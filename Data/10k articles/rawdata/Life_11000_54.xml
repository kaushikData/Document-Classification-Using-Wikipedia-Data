      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7761">In 2015, Swedish diving group Ocean X Team found the wreck of what initially appeared to be a foreign [[Midget submarine|mini-submarine]] off the east coast of Sweden.

The [[Swedish Armed Forces|Swedish armed forces]] subsequently issued a statement that it was "most likely" a [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian]] {{sclass-|Som|submarine}} that went down with all hands in 1916.

== Find ==
On 27{{nbsp}}July 2015, it was reported that a foreign mini-submarine, {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, had been located the previous week by Swedish diving group Ocean X Team, led by Dennis Åberg.&lt;ref name=svt /&gt; The submarine was found {{convert|2.75|km|nmi mi|abbr=on}} offshore on the east coast of central Sweden.&lt;ref name="Expressen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stjernberg|first1=Max Sohl|title=Främmande ubåt hittad i svenskt vatten|trans-title=Foreign submarine found in Swedish waters|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/frammande-ubat-hittad-i-svenskt-vatten/|publisher=[[Expressen]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group had received coordinates for where to search from Icelandic company Ixplorer.&lt;ref name=svt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hägg|first1=Marie|last2=Sjöqvist|first2=Hanna Aler|title=Okänd ubåt hittad i svenskt vatten|trans-title=Unknown submarine found in Swedish waters|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/okand-ubat-hittad-i-svenskt-vatten|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=27 July 2015|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the divers who found the submarine, it was a modern model and it appeared to be intact, suggesting that the remains of the crew may still be on board. The hull was marked with [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic letters]].&lt;ref name=afton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Habul|first1=Kenan|last2=Hagberg|first2=Sebastian|title=Främmande ubåt hittad i svenskt vatten|trans-title=Foreign submarine found in Swedish waters|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21177742.ab|website=www.aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=27 July 2015|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures from the wreck showed that the yellow&lt;ref name=svd1916 /&gt; submarine was standing on the sea bottom with its tower pointing straight up.&lt;ref name=ny /&gt; The diving group informed the Swedish armed forces on Monday 27{{nbsp}}July 2015, and video material from the wreckage was handed over for analysis.&lt;ref name=gp&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenken|first1=Victor|title=Främmande ubåt hittad i Östersjön|trans-title=Foreign submarine found in the Baltic Sea|url=https://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/1.2786965-frammande-ubat-hittad-i-ostersjon|website=www.gp.se|publisher=[[Göteborgs-Posten]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hull of the wreck features the "hard sign" [[Ъ]] in a final position. Since this usage was discontinued during the [[Reforms of Russian orthography|1917 orthographic reform]], it indicated that the ship predated the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=peterkz_swe |author=Peter Krantz |number=625778350485803008 |date = 27 July 2015 |title=Verkar vara ubåten Сом/Catfish från 1905.Observera texten i fören.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: while citing tweets are discouraged, this tweet was itself cited by Expressen --&gt;&lt;ref name="Expressen"/&gt;

On 28{{nbsp}}July 2015, a statement was released by the Swedish armed forces public relations office that stated that analysis of the video footage and other evidence indicated that the wreck was "most likely" that of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] ''Som''-class submarine ''Som'' (''Сом'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubåt från 1916 funnen i svenska vatten|trans-title=Submarine from 1916 found in Swedish waters|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/aktuellt/2015/07/ubat-fran-1916-funnen-i-svenska-vatten/|website=www.forsvarsmakten.se|publisher=[[Swedish Armed Forces]]|accessdate=28 July 2015|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Som'' sank with all hands on active service in 1916 after a collision with the steamship ''Ångermanland'' in the [[Sea of Åland]], somewhere between [[Arholma]] and the [[Svartklubben]] lighthouse.&lt;ref name=confirm /&gt; According to several sources who previously worked with submarine analyses for the Swedish armed forces, the location of the submarine had been known for at least one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Svahn |first=Clas |date=27 July 2015 |title=Ubåtsfyndet sannolikt från 1916 |trans-title=Submarine discovery likely from 1916 |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/ubatsfyndet-sannolikt-fran-1916/||language=Swedish |newspaper=Dagens Nyheter |location=Stockholm |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015|7|28}}, the Swedish armed forces considered the wreck to be of historical or [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeological]] interest rather than military, and handed over the case to the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]]. The ministry consequently informed the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|Russian embassy]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=confirm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eriksson|first1=Gustaf|title=Bekräftat: Fyndet är den ryska Catfish-ubåten|trans-title=Confirmed: The find is the Russian Catfish submarine|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article21180697.ab|website=www.aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ocean X diving group is a privately owned [[Marine salvage|salvage operator]] not affiliated with the Swedish military. It previously found an American [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] in 1992,&lt;ref name=svd1916&gt;{{cite web|last1=Svensson|first1=Frida|last2=Lidholm|first2=Per|title=Ubåtsvraket kan vara från 1916|trans-title=The submarine wreck can be from 1916|url=http://www.svd.se/frammande-ubat-hittad-i-svenskt-vatten|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2,400 bottles of 1907 [[Heidsieck &amp; Co|champagne]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About X-team|url=http://www.oceanexplorer.se/about-x-team/|website=www.oceanexplorer.se|publisher=Ocean X team|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frederick|first1=Tim|title=Massive Unidentified Underwater Object Stumps Treasure Diving Crew: Crashed UFO or Elaborate Hoax?|url=http://www.itechpost.com/articles/2828/20120618/ufo-ocean-x-team-baltic-sea-jonkoping.htm|website=www.itechpost.com|publisher=iTech Post|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wreck was discovered by using an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] (remote operated vehicle) called V8 Sii from Ocean Modules in [[Åtvidaberg]]. The ROV was equipped with a grapple, a video camera and a Blueview sonar made by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]].&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Schultz|first1=Charlotta|title=Svenska tekniken som hittade ubåten|trans-title=Swedish technology found the submarine|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/article3920621.ece|website=www.nyteknik.se|publisher=[[Ny Teknik]]|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abiodun''' (reigned {{circa}} 1770–1789) was an 18th-century ''[[alaafin]],'' or ruler, of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] people in what is now [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=dHbrDvGQEbUC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Abiodun+Alaafin+Oyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAWoVChMIla_Nn-HpxgIVgaosCh36gQBt#v=onepage&amp;q=Abiodun%20Alaafin%20Oyo&amp;f=false|page=113|title=Hegemony and Culture: Politics and Change Among the Yoruba|author=David D. Laitin|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 1986|isbn=9780226467900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Abiodun|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=September 26, 2015|title=Abiodun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oyo Empire==
Coming to the throne shortly after the Oyo subjugation of neighboring [[Dahomey]], Abiodun soon found himself embroiled in a civil war over the goals of the newly wealthy state.&lt;ref name="Lipschutz1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark R. Lipschutz|title=Dictionary of African Historical Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYoPkk04Yp4C|page=2|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06611-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Bashorun [[Gaha]], the empire's prime minister and lord marshal, had used his power to pervert the constitutional terms of abdication in a bid to limit the powers of the ''Alaafin'' and gain more political power for himself. During Gaha's power play, he had succeeded in removing three kings before Abiodun curtailed his excesses and had him burned alive.

In terms of trade, while Abiodun favored economic expansion for its own sake, his opponents favored using the wealth from Dahomey's tribute to finance further military expansion. Abiodun soon proved victorious and pursued a policy of peaceful trade with the [[Europe]]an merchants of the coast. This course significantly weakened the army, leaving his successor, Awole, facing a number of local revolts.

==Descendants and legacy==
Abiodun's reign is generally remembered as a time of peace and prosperity for the Oyo, though Nigerian playwright [[Femi Òsófisan]] portrays him as a despot in his play ''The Chattering and the Song'' (1973). 

His son Alaafin Atiba was the founder of the ruling dynasty in the present Oyo. His grandson [[Cândido da Fonseca Galvão]], under the title of ''Dom Oba II'', was an important South American abolitionist during [[Pedro II of Brazil]]'s rule. His great grandson, [[ Mohammed Shitta Bey]], was an African merchant prince titled ''Seriki Musulumi of Lagos'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fol/brasil500/zumbi_32.htm|title=A black prince in the streets of Rio de Janeiro - Obá 2º, friend of Pedro 2º, attacked racism and defended equality|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other descendants include the 19th-century warrior [[Oluyole]], the historian [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]], his brother physician [[Obadiah Johnson]], [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], the first African Bishop of the CMS, as well as Nigerian [[founding father]] [[Herbert Macaulay]] and the Rev. Canon M. C. Adeyemi. A prominent contemporary descendant was Dr. [[Ameyo Adadevoh]].

== Impact ==
Balcoba was a veteran journalist who had covered the local crime and police beat since the 1990s. He was also known for being a reporter for the People’s Brigada and officer of the [[Manila Police District]] Press Corporation. He helped to bring justice for police who experienced brutality and helped to expose criminals.&lt;ref name=ifj /&gt; After the attack on Balcoba, it helped to get the public's attention on the problem at hand and take a stand to protect future journalist and reporters.&lt;ref name=inquirer1 /&gt;

== Reactions ==
Mayor Rodrigo Duterte spoke out at a press conference after the killing of Alex Balcoba and made certain comments such as, "Most of you are clean, but do not ever say all journalists are clean," he said. "Just because you are a journalist, you are not exempt from assassination if you are a son of a bitch." As well as, "... Most of those killed, to be frank, have done something. You won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong."&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-politics-journalists-idUSKCN0YN3TK|title=Philippines' Duterte denounced for defending killing of some journalists|date=June 2, 2017|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people were outraged by this. 

Reporter, Ryan Rosuaro spoke out against this and said, "It is appalling that President-elect Rodrigo Duterte should justify the murder of journalists in the country by playing the corruption card."&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;

Executive director of the Center for [[international law]], Romel Regalado Bagares, said, "Duterte's comments showed "a cynical attitude towards what is a serious concern to the international community" and could perpetuate impunity for the killers."&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;

International media monitor the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] made a statement that wrote, "President-Elect Rodrigo Duterte's shocking remarks apparently excusing [[extrajudicial killing]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s threaten to make the Philippines into a killing field for journalists, we strongly urge him to retract his comments and to signal that he intends to protect, not target the press."&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;

Then finally, the Foreign [[Correspondent]] Association of the Philippines showed concern by stating, "Duterte's statement is a chilling reminder that journalists in the Philippines continue to live under threat, decades after (the association) was founded to fight for press freedom at the height of Ferdinand Marcos's dictatorship."&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt;

Balcoba's wife spoke up a few days later and replied to the Mayor's comments and standing up for her husband by making a few comments such as, "Sir, I am appealing to you. If I have to kneel, I will, just do not let this case drag on. I hope that once you assume office, you will prioritize this case so that the media killings, if not all the crimes in the country, will stop. You know, I really hope you could help me. I am drawing my strength from you, so that one day, I can finally get justice. I also hope the death penalty will be reimposed so that the killers of my husband will be punished with it."&lt;ref name=inquirer4 /&gt;

Non-human '''animals in space''' originally served to test the survivability of [[spaceflight]], before [[human spaceflight]]s were attempted. Later, other non-human animals were flown to investigate various biological processes and the effects [[microgravity]] and space flight might have on them. [[Bioastronautics]] is an area of [[bioengineering]] research which spans the study and support of life in [[Outer space|space]]. To date, seven national space programs have flown animals into space: the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Argentina]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Japan]] and [[Iran]].

A wide variety of non-human animals have been launched into space, including [[monkey]]s, [[Dogs in space|dogs]], tortoises, and insects.  The [[United States]] launched flights containing [[monkeys in space|monkeys and primates]] primarily between 1948-1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. [[France]] launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]] launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996. During the 1950s and 1960s, the [[Soviet space program]] used [[Soviet space dogs|a number of dog]]s for [[sub-orbital]] and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital space flights]].&lt;ref name="AT-20171103"&gt;{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Eric |title=The first creature in space was a dog. She died miserably 60 years ago |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/sixty-years-ago-the-first-creature-went-into-space-a-stray-moscow-dog/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two tortoises and a variety of insects were the first inhabitants of Earth to circle the Moon, on the 1968 [[Zond 5]] mission.

==Background==
Animals had been used in aeronautic exploration since 1783 when the [[Montgolfier brothers]] sent a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft in a hot air balloon (the duck serving as the [[experimental control]]). The limited supply of captured German [[V-2]] rockets led to the U.S. use of high-altitude balloon launches carrying fruit flies, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, frogs, goldfish and monkeys to heights of up to {{convert|44000|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space. A chronology and annotated bibliography through the year 1960. |journal=US Naval School of Aviation Medicine |volume=ONR TR ACR-64 |issue=AD0272581 |year=1962 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9288 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These high-altitude balloon flights from 1947 to 1960 tested radiation exposure, physiological response, life support and recovery systems. The U.S. high-altitude manned balloon flights occurred in the same time frame, one of which also carried fruit flies.

==1940s==
The  first animals sent into space were [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] aboard a U.S.-launched [[V-2 rocket]] on 20 February 1947 from [[White Sands Missile Range]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Beischer1962 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postwarv2.com/usa/ws/uars/uars20.html UPPER AIR ROCKET SUMMARY V-2 NO. 20]. postwarv2.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/afspbio/part1.htm |title=The Beginnings of Research in Space Biology at the Air Force Missile Development Center, 1946–1952 |accessdate=31 January 2008 |work=History of Research in Space Biology and Biodynamics |publisher=[[NASA]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125044753/https://history.nasa.gov/afspbio/part1.htm| archivedate= 25 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/V2/v-2tab.htm |title=V-2 Firing Tables |accessdate=31 January 2008 |publisher=[[White Sands Missile Range]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125175018/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/FactSheets/V2/v-2tab.htm |archivedate = 25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached 68 miles (109&amp;nbsp;km) in 3 minutes and 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force 50-mile and the [[Karman line|international 100 km]] definitions of the boundary of space. The Blossom capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive. Other V-2 missions carried biological samples, including [[moss]].

Albert II, a [[rhesus monkey]], became the first [[monkeys in space|monkey in space]] on 14 June 1949, in a U.S.-launched V-2, after the failure of the original Albert's mission on ascent. Albert I reached only 30–39 miles (48–63&amp;nbsp;km) altitude; Albert II reached about 83 miles (134&amp;nbsp;km).  Albert II died on impact after a parachute failure. Numerous monkeys of several species were flown by the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s. Monkeys were implanted with sensors to measure vital signs, and many were under anesthesia during launch. The death rate among monkeys at this stage was very high: about two-thirds of all monkeys launched in the 1940s and 1950s died on missions or soon after landing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==1950s==
[[File:Animals In Rocket Flight.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:39|left|''Animals In Rocket Flight'', a 1953 US Air Force film]]
On 31 August 1950, the U.S. launched a [[mouse]] into space (137&amp;nbsp;km) aboard a V-2 (the Albert V flight, which, unlike the Albert I-IV flights, did not have a monkey), but the rocket disintegrated because the parachute system failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-animals-astronauts-in-space.php "Top 10 Animal Astronauts"]. ''Toptenz.net''.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. launched several other mice in the 1950s.

On 22 July 1951, the Soviet Union launched the [[R-1 (missile)|R-1]] IIIA-1 flight, carrying the [[dog]]s Tsygan ({{lang-ru|Цыган}}, "Gypsy") and Dezik ({{lang-ru|Дезик}}) into space, but not into orbit.&lt;ref name="Siddiqi, p.95"&gt;{{cite book|title=Challenge to Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945–1974|author=Asif. A. Siddiqi|year=2000|publisher=NASA|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4408pt1.pdf |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two dogs were the first living higher organisms successfully recovered from a spaceflight.&lt;ref name="Siddiqi, p.95"/&gt; Both [[Soviet space dogs|space dogs]] survived the flight, although one would die on a subsequent flight. The U.S. launched mice aboard spacecraft later that year; however, they failed to reach the altitude for true spaceflight.

On 3 November 1957, the second-ever orbiting spacecraft carried the first animal into orbit, the dog [[Laika]],&lt;ref name="AT-20171103" /&gt; launched aboard the Soviet [[Sputnik 2]] spacecraft (nicknamed 'Muttnik' in the West). Laika died during the flight, as was intended because the technology to return from orbit had not yet been developed.&lt;ref name="AT-20171103" /&gt; At least 10 other dogs were launched into orbit and [[Soviet space dogs|numerous others]] on sub-orbital flights before the historic date of 12 April 1961, when [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human in space.

On 13 December 1958, a [[Jupiter IRBM]], AM-13, was launched from [[Cape Canaveral]], Florida, with a [[United States Navy]]-trained South American [[squirrel monkey]] named [[Gordo (space monkey)|Gordo]] on board. The nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and Gordo was lost. [[Telemetry]] data sent back during the flight showed that the monkey survived the 10&amp;nbsp;[[g-force|g]] of launch, 8 minutes of weightlessness and 40&amp;nbsp;g of reentry at 10,000 miles per hour (16,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). The nose cone sank {{convert|1302|nmi|km}} downrange from Cape Canaveral and was not recovered.

[[Monkey]]s Able and [[Miss Baker|Baker]] became the first monkeys to survive spaceflight after their 1959 flight. On 28 May 1959, aboard [[Jupiter IRBM]] AM-18, were a 7-pound (3.18&amp;nbsp;kg) American-born [[rhesus monkey]], Able, from Independence, Kansas, and an 11-ounce (310-gram) [[squirrel monkey]] from Peru, Baker. The monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of 360 miles (579&amp;nbsp;km) and a distance of 1,700 miles (2,735&amp;nbsp;km) down the Atlantic Missile Range from Cape Canaveral, Florida. They withstood forces 38 times the normal pull of gravity and were weightless for about 9 minutes. A top speed of 10,000&amp;nbsp;mph (16,000&amp;nbsp;km/h) was reached during their 16-minute flight. The monkeys survived the flight in good condition. Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia, while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode. Baker was the center of media attention for the next several months as she was watched closely for any ill-effects from her space flight. She was even mated in an attempt to test her reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;"Space Monkey to be a Bride." ''New York Times'':6. 14 August 1959. ''ProQuest''Web. 22 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Baker lived until 29 November 1984, at the [[US Space and Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].

On 2 July 1959, a launch of a Soviet R2 rocket, which reached {{convert|212|km|mi|sp=us}}, carried two space dogs and Marfusa, the first rabbit to go into space.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962 /&gt;

A 19 September 1959 launch, Jupiter AM-23, carried 2 frogs along with 12 mice but the rocket was destroyed during launch.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962 /&gt;

==1960s==

On 19 August 1960 the Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 5]] (also known as Korabl-Sputnik 2) which carried the dogs [[Belka and Strelka]], along with a gray rabbit, 40 mice, 2 rats, and 15 flasks of fruit flies and plants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html A brief History of Animals in Space]. ''NASA''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first spacecraft to carry animals into orbit and return them alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetoday.org/Astronauts/Animals/Dogs.html Dogs], Space Online Today, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Strelka's pups, Pushinka, bred and born after her mission, was given as a present to [[Caroline Kennedy]] by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1961, and many descendants are known to exist.

The United States sent 3 black mice Sally, Amy and Moe 1,000&amp;nbsp;km up and 8,000&amp;nbsp;km distance from Cape Canaveral on 13 October 1960 using an Atlas D 71D launch vehicle.  The mice were retrieved from the nosecone near Ascension Island and were said to be in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1960 Chronology|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/1960.htm|accessdate=7 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926165622/http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/1960.htm|archivedate=26 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 1961, [[Ham the Chimp]] was launched in a [[Mercury program|Mercury]] capsule aboard a [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone rocket]]. Ham's mission was [[Mercury-Redstone 2]]. The chimpanzee had been trained to pull levers to receive rewards of banana pellets and avoid electric shocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch10-3.htm |title=MR-2: Ham Paves the Way |accessdate=31 January 2008 |last=Swenson Jr.|first=Loyd S. |author2=James M.

A little over 3 months later the United States sent [[Alan Shepard]] into space. [[Enos (chimpanzee)|Enos the chimp]] became the first chimpanzee in orbit on 29 November 1961, in another Mercury capsule, an [[Atlas rocket]], [[Mercury 5|Mercury-Atlas 5]].

On 9 March 1961 the Soviet Union launched the [[Korabl-Sputnik 4]] that carried a dog named [[Soviet space dogs#Chernushka|Chernushka]], some mice, [[frog]]s and, for the first time into space, a [[guinea pig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html |title=Animals in Space |accessdate=31 January 2008 |first=Tara |last=Gray |year=1998 |work= |publisher=[[NASA]] History Division| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128134352/https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html| archivedate= 28 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were successfully recovered.

France flew their first [[rat]] (Hector) into space on 22 February 1961. Two more rats were flown in October 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/country/france.htm|title=France|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323115358/http://www.astronautix.com/country/france.htm |archivedate=23 March 2010|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|date=1997–2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 1963, France launched [[Félicette]] the cat aboard Veronique AGI sounding rocket No. 47. The launch was directed by the French Centre d'Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique (CERMA). Félicette was recovered alive after a 15-minute flight and a descent by parachute. Félicette had electrodes implanted into her brain, and the recorded neural impulses were transmitted back to Earth. A second cat was sent to space by CERMA on 24 October 1963, but the flight ran into difficulties that prevented recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html |title=A Brief History of Animals in Space |accessdate=29 November 2013 |last=Grey |first=Tara |year=2008 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final French animal launches were of two monkeys in March 1967.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

During the [[Voskhod program]], two Soviet space dogs, Veterok (Ветерок, Little Wind) and Ugolyok (Уголёк, Blackie), were launched on 22 February 1966, on board [[Cosmos 110]] and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March. This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until [[Soyuz 11]] in 1971 and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The United States launched Biosatellite I in 1966 and Biosatellite I/II in 1967 with fruit flies, [[parasitic wasp]]s, [[flour beetle]]s and frog eggs, along with [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[amoebae]], plants and [[fungi]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubbs, Chris and [[Colin Burgess (author)|Burgess, Colin]] (2007) ''Animals In Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle''.

On 11 April 1967, Argentina also launched the rat Belisario, atop a Yarará rocket,&lt;ref name="Leon"&gt;{{cite book|author=de León, Pablo |title=Historia de la Actividad Espacial en la Argentina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X174Scm1qVkC|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-0-557-01782-9|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Cordoba military range, which was recovered successfully. This flight was followed by a series of subsequent flights using rats.&lt;ref&gt;Manfredi, Alberto N.

The first two [[tortoise]]s in space were launched on [[Zond 5]] on 14 September 1968 by the Soviet Union. The [[Horsfield's tortoise]]s were sent on a circumlunar voyage along with [[wine fly|wine flies]], [[meal worm]]s, and other biological specimens. These were the first animals in deep space and the first inhabitants of earth to travel around the moon. The capsule overshot its terrestrial landing site but was successfully recovered at sea on 21 September. The animals survived but suffered some weight loss.

On 28 June 1969, the United States launched the monkey Bonny, a macaque, on [[Biosatellite 3]] in what was intended to have been a 30-day orbit around the Earth, with the monkey being fed by food pellets from a dispenser that he had been trained to operate.  However, Bonny's health deteriorated rapidly and he was returned to Earth on July 7,&lt;ref&gt;[https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Mission/miss/56? "Biosatellite III", NASA Life Sciences Data Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; but died the next day after the Biosatellite capsule was recovered in the Pacific Ocean.  &lt;ref&gt; [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&amp;dat=19690708&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Astromonk Dies After Return"], ''Pittsburgh Press'', July 8, 1969, p1 &lt;/ref&gt;

In total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.

On 23 December 1969, as part of the 'Operación Navidad' (Operation Christmas), Argentina launched Juan (a [[Tufted capuchin|cai monkey]], native of Argentina's Misiones Province) using a [[Canopus 2|Canopus II]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/dossier/2009/diciembre/unc_dossier_de_prensa_19-12-2009.pdf|title=Córdoba|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160331/http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/dossier/2009/diciembre/unc_dossier_de_prensa_19-12-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015|publisher=unc.edu.ar|date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ascended 82 kilometers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoylauniversidad.unc.edu.ar/especiales/mono-juan "Juan, el primer astronauta argentino"]. ''unc.edu.ar''.&lt;/ref&gt; and then was recovered successfully. Later, on 1 February 1970 the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using a X-1 Panther rocket. It reached a higher altitude than its predecessor, but it was lost after the capsule's parachute failed.

==1970s==
[[Image:Arabella web aboard second Skylab mission (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|First [[Spider webs in space|spider web built in space]]]]
Two [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]]s were launched on a one-way mission on the [[Orbiting Frog Otolith satellite]] on 9 November 1970, to understand more about space motion sickness.

[[Apollo 16]] on 16 April 1972 carried [[nematode]]s, and [[Apollo 17]], launched on 7 December 1972 carried five [[Little pocket mouse|pocket mice]], although one died on the circumlunar trip. [[Skylab 3]] carried pocket mice and the first [[fish]] in space (a [[mummichog]]), and the first [[spider]]s in space ([[garden spider]]s named [[Spider webs in space|Arabella and Anita]]). Mummichog were also flown by the U.S. on the [[Apollo-Soyuz]] joint mission, launched 15 July 1975.

The Soviets flew several [[Bion program]] missions which consisted of satellites with biological cargoes. On these launches they flew tortoises, rats, and mummichog. On [[Soyuz 20]], launched 17 November 1975, tortoises set the duration record for an animal in space when they spent 90.5 days in space. [[Salyut 5]] on 22 June 1976, carried tortoises and a fish (a [[zebra danio]]).

==1980s==
The Soviet Union sent eight monkeys into space in the 1980s on Bion flights. In 1985, the U.S. sent two [[squirrel monkeys]] aboard [[STS-51B|Spacelab 3]] on the [[Space Shuttle]] with 24 male albino [[Rattus norvegicus|rats]] and [[stick insect]] eggs. Bion flights also flew zebra danio, fruit flies, rats, stick insect eggs and the first [[Iberian ribbed newt|newts]] in space.

[[Bion 7]] (1985) had 10 newts (''[[Pleurodeles waltl]]'') on board. The newts had part of their front limbs amputated, to study the rate of [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] in space, knowledge to understand human recovery from space injuries.

After an experiment was lost in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], [[chicken]] embryos (fertilized eggs) were sent into space in an experiment on [[STS-29]] in 1989. The experiment was designed for a student contest.

==1990s==
Four monkeys flew aboard the last Bion flights of the Soviet Union as well as frogs and fruit flies. The [[Foton program]] flights carried dormant [[brine shrimp]] (''[[Artemia franciscana]]''), newts, fruit flies, and sand desert beetles (''[[Trigonoscelis gigas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hernandorena, A.; Marco, R.; Reitz, G. and Facius, R.

[[Toyohiro Akiyama]], a Japanese journalist carried [[Japanese tree frog]]s with him during his trip to the ''[[Mir]]'' space station in December 1990. Other biological experiments aboard Mir involved [[quail]] eggs.

Japan launched its first animals, a species of newt, into space on 18 March 1995 aboard the [[Space Flyer Unit]].

During the 1990s the U.S. carried [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], mice, rats, frogs, newts, fruit flies, [[snail]]s, [[carp]], [[medaka]], [[oyster toadfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[swordtail fish]], [[gypsy moth]] eggs, stick insect eggs, [[brine shrimp]] (''[[Artemia salina]]''), quail eggs, and [[jellyfish]] aboard [[Space Shuttle]]s.

==2000s==
The [[STS-107|last flight of ''Columbia'' in 2003]] carried [[silkworm]]s, [[Eriophora|garden orb spiders]], [[carpenter bee]]s, [[harvester ant]]s, and [[Japanese killifish]] (medaka). [[Nematode]]s (''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'') from one experiment were found still alive in the debris after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irene |last=Brown |title=Shuttle worms found alive |url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Science/2003/04/30/shuttle_worms_found_alive/2166/ |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date=30 April 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524214850/http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2003/04/30/Shuttle-worms-found-alive/UPI-21661051746091/ |archivedate=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' are also part of experiments aboard the [[International Space Station]] as well as research using quail eggs.

Earlier shuttle missions included grade school, junior high and high school projects; some of these included [[ant]]s, stick insect eggs and brine shrimp cysts. Other science missions included gypsy moth eggs.

On 12 July 2006, [[Bigelow Aerospace]] launched their ''[[Genesis I]]'' inflatable space module, containing many small items such as toys and simple experiments chosen by company employees that would be observed via camera. These items included insects, perhaps making it the first private flight to launch animals into space. Included were [[Madagascar hissing cockroach]]es and [[Mexican jumping beans]] — seeds containing live larvae of the moth ''[[Cydia deshaisiana]]''.&lt;ref name="LVRJ1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/8246747.html |title=NLV firm launches Genesis II |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |first=John |last=Antczak |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=30 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207130414/http://www.lvrj.com/news/8246747.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 June 2007, Bigelow launched ''[[Genesis II]]'', a near-twin to ''Genesis I''.

In September 2007, during the [[ESA|European Space Agency]]'s [[FOTON-M3]] mission, [[tardigrade]]s, also known as water-bears, were able to survive 10 days of exposure to open-space with only their natural protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14690-water-bears-are-first-animal-to-survive-vacuum-of-space.html |title='Water Bears' are first animal to survive vacuum of space|work=newscientist.com|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910062613/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn14690-water-bears-are-first-animal-to-survive-vacuum-of-space.html| archivedate= 10 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080908135906.htm |title='Water Bears' Able To Survive Exposure To Vacuum Of Space|work=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080911091656/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080908135906.htm| archivedate= 11 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same mission, a number of cockroaches were carried inside a sealed container and at least one of the females conceived during the mission. After they were returned to earth, the one named [[Nadezhda (cockroach)|Nadezhda]] became the first earth creature to produce young that had been conceived in space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ria.ru/science/20071023/85202812.html "'Hope' the Russian cockroach gives birth to first space babies"]. ''ria.ru''. 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2009, during the countdown of the [[STS-119]], a [[free-tailed bat]] was seen clinging to the fuel tank. NASA observers believed the bat would fly off once the shuttle started to launch, but it did not. Upon analyzing the images, a wildlife expert who provided support to the center said it likely had a broken left wing and some problem with its right shoulder or wrist. The animal most likely perished quickly during Discovery's climb into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts119/launchbat.html "Bat Hung onto Shuttle During Liftoff"]. 19 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, [[STS-129]] took [[painted lady]] and [[monarch butterfly]] larvae into space for a school experiment as well as thousands of [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']] roundworms for long-term weight loss studies.

==2010s==
On 3 February 2010, on the 31st anniversary of its revolution, [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran]] became the latest country to launch animals into space. The animals (a mouse, two [[turtle]]s and some worms) were launched on top of the [[Safir (rocket)|Kavoshgar 3]] rocket and returned alive to Earth.&lt;ref name="Tehran Times "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=213671|title=Tehran Times|date=4 February 2010|work=Tehran Times Political Desk|publisher=Tehran Times|accessdate=5 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212225529/http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=213671|archivedate=12 February 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35213146/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/|title='Iran sends mouse, worms, turtles into space|work=MSNBC|accessdate=2 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206001136/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35213146/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/|archivedate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the last flight of ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' ([[STS-134]]) carried two [[golden orb spider]]s, named Gladys and Esmeralda, as well as a fruit fly colony as their food source in order to study the effects of microgravity on spiders' behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/space_spiders_live.html "Spiders in Space – Live!"].

In November 2011, the [[Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment]] on the [[Fobos-Grunt]] mission planned to carry [[tardigrades]] to Mars and back; however, the mission failed to leave Earth orbit.

In October 2012, 32 medaka fish were delivered to the International Space Station by [[Soyuz TMA-06M]] for the new Aquatic Habitat in the [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]].

On 28 January 2013, Iranian news agencies reported that Iran sent a monkey in a "[[Pishgam]]" rocket to a height of {{convert|72|mi|km}} and retrieved a "shipment". Later Iran's space research website uploaded an 18-minute video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ari.ac.ir/index.php/news/35-lastest-developments/572-1391-11-30-12-41-51.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023757/http://ari.ac.ir/index.php/news/35-lastest-developments/572-1391-11-30-12-41-51.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=Reliability Research Center |language=Persian |accessdate=2 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was uploaded later on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo-7QjxxcDg|title=Iran's Space Monkey Full High Quality Video|author=Mohammad Mohsenipur|date=18 February 2013|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the search strategies of [[pavement ant]]s were studied on the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/animals/insects/ants-hold-their-own-searching-in-space-150331.htm Ants Hold Their Own Searching in Space], Discovery News, March 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2015.00025/full Collective search by ants in microgravity], Stefanie M.

On 19 July 2014, Russia announced that they launched their Foton-M4 satellite into low earth orbit (575 kilometers) with 1 male and 4 female geckos (possibly [[gold dust day gecko]]s) as the payload. This was an effort to study the effects of microgravity on reproductive habits of reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/space/stories/russia-launches-geckos-and-other-critters-into-space | work= MotherNatureNetwork | title= Russia launches geckos and other critters into space| date= 22 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 2014, it was announced that Russia had lost control of the Foton-M4 satellite, leaving only two months to restore contact before the geckos' food supply was exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/russia-loses-contact-satellite-geckos | work= TheGuardian| title= Russia loses contact with satellite full of geckos | date= 24 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Control of the satellite was subsequently restored on 28 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.space.com/26661-russia-space-gecko-capsule-contact-restored.html | work= Space.com | title= Russia Restores Contact with Gecko-Filled Space Capsule | date= 28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2014 Russia confirmed the death of all five geckos, stating that their mummified bodies seem to indicate they froze to death.

On 14 April 2015, the [[SpaceX CRS-6]] delivered 20 [[C57BL/6|C57BL/6NTAC]] mice to live on the ISS for evaluating microgravity as the extreme opposite of a healthy active lifestyle. In the absence of gravity, astronauts are subject to a decrease in muscle, bone, and tendon mass. "Although, we’re not out to treat couch potatoes," states head Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research (NIBR) scientist on the project Dr. Sam Cadena, "we’re hoping that these experiments will help us to better understand muscle loss in populations where physical activity in any form is not an option; e.g., in the frail elderly or those subjected to bed rest or immobilization due to surgery or chronic disease." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixth Commercial Resupply Services Flight to the International Space Station|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/SpaceX_CRS-6_Mission_Overview.pdf|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2016, Rodent Research 3 delivered 20 mice on [[SpaceX CRS-8]]. The experiment sponsored by Eli Lilly and Co. was a study of myostatin inhibition for the prevention of skeletal and muscle atrophy and weakness. Mice are known to suffer from rapid loss of muscle and bone mass after as little as 12 days of space flight exposure. The mice were euthanized and dissected on the station and then frozen for eventual return to Earth for further study. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon SpX-8 Cargo Overview|url=http://spaceflight101.com/dragon-spx8/cargo-overview/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2018, a [[SpaceX Dragon]] spaceship blasted off from Florida carrying 20 mice. The rodent crew arrived at the [[international Space Station|ISS]] on 2 July 2018. Their record-breaking journey — this was the longest mice have been off the planet — was part of a study on how Earth-dwellers' guts and sleep schedules responded to the stress of being in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA just launched 20 mice into space on a SpaceX rocket while their identical twins stay on Earth — here's what they hope to learn|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-launches-mice-to-space-station-for-twin-study-2018-6|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Reproductive technology}}
'''Artificial reproduction/propagation''' is the creation of new life by other than the natural means available to an [[organism]]. Examples include [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization]], [[cloning]] and embryonic splitting, or [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]].

Cutting plants' stems and placing them in [[compost]] is also a form of artificial reproduction.
We can grow many plants from one plant by using the man-made methods. The process of growing many plants from one plant by man-made methods is called artificial propagation of plants. A number of methods of artificial propagation of plants are used in agriculture (for raising crops), and horticulture (cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers). The three common methods for the artificial propagation of plants are:
# Cuttings,
# Layering, and
# Grafting.

We will now describe all these methods, one by one. Let us start with the cuttings method for the artificial propagation of plants.

== Layering ==
In this method, a branch of the plant is pulled towards the ground and a part of it is covered with moist soil leaving the tip of the branch exposed above the ground. After some time, new roots develop from the part of the branch buried in the soil. The branch is then cut off from the parent plant. The part of the branch which has developed roots grows to become a new plant (just like the parent plant). Jasmine plant (chameli) is propagated or produced by the layering method.

We can see from that one left side branch and one right side branch of the parent jasmine plant have been buried in moist soil. The parts of branches which are buried in soil grow their own roots. When this happens, the branches of the parent plant connecting the newly formed plants are cut off so that the newly formed plants may grow on their own and develop into mature plants (like the parent plant).

Many plants like strawberry and raspberry are propagated by the natural layering method. The natural layering occurs because these plants form runners (which are soft horizontal stems running above the ground). Wherever the ends of such runners touch the ground, new plants are formed at those places. In this way, many more strawberry or raspberry plants are formed from" the parent plant in a natural way.

The layering method is used for the propagation (or reproduction) of plants like : Jasmine, Strawberry, Raspberry, Lemon, Guava, Hibiscus (China rose), Bougainvillea and many slender ornamental plants.Example: Nerium

== Grafting ==
Grafting is a method in which the cut stems of two different plants   are joined together in such a way that the two stems join and grow as a single plant. This new plant will have the 
characteristics of both the original plants.


The cutted stem of a plant  having roots and fixed in the soil is called ''stock''. Stock is the lower part of a plant having the roots.The cutted stem of another plant without  is called 'scion'. Scion is the upper part of a plant which may have leaves on it .

In carrying out grafting, two plants  are chosen which are to be used as scion and stock. First, the stem (or branch) is removed from the plant chosen to be made scion (for its desirable characteristics) by making a slanting cut. This gives us the scion with a slanting cut. The stem of second plant (or tree) to be used in grafting is also cut in a slanting way. The lower part of this plant (or tree) is stock. It has also a slanting cut.

The scion is placed over the stock. The cut surfaces of the scion and stock are fitted together and bound tightly with a piece of cloth and covered properly with polythene sheet (so as to prevent harmful infection by bacteria or fungus, and loss of water and plant sap from the cut and joined ends of stock and scion).

While joining the scion to the stock, care should be taken to make sure that the cambium layer of scion is in contact with the cambium layer of stock (because the cambium layer in the stem is responsible for growth).

The cut soon heals and the stock and scion of two plants grow together and become one plant. The scion continues to produce its original leaves, flowers and fruits but it gets water and minerals for making food from the chosen stock. So, the fruits will have the characteristics of both the plants (from which scion and stock have come).

Grafting is used to breed fruit trees and flowering bushes. Apple, peach, apricot and pear trees are often grafted. We will now describe some of the advantages of the grafting method of artificial propagation.
# Grafting enables us to combine the most desirable characteristics of the two plants (scion and stock) in its flowers and fruits.
# By grafting method, a very young scion (shoot part of a plant) .can be made to flower and produce fruits quite fast when it is grafted to the stock (stem having roots) of a mature plant.
# It enables us to obtain flowers and fruits having . Many varieties of mango have been produced by grafting method.
 Grafting can be used to produce varieties of seedless fruits. Some examples of such plants which are reproduced by artificial vegetative propagation methods are: Banana, Pineapple, Orange, Grape, Rose etc.

'''Bachem''' is a  contract manufacturing organization headquartered in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Bachem Holding AG|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=760034|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachem specializes in the manufacturing of [[peptides]] and complex organic molecules such as [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]].  In addition, biochemicals for research purposes and manufacturing processes are developed.  The firm provides a number of products and services to the pharmaceutical and [[biology|life science]] industries, including [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[fine chemicals|fine]] and performance chemicals, custom manufacturing of [[biopharmaceutical]]s, [[chemical synthesis]] capabilities and new chemical entities, and services for the [[bioscience]] sector.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt;

==History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bachem - History|url=http://www.bachem.com/company/history/|publisher=Bachem}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
In 1971, Peter Grogg founded Bachem Feinchemikalien AG with two employees in Liestal near Basel with the focus on peptide synthesis.  In 1977, Bachem moved with eight employees to nearby Bubendorf, and, in 1978, it manufactured, for the first time, peptides for use in medicine under cGMP guidelines.  Between 1981 and 1991 Bachem tripled its production capacity and built an administration building, and in 1995, facilities were further expanded including the quality control department to a total of 168'000 sq. ft. (15'600 m2).

Expansion into markets outside Europe began with the establishment of Bachem Bioscience, Inc. in Philadelphia, USA in 1987.  To strengthen its presence in Europe, Bachem opened sales and marketing centers in Germany in 1988 and in France in 1993.  In 1996 it acquired its largest competitor, Bachem, Inc., together with its subsidiaries in Germany and the United Kingdom. In June 1998, following a very successful IPO, Bachem's shares began to be publicly traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange.  In 1999 and 2000, a new administration building and a further production facility were respectively opened at the Bubendorf site.

With the acquisition of the San Carlos, California based Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. and its affiliate Peninsula Laboratories Ltd., United Kingdom in December 1999, Bachem extended its strong position in therapeutically active peptides into immunology, a domain with strong future promise.  In August 2000, Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. and Bachem (UK) Ltd. merged to a single Bachem group affiliated company in the United Kingdom.
The acquisition of Sochinaz SA, a Swiss-based specialized manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2001, strengthened Bachem's expertise and once again expanded its manufacturing capabilities.

Reorganization of distribution was carried out in Germany and France as a result of the positive experiences gained with the realignment of the sales and marketing organization in the USA.  As a result the subsidiary in France was closed at the end of 2002.  The subsidiary in Germany was relocated from Heidelberg to Weil am Rhein, was renamed Bachem Distribution Services GmbH and is now responsible for all customers in the European Union.
In 2003, a holding structure was introduced to align the factual organization of the company with an appropriate legal structure and to support management structure adjustments, given by continued company growth requirements.  In 2007, Bachem acquired the Clinalfa® brand for Bachem's ready-to-use clinical trial materials and related services.  In 2010, Bachem commenced the partnership with Atheris laboratories offering the Melusine® range of research products for lead generation of new pharmaceutical candidates.  In 2011, Bachem celebrated its 40th year as a producer of research ingredients and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for the pharmaceutical industry.

In 2013, Bachem and GlyTech Inc. teamed up to offer [[glycosylated]] peptides in their product pipelines. Bachem and affiliate were conducting groundbreaking work on [[interferon beta-1a]] and to manufacture glycosylated [[somatostatin]] analogues by chemical synthesis.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.glytech.jp/en/ Glytech Inc. News &amp; Topics]. Retrieved 19 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015, Bachem acquired American Peptide Company, a mid-sized biotech establishment in [[Sunnyvale]] CA, not far from Bachem's US facility in Torrance, expanding the firm's GMP manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities for the US and international markets.&lt;ref&gt; R.Mullin (2015).

{{Bayesian statistics}}{{Probability fundamentals}}
'''Bayesian programming''' is a formalism and a methodology for having a technique to specify [[Probability distribution|probabilistic models]] and solve problems when less than the necessary information is available. [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes’ Theorem]] is the central concept behind this programming approach, which states that the probability of something occurring in the future can be inferred by past conditions related to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/bayesian-programming|title=Bayesian versus Frequentist Probability|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Edwin T. Jaynes]] proposed that probability could be considered as an alternative and an extension of logic for rational reasoning with incomplete and uncertain information. In his founding book ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science''&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. T. |last=Jaynes|title=Probability Theory: The Logic of Science|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=UjsgAwAAQBAJ}}|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43516-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; he developed this theory and proposed what he called “the robot,” which was not
a physical device, but an inference engine to automate probabilistic reasoning—a kind of [[Prolog]] for probability instead of logic. Bayesian programming&lt;ref name="BessiereMazer2013"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Pierre |last1=Bessiere|first2=Emmanuel |last2=Mazer|first3=Juan |last3=Manuel Ahuactzin|first4=Kamel |last4=Mekhnacha|title=Bayesian Programming|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4XtcAgAAQBAJ}}|date=20 December 2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-8032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a formal and concrete implementation of this "robot".

Bayesian programming may also be seen as an algebraic formalism to specify [[graphical model]]s such as, for instance, [[Bayesian network]]s, [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s, [[Kalman filter]]s or [[hidden Markov model]]s. Indeed, Bayesian Programming is more general than [[Bayesian network]]s and has a power of expression equivalent to probabilistic [[factor graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcf.usc.edu/~rosenblo/Pubs/agi15_demski.pdf|title=Expression Graphs: Unifying Factor Graphs and Sum-Product Networks|last=|first=|date=|website=bcf.usc.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formalism ==

A Bayesian program is a means of specifying a family of probability distributions.

The constituent elements of a Bayesian program are presented below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-097-prediction-machine-learning-and-statistics-spring-2012/lecture-notes/MIT15_097S12_lec15.pdf|title=Probabilistic Modeling and Bayesian Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=ocw.mit.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\text{Program}
\begin{cases}
\text{Description}
   \begin{cases}
   \text{Specification} (\pi)
       \begin{cases}
       \text{Variables}\\
       \text{Decomposition}\\
       \text{Forms}\\
       \end{cases}\\
   \text{Identification (based on }\delta)
   \end{cases}\\
\text{Question}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

# A program is constructed from a description and a question.
# A description is constructed using some specification (&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;) as given by the programmer and an identification or learning process for the parameters not completely specified by the specification, using a data set (&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;).
# A specification is constructed from a set of pertinent variables, a decomposition and a set of forms.
# Forms are either parametric forms or questions to other Bayesian programs.
# A question specifies which probability distribution has to be computed.

=== Description ===

The purpose of a description is to specify an effective method of computing a [[joint probability distribution]]
on a set of [[Random variable|variables]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; given a set of experimental data &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and some
specification &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Joint probability distribution|joint distribution]] is denoted as: &lt;math&gt;P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~cs134/K_F_Ch3.pdf|title=Bayesian Networks|last=|first=|date=|website=cs.brandeis.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To specify preliminary knowledge &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, the programmer must undertake the following:

# Define the set of relevant [[Random variable|variables]] &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; on which the joint distribution is defined.
# Decompose the joint distribution (break it into relevant [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] or [[Conditional probability|conditional probabilities]]).
# Define the forms of each of the distributions (e.g., for each variable, one of the [[list of probability distributions]]).

==== Decomposition ====

Given a partition of &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; subsets, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; variables are defined
&lt;math&gt;L_{1},\cdots,L_{K}&lt;/math&gt;, each corresponding to one of these subsets.
Each variable &lt;math&gt;L_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as the conjunction of the variables &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{k_{1}},X_{k_{2}},\cdots\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
belonging to the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; subset. Recursive application of [[Bayes' theorem]] leads to:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(L_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{K}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(L_{1}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(L_{2}\mid L_{1}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right) \times\cdots\times P\left(L_{K}\mid L_{K-1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{1}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Conditional independance|Conditional independence]] hypotheses then allow further simplifications. A conditional
independence hypothesis for variable &lt;math&gt;L_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by choosing some variable &lt;math&gt;X_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
among the variables appearing in the conjunction &lt;math&gt;L_{k-1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{2}\wedge L_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, labelling &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt; as the
conjunction of these chosen variables and setting:

: &lt;math&gt;
P \left(L_{k}\mid L_{k-1}\wedge\cdots\wedge L_{1}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right ) = P\left( L_{k} \mid R_{k}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

We then obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(L_{1}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(L_{2}\mid R_{2}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\times\cdots\times P\left(L_{K}\mid R_{K}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Such a simplification of the joint distribution as a product of simpler distributions is
called a decomposition, derived using the [[Chain rule (probability)|chain rule]].

This ensures that each variable appears at the most once on the left of a conditioning
bar, which is the necessary and sufficient condition to write mathematically valid
decompositions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==== Forms ====

Each distribution &lt;math&gt;P\left(L_{k}\mid R_{k}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the product is then associated
with either a parametric form (i.e., a function &lt;math&gt;f_{\mu}\left(L_{k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;) or a question to another Bayesian program &lt;math&gt;P\left(L_{k}\mid R_{k} \wedge \delta \wedge \pi \right) = P\left(L\mid R\wedge\widehat{\delta}\wedge\widehat{\pi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

When it is a form &lt;math&gt;f_{\mu}\left(L_{k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, in general, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of parameters that may depend on &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; or both. Learning
takes place when some of these parameters are computed using the data set &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

An important feature of Bayesian Programming is this capacity to use questions to other Bayesian programs as components of the definition of a new Bayesian program. &lt;math&gt;P\left(L_{k}\mid R_{k}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by some inferences done by another Bayesian program defined by the specifications &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; and the data &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;. This is similar to calling a subroutine in classical programming and provides an easy way to build [[Bayesian network#Hierarchical models|hierarchical models]].

=== Question ===

Given a description (i.e., &lt;math&gt;P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;), a question is obtained by partitioning &lt;math&gt;\left\{ X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
into three sets: the searched variables, the known variables and
the free variables.

The 3 variables &lt;math&gt;Searched&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Known&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Free&lt;/math&gt; are defined as the
conjunction of the variables belonging to
these sets.

A question is defined as the set
of distributions:

: &lt;math&gt;
P\left(Searched\mid \text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

made of many "instantiated questions" as the cardinal of &lt;math&gt;Known&lt;/math&gt;,
each instantiated question being the distribution:

: &lt;math&gt;
P\left(\text{Searched}\mid\text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inference ===

Given the joint distribution &lt;math&gt;P\left(X_{1}\wedge X_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge
X_{N}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;, it is always possible to compute any possible question using the following general inference:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(\text{Searched}\mid\text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
={} &amp; \sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left( \text{Searched} \wedge \text{Free} \mid \text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]\\
={} &amp; \frac{\displaystyle \sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left(\text{Searched}\wedge \text{Free}\wedge \text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]}{\displaystyle P\left(\text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)}\\
={} &amp; \frac{\displaystyle \sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left(\text{Searched}\wedge \text{Free}\wedge \text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]}{\displaystyle \sum_{\text{Free}\wedge \text{Searched}} \left[P\left(\text{Searched} \wedge \text{Free} \wedge \text{Known}\mid\delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]}\\
={} &amp; \frac{1}{Z}\times\sum_\text{Free}\left[P\left(\text{Searched}\wedge \text{Free} \wedge \text{Known} \mid \delta\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the first equality results from the marginalization rule, the second
results from [[Bayes' theorem]] and the third corresponds to a second application of marginalization. The denominator appears to be a normalization term and can be replaced by a constant &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Theoretically, this allows to solve any Bayesian inference problem. In practice,
however, the cost of computing exhaustively and exactly &lt;math&gt;P\left(\text{Searched} \mid \text{Known} \wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; is too great in almost all cases.

Replacing the joint distribution by its decomposition we get:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(\text{Searched}\mid \text{Known}\wedge\delta\wedge\pi\right)\\
= {}&amp; \frac{1}{Z} \sum_\text{Free} \left[\prod_{k=1}^K \left[ P\left( L_{i}\mid K_{i} \wedge \pi \right)\right]\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is usually a much simpler expression to compute, as the dimensionality of the problem is considerably reduced by the decomposition into a product of lower dimension distributions.

== Example ==

===Bayesian spam detection===

The purpose of [[Bayesian spam filtering]] is to eliminate junk e-mails.

The problem is very easy to formulate. E-mails should be classified
into one of two categories: non-spam or spam. The only available information to classify the e-mails is their content: a set of words. Using these words without taking the order into account is commonly called a [[Bag of words|bag of words model]].

The classifier should furthermore be able to adapt to its user and to learn
from experience. Starting from an initial standard setting, the classifier should
modify its internal parameters when the user disagrees with its own decision.
It will hence adapt to the user’s criteria to differentiate between non-spam and
spam. It will improve its results as it encounters increasingly classified e-mails.

==== Variables ====

The variables necessary to write this program are as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;Spam&lt;/math&gt;: a binary variable, false if the e-mail is not spam and true otherwise.
# &lt;math&gt;W_0,W_1, \ldots, W_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; binary variables. &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt; is true if the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word of the dictionary is present in the text.

These &lt;math&gt;N + 1&lt;/math&gt; binary variables sum up all the information
about an e-mail.

==== Decomposition ====

Starting from the joint distribution and applying recursively [[Bayes' theorem]] we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P(\text{Spam}\wedge W_{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge W_{N-1})\\
={} &amp; P(\text{Spam})\times P(W_0 \mid \text{Spam})\times P(W_1 \mid \text{Spam} \wedge W_0)\\
 &amp; \times\cdots\\
 &amp; \times P\left(W_{N-1}\mid\text{Spam}\wedge W_{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge W_{N-2}\right)\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is an exact mathematical expression.

It can be drastically simplified by assuming that the probability of appearance of a word knowing the nature of the text (spam or not) is independent of the appearance of the other words. This is the [[naive Bayes]] assumption and this makes this spam filter a [[naive Bayes]] model.

For instance, the programmer can assume that:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(W_1\mid\text{Spam} \land W_0) = P(W_1\mid\text{Spam})
&lt;/math&gt;

to finally obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(\text{Spam} \land W_0 \land \ldots
      \land W_{N-1}) = P(\text{Spam})\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}[P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})]
&lt;/math&gt;

This kind of assumption is known as the [[Naive Bayes classifier|naive Bayes' assumption]]. It  is "naive" in the sense that the independence between words is clearly not completely true. For instance, it completely neglects that the appearance of pairs of words may be more significant than isolated appearances. However, the programmer may assume this hypothesis and may develop the model and the associated inferences to test how reliable and efficient it is.

==== Parametric forms ====

To be able to compute the joint distribution, the programmer must now specify the
&lt;math&gt;N + 1&lt;/math&gt; distributions appearing in the decomposition:

# &lt;math&gt;P(\text{Spam})&lt;/math&gt; is a prior defined, for instance, by &lt;math&gt;P([\text{Spam}=1]) = 0.75 &lt;/math&gt;
# Each of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  forms &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})&lt;/math&gt; may be specified using [[Laplace rule of succession]] (this is a pseudocounts-based [[N-gram#Smoothing techniques|smoothing technique]] to counter the [[PPM compression algorithm|zero-frequency problem]] of words never-seen-before):
## &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{false}])=\frac{1+a^n_f}{2+a_f}&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{true}])=\frac{1+a^n_t}{2+a_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a^n_f&lt;/math&gt; stands for the number of appearances of the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in non-spam e-mails and &lt;math&gt;a_f&lt;/math&gt; stands for the total number of non-spam e-mails. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;a_t^n&lt;/math&gt; stands for the number of appearances of the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in spam e-mails and &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; stands for the total number of spam e-mails.

==== Identification ====

The &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  forms &lt;math&gt;P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})&lt;/math&gt; are not yet completely specified because the &lt;math&gt;2N + 2&lt;/math&gt; parameters &lt;math&gt;a_f^{n=0, \ldots, N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_t^{n=0, \ldots, N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_t&lt;/math&gt; have no values yet.

The identification of these parameters could be done either by batch processing a series of classified e-mails or by an incremental updating of the parameters using the user's classifications of the e-mails as they arrive.

Both methods could be combined: the system could start with initial standard values of these parameters issued from a generic database, then some incremental learning customizes the classifier to each individual user.

==== Question ====

The question asked to the program is: "what is the probability for a given text to be spam knowing which words appear and don't appear in this text?"
It can be formalized by:

: &lt;math&gt;P (\text{Spam}\mid w_0 \wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1} )&lt;/math&gt;

which can be computed as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; P(\text{Spam}\mid w_{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1} )\\
={} &amp; \frac{\displaystyle P(\text{Spam}) \prod_{n=0}^{N-1} [ P(w_{n}\mid\text{Spam})]}{\displaystyle \sum_\text{Spam} [P(\text{Spam}) \prod_{n=0}^{N-1}  [P (w_{n}\mid\text{Spam})]]}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator appears to be a [[Normalizing constant|normalization constant]]. It is not necessary to compute it to decide if we are dealing with spam. For instance, an easy trick is to compute the ratio:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; \frac{P([\text{Spam}=\text{true}]\mid w_0\wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1})}{P([ \text{Spam} = \text{false} ]\mid w_0 \wedge\cdots\wedge w_{N-1})}\\
={} &amp; \frac{P([ \text{Spam}=\text{true} ] )}{P([ \text{Spam} =\text{false} ])}\times\prod_{n=0}^{N-1} \left[\frac{P(w_n\mid [\text{Spam}=\text{true}])}{P(w_n\mid [\text{Spam} = \text{false}])}\right] \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This computation is faster and easier because it requires only &lt;math&gt;2N&lt;/math&gt; products.

==== Bayesian program ====

The Bayesian spam filter program is completely defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Pr
\begin{cases}
  Ds
  \begin{cases}
    Sp (\pi)
    \begin{cases}
       Va: \text{Spam},W_0,W_1 \ldots W_{N-1} \\
       Dc:
        \begin{cases}
          P(\text{Spam} \land W_0 \land \ldots \land W_n \land \ldots \land W_{N-1})\\
         = P(\text{Spam})\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}P(W_n\mid\text{Spam})
       \end{cases}\\
       Fo:
       \begin{cases}
          P(\text{Spam}):
          \begin{cases}
             P([\text{Spam}=\text{false}])=0.25 \\
             P([\text{Spam}=\text{true}])=0.75
          \end{cases}\\
           P(W_n\mid\text{Spam}):
           \begin{cases}
               P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{false}])\\
               =\frac{1+a^n_f}{2+a_f} \\
               P(W_n\mid[\text{Spam}=\text{true}])\\
               =\frac{1+a^n_t}{2+a_t}
           \end{cases} \\
         \end{cases}\\
       \end{cases}\\
   \text{Identification (based on }\delta)
   \end{cases}\\
   Qu: P(\text{Spam}\mid w_0 \land \ldots \land w_n \land \ldots \land w_{N-1})
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Bayesian filter, Kalman filter and hidden Markov model===

Bayesian filters (often called [[Recursive Bayesian estimation]]) are generic probabilistic models for time evolving processes. Numerous models are particular instances of this generic approach, for instance: the [[Kalman filter]] or the [[Hidden Markov model]] (HMM).

==== Variables ====

* Variables &lt;math&gt;S^{0},\ldots,S^{T}&lt;/math&gt; are a time series of state variables considered to be on a time horizon ranging from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
* Variables &lt;math&gt;O^{0},\ldots,O^{T}&lt;/math&gt; are a time series of observation variables on the same horizon.

==== Decomposition ====

The decomposition is based:
* on &lt;math&gt;P(S^t \mid S^{t-1})&lt;/math&gt;, called the system model, transition model or dynamic model, which formalizes the transition from the state at time &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt; to the state at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;;
* on &lt;math&gt;P(O^t\mid S^t)&lt;/math&gt;, called the observation model, which expresses what can be observed at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; when the system is in state &lt;math&gt;S^t&lt;/math&gt;;
* on an initial state at time &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;P(S^0 \wedge O^0)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Parametrical forms ====

The parametrical forms are not constrained and different choices lead to different well-known models: see Kalman filters and Hidden Markov models just below.

==== Question ====

The typical question for such models is &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t+k}\mid O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;: what is the probability distribution for the state at time &lt;math&gt;t + k&lt;/math&gt; knowing the observations from instant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;?

The most common case is Bayesian filtering where &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;, which searches for the present state, knowing past observations.

However it is also possible &lt;math&gt;(k&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;, to extrapolate a future state from past observations, or to do smoothing &lt;math&gt;(k&lt;0)&lt;/math&gt;, to recover a past state from observations made either before or after that instant.

More complicated questions may also be asked as shown below in the HMM section.

Bayesian filters &lt;math&gt;(k=0)&lt;/math&gt; have a very interesting recursive property, which contributes greatly to their attractiveness. &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)&lt;/math&gt; may be computed simply from &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t 1}\mid O^0 \wedge \cdots \wedge O^{t-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ll}
 &amp; P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)\\
= &amp; P\left(O^{t}|S^{t}\right)\times\sum_{S^{t-1}}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\right)\times P\left(S^{t-1}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)\right]\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Another interesting point of view for this equation is to consider that there are two phases: a
prediction phase and an estimation phase:
* During the prediction phase, the state is predicted using the dynamic model and the estimation of the state at the previous moment:

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ll}
 &amp; P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)\\
= &amp; \sum_{S^{t-1}}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\right)\times P\left(S^{t-1}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)\right]\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
* During the estimation phase, the prediction is either confirmed or invalidated using the last observation:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; P\left(S^{t}\mid O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t}\right)\\
={} &amp; P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\right)\times P\left(S^{t}|O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{t-1}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Bayesian program ====

Pr\begin{cases}

Sp(\pi)\begin{cases}
Va:\\
S^{0},\cdots,S^{T},O^{0},\cdots,O^{T}\\
Dc:\\

= &amp; P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}\right)\times\prod_{t=1}^{T}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\right)\times P\left(O^{t}|S^{t}\right)\right]\end{cases}\\
Fo:\\

\left(k&gt;0\right)\equiv \text{Prediction} \\
\left(k&lt;0\right)\equiv \text{Smoothing} \end{array}\end{cases}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Kalman filter====

The very well-known [[Kalman filter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalman|first=R. E.|title=A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems|journal=Transactions of the ASME--Journal of Basic Engineering|year=1960|volume=82|pages=33–45|doi=10.1115/1.3662552}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a special case of Bayesian
filters.

They are defined by the following Bayesian program:

: &lt;math&gt;
Pr\begin{cases}
Ds\begin{cases}
Sp(\pi)\begin{cases}
Va:\\
S^{0},\cdots,S^{T},O^{0},\cdots,O^{T}\\
Dc:\\
\begin{cases}
 &amp; P\left(S^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}|\pi\right)\\
= &amp; \left[\begin{array}{c}
P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}|\pi\right)\\
\prod_{t=1}^{T}\left[P\left(S^{t}|S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(O^{t}|S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{array}\right]\end{cases}\\
Fo:\\
\begin{cases}
P\left(S^t \mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\equiv G\left(S^{t},A\bullet S^{t-1},Q\right)\\
P\left(O^t \mid S^t \wedge\pi\right)\equiv G\left(O^{t},H\bullet S^{t},R\right)\end{cases}\end{cases}\\
Id\end{cases}\\
Qu:\\
P\left(S^T \mid O^0 \wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\wedge\pi\right)\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Variables are continuous.
* The transition model &lt;math&gt;P(S^t \mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi)&lt;/math&gt; and the observation model &lt;math&gt;P(O^t \mid S^t \wedge\pi)&lt;/math&gt; are both specified using Gaussian laws with means that are linear functions of the conditioning variables.

With these hypotheses and by using the recursive formula, it is possible to solve
the inference problem analytically to answer the usual &lt;math&gt;P(S^T \mid O^0 \wedge\cdots\wedge O^T \wedge\pi)&lt;/math&gt; question.
This leads to an extremely efficient algorithm, which explains the popularity of Kalman filters and the number of their everyday applications.

When there are no obvious linear transition and observation models, it is still often
possible, using a first-order Taylor's expansion, to treat these models as locally linear.
This generalization is commonly called the [[extended Kalman filter]].

====Hidden Markov model====

[[Hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs) are another very popular specialization of Bayesian filters.

They are defined by the following Bayesian program:

: &lt;math&gt;
\Pr\begin{cases}
Ds\begin{cases}
Sp(\pi)\begin{cases}
Va:\\
S^{0},\ldots,S^{T},O^{0},\ldots,O^{T}\\
Dc:\\
\begin{cases}
 &amp; P\left(S^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\mid\pi\right)\\
= &amp; \left[\begin{array}{c}
P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}\mid\pi\right)\\
\prod_{t=1}^{T}\left[P\left(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\times P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{array}\right]\end{cases}\\
Fo:\\
\begin{cases}
P\left(S^{0}\wedge O^{0}\mid\pi\right)\equiv \text{Matrix}\\
P\left(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)\equiv \text{Matrix}\\
P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)\equiv \text{Matrix}\end{cases}\end{cases}\\
Id\end{cases}\\
Qu:\\
\max_{S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}}\left[P\left(S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}\mid S^{T}\wedge O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\wedge\pi\right)\right]\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
* Variables are treated as being discrete.
* The transition model &lt;math&gt;P\left(S^{t}\mid S^{t-1}\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the observation model &lt;math&gt;P\left(O^{t}\mid S^{t}\wedge\pi\right)&lt;/math&gt; are
both specified using probability matrices.
* The question most frequently asked of HMMs is:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\max_{S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}}\left[P\left(S^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge S^{T-1}\mid S^{T}\wedge O^{0}\wedge\cdots\wedge O^{T}\wedge\pi\right)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

What is the most probable series of states that leads to the present state, knowing the past observations?

This particular question may be answered with a specific and very efficient algorithm
called the [[Viterbi algorithm]].

The [[Baum–Welch algorithm]] has been developed
for HMMs.

=== Pattern recognition ===
Bayesian program learning has potential applications voice recognition and synthesis, image recognition and natural language processing. It employs the principles of ''compositionality'' (building abstract representations from parts), ''causality'' (building complexity from parts) and ''learning to learn'' (using previously recognized concepts to ease the creation of new concepts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New algorithm helps machines learn as quickly as humans|url = http://www.gizmag.com/artificial-intelligence-algorithm-learning/41448|website = www.gizmag.com|access-date = 2016-01-23|date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possibility theories ==

The comparison between probabilistic approaches (not only bayesian programming) and possibility theories continues to be debated.

Possibility theories like, for instance, [[fuzzy set]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=Lofti, A.|journal=Information and Control|year=1965|volume=8|issue=3|pages=338–353|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X|title=Fuzzy sets}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fuzzy logic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=Lofti, A.|journal=Synthese|year=1975|volume=30|issue=3–4|pages=407–428|doi=10.1007/BF00485052|title=Fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[possibility theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dubois|first=D.|author2=Prade, H.|title=Possibility Theory, Probability Theory and Multiple-Valued Logics: A Clarification|journal=Ann. Math. Artif. Intell.|year=2001|volume=32|issue=1–4|pages=35–66|doi=10.1023/A:1016740830286|url=ftp://ftp.irit.fr/IRIT/ADRIA/AMAI-Dub.Pra.revised.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are alternatives to probability to model uncertainty. They argue that probability is insufficient or inconvenient to model certain aspects of incomplete/uncertain knowledge.

The defense of probability is mainly based on [[Cox's theorem]], which starts from four postulates concerning rational reasoning in the presence of uncertainty. It demonstrates that the only mathematical framework that satisfies these postulates is probability theory. The argument is that any approach other than probability necessarily infringes one of these postulates and the value of that infringement.

== Probabilistic programming ==

The purpose of [[Probabilistic relational programming language|probabilistic programming]] is to unify the scope of classical programming languages with probabilistic modeling (especially [[bayesian network]]s) to deal with uncertainty while profiting from the programming languages' expressiveness to encode complexity.

Extended classical programming languages include logical languages as proposed in [[Abductive logic programming|Probabilistic Horn Abduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=D.|title=Probabilistic Horn abduction and Bayesian networks|journal=Artificial Intelligence|year=1993|volume=64|pages=81–129|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(93)90061-F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent Choice Logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=D.|title=The Independent Choice Logic for modelling multiple agents under uncertainty|journal=Artificial Intelligence|year=1997|volume=94|pages=7–56|doi=10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRISM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sato|first=T.|author2=Kameya, Y.|title=Parameter learning of logic programs for symbolic-statistical modeling|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|year=2001|volume=15|issue=2001|pages=391–454|url=http://www.jair.org/media/912/live-912-2013-jair.pdf|bibcode=2011arXiv1106.1797S|arxiv=1106.1797|doi=10.1613/jair.912}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ProbLog which proposes an extension of Prolog.

It can also be extensions of [[Functional programming|functional programming languages]] (essentially [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]) such as IBAL or CHURCH. The underlying programming languages can be object-oriented as in BLOG and FACTORIE or more standard ones as in CES and FIGARO.&lt;ref&gt;{{github|p2t2/figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Bayesian programming is different. Jaynes' precept of "probability as logic" argues that probability is an extension of and an alternative to logic above which a complete theory of rationality, computation and programming can be rebuilt.&lt;ref name="Jaynes2003"/&gt; Bayesian programming attempts to replace classical languages with a programming approach based on probability that considers [[Completeness (logic)|incompleteness]] and [[Uncertainty quantification|uncertainty]].

The precise comparison between the [[semantics]] and power of expression of Bayesian and probabilistic programming is an open question.

'''Momin Khan Biltoon''' ({{lang-ps|مومن خان بیلتون}}; {{lang-fa|مومن خان بيلتون}}) was an Afghan Pashtun singer from [[Kabul Province]], [[Afghanistan]]. He was born in [[Chakari, Afghanistan|Chakari]] village of [[Khaki Jabbar District]], [[Kabul Province|Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pashto/news/story/2009/01/090122_mm_s7-beltoon.shtml |title=BBCPashto.com &amp;#124; خبرونه &amp;#124; د موسيقي د هنر ځانگړې څيره ښاغلى بيلتون |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he spent most of his life in [[Logar Province]] of Afghanistan. Biltoon sang in both [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari language|Dari]] languages. His style of music reflects the [[Kharabat (Kabul)|Kharabat]] style of [[Kabul]]. Biltoon's father died before he was born, and his mother did so when he was young. He was raised by his sister in [[Logar Province]] of Afghanistan. Biltoon learned the [[rubab (instrument)|rubab]] and [[tanbur]] at a young age. He started singing at the age of 15. His first song was in both [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Pashto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=نام اداره |url=http://da.azadiradio.com/a/27353770.html |title=بیلتون هنرمند مشهور افغانستان به جاویدادنه گان پیوست |language=pr |publisher=Da.azadiradio.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/persian/archives/32044 |title=استاد بلتون هنرمند نام آشنای افغانستان چشم از جهان بست - خبرگزاری خامه پرس - فارسی &amp;#124; خبرهای داغ از افغانستان، منطقه و جهان |publisher=Khaama.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Black''' is the darkest color, the result of the absence or complete [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[visible spectrum|visible]] [[light]]. It is an achromatic color, literally a color  without [[hue]], like [[white]] and [[gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/achromatic+color|title=Definition of ''achromatic''|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used [[symbol]]ically or [[figurative language|figuratively]] to represent darkness, while [[white]] represents light.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

Black [[ink]] is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read. For the same reason, black text on a white screen  is the most common format used on computer screens.&lt;ref name="Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126"&gt;Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' (2009), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[color printing]] it is [[CMYK shade model|used along with]] the [[subtractive shade|subtractive]] [[primary shade|primaries]] [[cyan]], [[yellow]], and [[magenta]], in order to help produce the darkest colors.

Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly truth and ignorance, good and evil, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] versus [[Age of Enlightenment]].   Since the [[Middle Ages]], black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in [[neolithic]] cave paintings.  In the 14th century, it began to be worn by royalty, the clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pages=105–26}}

In the [[Roman Empire]], it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with [[death]], evil, witches and magic.  According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;105–27.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
The word ''black'' comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''blæc'' ("black, dark", ''also'', "ink"), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''blakkaz'' ("burned"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''bhleg-'' ("to burn, gleam, shine, flash"), from base *''bhel-'' ("to shine"), related to [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''blak'' ("ink"), [[Old High German]] ''blach'' ("black"), [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''blakkr'' ("dark"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''blaken'' ("to burn"), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''bläck'' ("ink"). More distant cognates include [[Latin]] ''flagrare'' ("to blaze, glow, burn"), and [[Ancient Greek]] ''phlegein'' ("to burn, scorch").

The Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity.  ''Kuanos''' could mean both dark blue and black.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans had two words for black:  ''ater'' was a flat, dull black, while ''niger'' was a brilliant, saturated black.  ''Ater'' has vanished from the vocabulary, but ''niger'' was the source of the country name ''Nigeria''&lt;ref&gt;"African nation, named for the river Niger, mentioned by that name 1520s (Leo Africanus), probably an alteration (by influence of Latin niger "black") of a local Tuareg name, egereou n-igereouen, from egereou "big river, sea" + n-igereouen, plural of that word. Translated in Arabic as nahr al-anhur "river of rivers." (Online Etymological Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;  the English word ''Negro'' and the word for "black" in most modern [[Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]]: ''noir''; [[Spanish language|Spanish and Portuguese]]: ''negro''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''nero'' ).

[[Old High German]] also had two words for black: ''swartz'' for dull black and ''blach'' for a luminous black.  These are parallelled in [[Middle English]] by the terms ''swart'' for dull black and ''blaek'' for luminous black. ''Swart'' still survives as the word ''swarthy'', while ''blaek'' became the modern English ''black''.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

In heraldry, the word used for the black color is [[sable (heraldry)|sable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|date=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0-906670-44-6|pages=294, 343}}&lt;/ref&gt; named for the black fur of the [[sable]], an animal.

==History and art==

===Prehistoric history===
Black was one of the first colors used in art.  The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and then made more vivid black pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of [[manganese oxide]].&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

===Ancient history===
For the ancient Egyptians, black had positive associations; being the color of fertility and the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of [[Anubis]], the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black [[jackal]], and offered protection against evil to the dead.

For the ancient Greeks, black was also the color of the underworld, separated from the world of the living by the river [[Acheron]], whose water was black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to [[Tartarus]], the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of [[Hades]], the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black [[ebony]] throne.

Black was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making [[black-figure pottery]] and later [[red figure pottery]], using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social hierarchy of [[ancient Rome]], purple was the color reserved for the Emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often turned out faded gray or brown.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In [[Latin]], the word for black, ''ater'' and to darken, ''atere'',  were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words "atrocious" and "atrocity".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', New York: World Publishing Company (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was also the Roman color of death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates began to wear a dark toga, called a ''toga pulla'', to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the ''hora nigra'', the black hour.&lt;ref name="Michel Pastoureau pg. 34"/&gt;

The German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, [[Nótt]], who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the [[raven]]. They believed that [[Odin]], the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassical history===
In the early Middle Ages, black was commonly associated with darkness and evil. In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the 12th and 13th centuries====
In fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by [[Benedictine]] monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the [[Cistercian]] monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, "of death and sin," while white represented "purity, innocence and all the virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The [[black knight]] in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;86–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black [[ink]], invented in China, was traditionally used in the Middle Ages for writing, for the simple reason that black was the darkest color and therefore provided the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, making it the easiest color to read.  It became even more important in the 15th century, with the invention of [[printing]].    A new kind of ink, printer's ink, was created out of [[soot]], [[turpentine]] and [[walnut oil]]. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white engravings and prints.  Because of its contrast and clarity, black ink on white paper continued to be the standard for printing books, newspapers and documents; and for the same reason black text on a white background is the most common format used on computer screens.&lt;ref name="Heller, Eva 2009 p. 126"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 14th and 15th centuries====
In the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly [[scarlet (cloth)|scarlet]] cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the [[sable]]. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the [[marten]] family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe.  It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.

In the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of [[sumptuary laws]] in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from [[Venice]] and the peacock blue fabrics from [[Florence]] were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau,  Noir – HIstoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by [[Louis I, Duke of Orleans]], younger brother of King [[Charles VI of France]]. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King [[Richard II]] (1377–1399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419–20, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]]. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of the Spanish Habsburgs, of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and of his son, [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527–1598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;121–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===

====In the 16th and 17th centuries====
While black was the color worn by the Catholic rulers of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. [[John Calvin]], [[Philip Melanchthon]] and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the Pope and his Cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet. Bright colors were banished and replaced by blacks, browns and grays; women and children were recommended to wear white.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;152–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Protestant Netherlands, [[Rembrandt]] used this sober new palette of blacks and browns to create portraits whose faces emerged from the shadows expressing the deepest human emotions. The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like [[Rubens]], went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new [[Baroque]] churches of the [[Counter-Reformation]] were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;150–51&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of [[witchcraft]].  People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a [[Black Mass]] or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their [[familiar spirit]]s, black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In medieval [[Flanders]], in a ceremony called ''Kattenstoet,'' black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of [[Ypres]] to ward off witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious [[Salem witch trials]] in New England in 1692–93, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a "black thing with a blue cap,"  and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/SALEM.HTM|title=The Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692|first=Prof.|last=Linder|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen women and men were hanged as witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/calef/calef.html |title=More Wonders Of The Invisible World |publisher=Salem.lib.virginia.edu |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 18th and 19th centuries====
In the 18th century, during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]], black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the [[French Revolution]], black again became the dominant color.

Black was the color of the [[industrial revolution]], largely fueled by [[coal]], and later by oil. Thanks to coal [[smoke]], the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned [[black carbon|black]].  By 1846 the industrial area of the West Midlands of England was "commonly called 'the [[Black Country]]'”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Upton|title=And so it came to pass...|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/lifestyle/came-pass-3920518|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=18 November 2011|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Dickens]] and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the engravings of French artist [[Gustave Doré]].

A different kind of black was an important part of the [[romantic movement]] in literature. Black was the color of [[Melancholia|melancholy]], the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotype of the romantic poet.

The invention of new, inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that good-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century gradually black became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America.

Black dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. [[James McNeil Whistler]] made the color the subject of his most famous painting, ''Arrangement in grey and black number one''  (1871), better known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.

Some 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: "Reject black," [[Paul Gauguin]] said, "and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gauguin, ''Oviri.  Écrits d'un sauvage''. Textes choisis (1892–1903). Editions D. Guerin, Paris, 1974, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Édouard Manet]] used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet's portrait of painter [[Berthe Morisot]] was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy;  he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect.&lt;ref&gt;Steffano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Matisse]] quoted the French impressionist [[Pissarro]] telling him, "Manet is stronger than us all – he made light with black."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Flam, ''Matisse on Art'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: "What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixture of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent van Gogh]] used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting.

In the late 19th century, black also became the color of [[anarchism]]. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====In the 20th and 21st centuries====
In the 20th century, black was the color of Italian and German [[fascism]].  (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

In art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], a member of the [[Suprematist]] movement, created the ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]'' in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, "The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality&amp;nbsp;... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was also appreciated by [[Henri Matisse]]. "When I didn't know what color to put down, I put down black," he said in 1945. "Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction&amp;nbsp;... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Flam (1995), ''Matisse on Art'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who didn't accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as [[Juliette Greco]], and by some members of the [[Beat Movement]] in New York and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the [[Hells Angels]] and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as ''[[The Wild One]]'', with [[Marlon Brando]]. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the [[punk subculture]] [[punk fashion]], and the [[goth subculture]]. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by [[Victorian era]] mourning dress.

In men's fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, [[John F. Kennedy]] was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and all his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.

Women's fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer [[Coco Chanel]], who published a drawing of a simple black dress in ''Vogue'' magazine. She famously said, "A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves."&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/&gt;  Other designers contributed to the trend of the [[little black dress]]. The Italian designer [[Gianni Versace]] said, "Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance," and French designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] said, "black is the liaison which connects art and fashion.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller pg 120"/&gt; One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and was worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The American [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of [[African Americans]]. It developed into the [[Black Power]] movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and popularized the slogan "[[Black is Beautiful]]".

In the 1990s, the [[Black Standard]] became the banner of several [[Islamic extremist]], [[jihadist]] groups. (See the section [[Black#Political movements|political movements]].)

==Science==

===Physics===
{{Main article|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}
In the [[visible spectrum]], black is the absorption of all colors.

Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no [[visible light]] reaches the eye. [[Pigment]]s or [[dye]]s that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye "look black". A black pigment can, however, result from a ''combination'' of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called "black".

This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the absorption of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also [[primary colors]].

In [[physics]], a [[black body]] is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the [[infrared]] as well.

In elementary science, far [[ultraviolet]] light is called "[[black light]]" because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to [[Phosphorescence|fluoresce]].

On January 16, 2008, researchers from [[Troy, New York]]'s [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] announced the creation of the then darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflected only 0.045 percent of light, was created from [[carbon nanotube]]s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/16/2139711.htm|title=Nanotubes yield the blackest black|date=January 16, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, the current darkest material known is claimed to be [[Vantablack]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 29 February 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones |first= Jonathan |title= Can an artist ever really own a colour? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2016/feb/29/anish-kapoor-vantablack-paint| date= 29 February 2016|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 5 November 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last= Lee |first= Linda |title= Gazing Into the Void: What You Can Do With Vantablack, the Darkest Material Ever Made |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/garden/what-you-can-do-with-vantablack-the-darkest-material-ever-made.html?_r=0| date= 5 November 2014|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |location=New York City| accessdate=29 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A material is said to be black if most incoming light is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] equally in the material. Light ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]) [[Interaction#Physics|interacts]] with the [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat (see [[Solar thermal collector]]).

Absorption of light is contrasted by [[Transmittance|transmission]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[Diffuse reflection|diffusion]], where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.

===Chemistry===

====Pigments====
The earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were [[charcoal]], [[red ocher]] and [[yellow ocher]]. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with [[resin]].&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon pg. 256"&gt;Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.
* '''Vine black''' was produced in Roman times by burning the cut branches of grapevines. It could also be produced by burning the remains of the crushed grapes, which were collected and dried in an oven. According to the historian [[Vitruvius]], the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded to the quality of the wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of [[indigo]].

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissance in his famous handbook for artists: "...there is a black which is made from the tendrils of vines. And these tendrils need to be burned. And when they have been burned, throw some water onto them and put them out and then mull them in the same way as the other black. And this is a lean and black pigment and is one of the perfect pigments that we use."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"&gt;Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cennini also noted that "There is [[peach black|another black]] which is made from burnt almond shells or peaches and this is a perfect, fine black."&lt;ref name="Lara Broecke 2015, p. 60"/&gt; Similar fine blacks were made by burning the pits of the [[peach]], [[cherry]] or [[apricot]]. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with [[gum arabic]] or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.

Different civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The [[Inuit]] of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of [[Pinniped|seals]] to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned [[coconut]]s to produce their pigment.
* [[Lamp black]] was used as a pigment for painting and frescoes. as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos.  The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance:  "... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers from the bottom of the pan. The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the bottom of the pan and gather, becoming thick.

* [[Ivory black]], also known as [[bone char]], was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil. The color is still made today, but ordinary animal bones are substituted for ivory.
* [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars black]] is a black pigment made of synthetic [[iron oxides]]. It is commonly used in water-colors and oil painting. It takes its name from [[Mars]], the god of war and patron of iron.

====Dyes====

Good-quality black [[dyes]] were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees;  usually the [[walnut]], [[chestnut]], or certain [[oak]] trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.

A much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the [[Oak apple]] or '''gall-nut'''.  The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the [[larva]] of certain kinds of [[gall wasp]] in the family Cynipidae.&lt;ref name=cranshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Cranshaw|first=Whitney|title=Garden Insects of North America|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-09560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dye was very expensive;  a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye.  The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from [[Poland]], eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa.  Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2008), ''Noir – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;112–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the [[logwood tree]], or [[Haematoxylum campechianum]], which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the [[legume]] family, [[Fabaceae]], that is native to southern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | ''Haematoxylum campechianum'' | 18172 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern nation of [[Belize]] grew from 17th century [[Kingdom of England|English]] logwood logging camps.

Since the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is [[Nigrosin]], a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of [[nitrobenzene]], [[aniline]] and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a [[copper]] or [[iron]] [[catalyst]]. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.&lt;ref&gt;Green F. J. (1990), ''The Sigma-Aldrich Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Indicators'', pp.&amp;nbsp;513–15. Milwaukee:&amp;nbsp;Aldrich. {{ISBN|0-941633-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inks====

The first known inks were made by the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as [[graphite]] ground with water and applied with an [[ink brush]]. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern [[inkstick]] have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the [[Warring States period]]. They were produced from [[soot]], usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with [[animal glue]]. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an [[inkstone]] with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an [[ink brush]]. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of [[Chinese brush painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=二、墨的發展史|first=玫芬|last=蔡|publisher=National Chang-Hua Hall of Social Education|url=http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|trans-title=Second, the ink history of the development|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041126130717/http://www.chcsec.gov.tw/pcsec/research/four_treasure/books/ink/index_ink.htm|archivedate=November 26, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India ink]] (or '''Indian ink''' in [[British English]]) is a black [[ink]] once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for [[drawing]], especially when inking [[comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s. The technique of making it probably came from China. India ink has been in use in [[India]] since at least the 4th century BC, where it was called ''masi''. In India, the black color of the ink came from [[bone char]], [[tar]], [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and other substances.&lt;ref&gt;"India ink." in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gottsege&gt;{{cite book

The Ancient Romans had a black writing ink they called ''[[atramentum]] librarium''.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith (editor) [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]], 1870
[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/index.html (text).]&lt;/ref&gt; Its name came from the Latin word ''atrare'', which meant to make something black. (This was the same root as the English word ''atrocious''.) It was usually made, like India ink, from [[soot]], although one variety, called ''atramentum elephantinum'', was made by burning the ivory of elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eastaugh, Valentine Walsh, Tracey Chaplin, Ruth Siddall, ''Pigment Compendium: A Dictionary of Historical Pigments'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gall-nuts were also used for making fine black writing ink. [[Iron gall ink]] (also known as iron gall nut ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black [[ink]] made from [[iron]] salts and [[tannic acid]]s from gall nut. It was the standard writing and drawing [[ink]] in [[Europe]], from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.

===Astronomy===
* A [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] where gravity prevents anything, including [[light]], from escaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that a sufficiently compact [[mass]] will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Although a black hole itself is black, infalling material forms an [[accretion disk]], which is one of brightest types of object in the universe.
* [[Black-body radiation]] refers to the radiation coming from a body at a given temperature where all incoming energy (light) is converted to heat.
* Black sky refers to the appearance of space as one emerges from Earth's atmosphere.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Why the night sky and space are black – Olbers' paradox====
The fact that [[outer space]] is black is sometimes called [[Olbers' paradox]]. In theory, because the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]], who posed the question of why the night sky was black.

The current accepted answer is that, although the universe is infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 13.8 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the [[Doppler effect]], and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question52.html|title=Why is space black?|website=starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daytime sky on Earth is blue because light from the Sun strikes molecules in Earth's atmosphere scattering light in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky appear blue. This is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].

The nighttime sky on Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by Earth itself, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This phenomenon also holds true for other locations without an atmosphere.

==Culture==
In China, the color black is associated with water, one of the five fundamental elements believed to compose all things;  and with winter, cold, and the direction north, usually symbolized by a black tortoise.  It is also associated with disorder, including the positive disorder which leads to change and new life. When the first Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] seized power from the [[Zhou Dynasty]], he changed the Imperial color from red to black, saying that black extinguished red.  Only when the [[Han Dynasty]] appeared in 206 BC was red restored as the imperial color.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp.&amp;nbsp;223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese and Japanese character for black (''kuro'' in Japanese), can, depending upon the context, also mean dark or evil.

In Japan, black is associated with mystery, the night, the unknown, the supernatural, the invisible and death.  Combined with white, it can symbolize intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322054855/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-art-and-design-colour/ |archivedate=March 22, 2013 |df=mdy }} Exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum on color in Japanese art and design,&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan in the 10th and 11th century, it was believed that wearing black could bring misfortune.  It was worn at court by those who wanted to set themselves apart from the established powers or who had renounced material possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan black can also symbolize experience, as opposed to white, which symbolizes naiveté. The black belt in martial arts symbolizes experience, while a white belt is worn by novices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/blacks.html |website=Webexhibits.org |series=Pigments through the ages |title=Intro to the blacks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese men traditionally wear a black kimono with some white decoration on their wedding day.

In Indonesia black is associated with depth, the subterranean world, demons, disaster, and the left hand.  When black is combined with white, however, it symbolizes harmony and equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, pp.&amp;nbsp;224–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political movements===
'''Anarchism''' is a political philosophy, most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which holds that governments and capitalism are harmful and undesirable. The [[Anarchist symbolism|symbols of anarchism]] was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement's socialist roots in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]]. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States and Russia. In the latter, the movement initially allied itself with the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name="blackflame"&gt;Michael Schmidt and [[Lucien van der Walt]], ''[[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)|Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism]]''. (Oakland and Edinburgh: [[AK Press]], 2009), pp. 33–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Army''' was a collection of anarchist military units which fought in the [[Russian Civil War]],  sometimes on the side of the Bolshevik [[Red Army]], and sometimes for the opposing [[White Army]]. It was officially known as the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], and it was under the command of the famous anarchist [[Nestor Makhno]].

'''Fascism'''. The [[Blackshirts]] ({{lang-it|camicie nere, 'CCNN}}) were [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[paramilitary]] groups in [[History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars|Italy]] during the period immediately following [[World War I]] and until the end of [[World War II]]. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'', or MVSN).

Inspired by the black uniforms of the [[Arditi]], Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by [[Benito Mussolini]] as the military tool of his political movement.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;Bosworth, R. J. B, ''Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915–1945'', Penguin Books, 2005, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with [[fasces]], an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his [[March on Rome]] with the blackshirts.

Black was also adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." Hitler also wrote that "the new flag&amp;nbsp;... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The black [[swastika]] was meant to symbolize the [[Aryan]] race, which, according to the Nazis, "was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm |title=Nazi propaganda pamphlet "The Life of the Führer" |publisher=Calvin.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mein Kampf]], volume 2, chapter VII |last=Hitler |first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf Hitler |year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black became the color of the uniform of the [[SS]], the ''Schutzstaffel'' or "defense corps", the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.

The Nazis used a [[black triangle (badge)|black triangle]] to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, where every prisoner had to wear one of the [[Nazi concentration camp badges]] on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to "their kind." Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the [[Romani people]], the habitually "work-shy," prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/asocials.html The unsettled, "asocials", alcoholics and prostitutes]. Center for Holocaust &amp; Genocide Studies. [[University of Minnesota]]. Retrieved September 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the black triangle has been adopted as a symbol in [[lesbian culture]] and by disabled activists.

Black shirts were also worn by the [[British Union of Fascists]] before World War II, and members of fascist movements in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriotic Resistance'''. The [[Lützow Free Corps]], composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against [[Napoleon]] in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing.  In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the [[German confederation]]. In 1866, [[Prussia]] unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000) ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp.&amp;nbsp;124–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamism'''. The [[Black Standard]] ({{lang|ar|راية السوداء |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|rāyat al-sawdā' }}, also known as {{lang|ar| راية العقاب |rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|rāyat al-'uqāb}} "[[:wikt:راية|banner]] of the [[:wikt:عقاب#Arabic|eagle]]" or simply as {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:الراية|الراية]]|rtl=yes}} {{lang|ar-Latn|al-rāya}} "the banner") is the historical flag flown by [[Muhammad]] in [[hadith|Islamic tradition]], an [[eschatology|eschatological]] symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]),&lt;ref name="cookshia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic|author=David Cook |year=2002|publisher=Darwin Press|page=197}} from Majlisi.&lt;/ref&gt; and a symbol used in [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].

Black has been a traditional color of cavalry and armoured or mechanized troops. German armoured troops ([[Panzerwaffe]]) traditionally wore black uniforms, and even in others, a [[black beret]] is common. In Finland, black is the symbolic color for both armoured troops and combat engineers, and military units of these specialities have black flags and unit insignia.

The [[black beret]] and the color black is also a symbol of special forces in many countries. Soviet and Russian [[OMON]] special police and [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Russian naval infantry]] wear a black beret. A black beret is also worn by military police in the Canadian, Czech, Croatian, Portuguese, Spanish and Serbian armies.

The silver-on-black skull and crossbones symbol or [[Totenkopf]] and a black uniform were used by [[Hussar]]s and [[Black Brunswickers]], the German [[Panzerwaffe]] and the Nazi [[Schutzstaffel]], and U.S. [[400th Missile Squadron]] (crossed missiles), and continues in use with the Estonian [[Kuperjanov Battalion]].

===Religion===
[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Holy Saturday.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[chancel]] of a [[Lutheran]] church on Holy Saturday is adorned with black [[parament]]s, as black is the liturgical colour of [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] in the Lutheran Churches.]]
* In [[Christian]] theology, black was the color of the universe before [[God]] created light. In many religious cultures, from [[Mesoamerica]] to [[Oceania]] to [[India]] and [[Japan]], the world was created out of a primordial darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuppi, ''Color in Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;268–69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bible]] the light of faith and Christianity is often contrasted with the darkness of ignorance and paganism.

In Christianity, the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] is often called the "prince of darkness." The term was used in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', published in 1667, referring to [[Satan]], who is viewed as the embodiment of evil. It is an English translation of the Latin phrase ''princeps tenebrarum'', which occurs in the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', written in the fourth century, in the 11th-century [[hymn]] ''Rhythmus de die mortis'' by [[Pietro Damiani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uan.it/alim/letteratura.nsf/(testiID)/9941C91390B5688BC125709F002D7C68!opendocument |title=Petrus Damiani: Opera poetica Pag 89 |publisher=Uan.it |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a sermon by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binetti.ru/bernardus/86_1.shtml |title="Sermones in Cantica canticorum, I–XVII" – Bernardus Claraevallensis |publisher=Binetti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the 12th century. The phrase also occurs in ''[[King Lear]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (c. 1606), Act III, Scene IV, l. 14:
'The prince of darkness is a gentleman."

Priests and pastors of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches commonly wear black, as do [[monks]] of the [[Benedictine Order]], who consider it the color of humility and penitence.
* In [[Islam]], black, along with green, plays an important symbolic role. It is the color of the [[Black Standard]], the banner that is said to have been carried by the soldiers of [[Muhammad]]. It is also used as a symbol in [[Shi'a Islam]] (heralding the advent of the [[Mahdi]]), and the flag of followers of [[Islamism]] and [[Jihadism]].
* In [[Hinduism]], the goddess [[Kali]], goddess of time and change, is portrayed with black or dark blue skin. wearing a necklace adorned with severed heads and hands. Her name means "The black one". She destroys anger and passion according to Hindu mythology and her devotees are supposed to abstain from meat or intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddess Kali never accepts nonvegetarian food because she is the chaste wife of Lord Siva|url=http://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Goddess_Kali_never_accepts_nonvegetarian_food_because_she_is_the_chaste_wife_of_Lord_Siva|publisher=Vani Quotes|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kali FAQ|url=http://www.shreemaa.org/questions-answers-goddess-kali/|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Kali does not eat meat, but it is the śāstra's injunction that those who are unable to give up meat-eating, they may sacrifice one goat, not cow, one small animal before the goddess Kali, on amāvāsya (new moon) day, night, not day, and they can eat it.

* In the United States, "[[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]" (the day after [[Thanksgiving Day]], the fourth Thursday in November) is traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. Many Americans are on holiday because of Thanksgiving, and many retailers open earlier and close later than normal, and offer special prices. The day's name originated in [[Philadelphia]] sometime before 1961, and originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive downtown pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on that day.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"&gt;Ben Zimmer, [http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/3047/ The Origins of "Black Friday,"] ''Word Routes'' (November 25, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linguistlist239"&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0804D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R5955&amp;I=-3 Martin L.

==Associations and symbolism==

===Mourning===
In Europe and America, black is the color most commonly associated with [[mourning]] and bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 109. In the survey cited, 80 percent of respondents said black was the color of mourning.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the color traditionally worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia like Vietnam, white is a color of mourning and is worn during funerals.

In Victorian England, the colors and fabrics of mourning were specified in an unofficial [[mourning dress|dress code]]:  "non-reflective black paramatta and crape for the first year of deepest mourning, followed by nine months of dullish black silk, heavily trimmed with crape, and then three months when crape was discarded.  Paramatta was a fabric of combined silk and wool or cotton; crape was a harsh black silk fabric with a crimped appearance produced by heat.  Widows were allowed to change into the colors of half-mourning, such as gray and lavender, black and white, for the final six months."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Jalland, Death in the Victorian Family, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "black day" (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] marked ''[[fasti]]'' days with white stones and ''nefasti'' days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the [[Black September in Jordan]], when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and [[Black July]] in [[Sri Lanka]], the killing of members of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population by the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] government.

In the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash]] on October 29, 1929, which marked the start of the [[Great Depression]], is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Darkness and evil===
In western popular culture, black has long been associated with [[evil]] and [[darkness]]. It is the traditional color of [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgment]]. The horseman representing famine rides a black horse.

The [[vampire]] of literature and films, such as [[Count Dracula]] of the [[Bram Stoker]] novel,  dressed in black, and could only move at night. The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' became the archetype of witches for generations of children.  Whereas witches and sorcerers inspired real fear in the 17th century, in the 21st century children and adults dressed as witches for Halloween parties and parades.

===Power, authority, and solemnity===
Black is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of [[Philip IV of France]] (1285–1314), and in England from the time of [[Edward I]] (1271–1307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Noir – histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by a less menacing blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In the United States, police cars are frequently [[black and white (police vehicle)|Black and white]]. The [[riot control]] units of the [[Basque Autonomous Police]] in Spain are known as ''[[beltzak]]'' ("blacks") after their uniform.

Black today is the most common color for limousines and the official cars of government officials.

Black evening dress is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls.  Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The [[mortarboard]] hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a [[biretta]] worn by Medieval professors and clerics

===Functionality===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The [[Ford Model T]], the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black house paint is becoming more popular with [[Sherwin-Williams]] reporting that the color, Tricorn Black, was the 6th most popular exterior house paint color in Canada and the 12th most popular paint in the United States in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Laura |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/1/17631794/modern-black-houses-exterior-colors |title=Black is the new black |work=[[Curbed]] |date=2018-08-01 |accessdate=2018-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnography===
{{further information|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|Classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom|Demographics of Canada|Demographics of Australia|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}
* The term "black" is often used in the West to describe people whose skin is darker. In the United States, it is particularly used to describe [[African Americans]]. The terms for African Americans have changed over the years, as shown by the categories in the [[United States Census]], taken every ten years.
* In the first U.S. Census, taken in 1790, just four categories were used: Free White males, Free White females, other free persons, and slaves.
* In the 1820 census the new category "colored" was added.
* In the 1850 census, slaves were listed by owner, and a B indicated black, while an M indicated "[[mulatto]]."
* In the 1890 census, the categories for race were white, black, mulatto, [[quadroon]] (a person one-quarter black); [[octoroon]] (a person one-eighth black), Chinese, Japanese, or American Indian.
* In the 1930 census, anyone with any black blood was supposed to be listed as "[[Negro]]."
* In the 1970 census, the category "Negro or black" was used for the first time.
* In the 2000 and 2012 census, the category "Black or African-American" was used, defined as "a person having their origin in any of the racial groups in Africa." In the 2012 Census 12.1 percent of Americans identified themselves as Black or African-American.&lt;ref name=thru&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions|title=Through the Decades | accessdate=2012-01-18 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black is also commonly used as a racial description in the [[United Kingdom]], since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census.  The 2011 British census asked residents to describe themselves, and categories offered included Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British.  Other possible categories were African British, African Scottish, Caribbean British and Caribbean Scottish. Of the total UK population in 2001, 1.0 percent identified themselves as Black Caribbean, 0.8 percent as Black African, and 0.2 percent as Black (others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |title=The Classification of Ethnic Groups |publisher=National Statistics |date=2001-02-16 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406195623/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Classifications/ns_ethnic_classification.asp |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], census respondents can identify themselves as Black. In the 2006 census, 2.5 percent of the population identified themselves as black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/rt-td/eth-eng.cfm] 2006 Canadian census, ethnicity&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the term black is not used in the census.  In the 2006 census, 2.3 percent of Australians identified themselves as [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and/or [[Torres Strait]] Islanders.

In [[Brazil]], the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as ''branco'' (white), ''pardo'' (brown), ''preto'' (black), or ''amarelo'' (yellow). In 2008 6.8 percent of the population identified themselves as "preto".&lt;ref&gt;IBGE. 2008 PNAD. [http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=1&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 População residente por cor ou raça, situação e sexo].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black and white===
* Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly light and darkness and good and evil. In [[Medieval literature]], the [[knight (stock character)|white knight]] usually represented virtue, the [[black knight]] something mysterious and sinister. In American [[westerns]], the hero often wore a white hat, the villain a black hat.
* In the original game of [[chess]] invented in [[Persia]] or [[India]], the colors of the two sides were varied; a 12th-century Iranian chess set in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]], has red and green pieces. But when the game was imported into Europe, the colors, corresponding to European culture, usually became black and white.
* Studies have shown that something printed in black letters on white has more authority with readers than any other color of printing.
* In philosophy and arguments, the issue is often described as [[black-and-white]], meaning that the issue at hand is [[dichotomy|dichotomized]] (having two clear, opposing sides with no middle ground).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Black chambers and black ops===
Black is commonly associated with [[secrecy]].
* The [[Black Chamber]] was a term given to an office which secretly opened and read diplomatic mail and broke codes. Queen [[Elizabeth I]] had such an office, headed by her Secretary, Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], which successfully broke the Spanish codes and broke up several plots against the Queen. In France a ''cabinet noir'' was established inside the French post office by [[Louis XIII]] to open diplomatic mail. It was closed during the [[French Revolution]] but re-opened under [[Napoleon I]]. The [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Dutch Republic]] had similar black chambers.
* The United States created a secret peacetime [[Black Chamber]], called the Cipher Bureau, in 1919. It was funded by the [[State Department]] and Army and disguised as a commercial company in New York. It successfully broke a number of diplomatic codes, including the code of the Japanese government. It was closed down in 1929 after the State Department withdrew funding, when the new Secretary of State, [[Henry Stimson]], stated that "Gentlemen do not read each other's mail." The Cipher Bureau was the ancestor of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name=NSAtimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-1952 Historical Timeline|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/center_crypt_history/pre_1952_timeline/index.shtml|work=National Security Agency|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''black project'' is a secret military project, such as [[Enigma machine|Enigma Decryption]] during World War II, or a secret counter-narcotics or police [[sting operation]].
* [[Black ops]] are covert operations carried out by a government, government agency or military.
* A [[Black Budget]] is a government budget that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a nation. The black budget is an account expenses and spending related to military research and covert operations. The black budget is mostly classified due to security reasons.

===Elegance – black and fashion===
Black is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States, followed by silver, gold, and white.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. (See history above.) In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear, in the form of a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 [[Edward VII]], then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short [[smoking jacket]].  The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a [[tuxedo]] in the U.S. The term "smoking" is still used today in Russia and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;
Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;
The tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the [[Duke of Windsor]] began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue. He did so because a black tuxedo looked greenish in artificial light, while a dark blue tuxedo looked blacker than black itself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For women's fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the [[little black dress|simple black dress]] by [[Coco Chanel]] in 1926. (See history.) Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The designer [[Karl Lagerfeld]], explaining why black was so popular, said:  "Black is the color that goes with everything. If you're wearing black, you're on sure ground."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Skirts have gone up and down and fashions have changed, but the black dress has not lost its position as the essential element of a woman's wardrobe. The fashion designer [[Christian Dior]] said, "elegance is a combination of distinction, naturalness, care and simplicity,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and black exemplified elegance.

The expression  "X is the new black" is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a [[cliché]].

Many performers of both popular and [[European classical music]], including French singers [[Edith Piaf]] and [[Juliette Greco]], and violinist [[Joshua Bell]] have traditionally worn black on stage during performances. A black costume was usually chosen as part of their image or stage persona, or because it did not distract from the music, or sometimes for a political reason. Country-western singer [[Johnny Cash]] always wore black on stage. In 1971, Cash wrote the song "[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]" to explain why he dressed in that color: "We're doing mighty fine I do suppose / In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes / But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back / Up front there ought to be a man in black."

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Bovine spongiform encephalopathy''' ('''BSE'''), commonly known as '''mad cow disease''', is a [[neurodegenerative disease]] of [[cattle]].&lt;ref name=WHO2002/&gt; Symptoms include abnormal behavior, trouble walking, and weight loss.&lt;ref name=Cas2018/&gt; Later in the course the cow becomes unable to move.&lt;ref name=Cas2018/&gt; The [[incubation period|time between infection and onset of symptoms]] is generally four to five years.&lt;ref name=WHO2002&gt;{{cite web |title=Bovine spongiform encephalopathy |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218132047/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs113/en/ |website=WHO |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time from onset of symptoms to death is generally weeks to months.&lt;ref name=WHO2002/&gt; Spread to humans is believed to result in [[variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt; As of 2018 a total of 231 cases of vCJD have been reported globally.&lt;ref name=CDC2018&gt;{{cite web |title=BSE in North America BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) Prion Diseases |url=https://www.cdc.gov/prions/bse/bse-north-america.html |website=CDC |accessdate=26 October 2018 |language=en-us |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
BSE is due to an infection by a misfolded protein, known as a [[prion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt; Cattle are believed to have been infected by being fed [[meat-and-bone meal]] (MBM) that contained the remains of other cattle who spontaneously developed the disease or [[scrapie]]-infected [[sheep]] products.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt; The outbreak increased throughout the United Kingdom due to the practice of feeding meat-and-bone meal to young calves of [[dairy cows]].&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMJ1997&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathanson|first=Neal|last2=Wilesmith|first2=John|last3=Griot|first3=Christian|year=1997|title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE): Causes and Consequences of a Common Source Epidemic|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/145/11/959.full.pdf|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=145|pages=959–69|via=|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009064|pmid=9169904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases are suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by examination of the brain.&lt;ref name=Cas2018/&gt; Cases are classified as classic or atypical, with the latter divided into H- and L types.&lt;ref name=Cas2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Efforts to prevent the disease in the UK include not allowing any animal older than 30 months to enter either the human food or [[animal feed supply]].&lt;ref name=CDC2018Con/&gt; In Europe all cattle over 30 month must be tested if they will become human food.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Con&gt;{{cite web |title=Control Measures BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) Prion Diseases |url=https://www.cdc.gov/prions/bse/control-measures.html |website=CDC |accessdate=27 October 2018 |language=en-us |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America tissue of concern, known as [[specified risk material]], may not be added to animal feed or [[pet food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feed Bans BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) {{!}} Prion Diseases |url=https://www.cdc.gov/prions/bse/feed-ban.html |website=CDC |accessdate=27 October 2018 |language=en-us |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 4.4 million cows were killed during the eradication program in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='All steps taken' after BSE diagnosis |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-45954225 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Bse-cattle-250.jpg|thumb|This cow with BSE displays abnormal posturing and weight loss.]]
Symptoms are not seen immediately in cattle due to the disease's extremely long incubation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afrivip.org/sites/default/files/bse_complete.pdf|title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)|last=Thomson|first=Gavin|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cattle have been observed to have an abnormal gait, changes in behavior, tremors and hyper-responsiveness to certain stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy.pdf|title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|last=|first=|date=August 2016|website=The Center for Food Security &amp; Public Health|publisher=The Center for Food Security &amp; Public Health|access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindlimb ataxia affects the animal’s gait and occurs when muscle control is lost. This results in poor balance and coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/ataxia/ataxia.htm|title=Ataxias and Cerebellar or Spinocerebellar Degeneration Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural changes may include aggression, anxiety relating to certain situations, nervousness, frenzy or an overall change in temperament. Some rare but previously observed symptoms also include persistent pacing, rubbing or licking. Additionally, nonspecific symptoms have also been observed which include weight loss, decreased milk production, lameness, ear infections and teeth grinding due to pain. Some animals may show a combination of these symptoms, while others may only be observed demonstrating one of the many reported. Once clinical symptoms arise, they typically get worse over the upcoming weeks and months, eventually leading to recumbency, coma and death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cause ==
BSE is due to an infection by a misfolded protein, known as a [[prion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt; Cattle are believed to have been infected from being feed [[meat and bone meal]] (MBM) that contained the remains of other cattle who spontaneously developed the disease or [[scrapie]]-infected sheep products.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt; The outbreak increased throughout the United Kingdom due to the practice of feeding meat-and-bone meal to young calves of dairy cows.&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMJ1997/&gt;

Prions replicate by causing other normally folded proteins of the same type to take on their misfolded shape, which then go on to do the same, leading to an exponential chain reaction. Eventually, the prions aggregate into an [[alpha helical]], [[beta pleated sheet]], which is thought to be toxic to brain cells.

The agent is not destroyed even if the beef or material containing it is cooked or heat-treated.&lt;ref name="TSE"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopaphy: An Overview  |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/BSEbrochure12-2006.pdf  |accessdate=8 April 2008  |date=December 2006  |format=PDF  |publisher=[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]]  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308030306/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/BSEbrochure12-2006.pdf  |archivedate=8 March 2008  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission can occur when healthy animals come in contact with tainted tissues from others with the disease. In the brain, the agent causes native cellular prion protein to deform into the misfolded state, which then goes on to deform further prion protein in an exponential cascade. This results in protein aggregates, which then form dense [[senile plaques|plaque]] fibers. Brain cells begin to die off in massive numbers, eventually leading to the microscopic appearance of "holes" in the brain, degeneration of physical and mental abilities, and ultimately death.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The British Government enquiry took the view the cause was not scrapie, as had originally been postulated, but was some event in the 1970s that was not possible to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/report/volume1/execsum4.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090505194948/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/report/volume1/execsum4.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-05-05|title=Vol.1 - Executive Summary of the Report of the Inquiry|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread to humans===
Spread to humans is believed to result in [[variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).&lt;ref name=CDC2018Ab/&gt; The agent can be transmitted to humans by eating food contaminated with it.&lt;ref name=Budka2015rev/&gt; The highest risk to humans is believed to be from eating food contaminated with the brain, spinal cord, or digestive tract though any tissue may be involved.&lt;ref name="FDA/CFSAN"&gt;

== Pathogenesis ==
The pathogenesis of BSE is not well understood or documented like other diseases of this nature. Even though BSE is a disease that results in neurological defects, its pathogenesis occurs in areas that reside outside of the nervous system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espinosa|first=Juan Carlos|last2=Morales|first2=Mónica|last3=Castilla|first3=Joaquín|last4=Rogers|first4=Mark|last5=Torres|first5=Juan María|date=2007-01-01|title=Progression of prion infectivity in asymptomatic cattle after oral bovine spongiform encephalopathy challenge|url=http://jgv.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.82647-0|journal=Journal of General Virology|volume=88|issue=4|pages=1379–83|doi=10.1099/vir.0.82647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong deposition of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; initially located in the Ileal Peyer’s patches of the small intestine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balkema-Buschmann|first=A.|last2=Fast|first2=C.|last3=Kaatz|first3=M.|last4=Eiden|first4=M.|last5=Ziegler|first5=U.|last6=McIntyre|first6=L.|last7=Keller|first7=M.|last8=Hills|first8=B.|last9=Groschup|first9=M.

It has not, however, been determined to be an essential part of the pathogenesis of BSE. The Ileal Peyer’s patches have been the only organ from this system that has been found to play a major role in the pathogenesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Infectivity of the Ileal Peyer's patches has been observed as early as 4 months after inoculation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation was found to occur mostly in tangible body macrophages of the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Tangible body macrophages involved in PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; clearance are thought to play a role in PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation in the Peyer’s patches.

Generally, in clinical experiments, high doses of the disease are administered. In natural cases, it was hypothesized that low doses of the agent were present, and therefore, infectivity could not be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=G|last2=Hawkins|first2=S|last3=Green|first3=R|last4=Austin|first4=A|last5=Dexter|first5=I|last6=Spencer|first6=Y|last7=Chaplin|first7=M|last8=Stack|first8=M|last9=Dawson|first9=M|year=1998|title=Preliminary observations on the pathogenesis of experimental bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE): an update|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Stack/publication/51299099_Preliminary_observations_on_the_pathogenesis_of_experimental_bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy_BSE_An_update/links/09e4150b77b33bd50c000000.pdf|journal=The Veterinary Record|volume=142|pages=103–06|via=|doi=10.1136/vr.142.5.103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Histology bse.jpg|thumb|Brain tissue of a cow with BSE showing the typical microscopic "holes" in the grey matter]]
Diagnosis of BSE continues to be a practical problem. It has an incubation period of months to years, during which no symptoms are noticed, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; form has started. At present, virtually no way is known to detect PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; reliably except by examining ''post mortem'' brain tissue using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.{{by whom|date=August 2015}}

The traditional method of diagnosis relies on [[histopathological]] examination of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the brain, and other tissues, ''[[post mortem]]''. [[Immunohistochemistry]] can be used to demonstrate prion protein accumulation.&lt;ref name="WikiVet"&gt;[http://en.wikivet.net/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy] reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)|surround optical fiber immunoassay]] and some specific antibodies against PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an [[antibody]] for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artifacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could, therefore, compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood- or urine-based screening test for BSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today. |pages=195 |date=August 2010 |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf | title = SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in Brain and Blood | publisher = SUNY Downstate Medical Center | authorlink = Rubenstein, R., et al. | accessdate = 19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
BSE is a transmissible disease that primarily affects the [[central nervous system]]; it is a form of [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]], like [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] in humans and [[scrapie]] in sheep, and [[chronic wasting disease]] in [[cervids|deer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eraña|first1=H|last2=Venegas|first2=V|last3=Moreno|first3=J|last4=Castilla|first4=J|title=Prion-like disorders and Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: An overview of the mechanistic features that are shared by the various disease-related misfolded proteins.|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=19 February 2017|volume=483|issue=4|pages=1125–36|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.08.166|pmid=27590581}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Budka2015rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budka|first1=H|last2=Will|first2=RG|title=The end of the BSE saga: do we still need surveillance for human prion diseases?|journal=Swiss medical weekly|date=12 November 2015 |volume=145 |pages=w1421 2|doi=10.4414/smw.2015.14212 |pmid=26715203 |url=https://smw.ch/index.php?id=75&amp;tx_ezmjournal_articledetail[identifier]=smw.2015.14212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waddell|first1=L|last2=Greig|first2=J|last3=Mascarenhas|first3=M|last4=Otten|first4=A|last5=Corrin|first5=T|last6=Hierlihy|first6=K|title=Current evidence on the transmissibility of chronic wasting disease prions to humans – A systematic review|journal=Transboundary and emerging diseases|date=30 January 2017|doi=10.1111/tbed.12612|pmid=28139079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
A ban on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle has resulted in a strong reduction in cases in countries where the disease has been present. In disease-free countries, control relies on import control, feeding regulations, and surveillance measures.&lt;ref name="WikiVet"/&gt;

In UK and US [[slaughterhouse]]s, the brain, spinal cord, [[Trigeminal ganglion|trigeminal ganglia]], intestines, eyes, and tonsils from cattle are classified as [[specified risk material]]s, and must be disposed of appropriately.&lt;ref name="WikiVet"/&gt;

An enhanced BSE-related feed ban is in effect in both the United States and Canada to help improve prevention and elimination of BSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/prions/bse/feed-ban.html|title=Feed Bans    BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) {{!}} Prion Diseases {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

The tests used for detecting BSE vary considerably, as do the regulations in various jurisdictions for when, and which cattle, must be tested. For instance in the EU, the cattle tested are older (30 months or older), while many cattle are slaughtered younger than that. At the opposite end of the scale, Japan tests all cattle at the time of slaughter. Tests are also difficult, as the altered prion protein has very low levels in blood or urine, and no other signal has been found. Newer tests{{specify|date=July 2016}} are faster, more sensitive, and cheaper, so future figures possibly may be more comprehensive. Even so, currently the only reliable test is examination of tissues during a [[necropsy]].

As for vCJD in humans, autopsy tests are not always done, so those figures, too, are likely to be too low, but probably by a lesser fraction. In the United Kingdom, anyone with possible vCJD symptoms must be reported to the Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has refused to impose a national requirement that physicians and hospitals report cases of the disease. Instead, the agency relies on other methods, including death certificates and urging physicians to send suspicious cases to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, which is funded by the CDC.

To control potential transmission of vCJD within the United States, the American Red Cross has established strict restrictions on individuals' eligibility to donate blood. Individuals who have spent a cumulative time of 3 months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996, or a cumulative time of 5 years or more from 1980 to present in any combination of countries in Europe, are prohibited from donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing#arc5 Eligibility Criteria for Blood Donation], American Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
The first reported case in [[North America]] was in December 1993 from [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/madcow/|accessdate=20 January 2015|newspaper=CBC News|date=24 August 2006|title=Mad Cow in Canada: The science and the story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Cow in Canada – 1993|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0301-e.htm|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Canadian case was reported in May 2003. The first known U.S. occurrence came in December of the same year, though it was later confirmed to be a cow of Canadian origin imported to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cattlerange.com/tcr-m.html#3 |title=Investigators Trace Diseased Cow to Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040211191824/http://www.cattlerange.com/tcr-m.html#3|archivedate=February 11, 2004|date=December 27, 2003|publisher=The Cattle Range }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cow was slaughtered on a farm near Yakima, Washington.

Canada announced two additional cases of BSE from Alberta in early 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Becker | first1=Geoffrey S. |url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL32627.pdf | title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and Canadian Beef Imports |publisher=CRS Report for Congress.

In June 2005, [[John R. Clifford]], chief veterinary officer for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] animal health inspection service, confirmed a fully domestic case of BSE in [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNeil Jr|first1=Donald G.|title=Case of Mad Cow in Texas Is First to Originate in U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/us/case-of-mad-cow-in-texas-is-first-to-originate-in-us.html?mtrref=en.wikipedia.org&amp;gwh=F997F7827D3AC55AADFD56C262D31CF1&amp;gwt=pay|work=The New York Times|date=30 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Practices in the United States relating to BSE ====
Soybean meal is cheap and plentiful in the [[United States]], and cottonseed meal (1.5 million tons of which are produced in the U.S. every year, none of which is  suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animals) is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to [[ruminant]]s such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and [[poultry]]. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampton|first1=Sheldon|last2=Stauber|first2=John|title=Mad Cow USA|edition=1st|year=2004|publisher=Common Courage Press|location=Monroe, Maine|isbn=978-1-56751-110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, some authors have suggested that under certain conditions, it is still possible for BSE incidence to increase in U.S. cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Richard|last2=Lehman|first2=Clarence|date=June 2013|title=Modeling of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a two-species feedback loop|journal=Epidemics|publisher=Elsevier|volume=5|issue=2|pages=85–91|doi=10.1016/j.epidem.2013.04.001}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- A proposal to end the use of cattle blood, restaurant scraps, and [[poultry litter]] (fecal matter, feathers, bedding material)&lt;ref&gt;The term "chicken litter" also includes spilled chicken feed, as well as fecal matter and feathers. It is still legal in the United States to use ruminant protein to feed chickens. Thus, ruminant protein can get into the food chain of cattle in this roundabout way.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

In February 2001, the US [[Government Accountability Office]] reported the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]], which is responsible for regulating feed, had not adequately enforced the various bans. Compliance with the regulations was shown to be extremely poor before the discovery of a cow in Washington infected with BSE in 2003, but industry representatives report that compliance is now total. Even so, critics call the partial prohibitions insufficient. Indeed, US meat producer [[Creekstone Farms Premium Beef|Creekstone Farms]] was forcibly prevented from conducting BSE testing by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], which under an obscure 1913 law had the authority to restrict sales of BSE testing kits, allegedly to protect other producers from being forced to conduct the same tests to stay competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Creekstone Farms response to USDA appeal of summary judgement | publisher = 3buddies | date = 30 May 2007 | url = http://www.3buddies.com/creekstone/news-appeal-response.html | accessdate = 20 June 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928064710/http://www.3buddies.com/creekstone/news-appeal-response.html | archivedate = 28 September 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA has issued recalls of beef supplies that involved introduction of [[downer (animal)|downer cow]]s into the food supply. [[Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company]] was found to have used electric shocks to prod downer cows into the slaughtering system in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Meat Recalls to Name Retailers | first = Molly | last = Seltzer | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/11/AR2008071102818.html | agency = Bloomberg News |work=The Washington Post | date = 12 July 2008 | accessdate = 20 June 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Possibly due to pressure from large agribusiness, the United States has drastically cut back on the number of cows inspected for BSE.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news | title = Mad cow watch goes blind | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-03-our-view_x.htm |work=USA Today | date = 3 August 2006 | accessdate = 20 June 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on the US beef industry====
{{Update section|date=November 2016}}
Japan was the top importer of US beef, buying 240,000 tons valued at $1.4 billion in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} After the discovery of the first case of BSE in the US on 23 December 2003, Japan halted US beef imports. In December 2005, Japan once again allowed imports of US beef, but reinstated its ban in January 2006 after a violation of the US-Japan beef import agreement: a vertebral column, which should have been removed prior to shipment, was included in a shipment of veal.

Tokyo yielded to US pressure to resume imports, ignoring consumer worries about the safety of US beef, said Japanese consumer groups. Michiko Kamiyama from Food Safety Citizen Watch and Yoko Tomiyama from [[Consumers Union of Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fswatch.org/newsletter/english/issue05.html|title=Food Safety Citizens'Watch English Newsletter|website=www.fswatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; said about this: "The government has put priority on the political schedule between the two countries, not on food safety or human health."

Sixty-five nations implemented full or partial restrictions on importing US beef products because of concerns that US testing lacked sufficient rigor. As a result, exports of US beef declined from 1,300,000 metric tons in 2003, (before the first mad cow was detected in the US) to 322,000 metric tons in 2004. This has increased since then to 771,000 metric tons in 2007 and to 1,300,000 metric tons by 2017.&lt;ref name="usmef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics |url=http://www.usmef.org/TradeLibrary/Statistics.asp |work=Trade Library |publisher=U.S. Meat Export Federation |accessdate=20 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514152807/http://www.usmef.org/TradeLibrary/Statistics.asp |archivedate=14 May 2009 }}

On 31 December 2006, Hematech, Inc, a biotechnology company based in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]], South Dakota, announced it had used genetic engineering and cloning technology to produce cattle that lacked a necessary gene for prion production – thus theoretically making them immune to BSE.&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2012, some [[South Korea]]n retailers ceased importing beef from the [[United States]] after a case of BSE was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/04/25/us-korea-beef-idINL3E8FP1J720120425 | agency=Reuters | title=S.

===Japan===
With 36 confirmed cases, Japan experienced one of the largest number of cases of BSE outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/topics/foodsafety/bse/dl/5.pdf Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare: BSE Cases in Japan] (accessed 7 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only country outside Europe and the Americas to report non-imported cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/bse-specific-data/ World Organisation for Animal Health: BSE situation in the world and annual incidence rate] (accessed 7 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Reformation of food safety in light of the BSE cases resulted in the establishment of a governmental Food Safety Commission in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kamisato Tatsuhiro | year = 2005 | title = BSE crisis in Japan: A chronological overview | journal = Environ Health Prev Med | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 295–302 | pmc=2723414 | pmid=21432134 | doi=10.1007/BF02897705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle are naturally [[herbivore]]s, eating [[grass]]es. In modern industrial cattle-farming, though, various commercial feeds are used, which may contain ingredients including [[antibiotic]]s, [[hormone]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, and [[protein]] supplements. The use of meat and [[bone meal]], produced from the ground and cooked leftovers of the slaughtering process, as well as from the carcasses of sick and injured animals such as cattle or sheep&lt;!-- rendered chicken parts are called poultry meal--&gt;, as a protein supplement in cattle feed was widespread in [[Europe]] prior to about 1987.&lt;ref name="FDA/CFSAN"/&gt; Worldwide, [[soybean]] meal is the primary plant-based protein supplement fed to cattle. However, soybeans do not grow well in Europe, so cattle raisers throughout Europe turned to the cheaper animal byproduct feeds as an alternative. The British Inquiry dismissed suggestions that changes to processing might have increased the infectious agents in cattle feed, saying, "changes in process could not have been solely responsible for the emergence of BSE, and changes in regulation were not a factor at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/index.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090505194948/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-05 |title=The BSE Inquiry: Home|work=Open.gov.uk|date =October 2000|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The prion causing BSE is not destroyed by heat treatment.)

The first confirmed instance in which an animal fell ill with the disease occurred in 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and lab tests the following year indicated the presence of BSE; by November 1987, the British Ministry of Agriculture accepted it had a new disease on its hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn111-brain-disease-drives-cows-wild.html|title=Brain disease drives cows wild|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, 177 people (as of June 2014) contracted and died of a disease with similar neurological symptoms subsequently called (new) [[variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).&lt;ref name="NCJDSU"&gt;{{cite web |title=Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease, Current Data (October 2009) |url=http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm  |accessdate=14 October 2009  |date=October 2009  |publisher=The National Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU), [[University of Edinburgh]]  |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721234746/http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm  |archivedate=21 July 2012  |df=dmy }};&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/documents/worldfigs.pdf|title=Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Current Data|date=June 2014|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226031911/http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/documents/worldfigs.pdf#|archive-date=26 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a separate disease from 'classical' [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], which is not related to BSE and has been known about since the early 1900s. Three cases of vCJD occurred in people who had lived in or visited the UK – one each in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States of America]]. Also, some concern existed about those who work with (and therefore inhale) cattle [[meat and bone meal]], such as [[horticulture|horticulturists]], who use it as fertilizer. Up-to-date statistics on all types of CJD are published by the National Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit &lt;!-- (NCJDSU) --&gt; in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].

For many of the vCJD patients, direct evidence exists that they had consumed tainted [[beef]], and this is assumed to be the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of [[nervous system]] tissue with [[ground meat]] (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by culling all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, the full extent of the human vCJD outbreak is still not known.

The scientific consensus is that infectious BSE prion material is not destroyed through cooking procedures, meaning that even contaminated beef foodstuffs prepared "well done" may remain infectious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mad cow disease: Still a concern |url=http://premium.edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/ID/00012.html |work=MayoClinic.com |publisher=CNN |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=20 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425012159/http://premium.edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/ID/00012.html |archivedate=25 April 2005 }}

In fact the infectious agent remains viable over {{cvt|600|C|F}}.

Alan Colchester, a professor of neurology at the [[University of Kent]], and Nancy Colchester, writing in the 3 September 2005 issue of the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', proposed a theory that the most likely initial origin of BSE in the United Kingdom was the importation from the Indian Subcontinent of bone meal which contained CJD-infected human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Colchester AC, Colchester NT | title = The origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy: the human prion disease hypothesis| journal = Lancet| volume = 366| issue = 9488| pages = 856–61| year = 2005| pmid = 16139661| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of India vehemently responded to the research, calling it "misleading, highly mischievous; a figment of imagination; absurd," further adding that India maintained constant surveillance and had not had a single case of either BSE or vCJD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = India dismisses Lancet's mad cow | first1 = Chandrika | last1 = Mago | first2 = Kounteya | last2 = Sinha | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1218869.cms |work=The Times of India | date = 2 September 2005 | accessdate = 20 June 2009 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; The authors responded in the 22 January 2006 issue of ''The Lancet'' that their theory is unprovable only in the same sense as all other BSE origin theories are and that the theory warrants further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1       = Colchester| first1      = A| last2       = Colchester| first2      = N|date=28 January 2006| title       = Origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy – Authors' reply| journal     = The Lancet| volume      = 367| issue       = 9507| pages       = 298–99| publisher   = Elsevier| doi         = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68062-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the investigation into the BSE epizootic, an enquiry was also made into the activities of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] [[Medicines Control Agency]] (MCA). On 7 May 1999, [[David Osborne Hagger]], a retired civil servant who worked in the Medicines Division of the Department of Health between 1984 and 1994, produced a written statement to the BSE Inquiry in which he gave an account of his professional experience of BSE.&lt;ref name="haggerpdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/files/ws/s476.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080102164404/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/files/ws/s476.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 January 2008|title=BSE Inquiry, Statement No. 476|date=7 May 1999|publisher=BSE Inquiry|accessdate=16 October 2008}} Statement of David Osborne Hagger, Head of Abridged Licensing and Coordinator of the Executive support business of the Medicines Division of the [[British Department of Health|Department of Health]] at Market Towers in London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1989, the MCA had been asked to "identify relevant manufacturers and obtain information about the bovine material contained in children’s vaccines, the stocks of these vaccines and how long it would take to switch to other products." In July, "[the] use of bovine insulin in a small group of mainly elderly patients was noted and it was recognised that alternative products for this group were not considered satisfactory." In September, the BSE Working Party of the [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) recommended that "no licensing action is required at present in regard to products produced from bovine material or using prepared bovine brain in nutrient media and sourced from outside the [[United Kingdom]], the Channel Isles and the Republic of Ireland provided that the country of origin is known to be free of BSE, has competent veterinary advisers and is known to practise good animal husbandry."

In 1990, the British Diabetic Association became concerned regarding the safety of bovine insulin. The CSM assured them "[that] there was no insulin sourced from cattle in the UK or Ireland and that the situation in other countries was being monitored."

In 1991, the European Commission "[expressed] concerns about the possible transmission of the BSE/scrapie agent to man through use of certain cosmetic treatments."

In 1992, sources in France reported to the MCA "that BSE had now been reported in France and there were some licensed surgical sutures derived from French bovine material." Concerns were also raised at a CSM meeting "regarding a possible risk of transmission of the BSE agent in gelatin products."&lt;ref name="haggerpdf" /&gt;

For this failure, France was heavily criticised internationally. Thillier himself queried why there had never been a ban on French beef or basic safety precautions to stop the food chain becoming contaminated, suggesting "Perhaps because the French government forgot its role in guaranteeing the safety of food products, and this neglect cost the lives of nine people."&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparks|first1=Ian|title=Yes, we had mad cow disease too, France confesses|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/yes-we-had-mad-cow-disease-too-france-confesses-6927256.html|accessdate=23 September 2017|publisher=Evening Standard|date=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney Morning Herald added, "while blustering French politicians blamed Britain for the emergence of the disease  – and tried to quarantine the country by banning imports of British beef – they failed to adopt measures to prevent a hidden epidemic at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilsher|first1=Kim|title=France in denial as BSE-infected beef entered food chain|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/04/1088879375088.html|website=SMH.com|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, a case of BSE was confirmed at a firm in [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]], the first such case in Scotland in a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/18/bse-case-found-on-aberdeenshire-farm|title=Movement ban imposed on Aberdeenshire farm following BSE case|last=Carrell|first=Severin|date=2018-10-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 18 October, the case was believed to be an isolated one, but four other animals from the same herd were being culled for precautionary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-45901043|title='Mad cow disease' at Scottish farm|date=2018-10-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish officials confirmed that the case had been identified as part of routine testing and that the diseased cow had not entered the human food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/mad-cow-disease-case-confirmed-on-farm-in-scotland-11528621|title=Farm locked down after mad cow disease found in Scotland|work=Sky News|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other countries had isolated outbreaks of BSE confirmed, including Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Germany.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

====The ban on British beef====
The BSE crisis led to the [[European Union]] (EU) banning exports of British beef with effect from March 1996; the ban lasted for 10 years before it was finally lifted on 1 May 2006&lt;ref name="BBC-3-May-2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4967480.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=End to 10-year British beef ban |date=3 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite attempts in May through September 1996 by British prime minister [[John Major]] to get the ban lifted. The ban, which led to much controversy in Parliament and to the incineration of over one million cattle from at least March 1996,&lt;ref name=dickinson&gt;[https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1997/general-news/nigel-dickinson [[World Press Photo|worldpressphoto.org]]: "1997 Photo Contest - General News, Honorable Mention prize singles: Nigel Dickinson - United Kingdom"] Caption: "A cow suspected of carrying BSE is placed in an incinerator. When a link was established in England between BSE, also known as 'mad cow disease', and Creutzfeldt-Jakob, a fatal brain condition in humans, it sparked off a political row in the European Union. British beef was banned worldwide, and by the year's end over a million cattle had been destroyed."&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in trade controversies between the UK and other EU states, dubbed "beef war" by media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/10/22/europe/beef/ |title=EU beef war escalates |publisher=[[CNNfn]] |date=22 October 1999 |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions remained for beef containing "vertebral material" and for beef sold on the bone.&lt;ref name="BBC-3-May-2006"/&gt; France continued to impose a ban on British beef illegally long after the European Court of Justice had ordered it to lift its blockade, although it has never paid any fine for doing so.&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt;

[[Russia]] was proceeding to lift the ban sometime after November 2012 after 16 years; the announcement was made during a visit by the UK's chief veterinary officer [[Nigel Gibbens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20454206 |title=Russia to lift 16-year ban on British beef and lamb |date=22 November 2012 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was successfully negotiated that beef from Wales was allowed to be exported to the Dutch market, which had formerly been an important market for Northern Irish beef. Of two approved export establishments in the United Kingdom in 1999, one was in Scotland – an establishment to which live beef was supplied from Northern Ireland. As the incidence of BSE was very low in Northern Ireland – only six cases of BSE by 1999 – partly due to the early adoption of an advanced herd tagging and computerization system in the region, calls were made to remove the EU ban on exports with regard to Northern Irish beef.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmniaf/62/6205.htm UK Parliament website] Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs Second Report&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar wildcat bans from countries known to have BSE were imposed in various European countries, although these were mostly subsequently ruled illegal. ''[[The Economist]]'' noted, "Unfortunately, much of the crisis in Europe can be blamed on politicians and bureaucrats. Even while some European countries were clamouring for bans on British beef, they were ignoring warnings from the European Commission about how to avoid the spread of BSE in their own herds."&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |title=Europe's mad cows |url=http://www.economist.com/node/436033 |accessdate=23 September 2017 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=28 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Different hypotheses exist for the origin of BSE in cattle. One hypothesis suggests it may have jumped species from the disease [[scrapie]] in sheep, and another hypothesis suggests that it evolved from a rare spontaneous form of "mad cow disease" that has been seen occasionally in cattle for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last        = MacKenzie| first       = Debora|date=17 March 2007| title       = New twist in tale of BSE's beginnings| journal     = New Scientist| issue       = 2595| url         = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325954.400-new-twist-in-tale-of-bses-beginnings.html| accessdate  = 20 June 2009| doi         = 10.1016/S0262-4079(07)60642-3| volume      = 193| pages       = 11}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century [[Before Christ|BC]], [[Hippocrates]] described a similar illness in cattle and sheep, which he believed also occurred in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last        = McAlister| first       = Vivian|date=June 2005| title       = Sacred disease of our times: failure of the infectious disease model of spongiform encephalopathy.| journal     = Clin Invest Med| issue       = 3| url         = http://works.bepress.com/vivianmcalister/10/| accessdate  = 20 June 2011| pmid        = 16021982| volume      = 28| pages       = 101–04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus]] recorded cases of a disease with similar characteristics in the fourth and fifth centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digesta Artis Mulomedicinae]], [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cadaveric [[spasm]]''', also known as '''postmortem spasm''', '''instantaneous rigor''', '''cataleptic rigidity''', or '''instantaneous rigidity''', is a rare form of muscular stiffening that occurs at the moment of [[death]] and persists into the period of [[rigor mortis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/forensicmedicine/notes/timedeath.pdf|title=Postmortem Changes and Time of Death|publisher=Dundee.ac.uk|accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cadaveric spasm can be distinguished from rigor mortis as the former is a stronger stiffening of the muscles that cannot be easily undone, as rigor mortis can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KNÜSEL|first=CHRISTOPHER|year=1996|title=DEATH, DECAY, AND RITUAL RECONSTRUCTION: ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF CADAVERIC SPASM|url=|journal=Oxford journal of archaeology|volume=15|pages=121–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cause is unknown but is usually associated with violent deaths under extremely physical circumstances with intense [[emotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lyle | first = Douglas P. | title = Forensics for Dummies | publisher = Wiley Publishing, Inc. | location = Indianapolis, Indiana | date = 2004 | page = 165 | ISBN = 0-7645-5580-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestation== 
Cadaveric spasm may affect all muscles in the body, but typically only groups, such as the forearms, or hands. Cadaveric spasm is seen in cases of drowning victims when [[grass]], [[weed]]s, [[root]]s or other materials are clutched, and provides evidence of life at the time of entry into the water. Cadaveric spasm often crystallizes the last activity one did before death and is therefore significant in forensic investigations, e.g. holding onto a knife tightly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Physiological mechanism==
[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is required to reuptake [[calcium]] into the [[sarcomere]]'s sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). When a muscle is relaxed, the [[myosin]] heads are returned to their "high energy" position, ready and waiting for a binding site on the [[actin]] filament to become available. Because there is no ATP available, previously released calcium ions cannot return to the SR. These leftover calcium ions move around inside the sarcomere and may eventually find their way to a binding site on the thin filament's regulatory protein. Since the myosin head is already ready to bind, no additional ATP expenditure is required and the sarcomere contracts.

When this process occurs on a larger scale, the stiffening associated with rigor mortis can occur. It mainly occurs during high ATP use. Sometimes, cadaveric spasms can be associated with [[erotic asphyxiation]] resulting in death.

Cadaveric spasm has been posed as an explanation for President Kennedy's reaction to the fatal head shot in his 1963 assassination, to indicate why his head moved backward after the shot.

When the body of [[Kurt Cobain]] was discovered, his left hand tightly clutched the barrel of the shotgun that killed him, indicating he had been alive and holding the weapon before his death, rather than having been killed by another person and the scene then arranged to suggest suicide.

== Controversy ==
Matthias Pfaffli and Dau Wyler, Professors of Legal Medicine at University of Bern, Switzerland, posed five requirements in order for a death to have been observed and classified as containing a cadaveric spasm:
# The body part hypothesized as having undergone cadaveric spasm must be freestanding against the force of gravity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# The deceased must be observed before the rigor mortis has developed &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madea|first=Burkhard|date=2013-06-01|title=Cadaveric spasm|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-012-9403-5|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=249–250|doi=10.1007/s12024-012-9403-5|issn=1547-769X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There must be adequate and continuous documentation of post mortem changes in respect to the lividity of the deceased
# The scene of the death must be undisturbed before examination of the crime scene
# No third party may be present at the death to ensure no manipulation of the body
Because of the improbability that all of these requirements may be examined in one subject, cadaveric spasms are unlikely to be consistently documented and therefore proved existent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirch|first=J.|last2=Schulz|first2=Y.|last3=Klintschar|first3=M.|date=2013-09-01|title=A case of instantaneous rigor?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-013-0881-0|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine|language=en|volume=127|issue=5|pages=971–974|doi=10.1007/s00414-013-0881-0|issn=0937-9827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very minimal to no pathophysiological or scientific basis exists to support the validity of cadaveric spasms. Chemically, this phenomenon cannot be explained as being analogous to “true” rigor mortis. Therefore, a variety of other factors have been examined and explored in an effort to alternatively account for the cases of supposed instantaneous rigor mortis that have been reported. In a study reported in The International Journal of Legal Medicine, there was no consistent evidence of cadaveric spasms even in deaths of the same type. Out of 65 sharp-force suicides, only two victims still held their weapon post mortem. This low incidence rate suggests that genuine cadaveric spasm was not exhibited.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bedford|first=Paul J.|last2=Tsokos|first2=Michael|date=2013-06-01|title=The occurrence of cadaveric spasm is a myth|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-012-9391-5|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=244–248|doi=10.1007/s12024-012-9391-5|issn=1547-769X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravity may play a large factor in the trapping of limbs and other objects under the body at the time of death, and the subsequent observed placement of limbs after death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In fatalities related to cranial or neural injury, nerve damage in the brain may inhibit the ability to release a weapon from the hand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The flexion of agonist and antagonist muscles in conjunction may additionally contribute to the observed fixation of an object or weapon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

]]

The [[capital punishment|death penalty]] has been completely abolished in all [[Europe]]an countries except for [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]], the latter of which has a moratorium and has not conducted an execution since 1999. The absolute ban on the death penalty is enshrined in both the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) and two widely adopted protocols of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] of the [[Council of Europe]], and is thus considered a central value. Of all modern European countries, [[San Marino]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] were the first to abolish capital punishment, whereas only Belarus still practices capital punishment in some form or another. In 2012, [[Latvia]] became the last EU Member State to abolish capital punishment in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/International-law-abolition-protocols-ratified-last-month.html|title=International law: abolition protocols ratified last month|website=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, in Europe, the death penalty for peacetime crimes has been abolished in all countries except Belarus, while the death penalty for wartime crimes has been abolished in all countries except Belarus and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries|title=Death Penalty|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kazakhstan is a country situated partly in Europe and partly in [[Asia]]).

In [[Russia]] the death penalty has been indefinitely suspended (under [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]]), therefore is uncommon but not unheard of.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

Except for Belarus, which carried out two executions in 2018, the last executions by a European country occurred in Kazakhstan in 2003, and [[Ukraine]] in 1997.

===Legal instruments in Europe===
The [[Council of Europe]] has two main instruments against capital punishment: Protocol no.6 and Protocol no.13.

The [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=114&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.6] which prohibits the death penalty during peacetime has been ratified by all members of the Council of Europe, except Russia (which has signed, but not ratified).

[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13] prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances (including for war crimes).  All member states of the Council of Europe have ratified it, except Azerbaijan and Russia, which have not signed it, and Armenia, which has signed but not yet ratified. All have, however, abolished the death penalty. In 2014, [[Poland]] was the latest country to ratify [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol No. 13 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances CETS No.: 187] Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 21st century===
The only country in Europe that continues to execute in the 21st century is Belarus (last execution done in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/europes-east/belarus-and-ukrainan-rebels-keep-death-penalty-alive-europe-313427|title=Belarus and Ukrainan rebels keep death penalty alive in Europe|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No member of the Council of Europe has carried out executions in the 21st century. The last execution on the present day territory of the Council of Europe took place in 1997 in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205224923/http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |archivedate=5 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=20&amp;nome=ukraine|title=NTC - Bancadati|website=www.handsoffcain.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Abolition has been common in European history, but has only been a real trend since the end of the [[Second World War]] when [[human rights]] became a particular priority. The [[Kingdom of Italy]] had abolished the death penalty for civilians with the adoption of the [[Zanardelli Penal Code]] of 1889, but the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascists]] had reintroduced it with the 1930 Penal Code.

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was adopted in 1950, but some countries took many years to ratify it. The United Kingdom retained the death penalty for [[high treason]] until 1998; however, this technicality was superseded by the absolute ban on the death penalty in 1976. [[William Joyce]] was the last person to be put to death for high treason in the UK, on 3 January 1946.

A moratorium on the death penalty has been in place in Russia since 1 January 2010. According to the 19 November 2009 decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, the death penalty shall not be practiced in Russia at any time before the ratification of the above-mentioned protocol. The Constitutional Court has also clarified that the decision is not an extension of the moratorium but the abolition of the capital punishment, since it will be no longer possible to practice it legally.

2009 was the first year that no one was executed anywhere in Europe, however in March 2010 [[Belarus]] executed the last two people on its death row.&lt;ref name="Belarus 2"&gt;Phillips, Leigh (30 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29797 Europe's first ever execution-free year undone by Belarus], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union (EU) has long since been against the death penalty, supporting the European Convention, and its 2000 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] included an absolute ban on the death penalty in all circumstances. The Charter has been made legally binding by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] as it was fully ratified and became effective on 1 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6901353.stm Q&amp;A: The Lisbon Treaty] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also has a provision for the EU to join the Council of Europe and accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU has been an active promoter of abolition worldwide and has been promoting a [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty]]; however some EU member state governments such as Poland have opposed such moves.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The [[Council of Europe]] has made abolition of the death penalty a prerequisite for membership. As a result, no execution has taken place on the territory of the organisation's member states since 1997. The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] continues to monitor the capital punishment issue. The current General Rapporteur on the abolition of the death penalty for the Parliamentary Assembly is German member of parliament [[Marina Schuster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/NewsManager/EMB_NewsManagerView.asp?ID=8703&amp;L=2 PACE Rapporteurs condemn death sentence handed down in Belarus], Press release of 3 May 2013, [[Council of Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belarus==
{{main|Capital punishment in Belarus}}
The only European country that executes criminals is [[Belarus]], as that country is not party to the European Convention on Human Rights. Executions in Belarus are carried out by shooting.

==Russia==
{{main|Capital punishment in Russia}}
Capital punishment in Russia has been indefinitely suspended, although it still remains codified in its law. There exists both an implicit [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] established by the President [[Yeltsin]] in 1996, and an explicit one, established by the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] in 1999 and which was most recently reaffirmed in 2009. Russia has not executed anyone in peacetime since 1996, and in wartime since 1999.

==Kazakhstan==
{{main|Capital punishment in Kazakhstan}}
Capital punishment in Kazakhstan has been abolished for ordinary crimes, but is still permitted for crimes occurring in special circumstances (such as war crimes). Kazakhstan has not carried out any executions since 2003, and currently only one person is on death row.
Kazakhstan is not a member of the Council of Europe.

== Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
{{main|Capital punishment in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina have constitutionally abolished the death penalty, but capital punishment remains present in legal statutes, specifically in [[Republika Srpska]], Article 11. However, due to the constitutional abolition, the death penalty cannot be used.

== Separatist territories and partially recognized jurisdictions ==
In Europe there are also [[List of states with limited recognition|partially unrecognized states]]. In 2006 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe wrote that: &lt;blockquote&gt;While [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] abolished the death penalty on 1 August 2003, when it decided to implement the Republic of Armenia's new Criminal Code on its territory, the other territories, [[Abkhazia]], [[Transnistria]] and [[South Ossetia]], have not done so, retaining capital punishment in their legislation both in peacetime and in wartime. As South Ossetia decided in 1992 to make Russian legislation applicable on its territory, it has observed a moratorium on executions since 1996. The death penalty is in the Transnistrian Criminal Code which came into force in 2002. In July 1999, de facto President Smirnov ordered a moratorium on executions, and there is said to be only one prisoner on death row in Transnistria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID%3D11376%26Language%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019050451/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11376&amp;Language=en |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Abkhazia]] formalized its moratorium in 2007, moving towards full abolition. On 12 January 2007 the parliament of Abkhazia adopted a law entitled "Moratorium on the Death Penalty", establishing a moratorium on executions during peacetime. Since 1993 the country has had a ''de facto'' moratorium on executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur04/002/2007/en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been 10 sentences of death in Abkhazia, these have never been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/6148|title=UNPO: The Death Penalty Must Order its Final Meal|website=www.unpo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] retains the death penalty only for crimes committed under special circumstances (war-crimes). See also [[Capital punishment in Cyprus]].

The [[Donetsk People's Republic]] introduced the death penalty in 2014 for cases of treason, espionage, and assassination of political leaders. There had already been accusations of [[extrajudicial execution]] occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/donetsk-separatists-introduce-death-penalty-for-treason/505271.html|title=Donetsk Separatists Introduce Death Penalty for Treason|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the Goodie Mob song|Cell Therapy (song)}}
'''Cell therapy''' (also called '''cellular therapy''' or '''cytotherapy''') is [[therapy]] in which cellular material is injected into a patient;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; this generally means intact, living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. For example, [[T cell]]s capable of fighting [[cancer]] cells via [[cell-mediated immunity]] may be injected in the course of [[immunotherapy]].

Cell therapy originated in the nineteenth century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness.&lt;ref name=testicles/&gt; Although such attempts produced no positive benefit, further research found in the mid twentieth century that human cells could be used to help prevent the human body rejecting transplanted organs, leading in time to successful bone marrow transplantation.&lt;ref name=starzl/&gt;

Today two distinct categories of cell therapy are recognized.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

The first category is cell therapy in mainstream medicine. This is the subject of intense research and the basis of potential therapeutic benefit.&lt;ref name=gage/&gt; Such research can be controversial when it involves [[human embryo]]nic material.

The second category is in [[Complementary and alternative medicine|alternative medicine]], and perpetuates the practice of injecting animal materials in an attempt to cure disease. This practice, according to the [[American Cancer Society]], is not backed by any [[medical evidence]] of effectiveness, and can have deadly consequences.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; tried to stop aging by injecting animal testicle extract]]
Cell therapy can be defined as therapy in which cellular material is injected into a patient.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

There are two branches of cell therapy: one is legitimate and established, whereby human cells are transplanted from a donor to a patient; the other is dangerous [[Complementary and alternative medicine|alternative]] medicine, whereby injected animal cells are used to attempt to treat illness.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

The origins of cell therapy can perhaps be traced to the nineteenth century, when [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817–1894) injected animal testicle extracts in an attempt to stop the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=testicles&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ando.2010.01.003|title=La thérapeutique du docteur Brown-Séquard|year=2010|last1=Lefrère|first1=J.-J.|last2=Berche|first2=P.|journal=Annales d'Endocrinologie|volume=71|issue=2|pages=69–75|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/249670}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 [[Paul Niehans]] (1882–1971)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; who has been called the inventor of cell therapy&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; attempted to cure a patient by injecting material from calf embryos.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/cell-therapy|title=Cell Therapy|date=1 November 2008|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niehans claimed to have treated many people for cancer using this technique, though his claims have never been validated by research.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

In 1953 researchers found that laboratory animals could be helped not to reject organ transplants by pre-inoculating them with cells from donor animals; in 1968, in Minnesota, the first successful human bone marrow transplantation took place.&lt;ref name=starzl&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10833242|year=2000|last1=Starzl|first1=TE|title=History of clinical transplantation|volume=24|issue=7|pages=759–82|doi=10.1007/s002680010124|pmc=3091383|journal=World Journal of Surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent work, [[cell encapulation]] is pursued as a means to shield therapeutic cells from the host immune response. Recent work includes micro-encapsulating cells in a gel core surrounded by a solid, but permeable, shell.&lt;ref name="Zhou etal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zhou X, Haraldsson T, Nania S, Ribet F, Palano G, Heuchel R, Löhr M, van der Wijngaart W |title= Human Cell Encapsulation in Gel Microbeads with Cosynthesized Concentric Nanoporous Solid Shells |journal=Adv. Funct. Mater. |year=2018 |doi=10.1002/adfm.201707129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone marrow transplants have been found to be effective, along with some other kinds of human cell therapy&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for example in treating damaged knee [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; In recent times, cell therapy using human material has been recognized as an important field in the treatment of human disease.&lt;ref name=gage&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9579857|year=1998|last1=Gage|first1=FH|title=Cell therapy|volume=392|issue=6679 Suppl|pages=18–24|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental field of [[Stem cell therapy]] has shown promise for new types of treatment.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

In mainstream medicine, cell therapy is supported by a distinct healthcare industry which sees strong prospects for future growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2011.10.010|title=The Impact of Market Volatility on the Cell Therapy Industry|year=2011|last1=Brindley|first1=David A.|last2=Reeve|first2=Brock C.|last3=Sahlman|first3=William A.|last4=Bonfiglio|first4=Greg A.|last5=Davie|first5=Natasha L.|last6=Culme-Seymour|first6=Emily J.|last7=Mason|first7=Chris|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=9|issue=5|pages=397–401|pmid=22056137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=C |author2=Brindley, DA |author3=Culme-Seymour, EJ |author4=Davie, NL|title=Cell therapy industry: billion dollar global business with unlimited potential.|journal=Regenerative medicine|date=May 2011|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–72|pmid=21548728|doi=10.2217/rme.11.28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human embryonic stem cells===
{{main|Embryonic stem cell}}
Research into human embryonic stem cells is [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]], and [[Stem cell research policy|regulation]] varies from country to country, with some countries banning it outright. Nevertheless,  these cells are being investigated as the basis for a number of therapeutic applications, including possible treatments for [[diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17053790|year=2006|last1=d'Amour|first1=KA|last2=Bang|first2=AG|last3=Eliazer|first3=S|last4=Kelly|first4=OG|last5=Agulnick|first5=AD|last6=Smart|first6=NG|last7=Moorman|first7=MA|last8=Kroon|first8=E|last9=Carpenter|first9=MK|last10=Baetge|first10=EE|title=Production of pancreatic hormone-expressing endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells|volume=24|issue=11|pages=1392–401|doi=10.1038/nbt1259|journal=Nature Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17627139|year=2007|last1=Parish|first1=CL|last2=Arenas|first2=E|title=Stem-cell-based strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease|volume=4|issue=4|pages=339–47|doi=10.1159/000101892|journal=Neuro-Degenerative Diseases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanisms of Action===
Cell therapy is targeted at many clinical indications in multiple organs and by several modes of cell delivery. Accordingly, the specific mechanisms of action involved in the therapies are wide-ranging. However, there are two main principles by which cells facilitate therapeutic action:

#Stem cell or progenitor cell engraftment, differentiation, and long term replacement of damaged tissue. In this paradigm multipotent or unipotent cells differentiate into a specific cell type in the lab or after reaching the site of injury (via local or systemic administration). These cells then integrate into the site of injury, replacing damaged tissue, and thus facilitate improved function of the organ or tissue. An example of this is the use of cells to replace cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson K. A. | author2 = Majka S. M. | year = 2001 | title = Regeneration of ischemic cardiac muscle and vascular endothelium by adult stem cells | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 107 | issue = 11| pages = 1395–402 | doi=10.1172/jci12150|display-authors=etal | pmid=11390421 | pmc=209322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawada H. | author2 = Fujita J. | year = 2004 | title = Nonhematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells can be mobilized and differentiate into cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 104 | issue = 12| pages = 3581–7 | doi=10.1182/blood-2004-04-1488|display-authors=etal | pmid=15297308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Cells that have the capacity to release soluble factors such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors which act in a paracrine or endocrine manner. These factors facilitate self-healing of the organ or region. The delivered cells (via local or systemic administration) remain viable for a relatively short period (days-weeks) and then die. This includes cells that naturally secrete the relevant therapeutic factors, or which undergo epigenetic changes or genetic engineering that causes the cells to release large quantities of a specific molecule. Examples of this include cells that secrete factors which facilitate angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Deuse, T., C. Peter, et al. (2009). "Hepatocyte growth factor or vascular endothelial growth factor gene transfer maximizes mesenchymal stem cell-based myocardial salvage after acute myocardial infarction."

===Neural Stem Cell Therapy===
{{see also|Neural stem cell}}
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the subject of ongoing research for possible therapeutic applications, for example for treating a number of neurological disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref name=Bonnamain&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22514520|year=2012|last1=Bonnamain|first1=V|last2=Neveu|first2=I|last3=Naveilhan|first3=P|title=Neural stem/progenitor cells as a promising candidate for regenerative therapy of the central nervous system|volume=6|pages=17|doi=10.3389/fncel.2012.00017|pmc=3323829|journal=Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy===
{{see also|Mesenchymal stem cell}}
MSCs are immunomodulatory, multipotent and fast proliferating and these unique capabilities mean they can be used for a wide range of treatments including immune-modulatory therapy, bone and cartilage regeneration, myocardium regeneration and the treatment of [[Hurler syndrome]], a skeletal and neurological disorder.&lt;ref name="oh"&gt;Oh SKW and Choo ABH (2011) The Biological Basis | Stem Cells. In: Murray Moo-Young (ed.), Comprehensive Biotechnology, Second Edition, Volume 1, pp. 341–365. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have demonstrated the use of MSCs for the treatment of [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] (OI). Horwitz et al. transplanted bone marrow (BM) cells from [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA)-identical siblings to patients suffering from OI. Results show that MSCs can develop into normal osteoblasts, leading to fast bone development and reduced fracture frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horwitz EM, Prockop DJ, Gordon PL | year = 1999 | title = Transplantability and therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells in children with osteogenesis imperfecta | pmid = 10086387 | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 309–313 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/6529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A more recent clinical trial showed that allogeneic fetal MSCs transplanted in utero in patients with severe OI can engraft and differentiate into bone in a human fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le Blanc K, Götherström C, Ringdén O | year = 2005 | title = Fetal mesenchymal stem-cell engraftment in bone after in utero transplantation in a patient with severe osteogenesis imperfecta | url = | journal = Transplantation | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 1607–1614 | doi=10.1097/01.tp.0000159029.48678.93|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides bone and cartilage regeneration, cardiomyocyte regeneration with autologous BM MSCs has also been reported recently. Introduction of BM MSCs following [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) resulted in significant reduction of damaged regions and improvement in heart function.  Clinical trials for treatment of acute MI with Prochymal by Osiris Therapeutics are underway. Also, a clinical trial revealed huge improvements in nerve conduction velocities in Hurler’s Syndrome patients infused with BM MSCs from HLA-identical siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koç ON, Day J, Nieder M | year = 2002 | title = Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell infusion for treatment of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) and Hurler syndrome (MPS-IH) | url = | journal = Bone Marrow Transplant | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 215–222 | doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1703650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation===
{{main|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}
HSCs possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all types of blood cells, especially those involved in the human immune system. Thus, they can be used to treat blood and immune disorders. Since human bone marrow (BM) grafting was first published in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas ED, ((Lochte HL Jr)), Cannon JH | year = 1959 | title = Supralethal whole body irradiation and isologous marrow transplantation in man | journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1709–1716 | doi=10.1172/jci103949|display-authors=etal | pmid=13837954 | pmc=444138}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been significant advancements in HSCs therapy. Following that, syngeneic marrow infusion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Der Berg DJ, Sharma AK, Bruno E, Hoffman R | year = 1998 | title = Role of members of the Wnt gene family in human hematopoiesis | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 3189–3202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allogeneic marrow grafting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson A, Trumpp A | year = 2006 | title = Bone-marrow haematopoietic stem-cell niches | url = | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 93–106 | doi=10.1038/nri1779}}&lt;/ref&gt; were performed successfully. HSCs therapy can also render its cure by reconstituting damaged blood-forming cells and restoring the immune system after high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hwang WYK | year = 2004 | title = Haematopoietic graft engineering | url = | journal = Annals, Academy of Medicine, Singapore | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 551–558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of HSCT: syngeneic, autologous, and allogeneic transplants.&lt;ref name="oh" /&gt;  Syngeneic transplantations occur between identical twins. Autologous transplantations use the HSCs obtained directly from the patient and hence do not cause any complications of tissue incompatibility; whereas allogeneic transplantations involve the use of donor HSCs, either genetically related or unrelated to the recipient. To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant). Mismatch of HLA loci would result in treatment-related mortality and higher risk of acute GVHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Hwang WYK)), Ong SY | year = 2009 | title = Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation without a matched sibling donor: Current options and future potential | url = | journal = Annals, Academy of Medicine, Singapore | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 340–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to BM derived HSCs, the use of alternative sources such as umbilical cord blood (UCB) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) has been increasing. In comparison with BM derived HSCs recipients, PBSCs recipients afflicted with myeloid malignancies reported a faster engraftment and better overall survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhardwaj G, Murdoch B, Wu D | year = 2001 | title = Sonic hedgehog induces the proliferation of primitive human hematopoietic cells via BMP regulation | doi = 10.1038/84282| journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 172–180 |display-authors=etal|pmid=11175816}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this was at the expense of increased rate of GVHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Couban S, Simpson DR, Barnett MJ | year = 2002 | title = A randomized multicenter comparison of bone marrow and peripheral blood in recipients of matched sibling allogeneic transplants for myeloid malignancies | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 1525–1531 | doi=10.1182/blood-2002-01-0048|display-authors=etal | pmid=12176866}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the use of UCB requires less stringent HLA loci matching, although the time of engraftment is longer and graft failure rate is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S, Gurudutta GU, Satija NK | year = 2006 | title = Stem cell c-KIT and HOXB4 genes: Critical roles and mechanisms in self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation | url = | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 755–778 | doi=10.1089/scd.2006.15.755|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas ED, Storb R | year = 1970 | title = Technique for human marrow grafting | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 507–515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In alternative medicine==
{{see also|List of ineffective cancer treatments}}
In alternative medicine, cell therapy is defined as the injection of non-human cellular animal material in an attempt to treat illness.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; [[Quackwatch]] labels this as "senseless", since "cells from the organs of one species cannot replace the cells from the organs of other species" and because a number of serious adverse effects have been reported.&lt;ref name=qw&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/cellular.html
|title=Cellular Therapy
|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.
|date=21 August 2003
|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]
|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of this alternative, animal-based form of cell therapy, the [[American Cancer Society]] say: "Available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. It may in fact be lethal ...".&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

'''César Fernándo Basa''' (1915 &amp;ndash; December 12, 1941) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[aviator|pilot]] and  [[World War II]] hero. Born in 1915, he was one of the pioneer fighter pilots of the [[Philippine Air Force]] and the first Filipino fighter pilot casualty during World War II.

==Death==
Basa's fight took place at [[Batangas]] Field on the morning of December 12, 1941 when 27 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] bombers and 17 fighter escorts raided the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippine Air Force History|url=http://www.paf.mil.ph/updatedhistory.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429051016/http://www.paf.mil.ph/updatedhistory.html|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Filipino fighter pilots on [[Boeing P-26 Peashooter|Curtiss P-26A "Peashooter"]] fighter planes, led by Captain [[Jesús Villamor]], engaged the numerically superior enemy in aerial combat at {{convert|12000|ft|m}}.

Several dogfights ensued as Villamor and his men fought desperately to prevent the pack of bombers and their fighter escorts from reaching and bombing Batangas Field.

Lieutenant Basa, who was already two hours airborne on an air reconnaissance mission, rushed to the scene and attempted to join the aerial engagement with only 15 minutes worth of fuel left on his P-26. While still half the distance away, he was intercepted by seven Japanese fighters and shot down. Although he was able to bail out, he was strafed and killed by machine-gun fire from the [[A6M Zero]] fighters while dangling helplessly from his parachute. This made him the first Filipino fighter pilot casualty of war killed in air combat.

Captain Villamor and his pilots won the battle, with the only casualty being Basa. In recognition of his heroism, Lieutenant Basa was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Silver Star]].

==Honors==
[[Basa Air Base]] in [[Floridablanca, Pampanga|Floridablanca]], [[Pampanga]], Philippines is named in his honor.

'''Data science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract [[knowledge]] and insights from [[data]] in various forms, both structured and unstructured,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dhar | first1 = V. | title = Data science and prediction | doi = 10.1145/2500499 | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 56 | issue = 12 | pages = 64 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/12/169933-data-science-and-prediction/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/12/the-key-word-in-data-science-is-not-data-it-is-science/ | title=The key word in "Data Science" is not Data, it is Science | publisher=Simply Statistics | date=2013-12-12 | author=Jeff Leek }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[data mining]].

Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.&lt;ref name="Hayashi" /&gt; It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[information science]], and [[computer science]].

[[Turing award]] winner [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science ([[Empirical research|empirical]], [[Basic research|theoretical]], [[computational science|computational]] and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the [[information explosion|data deluge]].&lt;ref name="TansleyTolle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stewart Tansley|author2=Kristin Michele Tolle|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs_AQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft Research|isbn=978-0-9825442-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BellHey2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=G.|last2=Hey|first2=T.|last3=Szalay|first3=A.|title=COMPUTER SCIENCE: Beyond the Data Deluge|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5919|year=2009|pages=1297–1298|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1170411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, when [[Harvard Business Review]] called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt; the term "data science" became a [[buzzword]].  It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like [[business analytics]],&lt;ref name="GilPress" /&gt; [[business intelligence]], [[Predictive modelling|predictive modeling]], and [[statistics]].  Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing [[Hans Rosling]], featured in a [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgq0l 2011 BBC documentary] with the quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/business/03stream.html|title=When the Data Struts Its Stuff|first=Natasha|last=Singer|date=2011-04-02|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nate Silver]] referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.&lt;ref name="NateSilver" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;   In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness."&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/data-science-terminology.html|title=Why the term "data science" is flawed but useful|last=Warden|first=Pete|date=2011-05-09|work=O'Reilly Radar|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.&lt;ref name="GilPress" /&gt; To its discredit, however, many data-science and [[big data|big-data]] projects fail to deliver useful results, often as a result of poor management and utilization of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2018/01/are-you-setting-your-data-scientists-up-to-fail|title=Are You Setting Your Data Scientists Up to Fail?|date=2018-01-25|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/16839/70-of-big-data-projects-in-uk-fail-to-realise-full-potential|title=70% of Big Data projects in UK fail to realise full potential|website=www.consultancy.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://analytics-magazine.org/the-data-economy-why-do-so-many-analytics-projects-fail/|title=The Data Economy: Why do so many analytics projects fail? – Analytics Magazine|date=2014-07-07|work=Analytics Magazine|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/data-science-4-reasons-failing-deliver.html|title=Data Science: 4 Reasons Why Most Are Failing to Deliver|website=www.kdnuggets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "data science" has appeared in various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently. In an early usage, it was used as a substitute for [[computer science]] by [[Peter Naur]] in 1960. Naur later introduced the term "[[datalogy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naur|first1=Peter|title=The science of datalogy|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 July 1966|volume=9|issue=7|pages=485|doi=10.1145/365719.366510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Naur published ''Concise Survey of Computer Methods'', which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications.

In 1996, members of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) met in Kobe for their biennial conference. Here, for the first time, the term data science is included in the title of the conference ("Data Science, classification, and related methods"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/05/28/a-very-short-history-of-data-science/|title=A Very Short History Of Data Science|first=Gil|last=Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the term was introduced in a roundtable discussion by Chikio Hayashi.&lt;ref name="Hayashi"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-65950-1_3|url=https://www.springer.com/book/9784431702085|title=Data Science, Classification, and Related Methods|last=Hayashi|first=Chikio|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Springer Japan|isbn=9784431702085|editor-last=Hayashi|editor-first=Chikio|series=Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization|location=|pages=40–51|language=en|chapter=What is Data Science?

In November 1997, [[C.F. Jeff Wu]] gave the inaugural lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?"&lt;ref name="cfjwutk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=C. F. J. (1997)|title=Statistics = Data Science?|url=http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/presentations/datascience.pdf|

Carver Professorship at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="cfjwu01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Identity of statistics in science examined|publisher=The University Records, 9 November 1997, The University of Michigan|url=http://ur.umich.edu/9899/Nov09_98/4.htm|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this lecture, he characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection, data modeling and analysis, and decision making. In his conclusion,
he initiated the modern, non-computer science, usage of the term "data science" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians data scientists.&lt;ref name="cfjwutk"/&gt;
Later, he presented his lecture entitled "Statistics = Data Science?" as the first of his 1998 P.C. Mahalanobis Memorial Lectures.&lt;ref name="cfjwu02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isical.ac.in/~statmath/html/pcm/pcm_recent.html|title=P.C.

In 2001, William S. Cleveland introduced data science as an independent discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate "advances in computing with data" in his article "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics," which was published in Volume 69, No. 1, of the April 2001 edition of the International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique.&lt;ref name="cleveland01"&gt;Cleveland, W. S. (2001). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/915c/d8e2b39eb02723553913d592b2237d4d9960.pdf Data science: an action plan for expanding the technical areas of the field of statistics]. International Statistical Review / Revue Internationale de Statistique, 21–26&lt;/ref&gt; In his report, Cleveland establishes six technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science: multidisciplinary investigations, models and methods for data, computing with data, pedagogy, tool evaluation, and theory.

The journal was largely devoted to the application of statistical methods and quantitative research. In 2005, The National Science Board published "Long-lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century" defining data scientists as "the information and computer scientists, database and software and programmers, disciplinary experts, curators and expert annotators, librarians, archivists, and others, who are crucial to the successful management of a digital data collection" whose primary activity is to "conduct creative inquiry and analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Science Board|title=Long-Lived Digital Data Collections Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century|url=http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2005/nsb0540/|publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 [[Harvard Business Review]] article "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/|title=Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]|first1=Thomas H.|last1=Davenport|authorlink1=Thomas H.

He asserts that a data scientist is "a new breed", and that a "shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors", but describes a much more business-oriented role.

In 2013, the IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsaa.co|title=IEEE Task Force on Data Science and Advanced Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched.

==Relationship to statistics==
The popularity of the term "data science" has exploded in business environments and academia, as indicated by a jump in job openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/21/data-science-white-hot/|title=Data science is still white hot, but nothing lasts forever|last=Darrow|first=Barb|date=May 21, 2015|work=Fortune|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many critical academics and journalists see no distinction between data science and [[statistics]]. Writing in [[Forbes]], Gil Press argues that data science is a [[buzzword]] without a clear definition and has simply replaced “[[business analytics]]” in contexts such as graduate degree programs.&lt;ref name="GilPress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Science: What's The Half-Life Of A Buzzword?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/08/19/data-science-whats-the-half-life-of-a-buzzword/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the question-and-answer section of his keynote address at the Joint Statistical Meetings of [[American Statistical Association]], noted applied statistician [[Nate Silver]] said, “I think data-scientist is a sexed up term for a statistician....Statistics is a branch of science. Data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldn’t berate the term statistician.”&lt;ref name="NateSilver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nate Silver: What I need from statisticians|url=http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5133141/Nate-Silver-What-I-need-from-statisticians.html|date=23 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in business sector, multiple researchers and analysts state that data scientists alone are far from being sufficient in granting companies a real competitive advantage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Steven|date=2014-04-10|title=Collaborative Approaches Needed to Close the Big Data Skills Gap|url=http://www.jorgdesign.net/article/view/9823|journal=Journal of Organization Design|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=26–30|doi=10.7146/jod.9823|issn=2245-408X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consider data scientists as only one of the four greater job families companies require to leverage big data effectively, namely: data analysts, data scientists, big data [[Software Developer|developers]] and big data [[Software engineer|engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Mauro|first=Andrea|last2=Greco|first2=Marco|last3=Grimaldi|first3=Michele|last4=Ritala|first4=Paavo|title=Human resources for Big Data professions: A systematic classification of job roles and required skill sets|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306457317300018|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2017.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, responses to criticism are as numerous. In a 2014 [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] article, Irving Wladawsky-Berger compares the data science enthusiasm with the dawn of [[computer science]]. He argues data science, like any other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field, employs [[Methodology|methodologies]] and practices from across the [[Academy|academia]] and [[industry]], but then it will morph them into a new [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]]. He brings to attention the sharp criticisms computer science, now a well respected academic discipline, had to once face.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/05/02/why-do-we-need-data-science-when-weve-had-statistics-for-centuries/|title=Why Do We Need Data Science When We’ve Had Statistics for Centuries?|last=Wladawsky-Berger|first=Irving|date=May 2, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[New York University|NYU]] [[NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights|Stern's]] Vasant Dhar, as do many other academic proponents of data science,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; argues more specifically in December 2013 that data science is different from the existing practice of data analysis across all [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]], which focuses only on explaining [[data set]]s. Data science seeks actionable and consistent [[Pattern recognition|pattern]] for [[Predictive modelling|predictive uses]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This practical engineering goal takes data science beyond traditional [[analytics]]. Now the data in those disciplines and [[Applied science|applied fields]] that lacked solid [[Theory|theories]], like [[health science]] and [[social science]], could be sought and utilized to generate powerful predictive models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In an effort similar to Dhar's, Stanford professor [[David Donoho]], in September 2015, takes the proposition further by rejecting three simplistic and misleading definitions of data science in lieu of criticisms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donoho|first=David|date=September 2015|title=50 Years of Data Science|url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf|journal=Based on a talk at Tukey Centennial workshop, Princeton NJ Sept 18 2015|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, for Donoho, data science does not equate to [[big data]], in that the size of the data set is not a criterion to distinguish data science and statistics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Second, data science is not defined by the [[computing]] skills of sorting big data sets, in that these skills are already generally used for analyses across all disciplines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Third, data science is a heavily applied field where [[Graduate school|academic programs]] right now do not sufficiently prepare data scientists for the jobs, in that many [[Graduate school|graduate programs]] misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Culture of Big Data|last=Barlow|first=Mike|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[statistician]], [[David Donoho|Donoho]], following many in his field, champions the broadening of learning scope in the form of data science,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; like John Chambers who urges statisticians to adopt an inclusive concept of learning from data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=John M.|date=1993-12-01|title=Greater or lesser statistics: a choice for future research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00141776|journal=Statistics and Computing|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=182–184|doi=10.1007/BF00141776|issn=0960-3174}}&lt;/ref&gt; or like William Cleveland who urges to prioritize extracting from data applicable [[Predictive modelling|predictive tools]] over [[Explanatory model|explanatory theories.]]&lt;ref name="cleveland01" /&gt; Together, these [[statistician]]s envision an increasingly inclusive applied field that grows out of traditional [[statistics]] and beyond.

For the future of data science, Donoho projects an ever-growing environment for [[open science]] where data sets used for [[Academic publishing|academic publications]] are accessible to all researchers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[National Institutes of Health|US National Institute of Health]] has already announced plans to enhance reproducibility and transparency of research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|last2=Tabak|first2=Lawrence A.|date=2014-01-30|title=NIH plans to enhance reproducibility|journal=Nature|volume=505|issue=7485|pages=612–613|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4058759|pmid=24482835|doi=10.1038/505612a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other big [[Academic journal|journals]] are likewise following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNutt|first=Marcia|date=2014-01-17|title=Reproducibility|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/229|journal=Science|language=en|volume=343|issue=6168|pages=229–229|doi=10.1126/science.1250475|issn=0036-8075|pmid=24436391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peng|first=Roger D.|date=2009-07-01|title=Reproducible research and Biostatistics|url=https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/10/3/405/293660|journal=Biostatistics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=405–408|doi=10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014|issn=1465-4644}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the future of data science not only exceeds the boundary of [[Statistical theory|statistical theories]] in scale and methodology, but data science will revolutionize current academia and [[Paradigm|research paradigms]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As Donoho concludes, "the scope and impact of data science will continue to expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1188">'''Desmoschisis''' is asexual reproduction in [[dinoflagellate]]s which the parent cell divides to produce two [[daughter cell]]s, each daughter retaining half the parent [[theca]], at least temporarily. During desmoschisis, the theca undergoes fission along a predetermined suture between thecal plates. The fission suture is oblique, usually from the top left to the bottom right (as in oblique binary fission).&lt;ref&gt;FENSOME R.A., TAYLOR F.J.R., NORRIS G., SARJEANT W.A.S., WHARTON D.I. &amp; WILLIAMS G.L. 1993.

'''Eric Henry Chalmers''' (29 November 1900 – 14 September 1930) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with {{WAFL SF}} in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL) and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Born on 29 November 1900 in Victoria, Chalmers was one of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38515366 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth |date=25 September 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their maternal grandfather was a Scottish blacksmith, from [[Dundee]], who came to [[Clunes, Victoria]] in 1854 to search for gold.&lt;ref name=FremantleHerald&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heraldonlinejournal.com/2013/10/04/foundry-forges-maritime-history/|title=Foundry forges maritime history|last=Amalfi|first=Carmelo|date=4 October 2013|work=Fremantle Herald Interactive|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, Alexander James Chalmers (known as James), was a wheat farmer, who moved the family to [[Fremantle]], Western Australia soon after Eric's birth.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58705398 |title=Prominent Portite. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=8 October 1933 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=20 Section: First Section |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Chalmers became well known in the area as the proprietor of the Fremantle Foundry and later became a local councillor.&lt;ref name=FremantleHerald/&gt; In his younger years, Chalmers had been a [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] footballer.&lt;ref name=SundayTimes/&gt;

Christina Frances Chalmers, Eric's mother, died in 1917, as did one of his brothers William Fraser Chalmers, killed in action on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81025858 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=14 May 1917 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=2 Edition: Third Edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1647658 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=7 September 1917 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not playing football, Chalmers worked as an engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33349468 |title=The Late Mr. E. H. Chalmers. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=17 September 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football career===
Chalmers started his football career in the [[West Australian Football League]], where he played for [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]], as a [[Follower (Australian rules football)|rover]] and in the forward-line.&lt;ref name=Chatter&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article84743301 |title=Chatter. |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=22 April 1921 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=3 Edition: Third Edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article84247871 |title=Movements of Players. |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=25 April 1924 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=3 Edition: Third Edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from the juniors in 1921, Chalmers played senior football for South Fremantle until 1924, when he was cleared to Richmond at the beginning of the [[1924 VFL season]].&lt;ref name=Chatter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136620868 |title=Australian Football is spreading. |newspaper=[[The Referee (newspaper)|Referee]] |location=Sydney |date=7 May 1924 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers, who wore number 23 for Richmond, debuted in round two against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Corio Oval]] and played five further senior games in what would be his only season of VFL football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmesby|first=Russell|last2=Main|first2=Jim|title=The Encyclopedia Of AFL Footballers| publisher=BAS Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781920910785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/E/Eric_Chalmers_gm.html|title=Eric Chalmers – Games Played|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejoined South Fremantle midway through the [[1926 WAFL season]] and played for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31935480 |title=Club Jottings. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=9 July 1926 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stabbing death===
[[File:Sandpatchwestperth.png|thumb|right|The "sand patch" on Fitzgerald Street]]
On the night of 13 September 1930, Chalmers was stabbed during a confrontation with a 55-year-old hawker, Maurice Alexander, near West Perth's Clarendon Hotel, in an area known locally as the "sand patch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79468869 |title=Stabbed to Death. |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=15 September 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=1 Edition: Home Final Edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the night, Chalmers had eaten dinner at the hotel and it was there that he met George Maloney, with whom he walked to the sand patch, a vacant block on Fitzgerald Street.&lt;ref name=Fatal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58398860 |title=Fatal Stabbing Affray. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=21 September 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were there to search for Maloney's hat, which had been lost when Maloney was involved in a fight that afternoon, with a man named Bob Brown.&lt;ref name=DailyNews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79468690 |title=It's all right; They won't squeak!". |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=3 October 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=1 Edition: Home (Final) Edition|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the scene, Chalmers began talking to Alexander, who had an adjoining property, which they both headed to.&lt;ref name=DailyNews/&gt; Maloney eventually gave up on finding his hat and went over to Chalmers, who was by then involved in a fight with Alexander on the verandah.&lt;ref name=WestAustralian&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33249647 |title=Stabbing Tragedy. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=14 October 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maloney intervened and was stabbed by Alexander with a table knife, along with Chalmers.&lt;ref name=WestAustralian/&gt; Both Chalmers and Maloney, the latter with non life-threatening injuries, fled towards the Clarendon Hotel, where they were given medical assistance by the manager, before being taken to hospital.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;

At the hospital, Chalmers made a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]], in which he identified Alexander as the man who stabbed him.&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75485600 |title=Says it was Justifiable. |newspaper=[[The Mirror (Western Australia)|The Mirror]] |location=Perth |date=4 October 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers, who had suffered wounds to his arm and abdomen, died of his injuries the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21583463 |title=Perth Crime. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |location=Qld. |date=15 September 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to six year imprisonment, which was less than would have been imposed had the jury not recommended mercy, on account of "extreme provocation".&lt;ref name=WestAustralian/&gt; It was argued by the crown by Chalmers had struck Alexander because he believed he was "behaving indecently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29817099 |title=Gaol for Manslaughter. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=14 October 1930 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, Chalmers had been employed as a foreman with [[Shell Oil]], a job he had held since returning to Western Australia.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;

The PSP version of EyePet was released on 2 November 2010.

The game uses the camera to allow a [[virtual pet]] to interact with people and objects in the real world. Using [[augmented reality]], the simian, [[gremlin]]-like creature appears to be aware of its environment and surroundings and reacts to them accordingly. The player can place objects in front of the animal and the game will interpret what the object is and respond to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5039467/eyepet-brings-virtual-monchichis-to-playstation-3|title=EyePet Brings Virtual Monchichis To PlayStation 3|publisher=Kotaku|author=Michael McWhertor|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the player rolls a ball towards it, it will jump out of the way to avoid being hurt. It will also react to the player's actions and sound allowing the user to, for example, tickle the animal or clap their hands to startle it. A trailer shown at E3 2009 shows the pet being customized with outfits and colored fur and interacting with virtual objects including a trampoline and bubble machine. The trailers also demonstrate users drawing custom objects (first trailer shows a car, E3 2009 trailer shows an airplane) which are scanned by the camera and converted to virtual objects which the pet can then interact with. The pet can also be fed, as in the trailers, it is shown eating [[cookies]] and a type of [[pet food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=20 August 2008 |title=PlayStation Eye + EyePet=Who needs real pets? |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/08/20/playstation-eye-eyepet-who-needs-real-pets/ |publisher=SCEE via Joystiq |accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Eurogamer]] scored the original ''EyePet'' 6 out of 10. Reviewer Dan Whitehead, praised the game as "a showcase of what console cameras and motion-sensing is capable of" initially commenting how convincing the illusion of seeing the [[Computer graphics|CG]] creature in the real world. However, this illusion is often spoiled by "clumsy" gameplay mechanics. Whitehead also criticised the sometimes vague instructions and a lack of feedback provided when the player fails to carry out an instruction properly. IGN gave the game an 8.0 calling it a game that runs smoothly and has a look that can't be beat.

Born in [[Campeche, Campeche]] as Francisco Garcia Escalante, He first gained attention as a dancer in [[vedette (entertainer)in |vedette]] shows, held at the famous "Blanquita" theater, some of which included a [[transvestite]]s' ballet. 
His first mainstream breakthrough was in the said theater during the casting for a movie called "Bellas de noche" (1975) where he was given a role, resulting in him later getting his own show at the Blanquita called "Francis, la fantasia hecha mujer"  ( Francis, fantasy becomes a woman ) which successfully ran for 17 years, he also performed in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] at the theater "Los Pinos", which was the home of his touring shows. He was an actor, comedian, singer, lip-syncher and choreographer/dancer.

During his theater and T.V. shows, he impersonated famous Latin female singers such as Colombian [[Shakira]], Spaniard [[Rocío Dúrcal]] and Mexicans [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Alejandra Guzmán]], and [[Lupita D'Alessio]] as well as doing stand up comedy and Vegas style dancing numbers.

Fashion designer Mitzi, a long-time friend, credits Garcia with helping him during his time of need and aiding to start his design empire.

He was a beloved public personality in Mexican showbiz and appeared in several movies, telenovelas, variety shows and broadcasts of his theater comedy shows, most notable was his stage persona as a female impersonator during a time when Mexican society was very close-minded and homosexuality was considered a minor crime, he was the first openly gay celebrity in the country and a passionate activist for equality and human and gay rights till his death.
During his lifetime he was relentlessly questioned if he ever wanted to surgically become a woman, which he vehemently denied quoting religious beliefs and jokingly expressing that in today's society, he'd rather get surgery to make his penis bigger, as women are more popular with "something extra" down there...

He never had feminisation surgeries, he did however have rhinoplasty to help him achieve his famed [[Lupita D'Alessio]] characterization which was highly acclaimed.

Garcia died of a [[lung]] [[thrombosis]] in a [[Mexico City]] hospital on October 10, 2007. He was 49 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">'''Funerary texts''' or '''funerary literature''' feature in many belief systems. Its purpose is usually to provide guidance to the newly deceased or the soon-to-be-deceased about how to survive and prosper in the afterlife.

==Antiquity==
{{main article|Ancient Egyptian funerary texts}}
The most famous example of funerary literature is that of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, whose ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' was buried with the deceased to guide him or her through the various trials that would be encountered before being allowed into the afterlife. The ''Book of the Dead'' followed a tradition of Egyptian funerary literature that dated back as far as the 26th century BC.

Similar practices were followed by followers of the cult of [[Orpheus]], who lived in southern [[Italy]] and [[Crete]] in the 6th&amp;ndash;1st century BC. Their dead were buried with gold plates or laminae on which were inscribed directions about the afterlife.

==Medieval==

[[Tibetan Buddhists]] still make use of the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' (also known as ""Tibetan Book of the Dead"", dating to ca. the 8th century), which describes the experiences of the mind after death. It is recited by [[lama]]s over a dying or recently deceased person, or sometimes over an effigy of the deceased.

[[Pure Land Buddhists]] regularly recite the ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]'', which describes the Buddha [[Amitabha]] and Sukhavati, the Western Pure Land, in brief detail. It is ordinarily recited at funerals or at memorial services.

In late 15th-century [[Europe]], the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'' ("The Art of Dying Well") became one of the most popular and widely circulated early printed books. It was published in [[Germany]] around 1470 as a guide to how to meet Death and avoid the temptations (Impatience, Pride, Avarice, etc.) that would consign a soul to [[purgatory]] or, worse, to [[hell]].

The ''Funeral Oration'' ([[:hu:Halotti beszéd|Halotti beszéd]]) is the oldest extant record of the [[Hungarian language]], dating back to 1192–1195. ([http://mek.oszk.hu/01900/01955/html/index282.html], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060210154349/http://users.tpg.com.au/etr/oldhu/halotti.html])

A '''holonic map''' is a [[fractal]] map of [[perceptions]] represented as [[Holon (philosophy)|holons]], forming a [[holarchy]] of perceptual [[information]]. Within a holonic map each ''object of perception'', colloquially referred to as a 'thought' or a 'thing', is represented by a holon, which can contain other holons.

The holonic map is able to store and communicate [[subjective experience|subjective]] and [[inter-subjective]] information, and therefore by function of the [[human nervous system]] abstractions of 'objective' information.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Korzybski, ''Selections from Science and Sanity'', 2010, {{ISBN|9780982755914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any perceptual object of [[attention]] can potentially be represented as a holon within a holonic map.

==History==
The concept of a ''holonic map'' and ''holonic mapping'' was invented in 2011 by [[Chris Larcombe]] in an attempt to bring [[systems thinking]] to a wider audience, in addition to providing a platform for expanding individual and collective perception of the environment through the process of sharing perceptions.

In the same year the holonic map was subsequently implemented by Larcombe in the form of a web-based [[#chm|collaborative holonic mapping]] technology initially known as ''Waysphere'',&lt;ref&gt;Larcombe, C. G. (2012, January). Introducing Waysphere: Holonic Social Mapping for Human Beings [Video file].&lt;/ref&gt; allowing perceptions to be shared over the internet.

==Mapping systems==
A holonic map can be used to map any whole system or sub-system, since its structure appears to mirror the geometry of natural energetic systems, as ''perceived by'' the human brain: the ''observer-dependence'' of what constitutes a system has been noted within early [[cybernetics]] research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Ross Ashby|Ashby, William Ross]]|title=Design for a Brain|isbn=978-0412200908|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|date= 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; while modern research into the human brain has revealed a fractal holarchical structure in the [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jeff Hawkins]]|title=[[On Intelligence]]|isbn=978-0805078534|publisher=Owl Books|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborative holonic mapping==
A single holonic map can be co-created by multiple individuals simultaneously in a [[collaborative mapping]] process. When multiple individuals are creating a single map in collaboration, the process can be referred to as collaborative holonic mapping, or holonic [[collaborative mapping]].

Most generally, a holonic map co-created by multiple individuals is used to map and represent [[consensus reality]]; that which is inter-subjective. In practice a collaborative holonic map is typically focused on something specific, such as a co-created project, resource, topic, time-line of events, etc.

==Holonic mapping technology==
A holonic map can be implemented in a digital, technological form, such as in [[Noomap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noomap.com |title=Coming 2015 |publisher=Noomap |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huberta''' (initially named '''Hubert'''; the gender was discovered after death) was a [[hippopotamus]] and one of the most famous [[animal]]s in [[South Africa]]n history.&lt;ref name=kronos&gt;{{cite journal|title=The making of an animal biography: Huberta's journey into South African natural history, 1928-1932|author=Witz, Leslie|year=2004|journal=Kronos|volume=30|pages=138–166|jstor=41056519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1928, Huberta left her [[Depression (geology)|waterhole]] in the [[St. Lucia Estuary]] in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] and set off on the {{convert|1000|mile|order=flip}} journey to the [[Eastern Cape]], a journey which took her three years. In that time, Huberta became a minor celebrity in South Africa and attracted crowds wherever she went. She was initially thought to be a male and was nicknamed Hubert by the press. The first report in the press was on 23 November 1928 in the ''Natal Mercury'' and reported the appearance of a hippo in [[Natal (province)|Natal]]. The report was accompanied by the only photograph of Huberta in life.&lt;ref name=kronos /&gt;

Huberta stopped for a while at the mouth of the [[Mhlanga River]] about {{convert|15|km}} north of Durban and a failed attempt was made to capture her and put her in [[Johannesburg Zoo]]. After this, she headed south to [[Durban]] where she visited a beach and a [[country club]]. Moving on to the [[Umgeni River]], she became revered by [[Zulus]] and [[Xhosas]] alike.

Finally, Huberta arrived in [[East London, South Africa|East London]] in March 1931. Despite her having been declared ''royal game'' (and thus protected) by the [[Natal Provincial Council]], she was shot by farmers a month later. After a public outcry, the farmers were arrested and fined £25. Huberta's body was recovered and sent to a taxidermist in [[London]]. Upon her return to South Africa in 1932, she was greeted by 20,000 people and was displayed at the [[Amathole Museum]] (previously known as the Kaffrarian Museum) in [[King William's Town]].

Huberta is the subject of the children's book ''Hubert The Traveling Hippopotamus'' by Edmund Lindop and illustrated by Jane Carlson. The book was published in 1961 by [[Little, Brown and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Lindop |first1=Edmund |last2=Carlson|first2=Jane |title=Hubert, the Traveling Hippopotamus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbUbGQAACAAJ|year=1961|publisher=Little, Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joel Barlow''' (March 24, 1754 – December 26, 1812) was an American poet and diplomat, and French politician. &lt;ref&gt;Modern biographies are James Woodress, ''A Yankee's Odyssey: The Life of Joel Barlow'', 1958, and Samuel Bernstein, ''Joel Barlow: A Connecticut Yankee in an Age of Revolution'', 1985; an essay on Barlow's ruminations on the planetary [[hydrological cycle]] is part of [[Simon Schama]], ''Landscape and Memory'' 1995:245ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In politics, he supported the [[French Revolution]] and was an ardent [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] republican.

He worked as an agent for American speculator [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]] to set up the [[Scioto Company]] in [[Paris]] in 1788, and to sell worthless deeds to land in the [[Northwest Territory]] which it did not own. Scholars believe that he did not know the transactions were fraudulent. He stayed in Paris, becoming involved in the French Revolution. He was elected to the Assembly and given French citizenship in 1792.

In his own time, Barlow was known especially for the epic poem ''[[The Columbiad|Vision of Columbus]]'' (1807),&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;Brian Pelanda, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1941506 Declarations of Cultural Independence: The Nationalistic Imperative Behind the Passage of Early American Copyright Laws, 1783-1787], ''[[Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A.]]'' Vol. 58 (2011), pp. 431, 442-448 .&lt;/ref&gt; though modern readers rank ''[[The Hasty-Pudding]]'' (1793) more highly. 

As American consul at Algiers, he helped draft the [[Treaty of Tripoli]] in 1796, to end the attacks of Barbary pirates of North Africa city states. The treaty includes the phrase: "the Government of the [[United States|United States of America]] is not, in any sense, founded on the [[Christianity|Christian religion]]".&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;Boston, Rob, "[http://candst.tripod.com/boston4.htm Joel Barlow And The Treaty With Tripoli: A Tangled Tale Of Pirates, A Poet And The True Meaning Of The First Amendment]", ''Church &amp; State,'' Volume 50, No. 6, June 1997, pp 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as US Minister to France, from 1811 to his death on December 26, 1812 in [[Żarnowiec, Silesian Voivodeship|Żarnowiec]], Poland.

==Biography==
Barlow was born in [[Redding, Connecticut|Redding]], [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]]. He briefly attended [[Dartmouth College]] before he graduated from [[Yale University|Yale College]] in 1778, where he continued for two years as a postgraduate student. In 1778, he published an anti-slavery poem entitled "The Prospect of Peace". 

Barlow was an ardent [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]] in the [[American Revolution]]. He was engaged in the [[Battle of Long Island]] and served as a chaplain for the 4th Massachusetts Brigade from September 1780 until the close of the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name="goetzmann142"&gt;Goetzmann, William H. (2009) ''Beyond the Revolution: A History of American Thought from Paine to Pragmatism'', New York: Basic Books, Perseus Books Group, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schama observes that "he had found schoolmastering too humdrum, Yale too sober, and a chaplaincy to a Massachusetts regiment of the line during the American Revolution had not survived his natural irreverence" (Schama 1995:248).&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] &lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment and Freemasonry", Commonwealth Books. http://www.thomasjeffersonsenlightenment.org/Freemasonry.html&lt;/ref&gt; and he became a good friend to [[Thomas Paine]].

In 1783, Barlow moved to [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. In July 1784, he established a weekly paper called ''[[American Mercury]]'', with which he was connected for a year. After "reading the law" in an established office, in 1786 he was admitted to the bar. In Hartford, Barlow became a member of a group of young writers including [[Lemuel Hopkins]], [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]], and [[John Trumbull]], known in American literary history as the "[[Hartford Wits]]". He contributed to the ''Anarchiad'', a series of satirico-political papers. In 1787, he published a long and ambitious poem, ''The Vision of Columbus'',&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt; which gave him a considerable literary reputation and was once much read.

==Land speculator==

In 1788, he went to France as the agent of Colonel [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]] and the [[Scioto Land Company]], which had been registered in [[Paris]] the year before. He was to sell lands in part of the newly organized [[Northwest Territory]] (this section is now in Ohio), and recruit immigrants for new settlements. He seems to have been ignorant of the fraudulent character of the company, which did not hold title to the lands it sold and failed disastrously in 1790. He had previously recruited a group of French to emigrate to America. Known as the French 500, most of them were among the founders of [[Gallipolis, Ohio]], the second oldest European-American city founded in the new Northwest Territory.&lt;ref name="hometown"&gt;[https://www.ohiomagazine.com/ohio-life/article/best-hometowns-2013-gallipolis John Gladden, "Best Hometowns 2012: Gallipolis"], ''Ohio Magazine'', November 2012; accessed 06 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

==French politics and citizenship==
In [[Paris]], Barlow became a liberal in religion and an advanced republican in politics. He believed that "American civilization was world civilization", and was enthusiastic about the cause of world republicanism. He became involved with the [[French Revolution]], going so far as to be elected to the French Assembly, and being granted [[French citizenship]] in 1792.&lt;ref name="goetzmann144"/&gt; Although he dedicated his "Vision of Columbus" to [[Louis XVI]], he joined royal opponents in calling for the execution of the king.&lt;ref name="goetzmann144"&gt;Goetzmann (2009) ''Beyond the Revolution'', p144.&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow helped [[Thomas Paine]] publish the first part of ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' while Paine was imprisoned during [[The Reign of Terror]] in France.

Barlow remained abroad for several years, spending much of his time in London. There he was a member of the [[London Society for Constitutional Information]]. He also published various radical essays, including a volume entitled ''Advice to the Privileged Orders'' (1792). This was proscribed by the British government.

==Diplomacy==
Barlow was appointed as American consul at [[Algiers]] in 1795-1797, during the period when [[Barbary pirates]] were preying on United States and European shipping. He used State Department funds for bribes and ransoms to free more than 100 American merchant sailors held by pirates. He helped negotiate treaties with the Barbary states of Algiers, [[Tripoli]], and Tunis to avert future seizures of American ships.&lt;ref&gt;Peter P. Hill, ''Joel Barlow: American Diplomat and Nation Builder'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the United States in 1805, where he lived in the national capital at his mansion, known as [[Kalorama, Washington, D.C.|Kalorama]], now the name of a neighborhood in Northwest [[Washington, D.C.]].

In 1811, Barlow was appointed as [[United States Ambassador to France|U.S. Minister to France]]; he sailed across the Atlantic on the ''[[USS Constitution]]''. His task was to negotiate an end to the [[Berlin Decree]] and the [[Milan Decree]], as well as obtain the release of American ships and crews held by the French during the Napoleonic wars.&lt;ref name="somers"/&gt; In October 1812, Barlow set off for [[Vilnius]] to negotiate a treaty with the French foreign minister, who was based in [[Lithuania]] to prepare for the [[French invasion of Russia]]. By the time he arrived, the French army was already in full retreat from [[Moscow]]. 

Barlow chose to take the southerly route to return to Paris, by way of [[Kraków|Krakow]] and [[Vienna]]. He became ill and died of [[pneumonia]] on December 26, 1812 in the Polish village of [[Żarnowiec, Silesian Voivodeship|Żarnowiec]].&lt;ref name="somers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sommers|first1=William|title=American Writers Who Were Diplomats: Joel Barlow|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0106/ca/sommers_barlow.html|website=American Diplomacy|publisher=American Diplomacy Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monument was later erected to him there.

==Poetry==
In 1807, he published the epic ''Columbiad'', an extended edition of his ''Vision of Columbus''. It added to his reputation in some quarters, but on the whole it was not well received. It has subsequently been much ridiculed. &lt;!-- Why? --&gt;

The poem for which he is now best known is his mock heroic ''The Hasty-Pudding'' (1793), first published in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' and now a standard item in literary anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemay|first=J. A.

He continued writing political essays, publishing ''Political Writings of Joel Barlow'' (2nd ed., 1796) and ''View of the Public Debt, Receipts and Expenditure of the United States'' (1800). But much of his political speculation never passed beyond his voluminous notebooks, many of which are conserved in Harvard's [[Houghton Library]].

He also composed a satirical version of the British national anthem "[[God Save the King]]", called "[[God Save the King#Historic_republican_alternative|God Save the Guillotine]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8410734 A song. Tune-"God save the guillotine"], stanford.edu catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==

Historian William H. Goetzmann describes Barlow as a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], along with [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], engineer [[Robert Fulton]], and [[Thomas Paine]], the last of whom Barlow befriended in France. Barlow believed that the new country of America was a model [[civilization]] that prefigured the "uniting of all mankind in one religion, one language and one Newtonian harmonious whole"&lt;ref name="goetzmann143"&gt;Goeztmann (2009), ''Beyond the Revolution'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and thought of "the American Revolution as the opening skirmish of a world revolution on behalf of the rights of all humanity."&lt;ref name="goetzmann142"/&gt; An optimist, he believed that scientific and republican progress, along with religion and people's growing sense of humanity, would lead to the coming of the Millennium. For him, American civilization was world civilization. He projected that these concepts would coalesce around the rebuilding of the temple in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="goetzmann143"/&gt;

'''Kamokuiki''' (c. 1795 – September 26, 1840) was a grandmother of the last two ruling [[monarch]]s of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Life==
Kamokuiki was born about 1795 as a daughter of the chief Kanepawale, son of Kaʻihelemoana and Kaʻopa, and his wife chiefess Uaua, daughter of Kaʻehunuiamamaliʻi and Koʻi. Her grandfather's sister was Hikuikekualono, the mother of Kahaopulani, who according to legend hid and nursed the baby [[Kamehameha I]] during his infancy when he was being hunted down by [[Alapainui]].&lt;ref name="kekoolani"&gt;{{cite web |last= Kekoolani |first= Dean |title= Kamokuiki (Ka-moku-iki) |url=http://www.kekoolani.org/Pages/Kekoolani%20Genealogy%20Database%20(PAF)/pafg117.htm#2119 |work= Kekoolani Genealogy of the Descendants of the Ruling Chiefs of Hawaii |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamokuiki married High Chief [[Kamanawa II]] and with him had a son, [[Kapaakea|Caesar Kapaʻakea]] (1815–1866). She also had a daughter named Kekahili by another husband named Alapaimaloiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= High Chief Kamanawa II Is Hanged for Murder |author= Kapikauinamoku |newspaper= [[The Honolulu Advertiser]] |year= 1955 |url= http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=q-0sohr-000Sec--11en-50-20-frameset-book-Kepookalani-1-011utfZz-8&amp;a=d&amp;d=D0.4.61&amp;toc=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Kalākaua]] descends from her son Kapaʻakea. The [[House of Kawānanakoa]] descends from her daughter Kekahili.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royalark.net/Hawaii/kauai.htm |title=Kauai Genealogy |author=Christopher Buyers |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |work= Royal Ark web site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After converting to [[Christianity]], Kamokuiki grew disgusted at her husband Kamanawa's many affairs. In 1840, she divorced him for the crime of adultery. Kamanawa was not allowed to remarry while she was alive. Six weeks after the divorce, Kamokuiki died in [[Honolulu]] on September 26, 1840.{{sfn|Gutmanis|1974|pages=143–145}}&lt;ref name="KaleinamanuSilva"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://apps.ksbe.edu/kaiwakiloumoku/makalii/historical-photos/manuscript/kamanawa_execution  |title=‘Execution of Chief Kamanawa |author=Hawaii State Archives |work= Ka‘iwakīloumoku Virtual Archive, Kamehameha Schools |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two days later an autopsy was performed on her body and her stomach was discovered to be "much inflamed, while everything else was in order." Her ex-husband and his accomplice Lonoapuakau were arrested and placed in chains.{{sfn|Cooke|Cooke|1937|page=84}} They had poisoned her "‘awa" (a name for [[kava]], a narcotic drink) with fatal doses of the fishing poisons ʻākia and ʻauhuhu. They were both tried by a jury of twelve chiefs and found guilty of her murder. They were hanged in the Honolulu Fort on October 20, 1840, the first two to be prosecuted under the criminal laws adopted in the [[1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaiian constitution of 1840]].{{sfn|Gutmanis|1974|pages=143–145}}
[[Charles Wilkes]] of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] was in Honolulu during the murder and subsequent trial. Calling her "Kamakinki", Wilkes recounted how the cries of the natives mourning the death of Kamokuiki kept him awake at night, describing it as "one of the most startling and mournful sounds I ever heard which lasted all night, and disturbed the whole town of Honolulu."{{sfn|Wilkes|1844|page=30}}

This incident left a mark on the family and would negatively affect public opinion of Kamokuiki's grandson [[Kalākaua]] during his campaign for the throne in 1874. Later opponents of Kalākaua and his sister and successor [[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]] would use the murder case as an example of their family's idolatrous tendencies.{{sfn|Alexander|1894|page=3}}

Kamokuiki's remains are interred in the cemetery of the [[Kawaiahaʻo Church]], in the Kapiʻolani family plot. Her husband Alapaimaloiki, [[Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole]], the father of [[Queen Kapiolani|Queen Kapiʻolani]], and other relatives of [[Elizabeth Kahanu Kalanianaʻole]] are also buried here. Today, an [[obelisk]] marks where the Kapiʻolani family plot is located.&lt;ref name="KapiolaniPlot"&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Statement of Princess Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawananakoa regarding Kawaiahao Church |work= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308064356/http://pononohawaiiponoi.com/page10/page10.html|archivedate=March 8, 2012|url=http://pononohawaiiponoi.com/page10/page10.html|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her royal descendants are buried at the [[Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii|Royal Mausoleum at Mauna ʻAla]].

For [[Pokémon Black and White|''Pokémon Black'' and ''White'']], Sugimori directed a team of 17 people in designing new characters for the games, though he always drew the final designs.

'''Labor induction''' is the process or treatment that stimulates [[childbirth]] and delivery. Inducing labor can be accomplished with pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical methods. In Western countries, it is estimated that one quarter of pregnant women have their labor medically induced with drug treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inductions are most often performed either with [[prostaglandin]] drug treatment alone, or with a combination of prostaglandin and intravenus [[oxytocin]] treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical uses==
Commonly accepted medical reasons for induction include:
* [[Postterm pregnancy]], i.e. if the pregnancy has gone past the end of the 42nd week.
*[[Intrauterine growth restriction|Intrauterine fetal growth restriction]] (IUGR).
* There are health risks to the woman in continuing the pregnancy (e.g. she has [[pre-eclampsia]]).
*[[Prelabor rupture of membranes|Premature rupture of the membranes]] (PROM); this is when the membranes have ruptured, but labor does not start within a specific amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;Allahyar, J. &amp; Galan, H. "Premature Rupture of the Membranes."; also American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Premature termination of the pregnancy (abortion).
* Fetal death in utero and previous history of stillbirth. 
* [[Twin]] pregnancy continuing beyond 38 weeks.
* Previous health conditions that puts risk on the woman and/or her child such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]]

Induction of labor in those who are either at or after term improves outcomes for the baby and decreases the number of [[Caesarean section|C-sections]] performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mishanina|first1=E|last2=Rogozinska|first2=E|last3=Thatthi|first3=T|last4=Uddin-Khan|first4=R|last5=Khan|first5=KS|last6=Meads|first6=C|title=Use of labour induction and risk of cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=Jun 10, 2014|volume=186|issue=9|pages=665–73|pmid=24778358|doi=10.1503/cmaj.130925|pmc=4049989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of induction ==
Methods of inducing labor include both pharmacological medication and mechanical or physical approaches.

Mechanical and physical approaches can include artificial rupture of membranes or membrane sweeping. The use of intrauterine catheters are also indicated. These work by compressing the cervix mechanically to generate release on prostaglandins in local tissues. There is no direct effect on the uterus.

Clinicians assess the odds of having a vaginal delivery after labor induction by a "[[Bishop score]]". However, recent research has questioned the relationship between the Bishop score and a successful induction, finding that a poor Bishop score actually may improve the chance for a vaginal delivery after induction.&lt;ref name="cmaj.ca"/&gt; A Bishop Score is done to assess the progression of the cervix prior to an induction. In order to do this, the cervix must be checked to see how much it has effaced, thinned out, and how far dilated it is. The score goes by a points system depending on five factors. Each factor is scored on a scale of either 0–2 or 0–3, any total score less than 5 holds a higher risk of delivering by caesarean section.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Human Spaceflight''' includes all crewed spaceflights which reached an altitude of at least 100&amp;nbsp;km (the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]]&amp;nbsp;definition of spaceflight, see [[Kármán line]]), or were launched with that intention but failed. The USA has adopted a different definition of spaceflight, requiring an altitude of only {{convert|50|mi|km}}. During the 1960s, 13 flights of the US [[North American X-15|X-15 rocket plane]]&amp;nbsp;met the US criteria, but only two met the FAI's. These lists include only the latter two flights; see the [[North American X-15#Highest flights|list of highest X-15 flights]]&amp;nbsp;for all 13.
As of the launch of [[Soyuz MS-10]] on 11 October 2018, there have been 320 crewed spaceflights that reached 100&amp;nbsp;km or more in altitude (323 attempted crewed flights with three failed attempts), 8 of which were [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]s.  One uncrewed flight, [[Soyuz 34]], was launched in order to provide a return vehicle to the crew of [[Soyuz 32]].

To date, there have been four [[List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents|fatal missions]] in which 18 astronauts died.

==Human spaceflights==
The [[Salyut]] series, [[Skylab]], [[Mir]], [[International Space Station|ISS]], and [[Tiangong program|Tiangong series]] space stations, with which many of these flights docked in orbit, are not listed separately here. See the detailed lists (links below) for information.

Missions which were intended to reach space but which failed to do so are listed in ''italics'', and fatal missions are marked with asterisks.

* [http://spacefacts.de/english/e_missions.htm ''Spacefacts''] Compare with the present article.  The ''Spacefacts'' list includes most flights listed here, but omits eleven: The two failed launches of STS-51-L and Soyuz T-10-1, neither of which actually achieved human spaceflight, the uncrewed launch of Soyuz 34 (which nevertheless returned a crew to earth), and the eight sub-orbital human spaceflights: Mercury-Redstone 3 and 4, X-15 flights 90 and 91, SpaceShipOne flights 15P, 16P and 17P, and Soyuz 18-1, the latter being an aborted mission which nevertheless exceeded the Kármán line.

This is a detailed listing of human spaceflights from 1961 to 1970, spanning the Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] programs, the start of the Soviet [[Soyuz program]], the American [[Mercury program|Mercury]] and [[Gemini program|Gemini]] programs, and the first lunar landings of the American [[Apollo program]].

*&lt;span style="background:#fdc;"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; indicates fatalities.
*&lt;span style="background:#bfb;"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; indicates [[sub-orbital spaceflight]] (including flights that failed to attain intended orbit).
*&lt;span style="background:#ddd;"&gt;Grey&lt;/span&gt; indicates flights to the [[Moon]].
*Note: The USA defines spaceflight as any flight reaching an altitude of 50 miles, while the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] definition requires an altitude of 100&amp;nbsp;km. During the 1960s, 13 manned flights of the U.S. [[North American X-15]] rocket plane met the U.S. criteria and only two the FAI's. This list includes only the latter two flights. (See the [[North American X-15]] article for a list of all 13 flights.)

'''Sir Ludovic Henry Coverley Kennedy''' (3 November 1919{{spaced ndash}}18 October 2009) was a British journalist, [[Television presenter|broadcaster]], [[humanism|humanist]] and author best known for re-examining cases such as the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] and the murder convictions of [[Timothy Evans]] and [[Derek Bentley case|Derek Bentley]], and for his role in the abolition of the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]] in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Kennedy was born in 1919 in [[Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name="telegraph_obit"/&gt; the son of a career [[Royal Navy]] officer, [[Edward Coverley Kennedy]], and his wife, Rosalind Grant, daughter of [[Grant Baronets|Sir Ludovic Grant, 11th Baronet]]. His mother Rosalind was a cousin of the Conservative politician [[Robert Boothby, Baron Boothby|Robert Boothby]], later Lord Boothby. 
He had two younger sisters, Morar and Katherine. Morar married the playwright [[Royce Ryton]] in 1954. Katherine married Major [[Ion Calvocoressi]] in 1947.

He was schooled at [[Eton College]] (where he played in a jazz band with [[Humphrey Lyttelton]]),&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; and 
studied for a year at Christ Church, Oxford, until the outbreak of war.

Kennedy's father, by then a 60-year-old retired captain, returned to the navy and was given command of [[HMS Rawalpindi|HMS ''Rawalpindi'']],&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; a hastily militarised [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] steamship, known as an [[Armed merchantmen|Armed Merchant Cruiser]]. On 23 November 1939, while on patrol southeast of [[Iceland]] the ''Rawalpindi'' encountered two of the most powerful German warships, the small battleships (or battlecruisers) {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} trying to break out through the [[GIUK gap]] into the Atlantic. The ''Rawalpindi'' was able to signal the German ships' location back to base. Despite being hopelessly outgunned, Captain Edward Coverley Kennedy of the ''Rawalpindi'' decided to fight, rather than surrender as demanded by the Germans. ''Scharnhorst'' sank ''Rawalpindi''; of her 312 crew 275 (including her captain) were killed. Captain Kennedy was posthumously [[mentioned in dispatches]] and his decision to fight against overwhelming odds entered the folklore of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name="navy_rawalpindi"/&gt; His son Ludovic was twenty years old.

===Naval officer===
Ludovic Kennedy followed his father into the navy; he served as an officer on [[destroyer]]s, mostly in the same northern seas. His ship ([[HMS Tartar (F43)|HMS ''Tartar'']]) was one of those that pursued the [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] following the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] although he did not witness her sinking because ''Tartar'' went to refuel some hours before the end. Kennedy later wrote about this in ''Pursuit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Kennedy | first= Ludovic | title= Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the "Bismarck" | ISBN = 978-0-304-35526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; his chronicle of the chase and sinking of the ''Bismarck''.&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

==Journalism and broadcasting==
Having studied for one year at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], before the war, he returned to complete his studies in 1945. At Oxford he helped found the Writers' Club and then sought a means of support while he completed a book on [[Nelson's captains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-ludovic-kennedy-writer-and-broadcaster-who-devoted-much-of-his-career-to-exposing-miscarriages-of-justice-1805650.html |title=Sir Ludovic Kennedy: Writer and broadcaster who devoted much of his career to exposing miscarriages of justice |author=Leonard Miall |author-link=Leonard Miall |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Oxford he began a career as an investigative journalist.&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

A campaigning, investigative reporter, Kennedy wrote for a number of publications, including ''[[Newsweek]]''. From 1953, he edited and introduced the ''First Reading'' radio series on the [[BBC Third Programme]], presenting young writers such as [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[Philip Larkin]]. Later he became a television journalist and a [[news presenter|newsreader]] on ITV's [[Independent Television News]] alongside [[Robin Day]] and [[Chris Chataway]]. He presented the BBC's flagship current affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' for several years.&lt;ref name="herald_obit"/&gt; Kennedy was interested in [[miscarriages of justice]], and he wrote and broadcast on numerous cases.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

A major interest of Kennedy's was [[naval warfare]]. He wrote and presented a substantial number of television documentaries for the BBC on [[maritime history in the Second World War]], beginning with [[Scapa Flow]], followed by the dramatic narrative of the [[sinking of the Bismarck]] in which he was personally involved. Other subjects included the U-Boat war, the story of [[HMS Belfast]], and the raids on [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe]] and [[St Nazaire Raid|St. Nazaire]]. ''The Life and Death of the [[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]'' (1971) brought him into contact with survivors of the battlecruiser that had sunk his father's ship {{HMS|Rawalpindi}}. The series included ''Target Tirpitz'' (1973), a history of the extraordinary attempts to sink the feared German battleship. Two of these films led to subsequent books.

In 1980 he presented an episode of the BBC television series [[Great Railway Journeys of the World]], in which he crossed the US.

From 1980 to 1988&lt;ref name="Steel"/&gt; he presented the television review programme ''[[Did You See...?]]'' He interviewed [[Peter Cook]]'s character [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]] in ''A Life in Pieces'' in 1990. He appeared as himself in several episodes on the political comedy series ''[[Yes Minister]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/yes-minister/the-challenge/episode/74550/summary.html |title=Yes, Minister: 'The Challenge' episode summary |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/yes-prime-minister/the-tangled-web/episode/156010/summary.html?tag=prev_episode;title |title=Yes, Prime Minister: 'The Tangled Web' episode summary |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was the subject of an episode of ''[[That Reminds Me]]'' (2002: season 4, episode 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/ThatRemindsMe/ |title=That Reminds Me: A Titles &amp; Air Dates Guide |year=2006 |publisher=epguides.com |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129070700/http://epguides.com/ThatRemindsMe/ |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kennedy also expressed to another journalist that there are too many Blacks on television. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/sep/25/broadcasting.race |title=Too Many Blacks on TV, says Ludovic Kennedy |publisher=TheGuardian.com |first=Jason |last=Deans|date=September 25, 2003 |accessdate=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine sometimes referred to him as 'Ludicrous Kennedy'. In the long-running BBC sitcom ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'', [[Alf Garnett]] – while attacking BBC personalities – spoke of him as a ''Russian Mick'' (''"Mick"'' being an offensive term for an Irishman), meaning "that ''Ludovich Kennedy!"''

==Writing==
Kennedy's book ''Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the "Bismarck"'' ({{ISBN|978-0-304-35526-6}}) detailed the career of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], her sinking of British [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']], and her destruction by the Royal Navy.

===Miscarriages of justice===
He wrote several books that questioned convictions in a number of notable cases in British criminal history. One of the first [[miscarriages of justice]] he investigated was the conviction and hanging of [[Timothy Evans]] in his 1961 book ''[[John Christie (murderer)|Ten Rillington Place]]'' ({{ISBN|978-0-586-03428-6}}). Evans was found to have murdered his baby daughter in 1950, but Kennedy contended that he was innocent, and that the murders of his wife and baby had been committed by the [[serial killer]] [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]].&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Christie was hanged three years after the hanging of Evans, following the discovery of six more bodies at 10 Rillington Place, none of which could be ascribed to Evans. Indeed, two of the skeletons found at the house dated back to the war – long before Evans and his family had moved in. After a long campaign, Evans was [[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumously]] [[pardon]]ed in 1966. The scandal helped in the [[abolition of the death penalty in the UK]]. Kennedy's book was filmed in 1970 as ''[[10 Rillington Place]]'', starring [[John Hurt]] as Evans and [[Richard Attenborough]] as Christie.

In 1985, Kennedy published ''The Airman and the Carpenter'' ({{ISBN|978-0-670-80606-5}}), in which he argued that [[Richard Hauptmann]] did not kidnap and murder [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s baby, a crime for which he was executed in 1936.&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; The book was made into a 1996 [[HBO]] film ''[[Crime of the Century (TV film)|Crime of the Century]]'', starring [[Stephen Rea]] and [[Isabella Rossellini]].&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

In 1990, Kennedy became the advisory committee chairman of [[David Jessel|''Just Television'']], a television production company dedicated to exposing miscarriages of justice.

In 2003, he wrote ''36 Murders and 2 Immoral Earnings'' ({{ISBN|978-1-86197-457-0}}), in which he analysed a number of noted cases, including the Evans case and those of [[Derek Bentley case|Derek Bentley]] and the [[Birmingham Six]], a number of which were affected by claims of police failure, [[police misconduct]] or [[perjury]]. In it he concluded that the [[adversarial system]] of justice in the UK and the United States "is an invitation to the police to commit perjury, which they frequently do", and said that he preferred the [[inquisitorial system]].

==Politics==

In 1958, Kennedy stood for election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate in the [[Rochdale by-election, 1958|Rochdale by-election]] called after the death of the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, [[Wentworth Schofield]] in December 1957. He lost to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, [[Jack McCann]], but achieved an increase in the Liberal vote, pushing the Conservatives into third place. The Rochdale contest was the first British by-election to receive live television coverage (locally, by [[Granada Television]]).

Kennedy supported [[Scottish Independence]].&lt;ref name="bbc_obit"/&gt;

==Campaigning==
In addition to his writing and campaigning on [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]], Kennedy campaigned on a number of other issues.

A lifelong [[atheism|atheist]], he published ''All in the Mind: A Farewell To God'' in 1999, in which he discussed his philosophical objections to religion, and the ills he felt had come from Christianity. He was a Distinguished Supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]],&lt;ref name="bbc_report_of_death"/&gt; he contributed to ''[[New Humanist]]'' magazine, he was an Honorary Associate of the [[National Secular Society]] and a Distinguished Supporter of the [[Humanist Society Scotland]].

He was also an advocate of the legalisation of [[assisted suicide]], and was a co-founder and former chair of the [[Voluntary Euthanasia Society]]. His book, ''Euthanasia: The Case for the Good Death'', was published in 1990.

Kennedy resigned from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="bbc_kennedy_quits_libdems"/&gt; citing the incompatibility of his pro-voluntary euthanasia views with those of the then Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]] (no relation), who was a Roman Catholic.

He then stood as an independent on a platform of legalising voluntary euthanasia in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] for the [[Wiltshire]] constituency of [[Devizes (UK Parliament constituency)|Devizes]].&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; He won 2% of the vote and subsequently rejoined the Liberal Democrats.

== Personal life ==
In February 1950 he married the dancer and actress [[Moira Shearer]] in the [[Chapel Royal]], [[Hampton Court Palace]]. He later remembered their meeting in 1949, when he was reluctantly persuaded by a friend to accept a complimentary ticket to a fancy dress ball held at the Lyceum ballroom in London. Shearer – who had recently become famous for her role in ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' – was presenting the prizes at the occasion, and Kennedy later recalled that "I felt a tremor run through me when I caught sight of her. She looked even lovelier than in the film."

Summoning up his courage, he approached the 23-year-old dancer and asked her to dance. She would be delighted, she told him, only "I don't dance very well." She was not, Kennedy revealed, a competent ballroom dancer. The couple had one son and three daughters (Alastair, Ailsa, Rachel and Fiona) from a 56-year marriage that ended with her death on 31 January 2006 at the age of 80.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Honours==
He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Strathclyde]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="strathclyde_hon_degree"/&gt;

He was [[knighthood|knighted]] in 1994 for services to journalism, on the recommendation of [[John Major]]'s government. Major's predecessor [[Margaret Thatcher]] had vetoed Kennedy's knighthood.&lt;ref name="telegraph_obit"/&gt;

== Death ==
Kennedy died of [[pneumonia]] in a nursing home in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 18 October 2009,&lt;ref name="telegraph_obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt; aged 89.

=== Supercentenarian Research Foundation ===

In 2006,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Methuselah contributed capital and fiscal sponsorship to launch the Supercentenarian Research Foundation (SRF). SRF was formed to study why [[supercentenarian]]s, people over 110 years of age, live longer than most, and why they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supercentenarian-research-foundation.org/mission.htm|title=Mission summary of Supercentenarian Research Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight autopsies of supercentenarians were conducted by SRF, with six indicating senile cardiac [[Transthyretin amyloidosis|transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis]] at the time of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2010/03/04/autopsy-115-year-old-aids-research/|title=Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine performs autopsy on 115-year-old woman to aid research|website=dailybruin.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; TTR amyloidosis "amasses in and clogs blood vessels, forcing the heart to work harder and eventually fail."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Mitch|date=2008-09-26|title=Searching for the Secrets of the Super Old|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5897/1764|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5897|pages=1764–1765|doi=10.1126/science.321.5897.1764|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18818335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SENS Research Foundation ===

{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

From 2003-2009,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Methuselah Foundation served as the backbone organization for the [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]] (SENS) program, a long-term research framework developed by Aubrey de Grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Grey|first=Aubrey D.

During that time, de Grey and David Gobel established SENS-related research programs on human bioremedial biology – "getting the crud out" in Methuselah's parlance&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.methuselahfund.com/#about-us-section|title=Welcome|website=Methuselah Fund|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; – at [[Rice University]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The programs were the first use of [[environmental remediation]] principles directed at reversing "pollution" in human cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rittmann|first=Bruce E.|last2=Schloendorn|first2=John|date=2007-08-20|title=Engineering Away Lysosomal Junk: Medical Bioremediation|journal=Rejuvenation Research|volume=10|issue=3|pages=359–366|doi=10.1089/rej.2007.0594|pmid=17708688|issn=1549-1684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Methuselah sponsored a series of SENS-focused roundtables and conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sens.org/outreach/conferences/sens-conferences|title=SENS Conferences|date=2016-02-08|work=SENS Research Foundation|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funded the writing of ''[[Ending Aging]]'', co-authored by de Grey and Michael Rae.

Under de Grey's continued leadership, SENS spun out from Methuselah as the [[SENS Research Foundation]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Donors ==

In 2004, Methuselah Foundation began a donor initiative called the Methuselah 300 ("The 300"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mfoundation.org/300|title=The Methuselah 300|website=www.mfoundation.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a community of philanthropic donors pledging $25,000 over 25 years, at a minimum of $1,000 annually, toward the organization. The initiative was named after the [[Battle of Thermopylae|300 Spartans]] who held the pass at Thermopylae in 480 BC during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. In addition, in 2015, the foundation began memorializing The 300 donors with a monument&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2015/11/the-methuselah-300-monument-is-unveiled/|title=The Methuselah 300 Monument is Unveiled|date=2015-11-24|work=Fight Aging!|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[St. Thomas Island]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].

On September 16, 2006, [[Peter Thiel]] announced a pledge of $3.5 million to the Methuselah Foundation and the SENS program to "support scientific research into the alleviation and eventual reversal of the debilities caused by aging."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/health/article/BAY-AREA-Entrepreneur-backs-research-on-2469507.php|title=BAY AREA / Entrepreneur backs research on anti-aging / Scientist says humans could live indefinitely|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the anonymous principal of the [[Pineapple Fund]] donated $1 million to the Methuselah Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/01/the-pineapple-fund-donates-millions-to-the-organ-preservation-alliance-and-methuselah-foundation/|title=The Pineapple Fund Donates Millions to the Organ Preservation Alliance and Methuselah Foundation|date=2018-01-29|work=Fight Aging!|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Neomugicha incident'''|西鉄バスジャック事件|[[:ja:西鉄バス|Nishi-Tetsu]] [[:ja:バスジャック|basujakku]] jiken}} is the name given to the hijacking between May 4 and May 5, 2000, of a [[Japan]]ese bus by a user of [[internet forum]] [[2channel]] after placing a warning on the website.

An hour after posting a cryptic threat in a thread with the name "Neomugicha" ("Neo-[[Roasted barley tea|Barley Tea]]"; ネオむぎ茶), the 17-year-old hijacked a bus "the Wakakusu" ([[Nishi-Nippon Railroad]] Co., Ltd.) in [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], Japan with a Gyuto knife (牛刀 "gyuutou" or [[Chef's knife]]), stabbing one passenger to death and injuring 2.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;''[[Wired News]]''.

The incident came as a shock to both 2channers, who had mocked Neomugicha as a liar, thinking he was posting about an attack that had already occurred, and to the general public.

Later, a poster named "Neouuroncha" ("Neo-[[oolong|Oolong tea]]") attempted to imitate Neomugicha by plotting to blow up the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] in Japan and posting warnings about it on 2channel.  After the Neomugicha incident, however, the Japanese police were keeping a close eye on 2ch, so he was identified and arrested before his plan could be carried out.

A poster called "Neomugishu" ("Neo-Beer"; shu=alcohol) also attempted to imitate the incident, planning a terrorist attack on a railway company, but he was also arrested.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

The '''Neural network synchronization protocol''', abbreviated as NNSP, is built on the application-level layer of the [[OSI model|OSI]] upon [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]]. Aiming at secure communication, this protocol's design make use of a concept called neural network synchronization. Server and each connected client must create special type of [[neural network]] called Tree Parity Machine then compute outputs of their neural networks and exchange them in an iterative manner through the public channel. By learning and exchanging public outputs of their networks, client's and server's neural networks will be synchronized, meaning they will have identical synaptic weights, after some time. Once synchronization is achieved, weights of networks are used for secret key derivation. For the purposes of encryption/decryption of subsequent communication this symmetric key is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="89717">'''Neuroscience of free will''', a part of [[neurophilosophy]], is the study of the interconnections between [[free will]] and [[neuroscience]].

As it has become possible to study the human living [[brain]], researchers have begun to watch [[decision making]] processes at work. Findings could carry implications for our [[sense of agency]], [[moral responsibility]], and our understanding of [[consciousness]] in general.&lt;ref name="Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Institute of Art and Ideas|title=Fate, Freedom and Neuroscience|url=http://iai.tv/video/fate-freedom-and-neuroscience|publisher=IAI|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; One of the pioneering studies in this domain was designed by [[Benjamin Libet]],&lt;ref name="Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libet|first=Benjamin|title=Unconscious cerebral initiative  and the role of conscious will  in voluntary action|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=1985|volume=8|pages=529–566|url=http://selfpace.uconn.edu/class/ccs/Libet1985UcsCerebralInitiative.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2013|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00044903}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies have attempted to predict participant actions before they make them.&lt;ref name=soonetal /&gt; [[File:Some brain areas.png|thumb|right|350px|Some areas of the human brain implicated in mental disorders that might be related to free will.

The field remains highly controversial. There is no consensus among researchers about the significance of findings, their meaning, or what conclusions may be drawn. The precise role of consciousness in decision making therefore remains unclear.

Thinkers like [[Daniel Dennett]] or [[Alfred Mele]] consider the language used by researchers. They explain that "free will" means many different things to different people (e.g. some notions of free will are [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]], some not). Dennett insists that many important and common conceptions of "free will" are compatible with the emerging evidence from neuroscience.&lt;ref name=WalterH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kane/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennett/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = ...the current work is in broad agreement with a general trend in neuroscience of volition: although we may experience that our conscious decisions and thoughts cause our actions, these experiences are in fact based on readouts of brain activity in a network of brain areas that control voluntary action...It is clearly wrong to think of [feeling of willing something] as a prior intention, located at the very earliest moment of decision in an extended action chain. Rather, W seems to mark an intention-in-action, quite closely linked to action execution.|source = -Patrick Haggard&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; discussing an in-depth experiment by Itzhak Fried&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt;}}
One significant finding of modern studies is that a person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, other scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether subjects would press a button with their left or right hand up to 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice.&lt;ref name=soonetal&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2112 |title=Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain |year=2008 |last1=Soon |first1=Chun Siong |last2=Brass |first2=Marcel |last3=Heinze |first3=Hans-Jochen |last4=Haynes |first4=John-Dylan |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=543–5 |pmid=18408715}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some forms of "free will". To be clear, no single study would disprove all forms of free will. This is because the term "[[free will]]" can encapsulate different hypotheses, each of which must be considered in light of existing [[empirical evidence]].

There have also been a number of problems regarding studies of free will.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2478/v10053-008-0076-2 |title=Free will debates: Simple experiments are not so simple |year=2010 |last1=Klemm |first1=W. R. |journal=Advances in Cognitive Psychology |volume=6 |pages=47–65 |pmid=20859552 |pmc=2942748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that ''have'' been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might have nothing to do with unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt; Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of "free will" where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

===Free will as illusion===
[[File:Playing the piano.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An activity like playing the piano may be intentional, but is generally regarded as requiring many practiced actions. Studies suggest that each key press could be initiated unconsciously.]]It is quite likely that a large range of cognitive operations are necessary to freely press a button. Research at least suggests that our conscious self does not initiate all behavior. Instead, the conscious self is somehow alerted to a given behavior that the rest of the brain and body are already planning and performing. These findings do not forbid conscious experience from playing some moderating role, although it is also possible that some form of unconscious process is what is causing modification in our behavioral response. Unconscious processes may play a larger role in behavior than previously thought.

It may be possible, then, that our intuitions about the role of our conscious 'intentions' have led us astray; it may be the case that we have [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]] by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in [[neurostimulation]], [[brain damage]], but also research into [[introspection illusion]]s. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for [[moral responsibility]]. Neuroscientist and author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is 'intuitive': he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues - "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;"The Moral Landscape", p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientist [[Walter Jackson Freeman III]] nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly trying to keep up with what we do."&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Walter J. How Brains Make Up Their Minds. New York: Columbia UP, 2000. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.

===Disputed relevance of scientific research===
Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies think these studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that physical factors in the brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that "We feel we choose, but we don't".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Researcher [[John-Dylan Haynes]] adds "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Philosophers Walter Glannon and [[Alfred Mele]] think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because "[[free will]]" can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] notions of free will – but that is an "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down".&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt; Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in [[materialistic]] terms. In these cases, "free will" means something more like "not coerced" or that "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence of these types of free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about what goes on in the brain during decision making.&lt;ref name=NatureAim/&gt;

{{Quote box|align=left|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote= "[Some senses of free will] are compatible with what we are learning from science...If only that was what scientists were telling people. But scientists, especially in the last few years, have been on a rampage – writing ill-considered public pronouncements about free will which... verge on social irresponsibility.

This issue may be controversial for good reason: There is evidence to suggest that people normally associate a [[Free will#Believing in free will|belief in free will]] with their ability to affect their lives.&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9047-7 |title=Why 'Willusionism' Leads to 'Bad Results': Comments on Baumeister, Crescioni, and Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Nahmias |first1=Eddy |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 |title=Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist |year=2009 |last1=Holton |first1=Richard |journal=Neuroethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=13–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], author of ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'' and a supporter of [[compatibilism|deterministic free will]], believes scientists risk making a serious mistake. He says that there are types of free will that are incompatible with modern science, but he says those kinds of free will are not worth wanting. Other types of "free will" are pivotal to people's sense of responsibility and purpose (see also [[Free will#Believing in free will|"believing in free will"]]), and many of these types are actually compatible with modern science.&lt;ref name=DennettPOI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_the_scientific_study_of_religion/|title=Daniel Dennett - The Scientific Study of Religion|publisher=Point of Inquiry |type=Podcast|date=December 12, 2011}}. Discussion of free will starts especially at 24 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other studies described below have only just begun to shed light on the role that consciousness plays in actions and it is too early to draw very strong conclusions about certain kinds of "free will". It is worth noting that such experiments – so far – have dealt only with free will decisions made in short time frames (seconds) and ''may'' not have direct bearing on free will decisions made ("thoughtfully") by the subject over the course of ''many'' seconds, minutes, hours or longer. Scientists have also only so far studied extremely simple behaviors (e.g. moving a finger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/the-moral-sciences-club/what-can-neuroscience-teach-us-about-evil|title=What can neuroscience teach us about evil?|author=Will Wilkinson}} {{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adina Roskies points out five areas of neuroscientific research:  1.) action initiation, 2.) intention, 3). decision, 4.) Inhibition and control, and 5.) the phenomenology of agency, and for each of these areas Roskies concludes that the science may be developing our understanding of volition or "will", but it yet offers nothing  for developing the "free" part of the "free will" discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adina L.

They asked their subjects to read one of two passages: one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control; the other neutral about what influences behaviour. The participants then did a few math problems on a computer. But just before the test started, they were informed that because of a glitch in the computer it occasionally displayed the answer by accident; if this happened, they were to click it away without looking. Those who had read the deterministic message were more likely to cheat on the test. "Perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse to behave as one likes," Vohs and Schooler suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110831/full/477023a.html|title=Neuroscience vs philosophy: Taking aim at free will|first=Kerri|last=Smith|date=31 August 2011|volume=477|issue=7362|pages=23–25|doi=10.1038/477023a|pmid=21886139|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18181791 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x | volume=19 | title=The value of believing in free will: encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating | date=January 2008 | journal=Psychol Sci | pages=49–54 | last1 = Vohs | first1 = KD | last2 = Schooler | first2 = JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable experiments==

===Libet experiment===
A pioneering experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain (in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP), which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;). Although it was well known that the Bereitschaftspotential (sometimes also termed "readiness potential") preceded the physical action, Libet asked how the Bereitschaftspotential corresponded to the felt intention to move. To determine when the subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock and report its position when they felt that they had felt the conscious will to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;

[[File:B.Libet.experiment.gif|thumb|left|300px|Libet's experiment: (0) repose, until (1) the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] is detected, (2-Libet's W) the volunteer memorizes a dot position upon feeling their intention, and (3) then acts.]]
Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity leading up to the ''conscious'' decision by the subject to flick their wrist began approximately half a second ''before'' the subject consciously felt that they had decided to move.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0355-1_16 |chapter=Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action |title=Neurophysiology of Consciousness |series=Contemporary Neuroscientists |year=1993 |last1=Libet |first1=Benjamin |isbn=978-1-4612-6722-5 |pages=269–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libet's findings suggest that decisions made by a subject are first being made on a subconscious level and only afterward being translated into a "conscious decision", and that the subject's belief that it occurred at the behest of their will was only due to their retrospective perspective on the event.

Having attempted the experiment himself, Mele explains that "the awareness of the intention to move" is an ambiguous feeling at best. For this reason he remained skeptical of interpreting the subjects' reported times for comparison with their '[[Bereitschaftspotential]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/ideas/19231 Bigthink.com]{{self-published inline|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
[[File:Bereitschaftspotenzial fig1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Typical recording of the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] that was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;). [[Benjamin Libet]] investigated whether this neural activity corresponded to the "felt intention" (or will) to move of experimental subjects.]]

In a variation of this task, Haggard and Eimer asked subjects to decide not only when to move their hands, but also to decide ''which hand to move''. In this case, the felt intention correlated much more closely with the "[[lateralized readiness potential]]" (LRP), an [[Event-related potential|ERP]] component which measures the difference between left and right hemisphere brain activity. Haggard and Eimer argue that the feeling of conscious will must therefore follow the decision of which hand to move, since the LRP reflects the decision to lift a particular hand.&lt;ref name="HandE" /&gt;

A more direct test of the relationship between the Bereitschaftspotential and the "awareness of the intention to move" was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, research participants reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's "W").  If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information.  However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02254.x |title=We Infer Rather Than Perceive the Moment We Decided to Act |year=2009 |last1=Banks |first1=William P. |last2=Isham |first2=Eve A. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |pages=17–21 |pmid=19152537 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Jeff Miller and Judy Trevena (2009) suggests that the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) signal in Libet's experiments doesn't represent a decision to move, but that it's merely a sign that the brain is paying attention.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In this experiment the classical Libet experiment was modified by playing an audio tone indicating to volunteers to decide whether to tap a key or not. The researchers found that there was the same RP signal in both cases, regardless of whether or not volunteers actually elected to tap, which suggests that the RP signal doesn't indicate that a decision has been made.&lt;ref name=Anil&gt;{{cite journal

In a second experiment, researchers asked volunteers to decide on the spot whether to use left hand or right to tap the key while monitoring their brain signals, and they found no correlation among the signals and the chosen hand. This criticism has itself been criticized by free-will researcher Patrick Haggard, who mentions literature that distinguishes two different circuits in the brain that lead to action: a "stimulus-response" circuit and a "voluntary" circuit. According to Haggard, researchers applying external stimuli may not be testing the proposed voluntary circuit, nor Libet's hypothesis about internally triggered actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt;

Libet's interpretation of the ramping up of brain activity prior to the report of conscious "will" continues to draw heavy criticism. Studies have questioned participants' ability to report the timing of their "will". Authors have found that [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA]] activity is modulated by attention (attention precedes the movement signal by 100ms), and the prior activity reported could therefore have been product of paying attention to the movement.&lt;ref name="Lau2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=H. C.|title=Attention to Intention|journal=Science|volume=303|issue=5661|year=2004|pages=1208–1210|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1090973}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the perceived onset of intention depends on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) applied over the [[supplementary motor area|preSMA]] after a participant performed an action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and the perceived time of action execution forward in time.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Hakwan C.|last2=Rogers|first2=Robert D.|last3=Passingham|first3=Richard E.|title=Manipulating the Experienced Onset of Intention after Action Execution|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=1|year=2007|pages=81–90|issn=0898-929X|doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.1.81|pmid=17214565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have speculated that the preceding neural activity reported by Libet may be an artefact of averaging the time of "will", wherein neural activity does not always precede reported "will".&lt;ref name="Trevena" /&gt; In a similar replication they also reported no difference in electrophysiological signs before a decision not to move, and before a decision to move.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

Despite his findings, Libet himself did not interpret his experiment as evidence of the inefficacy of conscious free will — he points out that although the tendency to press a button may be building up for 500 milliseconds, the conscious will retains a right to veto any action at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Libet |first=Benjamin |year=2003 |title=Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity? |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=24–8 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=24&amp;epage=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, unconscious impulses to perform a volitional act are open to suppression by the conscious efforts of the subject (sometimes referred to as "free won't"). A comparison is made with a [[golf]]er, who may swing a club several times before striking the ball. The action simply gets a rubber stamp of approval at the last millisecond. [[Max Velmans]] argues however that "free won't" may turn out to need as much neural preparation as "free will" (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velmans |first1=Max |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=42&amp;epage=61 |title=Preconscious Free Will |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=42–61 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have however replicated Libet's findings, whilst addressing some of the original criticisms.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; A recent study has found that individual neurons were found to fire 2 seconds before a reported "will" to act (long before EEG activity predicted such a response).&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Itzhak Fried replicated Libet's findings in 2011 at the scale of the single neuron. This was accomplished with the help of volunteer [[epilepsy]] patients, who needed [[electrodes]] implanted deep in their brain for evaluation and treatment anyway. Now able to monitor awake and moving patients, the researchers replicated the timing anomalies that were discovered by Libet and are discussed in the following study.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Similarly to these tests, [[Chun Siong Soon]], [[Anna Hanxi He]], [[Stefan Bode]] and [[John-Dylan Haynes]] have conducted a study in 2013 claiming to be able to predict the choice to sum or subtract before the subject reports it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/6217|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|first1=Chun Siong|last1=Soon|first2=Anna Hanxi|last2=He|first3=Stefan|last3=Bode|first4=John-Dylan|last4=Haynes|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=15|pages=6217–6222|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconscious actions===

====Timing intentions compared to actions====
A study by Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, published in 2008, claims to have replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization on the part of participants.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt; The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the [[readiness potential]]). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.

=====The experiment=====
[[File:Wijsvinger.jpg|thumb|right|120px|It is difficult to identify exactly when a person becomes aware of his action. Some findings indicate that awareness comes after actions have already begun in the brain.]]
Matsuhashi and Hallett's study can be summarized thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after it has already been started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.

To test this hypothesis, Matsuhashi and Hallet had volunteers perform brisk finger movements at random intervals, while not counting or planning when to make such (future) movements, but rather immediately making a movement as soon as they thought about it. An externally controlled "stop-signal" sound was played at pseudo random intervals, and the volunteers had to cancel their intent to move if they heard a signal while being aware of their own immediate intention to move. Whenever there ''was'' an action (finger movement), the authors documented (and graphed) any tones that occurred before that action. The graph of tones before actions therefore only shows tones (a) before the subject is even aware of his "movement genesis" (or else they would have stopped or "vetoed" the movement), and (b) after it is too late to veto the action. This second set of graphed tones is of little importance here.

In this work, "movement genesis" is defined as the brain process of making movement, of which physiological observations have been made (via electrodes) indicating that it may occur before conscious awareness of intent to move (see [[Benjamin Libet]]).

By looking to see when tones started preventing actions, the researchers supposedly know the length of time (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. This moment of awareness (as seen in the graph below) is dubbed "T" (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their [[Event-related potential]] (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.

The researchers found that the time of the conscious intention to move T normally occurred ''too late'' to be the cause of movement genesis. See the example of a subject's graph below on the right. Although it is not shown on the graph, the subject's readiness potentials (ERP) tells us that his actions start at –2.8 seconds, and yet this is substantially earlier than his conscious intention to move, time "T" (−1.8 seconds). Matsuhashi and Hallet concluded that the feeling of the conscious intention to move does not cause movement genesis; both the feeling of intention and the movement itself are the result of unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

=====Analysis and interpretation=====
[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A simple "signalling noise" is used, but it is to warn participants that they must prevent any actions they are aware of.]]
This study is similar to Libet's in some ways: volunteers were again asked to perform finger extensions in short, self-paced intervals. In this version of the experiment, researchers introduced randomly timed "stop tones" during the self paced movements. If participants were not conscious of any intention to move, they simply ignored the tone. On the other hand, if they were aware of their intention to move at the time of the tone, they had to try to veto the action, then relax for a bit before continuing self-paced movements. This experimental design allowed Matsuhashi and Hallet to see when, once the subject moved his finger, any tones occurred. The goal was to identify their own equivalent of Libet's W, their own estimation of the timing of the conscious intention to move, which they would call "T"(time)

Testing the hypothesis that 'conscious intention occurs after movement genesis has already begun' required the researchers to analyse the distribution of responses to tones before actions. The idea is that, after time T, tones will lead to vetoing and thus a reduced representation in the data. There would also be a point of no return P where a tone was too close to the movement onset for the movement to be vetoed. In other words, the researchers were expecting to see the following on the graph: many unsuppressed responses to tones while the subjects are not yet aware of their movement genesis, followed by a drop in the number of unsuppressed responses to tones during a certain period of time during which the subjects are conscious of their intentions and are stopping any movements, and finally a brief increase again in unsuppressed responses to tones when the subjects do not have the time to process the tone and prevent an action – they have passed the action's "point of no return". That is exactly what the researchers found (see the graph on the right, below).

[[File:TimingConsciousIntentiontoMoveHistogram.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphing tones as they appeared (or didn't) in the time before any action. In this case, researchers believe the subject becomes aware of his actions at about -1.769 seconds (this is time 'T'). A typical subject's ERP recordings suggest movement preparation as early as −2.8 seconds.]]
The graph shows the times at which unsuppressed responses to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (dubbed "tone events" on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but a significant decrease in tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about −1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden increase in the number of tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (−1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to [[Event-related potential|ERP]] measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about −2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T — like Libet's original W — was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.&lt;ref name="Matsuhashi, M. 2008"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Haggard describes other studies at the neuronal levels as providing "a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations"&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt; such as the one just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements, and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of [[planning]] has implications for free will and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher [[Alfred Mele]] also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our "conscious self" has become aware of it does not mean our consciousness does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.&lt;ref name=mele&gt;{{cite book

===Unconsciously cancelling actions===
The possibility that human "free won't" is also the prerogative of the subconscious is being explored.

====Retrospective judgement of free choice====
[[File:LED traffic light.jpg|thumb|left|140px|As green light switches to yellow, research seems to suggest that humans cannot tell the difference between "deciding" to keep driving, and having no time to decide at all.]]

Recent research by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness may not be what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it ''easy'' to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the [[introspection illusion]]. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to "veto" an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====The experiment=====
The experiment involved asking volunteers to respond to a go-signal by pressing an electronic "go" button as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; In this experiment the go-signal was represented as a visual stimulus shown on a monitor (e.g. a green light as shown on the picture). The participants' reaction times (RT) were gathered at this stage, in what was described as the "primary response trials".

The primary response trials were then modified, in which 25% of the go-signals were subsequently followed by an additional signal – either a "stop" or "decide" signal. The additional signals occurred after a "signal delay" (SD), a random amount of time up to 2 seconds after the initial go-signal. They also occurred equally, each representing 12.5% of experimental cases. These additional signals were represented by the initial stimulus changing colour (e.g. to either a red or orange light). The other 75% of go-signals were not followed by an additional signal – and was therefore considered the "default" mode of the experiment. The participants' task of responding as quickly as possible to the initial signal (i.e. pressing the "go" button) remained.

Upon seeing the initial go-signal, the participant would immediately intend to press the "go" button. The participant was instructed to cancel their immediate intention to press the "go" button if they saw a stop signal. The participant was instructed to select randomly (at their leisure) between either pressing the "go" button, or not pressing it, if they saw a decide signal. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown after the initial go-signal ("decide trials"), for example, required that the participants prevent themselves from acting impulsively on the initial go-signal and then decide what to do. Due to the varying delays, this was sometimes impossible (e.g. some decide signals simply appeared too ''late'' in the process of them both intending to and pressing the go button for them to be obeyed).

Those trials in which the subject reacted to the go-signal impulsively without seeing a subsequent signal show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which the decide signal was shown too late, and the participant had already enacted their impulse to press the go-button (i.e. had not decided to do so), also show a quick RT of about 600&amp;nbsp;ms. Those trials in which a stop signal was shown and the participant successfully responded to it, do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant decided not to press the go-button, also do not show a response time. Those trials in which a decide signal was shown, and the participant had not already enacted their impulse to press the go-button, but (in which it was theorised that they) had had the opportunity to decide what to do, show a comparatively slow RT, in this case closer to 1400&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

The participant was asked at the end of those "decide trials" in which they had actually pressed the go-button whether they had acted impulsively (without enough time to register the decide signal before enacting their intent to press the go-button in response to the initial go-signal stimulus), or had acted based upon a conscious decision made after seeing the decide signal. Based upon the response time data however, it appears there was discrepancy between when the user thought they had had the opportunity to decide (and had therefore not acted on their impulses) – in this case deciding to press the go-button, and when they thought they had acted impulsively (based upon the initial go-signal) – where the decide signal came too late to be obeyed.

=====The rationale=====

Kuhn and Brass wanted to test participant self-knowledge. The first step was that after every decide trial, participants were next asked whether they had actually had time to decide. Specifically, the volunteers were asked to label each decide trial as either failed-to-decide (the action was the result of acting impulsively on the initial go-signal) or successful decide (the result of a deliberated decision). See the diagram on the right for this decide trial split: failed-to-decide and successful decide; the next split in this diagram (participant correct or incorrect) will be explained at the end of this experiment. Note also that the researchers sorted the participants’ successful decide trials into "decide go" and "decide nogo", but were not concerned with the nogo trials since they did not yield any RT data (and are not featured anywhere in the diagram on the right). Note that successful stop trials did not yield RT data either.
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionTrials.png|thumb|right|400px|The different types of trials and their different possible outcomes.]]

Kuhn and Brass now knew what to expect: primary response trials, any failed stop trials, and the "failed-to-decide" trials were all instances where the participant obviously acted impulsively – they would show the same quick RT. In contrast, the "successful ''decide''" trials (where the decision was a "go" and the subject moved) should show a slower RT. Presumably, if deciding whether to veto is a conscious process, volunteers should have no trouble distinguishing impulsivity from instances of true deliberate continuation of a movement. Again, this is important since decide trials require that participants rely on self-knowledge. Note that stop trials cannot test self-knowledge because if the subject ''does'' act, it is obvious to them that they reacted impulsively.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

=====Results and implications=====
[[File:RetrospectiveConstructionGraph.png|thumb|left|300px|The general distribution of reaction times for the different trials. Notice the timing of the two peaks for trials labelled "successful decide".]]
Unsurprisingly, the recorded RTs for the primary response trials, failed stop trials, and "failed-to-decide" trials all showed similar RTs: 600&amp;nbsp;ms seems to indicate an impulsive action made without time to truly deliberate. What the two researchers found next was not as easy to explain: while some "successful decide" trials did show the tell-tale slow RT of deliberation (averaging around 1400&amp;nbsp;ms), participants had also labelled many impulsive actions as "successful decide". This result is startling because participants should have had no trouble identifying which actions were the results of a conscious "I will not veto", and which actions were un-deliberated, impulsive reactions to the initial go-signal. As the authors explain:

{{cquote|[The results of the experiment] clearly argue against Libet's assumption that a veto process can be consciously initiated. He used the veto in order to reintroduce the possibility to control the unconsciously initiated actions. But since the subjects are not very accurate in observing when they have [acted impulsively instead of deliberately], the act of vetoing cannot be consciously initiated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;}}

In decide trials the participants, it seems, were not able to reliably identify whether they had really had time to decide – at least, not based on internal signals. The authors explain that this result is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a conscious veto, but simple to understand if the veto is considered an unconscious process.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; Thus it seems that the intention to move might not only arise from the subconscious, but it may only be inhibited if the subconscious says so. This conclusion could suggest that the phenomenon of "consciousness" is more of narration than direct arbitration (i.e. unconscious processing causes all thoughts, and these thoughts are again processed subconsciously).

After the above experiments, the authors concluded that subjects sometimes could not distinguish between "producing an action without stopping and stopping an action before voluntarily resuming", or in other words, they could not distinguish between actions that are immediate and impulsive as opposed to delayed by deliberation.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt; To be clear, one assumption of the authors is that all the early (600&amp;nbsp;ms) actions are unconscious, and all the later actions are conscious. These conclusions and assumptions have yet to be debated within the scientific literature or even replicated (it is a very early study).

The results of the trial in which the so-called "successful decide" data (with its respective longer time measured) was observed may have possible implications{{clarify|date=June 2012}} for our understanding of the role of consciousness as the modulator of a given action or response — and these possible implications cannot merely be omitted or ignored without valid reasons, specially when the authors of the experiment suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated.&lt;ref name="Kuhn Brass 2009"/&gt;

It is worth noting that Libet consistently referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"/&gt; That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any at all). This veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by Kühn and Brass using their decide signal.

Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds &amp;mdash; a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D. ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The point of no return ===
In early 2016, [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] published a paper by researchers in [[Berlin]], Germany, ''The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements'', in which the authors set out to investigate whether human subjects had the ability to veto an action (in this study, a movement of the foot) after the detection of its [[Bereitschaftspotential]] (BP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The point of no return in vetoing self-initiated movements|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/1080|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2016-01-26|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4743787|pmid = 26668390|pages = 1080–1085|volume = 113|issue = 4|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1513569112|first = Matthias|last = Schultze-Kraft|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Birman|first3 = Marco|last3 = Rusconi|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Allefeld|first5 = Kai|last5 = Görgen|first6 = Sven|last6 = Dähne|first7 = Benjamin|last7 = Blankertz|first8 = John-Dylan|last8 = Haynes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bereitschaftspotential, which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; is an instance of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neural oscillation|electrical activity]] within the [[motor cortex]], quantified by the use of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], that occurs moments before a motion is performed by a person: it is considered a signal that the brain is "getting ready" to perform the motion. The study found evidence that these actions can be vetoed even after the BP is detected (i. e. after it can be seen that the brain has started preparing for the action). The researchers maintain this is evidence for the existence of at least some degree of free will in humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neuroscience and Free Will Are Rethinking Their Divorce|url = http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/a-neuroscience-finding-on-free-will.html|website = Science of Us|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously, it had been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brain might not stand in the way of free will|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22144-brain-might-not-stand-in-the-way-of-free-will/|website = New Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-13|first = Anil|last = Ananthaswamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, given the unconscious nature of the BP and its usefulness in predicting a person's movement, these are movements that are initiated by the brain without the involvement of the conscious will of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21870/free_will_web.pdf|title = Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism|date = |access-date = |website = Oxford University|publisher = Oxford University Press|last = Swinburne|first = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Libet Experiments|url = http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libet_experiments.html|website = www.informationphilosopher.com|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that subjects were able to "override" these signals and stop short of performing the movement that was being anticipated by the BP. Furthermore, researchers identified what was termed a "point of no return": once the BP is detected for a movement, the person could refrain from performing the movement only if they attempted to cancel it 200 [[millisecond]]s or longer before the onset of the movement. After this point, the person was unable to avoid performing the movement. Previously, [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, USA, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuronal prediction of free will ===
Despite criticisms, experimenters are still trying to gather data that may support the case that conscious "will" can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so.&lt;ref name="soonetal" /&gt; Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex ([[anterior]] [[Lateral and medial|medial]] [[prefrontal cortex]]) and [[precuneus]]/[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[cingulate cortex]] (medial [[parietal cortex]]). In order to ensure report timing of conscious "will" to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.

Another version of the fMRI multivariate pattern analysis experiment was conducted using an abstract decision problem, in an attempt to rule out the possibility of the prediction capabilities being product of capturing a built-up motor urge.&lt;ref name="SoonHe2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soon|first1=C. S.|last2=He|first2=A. H.|last3=Bode|first3=S.|last4=Haynes|first4=J.-D.|title=Predicting free choices for abstract intentions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=15|year=2013|pages=6217–6222|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212218110|pmid=23509300|pmc=3625266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each frame contained a central letter like before, but also a central number, and a surrounding 4 possible "answers numbers". The participant first chose in their mind whether they wished to perform an addition or difference (subtraction) operation (and noted the central letter on the screen at the time of this decision). The participant then performed the mathematical operation based on the central numbers shown in the next two frames. In the following frame the participant then chose the "answer number" corresponding to the result of the operation. They were further presented with a frame which allowed them to indicate the central letter appearing on the screen at the time of their original decision. This version of the experiment discovered a brain prediction capacity of up to 5 seconds before the conscious will to act.

Multivariate pattern analysis using EEG has suggested that an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions.&lt;ref name="BodeSewell2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=S.|last2=Sewell|first2=D.

Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine the nature of the stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes.&lt;ref name="MattlerPalmer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattler|first1=Uwe|last2=Palmer|first2=Simon|title=Time course of free-choice priming effects explained by a simple accumulator model|journal=Cognition|volume=123|issue=3|year=2012|pages=347–360|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.002|pmid=22475294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain activity data).&lt;ref name="LagesJaworska2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lages|first1=Martin|last2=Jaworska|first2=Katarzyna|title=How Predictable are "Spontaneous Decisions" and "Hidden Intentions"? Comparing Classification Results Based on Previous Responses with Multivariate Pattern Analysis of fMRI BOLD Signals|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=3|year=2012|issn=1664-1078|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a recent study has sought to confirm the applicability of a perceptual decision model to free will decisions.&lt;ref name="BodeBogler2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=Stefan|last2=Bogler|first2=Carsten|last3=Haynes|first3=John-Dylan|title=Similar neural mechanisms for perceptual guesses and free decisions|journal=NeuroImage|volume=65|year=2013|pages=456–465|issn=1053-8119|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.09.064|pmid=23041528}}&lt;/ref&gt; When shown a masked and therefore invisible stimulus, participants were asked to either guess between a category or make a free decision for a particular category. Multivariate pattern analysis using fMRI could be trained on "free decision" data to successfully predict "guess decisions", and trained on "guess data" in order to predict "free decisions" (in the [[cuneus|precuneus and cuneus]] region).

Contemporary voluntary decision prediction tasks have been criticised based on the possibility the neuronal signatures for pre-conscious decisions could actually correspond to lower conscious processing rather than unconscious processing.&lt;ref name="MillerSchwarz2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Jeff|last2=Schwarz|first2=Wolf|title=Brain signals do not demonstrate unconscious decision making: An interpretation based on graded conscious awareness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=24|year=2014|pages=12–21|issn=1053-8100|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2013.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may be aware of their decisions before making their report yet need to wait several seconds to be certain. Such a model does not however explain what is left unconscious if everything can be conscious at some level (and the purpose of defining separate systems). Yet limitations remain in free will prediction research to date. In particular, the prediction of considered judgements from brain activity involving thought processes beginning minutes rather than seconds before a conscious will to act, including the rejection of a conflicting desire. Such are generally seen to be the product of sequences of evidence accumulating judgements.

===Retrospective construction===

It has been suggested that sense authorship is an illusion.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00002-0 |title=The mind's best trick: How we experience conscious will |year=2003 |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=65–69 |pmid=12584024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconscious causes of thought and action might facilitate thought and action, while the agent experiences the thoughts and actions as being dependent on conscious will. We may over-assign agency because of the evolutionary advantage that once came with always suspecting there might be an agent doing something (e.g. predator). The idea behind retrospective construction is that, while part of the "yes, I did it" feeling of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] seems to occur during action, there also seems to be processing performed after the fact – after the action is performed – to establish the full feeling of agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2004_2/Rakos_2004.pdf | title=The Belief in Free Will as a Biological Adaptation: Thinking Inside and Outside the Behavior Analytic Box | author=Richard F.

Unconscious agency processing can even alter, in the moment, how we perceive the timing of sensations or actions.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2497 |title=Human volition: Towards a neuroscience of will |year=2008 |last1=Haggard |first1=Patrick |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=934–46 |pmid=19020512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007"/&gt; Kühn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in "successful decide" RT's. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials that should have been labelled "failed to decide" were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They say that people "persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes" when in fact we do a great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs.

It should be noted that criticism to Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. criticism by H. Andersen in his paper with the title 'Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will' ; Also as a criticism, read "On the alleged illusion of conscious will' by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem. Other papers can be found).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulating choice===

[[File:Transcranial magnetic stimulation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] uses magnetism to safely stimulate or inhibit parts of the brain.]]
Some research suggests that [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] can be used to manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice.&lt;ref name="Walsh2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Walsh|title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Neurochronometrics of Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rACRPwAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Mit Press|isbn=978-0-262-73174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task.&lt;ref name="ammon"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.8.705 |title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation can influence the selection of motor programmes |year=1990 |last1=Ammon |first1=K |last2=Gandevia |first2=S C |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=705–7 |pmid=2213050 |pmc=488179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammon and Gandevia found that it was possible to influence which hand people move by stimulating [[frontal lobe|frontal]] regions that are involved in movement planning using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.

Right-handed people would normally choose to move their right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, [[Alvaro Pascual-Leone]] and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the transcranial magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.&lt;ref name="Brasil-NetoPascual-Leone1992"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.55.10.964 |title=Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation and response bias in a forced-choice task |year=1992 |last1=Brasil-Neto |first1=J P |last2=Pascual-Leone |first2=A |last3=Valls-Sole |first3=J |last4=Cohen |first4=L G |last5=Hallett |first5=M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=964–6 |pmid=1431962 |pmc=1015201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, a team of researchers from the UK and the US published a paper demonstrating similar findings. The researchers concluded that "motor responses and the choice of hand can be modulated using [[Transcranial direct-current stimulation|tDCS]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/JOCN_A_00848|title=Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Motor Cortex Biases Action Choice in a Perceptual Decision Task |year=2015 |last1=Javadi |first1=Amir-Homayoun |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=2174–85 |pmid=26151605 |last2=Beyko |first2=Angeliki |last3=Walsh |first3=Vincent |pmc=4745131}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a different attempt by Sohn ''et al.'' failed to replicate such results;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.7.985 |title=The effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on movement selection |year=2003 |last1=Sohn |first1=Y H |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=985–7 |pmid=12810802 |last2=Kaelin-Lang |first2=A |last3=Hallett |first3=M |pmc=1738563}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, [[Jeffrey Alan Gray|Jeffrey Gray]] wrote in his book ''Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem'' that tests looking for the influence of electromagnetic fields on brain function have been universally negative in their result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Jeffrey Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping up on the Hard Problem |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-852090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulating the perceived intention to move===

Various studies indicate that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies have focused on the pre-[[supplementary motor area]] (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008"/&gt; In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual awareness of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating [[premotor cortex|premotor]] brain regions.&lt;ref name="DesmurgetReilly2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desmurget|first1=M.|last2=Reilly|first2=K. T.|last3=Richard|first3=N.|last4=Szathmari|first4=A.|last5=Mottolese|first5=C.|last6=Sirigu|first6=A.|title=Movement Intention After Parietal Cortex Stimulation in Humans|journal=Science|volume=324|issue=5928|year=2009|pages=811–813|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.1169896|pmid=19423830}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.

This suggests that awareness of an intention to move may literally be the "sensation" of the body's early movement, but certainly not the cause. Other studies have at least suggested that "The greater activation of the SMA, SACC, and parietal areas during and after execution of internally generated actions suggests that an important feature of internal decisions is specific neural processing taking place during and after the corresponding action. Therefore, awareness of intention timing seems to be fully established only after execution of the corresponding action, in agreement with the time course of neural activity observed here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/neuro.09.014.2007 |title=High-frequency oscillations in distributed neural networks reveal the dynamics of human decision making |year=2008 |last1=Guggisberg |first1=Adrian G. |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=1 |pmid=18958227 |last2=Dalal |first2=SS |last3=Findlay |first3=AM |last4=Nagarajan |first4=SS |pages=14 |pmc=2525986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment involved an electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while the participant was led to believe they were entirely self-conducted.&lt;ref name="WegnerWheatley1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wegner|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Wheatley|first2=Thalia|title=Apparent mental causation: Sources of the experience of will.|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=7|year=1999|pages=480–492|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480|pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and it was found that if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones they were more likely to say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires: priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).

Lau et al. set up an experiment where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) pulse, and the other was given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16&amp;nbsp;ms, and shifted back the 14&amp;nbsp;ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200&amp;nbsp;ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements.&lt;ref name="LauRogers2007" /&gt; Often it is thought that if free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.

===Related models===

The idea that intention co-occurs with (rather than causes) movement is reminiscent of "forward models of motor control" (or FMMC, which have been used to try to explain [[inner speech]]). FMMCs describe parallel circuits: movement is processed in parallel with other predictions of movement; if the movement matches the prediction – the feeling of agency occurs. FMMCs have been applied in other related experiments. Metcalfe and her colleagues used an FMMC to explain how volunteers determine whether they are in control of a computer game task. On the other hand, they acknowledge other factors too. The authors attribute feelings of agency to desirability of the results (see [[self serving bias]]es) and top-down processing (reasoning and inferences about the situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.009 |title=Metacognition of agency across the lifespan |year=2010 |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Janet |last2=Eich |first2=Teal S. |last3=Castel |first3=Alan D. |journal=Cognition |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=267–82 |pmid=20570251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, it is by the application of the forward model that one might imagine how other consciousness processes could be the result of efferent, predictive processing. If the conscious self is the efferent copy of actions and vetoes being performed, then the consciousness is a sort of narrator of what is already occurring in the body, and an incomplete narrator at that. Haggard, summarizing data taken from recent neuron recordings, says "these data give the impression that conscious intention is just a subjective corollary of an action being about to occur".&lt;ref name=HaggardDT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Parallel processing helps explain how we might experience a sort of [[Libertarian free will|contra-causal free will]] even if it were determined.

How the brain constructs [[consciousness]] is still a mystery, and cracking it open would have a significant bearing on the question of free will. Numerous different models have been proposed, for example, the [[Multiple Drafts Model]] which argues that there is no central [[Cartesian theater]] where conscious experience would be represented, but rather that consciousness is located all across the brain. This model would explain the delay between the decision and conscious realization, as experiencing everything as a continuous 'filmstrip' comes behind the actual conscious decision. In contrast, there exist models of [[Cartesian materialism]] that have gained recognition by neuroscience, implying that there might be special brain areas that store the contents of consciousness; this does not, however, rule out the possibility of a conscious will. Other models such as [[epiphenomenalism]] argue that conscious will is an illusion, and that consciousness is a by-product of physical states of the world. Work in this sector is still highly speculative, and researchers favor no single model of consciousness. (See also: [[Philosophy of mind]].)

Auditory hallucinations produced by Schizophrenia seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Wegner2003" /&gt; The left brain of people whose hemispheres have been disconnected has been observed to invent explanations for body movement initiated by the opposing (right) hemisphere, perhaps based on the assumption that their actions are consciously willed.&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gazzaniga|first1=Michael S.|title=The Cognitive Neurosciences|year=1984|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, people with 'alien hand syndrome' are known to conduct complex motor movements against their will.&lt;ref name="GeschwindIacoboni1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geschwind|first1=D.

=== Neural models of voluntary action ===
A neural model for voluntary action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.&lt;ref name="Haggard, P. 2008" /&gt; The first involving early preparatory signals ([[basal ganglia]] [[substantia nigra]] and [[striatum]]), prior intention and deliberation (medial [[prefrontal cortex]]), motor preparation/readiness potential ([[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]]), and motor execution ([[primary motor cortex]], [[spinal cord]] and [[muscle]]s). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping ([[premotor cortex]], [[primary motor cortex]], [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal cortex]], and back to the [[premotor cortex]]). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input ('when decision'), motivations/reasons for actions (early 'whether decision'), task and action selection ('what decision'), a final predictive check (late 'whether decision') and action execution.

Another neural model for voluntary action also involves what, when, and whether (WWW) based decisions.&lt;ref name="BrassLynn2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brass|first1=Marcel|last2=Lynn|first2=Margaret T.|last3=Demanet|first3=Jelle|last4=Rigoni|first4=Davide|title=Imaging volition: what the brain can tell us about the will|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=229|issue=3|year=2013|pages=301–312|issn=0014-4819|doi=10.1007/s00221-013-3472-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 'what' component of decisions is considered a function of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], which is involved in conflict monitoring.&lt;ref name="MuellerBrass2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Veronika A.|last2=Brass|first2=Marcel|last3=Waszak|first3=Florian|last4=Prinz|first4=Wolfgang|title=The role of the preSMA and the rostral cingulate zone in internally selected actions|journal=NeuroImage|volume=37|issue=4|year=2007|pages=1354–1361|issn=1053-8119|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.06.018|pmid=17681798}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing ('when') of the decisions are considered a function of the [[Supplementary motor area|preSMA and SMA]], which is involved in motor preparation.&lt;ref name="Krieghoff2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krieghoff|first1=Veronika|title=Dissociating what and when of intentional actions|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=3|year=2009|issn=1662-5161|doi=10.3389/neuro.09.003.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, the 'whether' component is considered a function of the [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] medial [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="BrassLynn2013"/&gt;

=== Prospection ===
{{Main article|Prospection}}
[[Martin Seligman]] and others criticize the classical approach in science which views animals and humans as "driven by the past", and suggest instead that people and animals draw on experience to evaluate prospects they face, and act accordingly. The claim is made that this purposive action includes evaluation of possibilities that have never occurred before, and is experimentally verifiable.&lt;ref name=Seligman1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

Seligman and others argue that free will and the role of subjectivity in consciousness can be better understood by taking such a "prospective" stance on cognition, and that "accumulating evidence in a wide range of research suggests [this] shift in framework".&lt;ref name=Seligman2/&gt;

'''Nicholas Osborne Tomalin''' (30 October 1931 – 17 October 1973) was an [[United Kingdom|English]] [[journalist]] and [[writer]].

Tomalin was the son of Miles Tomalin, a Communist poet and veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He studied [[English literature]] at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. As a student he was President of the [[Cambridge Union]] and editor of the prestigious undergraduate ''[[Granta]]'' magazine. He graduated in 1954 and began work as a [[Correspondent|foreign correspondent]] for various [[London]] newspapers. He married fellow Cambridge graduate [[Claire Tomalin]] in 1955&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freebmd.org.uk search on Tomalin marriages post 1953&lt;/ref&gt; and they had three daughters and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freebmd.org.uk search on Tomalin/Delavenay births post 1955&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of numerous affairs on his part (and hers),&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Claire "Several Strangers" p.8&lt;/ref&gt; they remained together until his death.

He later co-wrote a book with Ron Hall about amateur sailor [[Donald Crowhurst]]'s failed attempt to circumnavigate the world and subsequent suicide.
His article ''[[The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong]]'' was included in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s collection ''[[The New Journalism]]'', which was a collection of non-fiction pieces emblematic of a new movement of reporting aimed at revolutionising the field.

Tomalin's articles often began with bombastic statements on their subject matter. The most famous of these is: "The only qualities essential for real success in journalism are ratlike cunning, a plausible manner and a little literary ability".&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Nicholas "Stop the press I want to get on" ''Sunday Times Magazine'' 26 October 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomalin was killed in Israel by a Syrian [[wire-guided missile]] on 17 October 1973 while reporting on the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejournalistsmemorial.rsf.org/spip.php?id_article=1297 Tomalin info at The Journalist's Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005 the journalism trade publication ''[[Press Gazette]]'' named Tomalin among its top forty 'journalists of the modern era'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=32585 Press Gazette names top forty journalists of the modern era]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overkill''' is a character from the [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]] toyline from [[Hasbro]], which has spawned comics and cartoon series. He first appeared in the 1989 ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' incarnation of the series. He also appears in ''[[G.I. Joe: Sigma 6]]''.

==History==
If the [[file card]]s that came with the Overkill action figures are to be believed, there are actually two different characters that owned the name Overkill. Both versions of the character are the leader of the [[B.A.T. (G.I. Joe)|B.A.T.]]s (short for Battle Android Troopers) that are controlled by the ruthless [[Cobra Command|Cobra Organization]].

The first Overkill was an experimental prototype of the B.A.T. with an advanced computer system and tactical logic programs but was considered by Cobra as too expensive to move to mass production. Despite being a soulless automaton, this Overkill is frequently referred to as a "he".

The second version appeared in 2003 as part of the [[G.I. Joe vs. Cobra]] series. This Overkill is a cyborg, which is half-man and half-machine. The file card spells his name as "Over Kill" rather than one word although news releases and the credits in [[G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom|''Valor vs. Venom'']] spelled it as "Overkill".

==Comics==

===Real American Hero - Devil's Due===
Overkill made his first comic appearance in the [[Devil's Due Publishing|Devil's Due]] G.I. Joe comics and was revealed to be Robert Skelton, the infamous SAW Viper from the Marvel Comics, who had killed a number of Joes, including the Joes' medical officer [[Doc (G.I. Joe)|Doc]], the tank driver [[Heavy Metal (G.I. Joe)|Heavy Metal]], and the A.W.E. Striker driver [[Crankcase (G.I. Joe)|Crankcase]].&lt;ref&gt;''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #109.&lt;/ref&gt; Skelton is recruited by [[Serpentor]] and his new organization, [[the Coil]]. This is after ten men are sent to bring him in, he kills four.

He chooses the name Overkill, in reference to his impressive body count. He participates in the battle against the Joes and Cobra on [[Cobra Island]] and fights with [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]], and would have killed him had [[Kamakura (G.I. Joe)|Kamakura]] not intervened and saved Hawk. Wounded, Overkill made his way onto a submarine with an escaping Cobra Commander and collapses, expressing the desire for power.&lt;ref&gt;''G.I.Joe: A Real American Hero'' vol. 2 #25 (Oct. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was experimented on by Cobra scientists and given his own mobile targeting system and robotic implants (including cutting off his hand for an implant). He did battle with the Joes in Badhikstan and proved to be a formidable opponent before being defeated by [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], he begged Snake Eyes to kill him, as he did not want to live like this, but Snake Eyes refused to and Overkill was last seen lying in the desert.

He was later a patient at a Cobra facility raided by Torpedo, Wet-Suit, and a group of Navy SEALs.&lt;ref&gt;''G.I.Joe Special Missions: Antarctica&lt;/ref&gt;

He was killed in the America's Elite series, during Tomax's raid on ''The Coffin'', a prison run by G.I. Joe.&lt;ref&gt;''G.I.Joe America's Elite'' #31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigma Six - Devils Due===
The [[G.I. Joe: Sigma 6]] version of Overkill also has a comic appearance, in GI Joe: Sigma 6 #3 also from [[Devil's Due Publishing|Devil's Due]]. In the Sigma 6 comics, each issue featured one or two Joes paired up against a Cobra character. Overkill's Joe opponent was Tunnel Rat. The storyline has Tunnel Rat alone in the Arctic without his Sigma suit having to try and stop Overkill and his army of B.A.T.s. A preview of the comic is available at the Devil's Due minisite for the Sigma 6 comics.

==Toys==
Overkill was first released as an action figure in 1991, as part of the Talking Battle Commanders line.&lt;ref name="30thAnnPg140"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Official 30th Anniversary Salute To G.I. Joe 1964-1994|last= Santelmo|first= Vincent|year= 1994|publisher= Krause Publications|ISBN= 0-87341-301-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartoon==

===DiC cartoon===
Overkill made his first animated appearance in the [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]]-produced ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]].&lt;ref name="VOICE CREDITS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=4404 |title=The Voices of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1989, Animated Series) - Voice Cast Listing at Voice Chasers |publisher=Voicechasers.com |date=1989-09-02 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he appeared to be fully robotic, and his appearance was that of his first action figure. His key episode in this series is "The Eliminator", in which he receives an upgrade via the Eliminator chip, which makes him stronger, faster and smarter. This puts him in Cobra Commander's good graces.

Other DiC appearances include:
* "The Eliminator"—Overkill gets an upgraded laser in his chest (Laser is included in his V1 action figure) and becomes 'The Eliminator'. 
* "The Sword"—where he's sent by Cobra Commander to retrieve the Sword of Destiny from [[Night Creepers|Night Creeper Leader]] (who, naturally enough, wants it for himself).
* "El Dorado: The Lost City of Gold"—where he's possessed by the spirit of Commander Fernando Luiz Jorge Pizarro, cousin to the explorer [[Francisco Pizarro]].
* "Kindergarten Commandos"—Overkill shows up to help Cobra Commander fight off the forces of six small children and the G.I. Joe [[Mercer (G.I. Joe)|Mercer]]. His appearance in this episode is relatively minor.
* "Keyboard Warriors"—Another minor appearance.

===Valor vs. Venom===
Overkill returned in the CGI movie ''[[G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom]]'' by [[Reel FX Creative Studios|Reel FX]], now clearly a half-human and half-machine cyborg version, with a variety of robotic appendages and a tendency to repeat the end of his sentences in a manic tone of voice. He serves Cobra as [[Doctor Mindbender]]'s lab assistant and BAT commander. Overkill looks down upon "organics", and believes he and his BATs are better candidates to rule the world. In a series of fortuitous circumstances, he makes an alliance with "Venomous Maximus", a mutated and brainwashed [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]]. Together, they attempted to remove [[Cobra Commander]] from power, and control Cobra themselves. The Joes are able to turn Maximus back into Hawk, and the Cobra base begins to explode around Overkill, who IS seemingly crushed in the ensuing explosion. However, following the credits, Overkill's robotic hand rises up on the screen. This has been theorized as a preview of the abandoned ''Robot Revolution'' line rumored to be following ''Valor vs. Venom''.

===Sigma 6===
Overkill returns in ''[[G.I. Joe: Sigma 6]]'', he is now inside a rejuvenation tank and wearing new armor, appearing far more robotic than when he last appeared. He is also revamped from a monotonous automaton lab assistant to Cobra's chief scientist. He is smarter and more devious, with a free will of his own.

Overkill is still attempting to overthrow Cobra Commander with his new B.A.T.s, this time in secret, and has a new more powerful BAT called Overlord Vector, which he uses to kidnap General Hawk's son, Scott. Overkill believed Scott had hacked into Cobra's computers, and possessed a formula which would allow his B.A.T.s to evolve as they fought. His kidnapping of Scott ultimately led the Joes to Cobra's underwater headquarters. However, when Overkill scanned Scott's mind, he found that his discovery was just pure dumb luck. Overkill fled as [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] battled his creation, Overlord Vector. Overkill managed to escape, and still resides in his tank inside his lab in the underground Cobra base, now planning to get hold of the power stones sought by the Joes and Cobra, to launch his Robot Revolution. With the foiling of Cobra's power stones plot, Overkill has apparently given up that quest.

During the second season of the cartoon, Overkill is finally able to create himself a body, and is removed from his healing tank.

==Video game==
Overkill appeared as a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in 1992's ''[[List of G.I. Joe video games#G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor|G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor]]'' for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

"'''The Princes in the Tower'''" is an expression frequently used to refer to [[Edward V of England|Edward V, King of England]] and [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]]. The two brothers were the only sons of [[Edward IV of England]] and [[Elizabeth Woodville]] surviving at the time of their father's death in 1483. When they were 12 and 9 years old, respectively, they were lodged in the [[Tower of London]] by the man appointed to look after them, their uncle, the [[Lord Protector]]: [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]]. This was supposedly in preparation for Edward's forthcoming [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] as king. However, Richard took the throne for himself and the boys disappeared.

It is unclear what happened to the boys after they disappeared in the Tower. It is generally assumed that they were murdered; a common hypothesis is that they were killed by Richard in an attempt to secure his hold on the throne. Their deaths may have occurred some time in 1483, but apart from their disappearance, the only evidence is circumstantial. As a result, several other hypotheses about their fates have been proposed, including the suggestion that they were murdered by [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] or [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], among others. It has also been suggested that one or both princes may have escaped assassination. In 1487, [[Lambert Simnel]] initially claimed to be Richard, Duke of York, but later claimed to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]]. From 1491 until his capture in 1497, [[Perkin Warbeck]] claimed to be Richard, Duke of York, having supposedly escaped to Flanders. Warbeck's claim was supported by some contemporaries (including the aunt of the disappeared princes, [[Margaret of York]]).

In 1674, workmen at the Tower dug up a wooden box containing two small human skeletons. The bones were found in a box under the staircase in the Tower of London. The bones were widely accepted at the time as those of the princes, but this has not been proven and is far from certain. [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] had the bones buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], where they remain.

==Background==
On 9 April 1483, Edward IV of England died unexpectedly after an illness lasting around three weeks.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;{{cite web|last=Horrox|first=Rosemary|title=Edward IV of England|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8520/?back=,8521|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2004|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Edward's son, the new King Edward V, was at [[Ludlow Castle]], and the dead king's brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was at [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire. The news reached Gloucester around 15 April, although he may have been forewarned of Edward's illness.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; It is reported that he then went to [[York Minster]] to publicly "pledge his loyalty to his new king".&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; The [[Croyland Chronicle]] states that, before his death, Edward IV designated his brother Gloucester as [[Lord Protector]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Crowland Chronicle Continuations, 1459–1486,'' Nicholas Pronay and John Cox (eds.), (Richard III and Yorkist History Trust, Gloucester: 1986), p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's request may not have mattered, however, since "as the precedent of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] showed, the [[privy council|council]] was not bound to follow the wishes of a dead king".&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

Edward V and Gloucester set out for London from the west and north respectively, meeting at [[Stony Stratford]] on 29 April. The following morning, Gloucester arrested Edward's [[retinue]] including the boys' uncle, [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers]], and their half-brother [[Richard Grey|Sir Richard Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://words.fromoldbooks.org/Chalmers-Biography/w/wydeville-anthony-earl-rivers.html Chalmers' Biography, vol. 32, p. 351]&lt;/ref&gt; They were sent to [[Pontefract Castle]] in Yorkshire where, on 25 June, they were beheaded.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; Gloucester then took possession of the prince himself, prompting [[Elizabeth Woodville]] to take her other son, [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and her daughters into [[Right of asylum#Medieval England|sanctuary]] at Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

Edward V and Gloucester arrived in London together. Plans continued for Edward's coronation, but the date was postponed from 4 May to 25 June.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; On 19 May 1483 Edward was lodged in the [[Tower of London]], then the traditional residence of monarchs prior to coronation.&lt;ref name=Rhodes/&gt; On 16 June, he was joined by his younger brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], who was previously in sanctuary.&lt;ref name=Rhodes/&gt; At this point the date of Edward's coronation was indefinitely postponed by their uncle, Gloucester. On Sunday 22 June, a sermon was preached at [[St Paul's Cathedral|Saint Paul's Cross]] claiming Gloucester to be the only legitimate heir of the House of York. On 25 June, "a group of lords, knights and gentlemen" petitioned Richard to take the throne.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; Both princes were subsequently declared illegitimate by Parliament; this was confirmed in 1484 by an [[Act of Parliament]] known as ''[[Titulus Regius]]''. The act stated that Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's marriage was invalid because of Edward's [[precontract|pre-contract of marriage]] with [[Lady Eleanor Talbot|Lady Eleanor Butler]].&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; Gloucester was crowned King Richard III of England on 3 July.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hammond and Anne Sutton, ''The Coronation of Richard III: the Extant Documents'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration of the boys' illegitimacy has been described by Rosemary Horrox as an [[ex post facto]] justification for Richard's accession.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;

==Disappearance==
[[Dominic Mancini]], an Italian friar who visited England in the 1480s and who was in London in the spring and summer of 1483, recorded that after Richard III seized the throne, Edward and his younger brother Richard were taken into the "inner apartments of the Tower" and then were seen less and less until they disappeared altogether. Mancini records that during this period Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, "like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him."&lt;ref&gt;"The Usurpation of Richard the Third", ''Dominicus Mancinus ad Angelum Catonem de occupatione regni Anglie per Riccardum Tercium libellus''; Translated to English by C.A.J. Armstrong (London, 1936)&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin reference to "Argentinus medicus", was originally translated as "a Strasbourg doctor"; however, D.E. Rhodes suggests it may actually refer to "Doctor Argentine", whom Rhodes identifies as [[John Argentine]], an English physician who would later serve as provost of [[King's College, Cambridge]], and as doctor to [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], eldest son of King [[Henry VII of England]] (Henry Tudor).&lt;ref name=Rhodes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=D.E.|title=The Princes in the Tower and Their Doctor|journal=The English Historical Review|date=April 1962|volume=77|issue=303|pages=304–306|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ehr/lxxvii.ccciii.304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports of the two princes being seen playing in the Tower grounds shortly after Richard joined his brother, but there are no recorded sightings of either of them after the summer of 1483.&lt;ref name = "walk"&gt;R. F. Walker, "Princes in the Tower", in S. H. Steinberg et al, ''A New Dictionary of British History'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1963, p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to rescue them in late July failed.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; Their fate remains an enduring mystery.

Many historians believe the princes were murdered, some suggesting that the act may have happened towards the end of summer 1483. [[Maurice Keen]] argues that the rebellion against Richard in 1483 initially "aimed to rescue Edward V and his brother from the Tower before it was too late", but that, when the Duke of Buckingham became involved, it shifted to support of Henry Tudor because "Buckingham almost certainly knew that the princes in the Tower were dead."&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Keen, ''England in the Later Middle Ages: A Political History'', Routledge: New York, 2003, p.388.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Weir]] proposes 3 September 1483 as a potential date;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Weir, ''The Princes of the Tower'' (p. 157)&lt;/ref&gt; however, Weir's work has been criticised for "arriving at a conclusion that depends more on her own imagination than on the uncertain evidence she has so misleadingly presented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Charles T|title=Review: Richard III: A Medieval Kingship. by John Gillingham; The Princes in the Tower. by Alison Weir|journal=Speculum|date=April 1995|volume=70|issue=2|pages=371–372|publisher=Cambridge University Press: Medieval Academy of America|doi=10.2307/2864918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Clements Markham]] suggests the princes may have been alive as late as July 1484, pointing to the regulations issued by Richard III's household which stated: "the children should be together at one breakfast".&lt;ref name=Markham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markham|first=Sir Clement Robert|title=Richard III: A Doubtful Verdict Reviewed|journal=The English Historical Review|date=April 1891|volume=6|issue=22|pages=250–283|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ehr/vi.xxii.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gairdner]], however, argues that it is unclear to whom the phrase "the children" alludes, and that it may not have been a reference to the princes.&lt;ref name=Gairdner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gairdner|first=James |title=Did Henry VII Murder the Princes?|journal=The English Historical Review|date=July 1891|volume=6|issue=23|pages=444–464|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/ehr/vi.xxiii.444}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may refer to [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (son of the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]]) and Edward IV's two youngest daughters ([[Catherine of York|Catherine]] and [[Bridget of York|Bridget]]), all of whom were living under Richard's care at [[Sheriff Hutton]].&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

==Evidence==
[[File:DelarocheKingEdward.jpg|thumb|''King Edward V and the Duke of York in the Tower of London'' by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The theme of innocent children awaiting an uncertain fate was popular amongst 19th-century painters. [[Edward V]] is again depicted wearing the [[Order of the Garter]]. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]
Other than their disappearance, there is no direct evidence that the princes were murdered, and "no reliable, well-informed, independent or impartial sources" for the associated events.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;  Nevertheless, following their disappearance, rumours quickly spread that they had been murdered. Only one contemporary narrative account of the boys' time in the tower exists: that of [[Dominic Mancini]]. Mancini's account was not discovered until 1934, in the Municipal Library in [[Lille]]. Later accounts written after the accession of Henry Tudor are often claimed to be biased or influenced by Tudor propaganda.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

Four unidentified bodies have been found which are considered possibly connected with the events of this period: two at the [[Tower of London]] and two in [[Saint George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]]. Those found in the Tower were buried in  [[Westminster Abbey]], but the Abbey authorities have refused to allow either set of remains to be subjected to DNA analysis to positively identify them as the remains of the princes.&lt;ref name=Guardian2013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/05/princes-in-tower-staying-under|title=Why the princes in the tower are staying six feet under|first1=Alan|last1=Travis|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rumours===
Several sources suggest there were rumours of the princes' deaths in the time following their disappearance. Rumours of murder also spread to France. In January 1484 [[:fr: Guillaume de Rochefort|Guillaume de Rochefort]], [[Lord Chancellor of France]], urged the Estates General to "take warning" from the fate of the princes, as their own king, [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], was only 13.&lt;ref name=Gairdner/&gt; The early reports, including that of Rochefort, [[Philippe de Commines]] (French politician), Caspar Weinreich (contemporary German chronicler) and Jan Allertz (Recorder of Rotterdam), all state that Richard killed the princes before he seized the throne (thus before June 1483).&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; De Commines' ''Memoirs'' (c.1500), however, identifies the Duke of Buckingham as the person "who put them to death".&lt;ref&gt;Philippe de Commines, ''Memoirs: the Reign of Louis XI, 1461–83'', Translated by Michael Jones (1972), pp.354, 396–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only Mancini's account is truly contemporary, having been written in London before November 1483.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; The Croyland Chronicle and de Commines' account were written three and seventeen years later, respectively (and thus after Richard III's death and the accession of Henry VII). Markham, writing long before Mancini's account was discovered, argued that some accounts, including the [[Croyland Chronicle]], might have been authored or heavily influenced by [[John Morton (bishop)|John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury]], in order to incriminate Richard III.&lt;ref name=Markham/&gt;

– [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|King Richard III]]'' (Act IV, scene ii)}}
[[Robert Fabyan]]'s ''Chronicles of London'', compiled around 30 years after the princes' disappearance, names Richard as murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fabyan|first=Robert|title=Chronicles of London|year=1902|orig-year=first published 1516|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=https://archive.org/details/chroniclesoflond00kinguoft|editor=Charles Lethbridge Kingsford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas More]] (a Tudor loyalist who had grown up in the household of [[John Morton (cardinal)|John Morton]], an avowed foe of Richard III), wrote The ''History of King Richard III'', c.1513. This identified Sir [[James Tyrrell]] as the murderer, acting on Richard's orders. Tyrrell was the loyal servant of Richard III who is said to have confessed to the murder of the princes before his execution for treason in 1502. In his history, More said that the princes were smothered to death in their beds by two agents of Tyrrell (Miles Forrest and John Dighton) and were then buried "at the stayre foote, metely depe in the grounde vnder a great heape of stones", but were later disinterred and buried in a secret place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/801/kingrichard.pdf?sequence=1 ''The History of King Richard the Third''], by Sir Thomas More.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polydore Vergil]], in his ''Anglica Historia'' (c.1513), also specifies that Tyrrell was the murderer, stating that he "rode sorrowfully to London" and committed the deed with reluctance, upon Richard III's orders, and that Richard himself spread the rumours of the princes' death in the belief that it would discourage rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Polydore Vergil, ''[http://www.r3.org/bookcase/polydore.html Anglica Historia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226004142/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/polydore.html |date=26 February 2009 }}'' 1846 edition, p. 188-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holinshed's Chronicles]], written in the second half of the 16th century, claims that the princes were murdered by Richard III. The chronicles were one of the main sources used by [[William Shakespeare]] for his play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', which also portrays Richard as the murderer, in the sense that he commissions Tyrrell to have the boys killed. [[A. J. Pollard]] believes that the chronicle's account reflected the contemporary "standard and accepted account", but that by the time it was written "propaganda had been transformed into historical fact".&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=A.J.|title=Richard III and the princes in the tower|year=1991|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing|isbn=0862996600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Thomas More wrote his account with the intention of writing about a moral point rather than a closely mirrored history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker-Smith|first1=Dominic|title=Thomas More|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-more/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While More's account does rely on some firsthand sources, the account is generally taken from other sources. Additionally, More's account is one of the bases for William Shakespeare's ''Richard III'', which similarly indicts Richard for murdering the young princes.

===Bodies===

====Tower of London====
In 1675, some workmen remodelling the [[Tower of London]] dug up a wooden box containing two small human skeletons. The bones were found buried 10&amp;nbsp;ft under the staircase leading to the chapel of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]]. They were not the first children's skeletons found within the tower; the bones of two children had previously been found "in an old chamber that had been walled up", which Pollard suggests could equally well have been those of the princes.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; The reason the bones were attributed to the princes was because the location partially matched that given by More. However, More also stated that they were later moved to a "better place",&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas More, ''The History of King Richard II'', R.S. Sylvester (ed.), (Newhaven: 1976), p.88&lt;/ref&gt; which does not match with the bones discovered. One anonymous report was that they were found with "pieces of rag and velvet about them"; the velvet could indicate that the bodies were those of aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Alison.  ''The Princes in the Tower''. 1992, Random House, {{ISBN|9780345391780}}, p. 252-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after their discovery,&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; the bones were placed in an urn and, on the orders of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], interred in [[Westminster Abbey]], in the wall of the [[Henry VII Lady Chapel]]. A monument designed by [[Christopher Wren]] marks the resting-place of the putative princes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LoLlvnRPY_sC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=urn+designed+by+christopher+wren+edward+v&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l30Phxh_vz&amp;sig=nHYMHLKa9XtlBcvdjS-5t8-8TZw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zws6UdHaM8-R7Abjk4CwAQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=urn%20designed%20by%20christopher%20wren%20edward%20v&amp;f=false John Steane, ''The Archaeology of the Medieval English Monarchy'' (Routledge, 1993), page 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bones were removed and examined in 1933, by the archivist of Westminster Abbey, Lawrence Tanner; a leading anatomist, Professor William Wright; and the president of the Dental Association, [[George Northcroft]]. By measuring certain bones and teeth, they concluded the bones belonged to two children around the correct ages for the princes.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; The bones were found to have been interred carelessly along with chicken and other animal bones. There were also three very rusty nails. One skeleton was larger than the other, but many of the bones were missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one. Many of the bones had been broken by the original workmen.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r3.org/on-line-library-text-essays/isolde-wigram-were-the-princes-in-the-tower-murdered/ 'Examination on the alleged murder of the Princes'], Wordpress: Richard III Society – American Branch&lt;/ref&gt; The examination has been criticised, on the grounds that it was conducted under the presumption that the bones were those of the princes and concentrated only on whether the bones showed evidence of suffocation. Thus no attempt was even made to determine whether the bones were male or female.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

No further scientific examination has since been conducted on the bones, which remain in Westminster Abbey, and DNA analysis (if DNA could be obtained) has not been attempted. A petition was started on the [[Online petition#E-government petitions in Europe and Australia|British Government's "e-petition" website]] requesting that the bones be DNA tested but closed months before its expected close date.  If it had received 100,000 signatories a parliamentary debate would have been triggered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/45769 Richard III and the Princes – e-petitions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollard points out that even if modern DNA and carbon-dating proved the bones belonged to the princes, it would not prove who or what killed them.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

====St George's Chapel====
In 1789, workmen carrying out repairs in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor]], rediscovered and accidentally broke into the vault of Edward IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville, discovering in the process what appeared to be a small adjoining vault. This vault was found to contain the coffins of two unidentified children. However, no inspection or examination was carried out and the tomb was resealed. The tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV's children: George, 1st Duke of Bedford who had died at the age of 2, and Mary of York who had died at the age of 14; both had predeceased the King.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter Records XXIII to XXVI, The Chapter Library, St. George's Chapel,

418–419. (1913).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vetusta Monumenta, Volume III, page 4 (1789).&lt;/ref&gt;
However, two lead coffins clearly labelled as George Plantagenet and Mary Plantagenet were subsequently discovered elsewhere in the Chapel (during the excavation for the royal tomb house for King George III under the Wolsey tomb-house in 1810–13), and were moved into the adjoining vault of Edward IV's, but at the time no effort was made to identify the two lead coffins already in Edward IV's vault.&lt;ref&gt;Lysons &amp; Lysons, Magna Britannia, 1812 supplement p. 471. Also in Britton's Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain, 1812 page 45. The move to Edward IV's crypt mentioned in Samuel Lewis, "A Topographical Dictionary of Great Britain" 1831.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, work was being carried out near and around Edward IV's tomb in St George's Chapel; the floor area was excavated to replace an old boiler and also to add a new repository for the remains of future Deans and Canons of Windsor.  A request was forwarded to the Dean and Canons of Windsor to consider a possible examination of the two vaults either by fibre-optic camera or, if possible, a reexamination of the two unidentified lead coffins in the tomb also housing the lead coffins of two of Edward IV's children that were discovered during the building of the Royal Tomb for King George III (1810–13) and placed in the adjoining vault at that time.  Royal consent would be necessary to open any royal tomb, so it was felt best to leave the medieval mystery unsolved for at least the next few generations.&lt;ref&gt;Art Ramirez, "A Medieval Mystery", ''Ricardian Bulletin'', September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 [[Richard III of England#Discovery of remains|Leicester archaeological dig]] has prompted renewed interest in re-excavating the skeletons of the "two princes", but [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has not granted the approval required for any such testing of an interred royal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert McCrum |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/15/king-villains-richard-iii |title=Richard III, the great villain of English history, is due a makeover |work=The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 15 September 2012|accessdate=2013-02-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
[[File:Pedro Américo - Os filhos de Eduardo IV da Inglaterra.jpg|thumb|left|''The children of Edward IV of England'' by [[Pedro Américo]]]] 
The absence of hard evidence of what happened to the Princes has led to a number of theories being put forward. The most common theory is that they were murdered close to the time that they disappeared, and among historians and authors who accept the murder theory, the most common explanation is that they were murdered by Richard.&lt;ref name="The Society - History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardiii.net/2_1_0_richardiii.php|title=The Society – History |publisher=Richardiii.net |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard III===
Many historians conclude that [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] is the likeliest candidate for the disappearance of the princes for a number of reasons. Although the princes had been eliminated from the succession, Richard's hold on the monarchy was very insecure due to the way in which he had attained the crown, leading to a backlash against him by the Yorkist establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Michael|title=Richard III|date=2003|publisher=History Press|location=Stroud|pages=209–210|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt had already been made to rescue them and restore Edward to the throne, clear evidence that the existence of the princes would remain a threat as long as they were alive. The boys could have been used by Richard's enemies as figureheads for rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Michael|title=Richard III|date=2003|publisher=History Press|location=Stroud|page=210|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumours of their death were in circulation by late 1483, but Richard never attempted to prove that they were alive by having them seen in public, which strongly suggests that they were dead by then. However, he did not remain silent on the matter. [[Raphael Holinshed]], in his ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'', written in 1577, reports that Richard, "what with purging and declaring his innocence concerning the murder of his nephews towards the world, and what with cost to obtain the love and favour of the communal tie (which outwardlie glosed, and openly dissembled with him) ... gave prodigally so many and so great rewards, that now both he lacked, and scarce with honesty how to borrow."&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Holinshed, "Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland ", 1577, p.746, commencing on line 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard also failed to open any investigation into the matter, which would have been in his interest if he was not responsible for the deaths of his nephews.

Richard was away from court on a progression through the Yorkist heartlands at the time the princes disappeared; if they died at this time, he would have been unable to murder them in person.&lt;ref name="Michael Hicks 2003 p 210"&gt;Richard III by Michael Hicks (2003) p 210&lt;/ref&gt; They were under guard in the Tower of London, which was controlled by his men, and access to them was strictly limited by his instructions.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Cape"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weir|first1=Alison|title=Elizabeth of York: The First Tudor Queen|date=2013|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could therefore have dispatched one of his retainers to murder the princes on his behalf, but it is unlikely they could have been murdered without his knowledge.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Cape"/&gt; This is the version put forward by More and Polydore Vergil, who both name [[James Tyrrell]] as the murderer. Tyrrell was an English knight who fought for the [[House of York]] on many occasions. Tyrrell was arrested by Henry VII's forces in 1502 for supporting another Yorkist claimant to the throne. Shortly before his execution, Tyrrell is said by [[Thomas More]] to have admitted, under torture, to having murdered the princes at the behest of Richard III.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Horrox, ‘Tyrell, Sir James (c.1455–1502)’, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27952 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography], Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 27 Aug 2013 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only record of this is the writing of Thomas More, who wrote that, during his examination, Tyrrell made his confession as to the murders, saying that Richard III ordered their deaths. He also implicated two other men; despite further questioning, however, he was unable to say where the bodies were, claiming that Brackenbury had moved them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Thomas%20More%20Reader%20IV%203.pdf Thomas More, ''The History of King Richard the Third'']. Accessed 20 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] portrays him as the culprit, sought out by Richard after Buckingham demurs. This version of events is accepted by Alison Weir&lt;ref&gt;The Princes in the Tower by Alison Weir (1992) {{ISBN|978-0-345-39178-0}} pp 156–166&lt;/ref&gt; and Hicks notes that his successful career and rapid promotion after 1483 'is consistent with his alleged murder of the princes'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard III by Michael Hicks (2003) p 189&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only record of Tyrrell's confession is through More, and "no actual confession has ever been found". Pollard casts doubts on the accuracy of More's accounts, suggesting it was "an elaboration of one of several circulating accounts"; however, he does not discount the possibility of it being "just his own invention", pointing to the "clear similarities to the stories of the [[Babes in the Wood]]".&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; [[Clements Markham]] suggests that More's account was actually written by [[John Morton (bishop)|Archbishop Morton]] and that Tyrrell was induced to do the deed by Henry VII between June 16 and July 16, 1486, the dates of two general pardons that he received from the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markham|1906|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard's guilt was widely accepted by contemporaries. George Cely, Dominic Mancini, John Rous, Fabyan’s Chronicle, the Crowland Chronicler and the London Chronicle all noted the disappearance of the Princes, and all bar Mancini (who noted that he had no knowledge of what had happened) repeated rumours naming Richard as the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillaume de Rochefort]], Chancellor of France, named Richard as the murderer to the Estates General at Tours in January 1484.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard 122&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears to have been the belief of Elizabeth Woodville, who would go on to support Henry Tudor in his campaign against Richard III. One possible motive for Elizabeth Woodville subsequently making her peace with Richard and bringing her daughters out of sanctuary could be that Richard had to swear a solemn oath, before witnesses, to protect and provide for her surviving children, which made it much less likely they could be quietly murdered as it was believed their brothers had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weir|first1=Alison|title=Elizabeth of York: The First Tudor Queen|date=2013|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheetham|first1=Antony|title=The Life and Times of Richard III|date=1972|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard III by Michael Hicks (2003) pp 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weir|first1=Alison|title=Elizabeth of York: The First Tudor Queen|date=2013|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|pages=112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this contemporary opinion many current historians, including [[David Starkey]],&lt;ref name="The Society - History"/&gt; [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard III by Michael Hicks (2003) {{ISBN|978-0-7524-2589-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Castor]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen Castor, ''She-Wolves: the Women who Ruled England before Elizabeth'' (Faber, 2010), {{ISBN|978-0-571-23706-7}}, p402&lt;/ref&gt; and A. J. Pollard&lt;ref&gt;Pollard p 135&lt;/ref&gt; regard Richard himself as the most likely culprit.  There was no formal accusation against Richard III on the matter; the [[Bill of Attainder]] brought by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] made no definitive mention of the Princes in the Tower, but it did accuse Richard of "the unnatural, mischievous and great perjuries, treasons, homicides and murders, in shedding of infant's blood, with many other wrongs, odious offences and abominations against God and man".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps]], ''Letters of the Kings of England,'' Vol. 1 (1846), p.161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rotuli Parliamentorum'', J. Strachey (ed.), VI, (1777), p.276&lt;/ref&gt; The "shedding of infant's blood" may be an accusation of the Princes' murder. Hicks speculated that it was a reference to speeches made in Parliament condemning the murder of the princes, which suggested that Richard's guilt had become common knowledge, or at least common wisdom.&lt;ref name="Michael Hicks 2003 p 210"/&gt;

===Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham===
The plausibility of [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], Richard's right-hand man, as a suspect depends on the princes having already been dead by the time Stafford was executed in November 1483. It has been suggested that Buckingham had several potential motives.&lt;ref name="Richard III"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul Murray|title=Richard III|date=1955|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=487–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a descendant of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], through [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]] and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester]] on his father's side, as well as through [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]] through John Beaufort, son of John of Gaunt on his mother's side, Buckingham may have hoped to accede to the throne himself in due course; alternatively, he may have been acting on behalf of a third party.

Some, notably [[Paul Murray Kendall]],&lt;ref name="Richard III"/&gt; regard Buckingham as the likeliest suspect: his execution, after he had rebelled against Richard in October 1483, might signify that he and the king had fallen out; Weir takes this as a sign that Richard had murdered the princes without Buckingham's knowledge and Buckingham had been shocked by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weir|first1=Alison|title=The Princes in the Tower|date=2008|publisher=Vintage|location=London|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary Portuguese document suggests Buckingham as the guilty party, stating "...and after the passing away of king Edward in the year of 83, another one of his brothers, the Duke of Gloucester, had in his power the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, the young sons of the said king his brother, and turned them to the Duke of Buckingham, under whose custody the said Princes were starved to death."&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro Lopes de Chaves (ref: Alvaro Lopes de Chaves, Livro de Apontamentos (1438–1489), (Codice 443 da Coleccao Pombalina da B.N.L.), Imprensa Nacional – Casa da Moeda, Lisboa, 1983), private secretary to the Portuguese King Alfonso V.&lt;/ref&gt; A document dated some decades after the disappearance was found within the archives of the [[College of Arms]] in London in 1980; this stated that the murder "be the vise of the Duke of Buckingham".&lt;ref&gt;College of Arms Collection, Queen Victoria Street, London, manuscript MS 2M6. The entire document containing the reference consists of 126 folios. It appears to have belonged to Christopher Barker whilst he was Suffolk Herald (1514–22), since his name, title, and a sketch of his maternal arms appear on folio. io6r. of the MS.&lt;/ref&gt; This led Michael Bennett to suggest that possibly some of Richard's prominent supporters, Buckingham and Tyrell, murdered the princes on their own initiative without waiting for Richard's orders. Bennett noted in support of this theory: 'After the King's departure Buckingham was in effective command in the capital, and it is known that when the two men met a month later there was an unholy row between them.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Michael|title=The Battle of Bosworth|date=1993|publisher=Alan Sutton|location=Stroud|page=46|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckingham is the only person to be named as responsible in a contemporary chronicle other than Richard himself. However, for two reasons he is unlikely to have acted alone. First of all, if he were guilty of acting without Richard's orders it is extremely surprising that Richard did not lay the blame for the princes' murder on Buckingham after Buckingham was disgraced and executed, especially as Richard could potentially have cleared his own name by doing so.&lt;ref name="The Life and Times of Richard III"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheetham|first1=Antony|title=The Life and Times of Richard III|date=1972|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it is likely he would have required Richard's help to gain access to the princes, under close guard in the Tower of London,&lt;ref name="Jonathan Cape"/&gt; although Kendall argued as Constable of England, he might have been exempt from this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul Murray|title=Richard III|date=1955|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, although it is extremely possible that he was implicated in the decision to murder them, the hypothesis that he acted without Richard's knowledge is not widely accepted by historians.&lt;ref name="The Life and Times of Richard III"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; While Jeremy Potter suggested that Richard would have kept silent had Buckingham been guilty because nobody would have believed Richard was not party to the crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Jeremy|title=Good King Richard? An Account of Richard III and his Reputation|date=1983|publisher=Constable|location=London|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; he further notes that 'Historians are agreed that Buckingham would never have dared to act without Richard's complicity, or at least, connivance'.&lt;ref name="Constable"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Jeremy|title=Good King Richard? An Account of Richard III and his Reputation|date=1983|publisher=Constable|location=London|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Potter also hypothesised that perhaps Buckingham was fantasising about seizing the crown himself at this point and saw the murder of the princes as a first step to achieving this goal.&lt;ref name="Constable"/&gt; This theory formed the basis of Sharon Penman's historical novel, ''The Sunne in Splendour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penman|first1=Sharon|title=The Sunne in Splendour|date=1983|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|pages=884–885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henry VII===
[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (Henry Tudor), following his seizure of the crown, executed some of the rival claimants to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne, Nigel. ''Kings and Queens of England.'' New York: Metro Books, 2010. Print. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; One who was either executed or died in captivity was [[John of Gloucester]], illegitimate son of Richard III.&lt;ref name=Markham/&gt;&lt;ref name="RH" /&gt; Henry was out of the country between the princes' disappearance and August 1485, thus his only opportunity to murder them would have been after his accession in 1485. Pollard suggests Henry (or those acting on his orders) is "the only plausible alternative to Richard III."&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt;

The year after becoming king, Henry married the princes' eldest sister, [[Elizabeth of York]], to reinforce his claim to the throne. Not wanting the legitimacy of his wife or her claim as heiress of Edward IV called into question, prior to the marriage he had repealed the ''Titulus Regius'' which had previously declared the princes (and Elizabeth) illegitimate.&lt;ref name=Markham/&gt; Markham suggests the princes were executed under Henry's orders between 16 June and 16 July 1486, claiming that it was only after this date that orders went out to circulate the story that Richard had killed the princes,&lt;ref name=Markham/&gt; and that the princes' mother, [[Elizabeth Woodville]], knew that this story was false, and so Henry had to have her silenced. Markham suggests this was the motivation behind Henry's decision, in February 1487, to confiscate all of Elizabeth's lands and possessions, and have her confined to [[Bermondsey Nunnery]], "where she died six years afterwards".&lt;ref name=Markham/&gt; However, Arlene Okerlund suggests that her retirement to the nunnery was her own decision,&lt;ref name="Ref_i"&gt;Arlene Okerlund, ''Elizabeth: England's Slandered Queen''. Stroud: Tempus, 2006, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Michael Bennett and Timothy Elston suggests the move was precautionary, precipitated by [[Lambert Simnel]]'s claim to be her son Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Michael, ''Lambert Simnel and the Battle of Stoke'', New York, St. Martin's Press, 1987, pp.42; 51; Elston, Timothy, "Widowed Princess or Neglected Queen" in Levin &amp; Bucholz (eds), ''Queens and Power in Medieval and Early Modern England'', University of Nebraska Press, 2009, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollard calls Markham's theory "highly speculative", and states that Henry's silence over the princes was more likely "political calculation than personal guilt".&lt;ref&gt;Pollard p 130&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was also never accused of the murder by any contemporary, not even by his enemies, which he likely would have been had contemporaries thought there was any possibility of his guilt.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Cape"/&gt; Jeremy Potter, at the time he wrote Chairman of the [[Richard III Society]], noted, 'With Henry, as with Richard, there is no real evidence and one must suspect that if he had killed the princes himself he would quickly have produced the corpses and some ingeniously appropriate story implicating Richard.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Jeremy|title=Good King Richard? An Account of Richard III and his reputation|date=1983|publisher=Constable|location=London|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Raphael Holinshed]] reported in 1577 that Richard "purged and declared is innocence" regarding "the murther of his nephews towards the world", indicating that the boys did indeed meet their end during Richard's days.&lt;ref&gt;Holinshed, Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland, 1577 p746.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unlikely that the princes would have been kept alive in secret by Richard for 2 years after their last sighting while rumours of his responsibility for their murder circulated.

===Other suspects===
Some writers have also accused [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk]]; [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]], Henry VII's mother; and [[Jane Shore]] (Edward IV's mistress). Pollard writes of these theories: "None deserve serious consideration. The problem with all these accusations is that they beg the question of access to the Tower without Richard's knowledge and overlook the fact that Richard was responsible for the safekeeping of his nephews".&lt;ref&gt;Pollard p 127&lt;/ref&gt; The Beaufort theory has more recently been supported by [[Philippa Gregory]] and is explored in her ''[[Cousins' War]]'' novels, as well as her BBC documentary series ''The Real White Queen and her Rivals'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gregory|first1=Philippa|title=Philippa Gregory tells the true story behind The White Queen|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-06-16/philippa-gregory-tells-the-true-story-behind-the-white-queen|website=Radio Times|publisher=The Radio Times (BBC)|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not supported by any evidence other than a speculative one of possible motive.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Cape"/&gt;

===Other claims===
Historian [[David Baldwin (historian)|David Baldwin]] suggests that Henry VII's reticence on the subject may have been due to the fact that at least one of the princes was still alive; he considers that the likelier candidate for survival would be Richard and that Edward may have died of a malady.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=David|title=Richard III|date=2013|publisher=Amberley|location=Stroud|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin argues that it is "impossible" that no one knew what happened to the Princes after they entered the Tower;&lt;ref name=BEEB&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=David|title=The White Queen – What happened to the Princes in the Tower?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/23574430|work=[[BBC]] History|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believes Richard III and Henry VII, leading courtiers and their mother would all have known the boys' whereabouts and welfare.&lt;ref name=BEEB/&gt; Baldwin argues that had this been the case, Henry VII would have had the choice of keeping quiet about the survival of Richard, or having him executed, and concluded, "He [Henry] would have been happy to let people ''think'' the boys had been murdered, but not to speculate when or by whose hand."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the reign of Henry VII, two individuals claimed to be Richard, Duke of York, who had somehow escaped death. Lambert Simnel initially claimed to be Richard, before changing his story and claiming to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=djIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=lambert+simnel&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IZwoUqS_I8Pm7AaDn4C4AQ&amp;ved=0CGwQuwUwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=lambert%20simnel&amp;f=false David Hume, ''The history of England, from the invasion of Julius Cæsar to the revolution in 1688'' (1812), p323-324]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perkin Warbeck]] later claimed to be Richard, appearing in Ireland and calling himself king Richard IV.&lt;ref name = "enc"&gt;Wagner, John, ''Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses'', ABC-CLIO, 2001, p.289.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret of York]], Duchess of Burgundy, formally recognised Warbeck as Richard. Margaret, Richard III's sister, an unrelenting opponent of Henry VII, had previously recognised Simnel as Warwick.&lt;ref name = "enc"/&gt; Warbeck was also accepted as Richard by [[James IV of Scotland]]. After a failed attempt to invade England he was captured. He retracted his claims, was imprisoned and later executed. Many modern historians believe he was an imposter, whose supporters accepted his claim for political reasons.&lt;ref name = "enc"/&gt;

The fact that two persons claimed to be Richard led the 18th century writer [[Horace Walpole]] to argue that Richard had in fact escaped death, and that Warbeck genuinely was Richard,&lt;ref&gt;Sabor, Peter (ed), ''Horace Walpole: The Critical Heritage'', Routledge, 1987, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; a view also supported by [[Malcolm Laing]]. Walpole, however, later retracted his views and stated that he now believed the princes to have been murdered by Richard III to secure his hold on the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard 214–216&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times the theory that Warbeck was Richard has been endorsed by Annette Carson, a freelance writer with a "lifelong interest" in Richard III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annette Carson|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/team/acarson.html|website=University of Leicester: Richard III team|publisher=University of Leicester|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that Richard smuggled the princes abroad to the custody of their aunt, the [[Margaret of York|Duchess of Burgundy]], and they were raised there under false identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Annette|title=Richard III: The Maligned King|date=2013|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud|pages=172–174|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin's theory was that by having removed them from sight to prevent them being a focus for opposition, he was then unable to bring them back to court to scotch rumours of their murder without once again having them become a threat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=David|title=Richard III|date=2013|publisher=Amberley|location=Stroud|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The political reality of the disappearance of the princes, whatever happened to them, is that they were believed to have been murdered and Richard was blamed for their murders.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard pp. 137–139&lt;/ref&gt; Even if he had not been directly responsible for their deaths, the fact that he had deposed them and kept them under tight guard made him responsible for their welfare in the eyes of contemporaries, and the belief that they had been murdered made him guilty via negligence if not directly.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard p 138&lt;/ref&gt; As Baldwin noted in support of his conclusion that Richard would not have murdered the princes, "It seems incredible Richard ever supposed killing his nephews would help secure his position or make him more acceptable to his subjects."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An initial uprising in September 1483, aimed at deposing Richard and restoring Edward V to the throne, was not stopped by rumours of Edward's murder.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks p. 211-212&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the rebels rallied around Henry Tudor as a potential alternative candidate, who was, as Horrox notes, "an inconceivable choice if Edward V and his brother were thought to be still available."&lt;ref name=RH/&gt;  Anthony Cheetham, who considered Richard likely did have the princes murdered, commented that it was "a colossal blunder. Nothing else could have prompted the deflated Woodvilles to hitch themselves to Henry Tudor's bandwagon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheetham|first1=Anthony|title=The Life and Times of Richard III|date=1972|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the majority of the rebels were wealthy and powerful southern noblemen, loyal to Edward IV, suggests a degree of revulsion against Richard's usurpation of the throne:&lt;ref&gt;Hicks p 211&lt;/ref&gt; their willingness to fight on under an implausible alternative candidate suggests that they regarded anyone as preferable to Richard as King due to his usurpation and the murder of his nephews.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett suggested that perhaps those who had initially supported Richard in his seizure of power may have felt complicit in the crime, which he thought "might explain the bitterness of the subsequent recriminations against him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Michael|title=The Battle of Bosworth|date=1993|publisher=Alan Sutton|location=Stroud|page=45|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hicks speculated that these men may have been "appalled by the character of the regime...shocked by Richard's crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Hicks pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Their defection severely weakened Richard, who had to impose his supporters among the northern lords as officeholders in the southern counties to maintain order, in itself a very unpopular act that further damaged his reputation.&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; In Pollard's words, "the belief that he had murdered his nephews seriously handicapped Richard's efforts to secure himself on the throne he had usurped."&lt;ref&gt;Pollard p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The mystery of the Princes in the Tower has had a great impact on literature and television, spawning several award-winning novels such as [[Josephine Tey]]'s ''[[The Daughter of Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deighton|first1=Selected by the Crime Writers' Association ; edited by Susan Moody ; foreword by Len|title=Hatchard's Crime Companion : the top 100 Crime novels of all times|date=1990|publisher=Hatchard|location=London|isbn=0-904030-02-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four novels in [[Philippa Gregory]]'s Cousins' War series, as well as aspects of [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', wherein boy heirs are apparently murdered. The continued publishing of these novels and stories have contributed to the continued fascination with this mystery.

'''Robert Hichens''' (16 September 1882 – 23 September 1940) was a British sailor who was part of the deck crew on board the {{RMS|Titanic}} when she [[The sinking of the RMS Titanic|sank on her maiden voyage on 15 April 1912]]. He was one of six [[quartermaster]]s on board the vessel and was at the [[ship's wheel]] when the ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg. In 1906, he married Florence Mortimore in Devon, England; when he registered for duty aboard the ''Titanic'', his listed address was in Southampton, where he lived with his wife and two children.&lt;ref name="MarEx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Men on the Titanic|url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/three-men-on-the-titanic#gs.2mxfbYM|website=The Maritime Executive|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en|date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hichens gained notoriety after the disaster because of his conduct in [[Titanic Lifeboat No. 6|Lifeboat No. 6]], of which he was in command. Passengers accused him of refusing to go back to rescue people from the water after the ship sank, that he called the people in the water "stiffs," and that he constantly criticised those at the [[oar]]s while he was manning the [[rudder]]. Hichens was later to testify at the [[United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|US Inquiry]] that he had never used the words "stiffs" and that he had other words to describe bodies. He would also testify to have been given direct orders by second mate [[Charles Lightoller]] and Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward Smith]] to row to where a light could be seen (a steamer they thought) on the port bow, drop off the passengers and return. Later it was alleged that he complained that the lifeboat was going to drift for days before any rescue came.  At least two boat 6 passengers publicly accused Hichens of being drunk: Major [[Arthur Godfrey Peuchen]] and [[Eloise Hughes Smith|Mrs Lucian Philip Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Hichens, Quartermaster|url=http://www.williammurdoch.net/mystery02_witness_hichens_r.html|website=www.williammurdoch.net|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the {{RMS |Carpathia}} came to rescue ''Titanic''{{'}}s survivors he said that the ship was not there to rescue them, but to pick up the bodies of the dead. By this time the other people in the lifeboat had lost patience with Hichens. Although Hichens protested, [[Denver]] millionaire [[Margaret Brown|Margaret "Molly" Brown]] told the others to start rowing to keep warm. After a last attempt by Hichens to keep control of the lifeboat, Brown threatened to throw him overboard. These events would later end up being depicted in the Broadway [[musical theater|musical]] and film, ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]''. During the US inquiry into the disaster, Hichens denied the accounts by the passengers and crew in lifeboat 6. He had been initially concerned about the suction from the ''Titanic'' and later by the fact that being a mile away from the wreck, with no compass and in complete darkness, they had no way of returning to the stricken vessel.

==Later life==
Hichens served with the [[Army Service Corps]] during World War One; by 1919 he was third officer on a small ship named ''Magpie''.  The Hitchens moved to Devon sometime in the 1920s where Robert purchased a motor boat from a man named Harry Henley and operated a boat charter.  In 1931, his wife and children left him and moved to Southampton.  In 1933, Hichens was jailed for attempting to murder Henley and was released in 1937.&lt;ref name="MarEx" /&gt;   

==Death==
On 23 September 1940, at age 58, Hichens died  of heart failure aboard the ship ''[[English Trader]]'', while it was moored off the coast of [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spignesi|first=Stephen J|title=The Titanic for Dummies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-1-118-17766-2|page=113|chapter=Surviving the Sinking of the Titanic|quote=He died of heart failure possibly resulting from stomach cancer or a gastric ulcer in 1940 aboard the ship ''English Trader'' off the Coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, at the age of 58. It was thought he was buried at sea until his grave was discovered in Aberdeen, Scotland in 2012 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17551053.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was buried in Section 10, Lair 244 of Trinity Cemetery, in Aberdeen.

==Depicted in fiction==
Hichens' conduct was featured in the 1997 blockbuster, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', in which he was played by [[Paul Brightwell]]. He was depicted as a tall thin man with a [[cockney]] accent, when in fact he was 5' 6", had a stocky build and spoke with a pronounced Cornish accent. He was also depicted saying "shut that hole in your face" to Molly Brown, but in fact those words were spoken by a steward in lifeboat 8.

Hichens' conduct was also depicted in the 1996 miniseries ''[[Titanic (1996 TV miniseries)|Titanic]]'', in which he was played by [[Martin Evans (actor)|Martin Evans]]. Hichens is shown telling the survivors in his lifeboat to "pipe down" when they get excited about spotting a flare from a ship on the horizon. He strongly protests when Molly Brown starts encouraging the other women to row towards the light, and she threatens to throw Hichens overboard. This depiction is more accurate than in the 1997 blockbuster.

Hichens was portrayed by an uncredited actor in the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'', which also portrays his conflict with Molly Brown in a more accurate manner.

Hichens' negative attitude was further depicted in Diane Hoh's 1998 romance novel ''[[Titanic: The Long Night (1998 romance novel)|Titanic: The Long Night]]'', which recounts his conduct as well as that of Molly Brown, from the viewpoint of Elizabeth Farr, a fictional lifeboat passenger. Molly Brown urged lifeboat passengers to start rowing to keep warm, and Hichens protested, declaring that he was commanding the lifeboat, and he made a move to stop her. "I will throw you overboard if you interfere," she told him in this account.

In September 2010, Hichens' name was brought back into the limelight by [[Louise Patten]], granddaughter of the most senior officer to have survived the ''Titanic'' disaster, second officer [[Charles Lightoller]]. In press interviews leading up to the publication of her latest novel, ''Good as Gold'' (into which she has worked the story of the catastrophe), Patten reports that a "straightforward" steering error by Hichens, brought about by his misunderstanding of a [[Tiller#Tiller orders|tiller order]], caused the ''Titanic'' to hit an iceberg in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100922/lf_nm_life/us_britain_titanic_book |title= ''Titanic'' sunk by steering mistake, author says |agency= Reuters |date= 22 September 2010 |accessdate= 25 September 2010 |author= Mike Collett-White (reporter), Paul Casciato (editor) |publisher= Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11390144 |title= Family's ''Titanic'' secret revealed |publisher= BBC News Northern Ireland|accessdate=25 September 2010|date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patten's allegation that Hichens caused the disaster by turning the ship's wheel the wrong way is not supported by testimony at both the British and US enquiries, which established that the second watch officer, Sixth Officer [[James Paul Moody|James Moody]], was stationed behind Hichens, supervising his actions, and he had confirmed to First Officer [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] that the order had been carried out correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Tim; Aston, Eloise (2010). ''101 Things You Thought You Knew About the Titanic...But Didn't'' London: Beautiful Books. {{ISBN|1-905636-68-7}}, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq03Hichens01.php |title= Testimony of Robert Hichens (Quartermaster, SS ''Titanic'') |work= British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry |accessdate= 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq07Olliver01.php United States Senate Enquiry: Testimony of Alfred Olliver]&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim was also disputed by Hichens' great-granddaughter on Channel 4 News. Sally Nilsson explained that Hichens was a well-trained Quartermaster with years of experience steering large vessels. He had been responsible on his watch for steering the ''Titanic'' for four days before the collision and would not have made such a glaring error. As to the steering orders, in 1912 they were as follows: There was only one way of giving steering orders. The order was always given with reference to the tiller. To go to port the Officer ordered starboard. The Quartermaster turned the wheel to port, tiller went to starboard and the ship turned to port. This was a hangover from the old days when ships were steered with tillers, steering oars etc. The change in steering orders did not occur until the 1930s. Sally Nilsson's biography on the life of Robert Hichens was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nillsson|first=Sally|title=The Man Who Sank Titanic: The Troubled Life of Quartermaster Robert Hichens|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud, England|isbn=978-0-7524-6071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hichens also appears in the play ''Iceberg – Right Ahead!'' by Chris Burgess which debuted on 22 March 2012 at [[Upstairs at the Gatehouse]]. In this production, he was played by Liam Mulvey.

==Confucianism==
[[File:Confucius Tang Dynasty.jpg|thumb|100px|Tang Dynasty depiction of Confucius]]
Confucian role ethics centers around [[filial piety]] or ''xiao'', a respect for family members.&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&amp;pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is elaborated in the Confucian text ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'': "In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity."&lt;ref name="Ikels"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edited by Charlotte Ikels|title=Filial Piety: Practice and Discourse in Contemporary East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpSpC15JHeoC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=21 November 2012|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4791-2|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filial duty requires the desire to be filial, and not just the act of filial piety.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Fraser|author2=Dan Robins|author3=Timothy O'Leary|title=Ethics in Early China: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2Qqf6ZXxh0C&amp;pg=PA35|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8028-93-1|pages=17–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Confucian societies, filial piety determines the "moral worth" of an individual in a community and acts as a form of [[social capital]].&lt;ref name="Ikels"/&gt;

According to [[Roger T. Ames]] and Henry Rosemont, "Confucian normativity is defined by living one's family roles to maximum effect." In Confucian role ethics, morality is based on a person's fulfillment of a role, such as that of a parent or a child. These roles are established as relationships, and are not individualistic. Confucian roles are not [[rationalism|rational]], and originate through the ''xin'', or human emotions.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

The concept of ''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' or ritual propriety is crucial to Confucian roles. Propriety reinforces family relationships, and binds together the community. The performance of li expresses a person's moral commitment as a human being.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;

In Japan, modern Confucian scholars like [[Uno Tetsuto]] and [[Ichimura Sanjiro]] have attempted to mix Confucian role ethics with concepts such as [[democracy]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snU6hyIVMawC&amp;pg=PA191|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17281-3|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">[[Image:Nimrod ST 07.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A sandek holds an infant during the ''brit milah''.]]
A '''sandek''' ({{lang-he-n|סנדק}} 'companion of child') is a person honored at a [[Judaism|Jewish]] ''[[brit milah]]'' ([[circumcision]]) ceremony, traditionally either by holding the baby boy on the [[knee]]s or [[thigh]]s while the [[mohel]] performs the brit milah, or by handing the baby to the mohel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebris.com/bris_stuff_sandek.html Kogen, Fred R. "Defining Sandek." ''The Bris Mila'']&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term has been attributed to a derivation from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''sunteknos'' (''syn-'' meaning 'plus' and ''tekno'' meaning 'child'), which means 'companion of child'.&lt;ref name="Kogen"&gt;Kogen.  See [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=225&amp;letter=S&amp;search=sandek|the Jewish Encyclopedia] for more detailed etymological coverage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbi]] [[Moses Isserles]] (the Rema) recorded the practice of the sandek holding the baby on his thighs ([[Yoreh De'ah|Yoreh Dayah]] 265:11). The [[Biur Hagra]] (YD 265:44) cites the [[Midrash Shocher Tov|Midrash Shochar Tov]], that explains that this is based on [[Psalm 35]]:10, which states, "All my bones shall say: '&lt;small&gt;[[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]&lt;/small&gt; who is like you?'"&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 35:10. Translation based on the [[Jewish Publication Society]]'s 1917 [[Hebrew Bible]] [[Bible translation|translation]], ''[[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|Holy Scriptures According to the Masoretic Text]]'' [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et2635.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Midrash]] outlines how every body part is used in the service of God and says that the sandek's thighs participate in the service of God by placing the baby on them during the brit.

The Rema records a custom that a father should not honour the same individual twice with being the sandek for his children. The reason is that the sandek is compared to a ''[[kohen]]'' (priest) offering the ''[[ketoret]]'' (incense offering) in the ''[[Beit HaMikdash]]'' ([[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]]). The procedure regarding the ketoret is that a kohen does not perform this ''[[mitzva]]'' (commandment) more than once in his lifetime. God rewards with wealth the kohen who offers the ketoret. Thus, the opportunity is afforded to as many kohanim as possible to become wealthy ([[Babylonian Talmud]] Tractate [[Yoma]] 26a). Similarly, the opportunity is afforded to as many people as possible to serve as a sandek and receive God's blessing to become wealthy.

The [[Vilna Gaon]] (Gra) (YD 265:45) expresses some skepticism regarding this custom. First, based on its reasoning, the custom should have been that one should not serve more than once as a sandek for any child, not just two different children of one family. Second, the Gra writes that no one has become wealthy because he served as a sandek. Nevertheless, the [[Aruch Hashulchan]] (Y.D. 265:34) concludes, that the custom recorded by the Rema should be observed. The Aruch Hashulchan notes, though, that the custom in many locales is that the ''[[rav]]'' (rabbi) of the city serves as the sandek for all the baby boys. The Aruch Hashulchan justifies this practice by comparing the local rav to the ''[[kohen gadol]]'' (high priest), who had the right to offer a ''[[korban]]'' (sacrifice) or ketoret any time he desired (see Yoma 14a). Indeed, it is related that the [[Chazon Ish]] served as the sandek for innumerable baby boys. Rabbi [[Yissocher Frand]] relates that Rav [[Yaakov Yitzchak Ruderman]] (the ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' (dean) of Yeshivat [[Ner Yisrael]]) also served as the sandek for countless baby boys.

The honor was given traditionally to one Jewish male: some older family member (grandfather, great-grandfather), a rabbi, or another important male who was observant and righteous.&lt;ref name="Kogen"/&gt; The sandek also wore the ''[[tallit]]'' (prayer shawl) and held the baby on a pillow while the mohel completed the circumcision.&lt;ref name="Kogen"/&gt; In modern times, among some more liberal Jews, the sandek may be female or even [[Gentile|non-Jewish]].&lt;ref name="Kogen"/&gt; At most ceremonies there is only a single sandek, but two are permissible, although more than two is uncommon.&lt;ref name="Kogen"/&gt; 

During the brit, a chair is sometimes placed next to the sandek's seat. The chair is reserved for the [[prophet]] [[Elijah]] and remains unoccupied during the ceremony; this practice is derived from the tradition that Elijah protects children from danger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred J. Kolatch|Kolatch, Alfred J.]] ''The Jewish Book of Why''. Jonathan David: New York, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8246-0256-0}}  .&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources the sandek is the "representative" of Elijah.&lt;ref&gt;Shoulson, Joel. "Orientation." {{cite web |url=http://www.moheljoel.com/orientation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108055531/http://moheljoel.com/orientation.htm |archivedate=2006-11-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suffering''', or '''pain''' in a broad sense,&lt;ref&gt;See '[[#Terminology|Terminology]]'. See also the entry 'Pleasure' in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pleasure/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], which begins with this paragraph: "Pleasure, in the inclusive usages most important in moral psychology, ethical theory, and the studies of mind, includes all joy and gladness&amp;nbsp;— all our feeling good, or happy. It is often contrasted with similarly inclusive pain or suffering, which is similarly thought of as including all our feeling bad." It should be mentioned that most encyclopedias, like the one mentioned above and Britannica, do not have an article about suffering and describe pain in the physical sense only.&lt;/ref&gt; may be an experience of unpleasantness and aversion associated with the perception of [[harm]] or threat of harm in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Wayne Hudson in Historicizing Suffering, Chapter 14 of Perspectives on Human Suffering (Jeff Malpas and Norelle Lickiss, editors, Springer, 2012) : "According to the standard account suffering is a universal human experience described as a negative basic feeling or emotion that involves a subjective character of unpleasantness, aversion, harm or threat of harm to body or mind (Spelman 1997; Cassell 1991)."&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative [[valence (psychology)|valence]] of [[affective]] [[phenomena]]. The opposite of suffering is [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]].

Suffering is often categorized as physical&lt;ref&gt;Examples of physical suffering: [[pain]] of various types, excessive heat, excessive cold, [[itching]], [[hunger]], [[thirst]], [[nausea]], [[air hunger]], [[sleep deprivation]] {{cite web |url=http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section%3DGeneral_Resource_Links%26Template%3D%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D3058 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926205544/http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=General_Resource_Links&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=3058 |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}{{cite web |url=http://www.palliative.uab.edu/response/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028180547/http://www.palliative.uab.edu/response/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}.

Examples of mental suffering: [[depression (mood)]] / [[hopelessness]], [[grief]], [[sadness]] / [[loneliness]] / [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], [[disgust]], [[irritation]], [[anger]], [[jealousy]], [[envy]], [[tanha|craving or yearning]], [[frustration]], [[anguish]], [[angst]], [[fear]], [[anxiety]] / [[panic]], [[shame]] / [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret (emotion)|regret]], [[embarrassment]] / [[humiliation]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]].&lt;/ref&gt; It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.

Suffering occurs in the lives of [[Sentience|sentient]] beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.

==Terminology==
The word ''suffering'' is sometimes used in the narrow sense of [[pain|physical pain]], but more often it refers to [[psychological pain|mental pain]], or more often yet it refers to pain in the broad sense, i.e. to any unpleasant [[feeling]], [[emotion]] or [[perception|sensation]]. The word ''pain'' usually refers to physical pain, but it is also a common synonym of ''suffering''. The words ''pain'' and ''suffering'' are often used both together in different ways. For instance, they may be used as interchangeable synonyms. Or they may be used in 'contradistinction' to one another, as in "pain is physical, suffering is mental", or "pain is inevitable, suffering is optional". Or they may be used to define each other, as in "pain is physical suffering", or "suffering is severe physical or mental pain".

Qualifiers, such as ''physical'', ''mental'', ''emotional'', and ''psychological'', are often used to refer to certain types of pain or suffering. In particular, ''mental pain (or suffering)'' may be used in relationship with ''physical pain (or suffering)'' for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering. A first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses ''physical pain'' in a sense that normally includes not only the 'typical sensory experience of physical pain' but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including [[dyspnea|air hunger]], [[hunger]], [[vestibular system|vestibular suffering]], [[nausea]], [[sleep deprivation]], and [[itch]]ing. A second caveat is that the terms ''physical'' or ''mental'' should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects, while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and, being an emotion, involves important physiological aspects.

The word ''unpleasantness'', which some people use as a synonym of ''suffering'' or ''pain'' in the broad sense, may be used to refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (its suffering aspect), usually in contrast with the sensory dimension, as for instance in this sentence: "Pain-unpleasantness is often, though not always, closely linked to both the intensity and unique qualities of the painful sensation."&lt;ref&gt;Donald D. Price, [http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/6/392 Central Neural Mechanisms that Interrelate Sensory and Affective Dimensions of Pain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818004239/http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/6/392 |date=2009-08-18 }}, ‘’Molecular Interventions’’ 2:392-403 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Other current words that have a definition with some similarity to ''suffering'' include ''distress, unhappiness, misery, affliction, woe, ill, discomfort, displeasure, disagreeableness''.

==Philosophy==
{{Hedonism}}
[[Hedonism]], as an ethical theory, claims that good and bad consist ultimately in [[pleasure]] and pain. Many hedonists, in accordance with [[Epicurus]] and contrarily to popular perception of his doctrine, advocate that we should first seek to avoid suffering and that the greatest pleasure lies in a robust state of profound tranquility ([[ataraxia]]) that is free from the worrisome pursuit or the unwelcome consequences of ephemeral pleasures.

For [[Stoicism]], the greatest good lies in reason and virtue, but the soul best reaches it through a kind of indifference ([[apathy|apatheia]]) to pleasure and pain: as a consequence, this doctrine has become identified with stern self-control in regard to suffering.

{{Utilitarianism}}
[[Jeremy Bentham]] developed hedonistic [[utilitarianism]], a popular doctrine in ethics, politics, and economics. Bentham argued that the right act or policy was that which would cause "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". He suggested a procedure called [[felicific calculus|hedonic or felicific calculus]], for determining how much pleasure and pain would result from any action. [[John Stuart Mill]] improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism. [[Karl Popper]], in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', proposed a [[negative utilitarianism]], which prioritizes the reduction of suffering over the enhancement of happiness when speaking of utility: "I believe that there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure. (...) human suffering makes a direct moral appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway." [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], for his part, advocates a utilitarianism that aims straightforwardly at the abolition of suffering through the use of biotechnology (see more details below in section [[Suffering#Biology, neurology, psychology|Biology, neurology, psychology]]). Another aspect worthy of mention here is that many utilitarians since Bentham hold that the moral status of a being comes from its ability to feel pleasure and pain: therefore, moral agents should consider not only the interests of human beings but also those of (other) animals. [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]] came to the same conclusion in his concepts of 'speciesism' and 'painism'. [[Peter Singer]]'s writings, especially the book [[Animal Liberation (book)|''Animal Liberation'']], represent the leading edge of this kind of utilitarianism for animals as well as for people.

Another doctrine related to the relief of suffering is [[humanitarianism]] (see also [[humanitarian principles]], [[humanitarian aid]], and [[humane society]]). "Where humanitarian efforts seek a positive addition to the happiness of sentient beings, it is to make the unhappy happy rather than the happy happier. (...) [Humanitarianism] is an ingredient in many social attitudes; in the modern world it has so penetrated into diverse movements (...) that it can hardly be said to exist in itself."&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, article ''Humanitarianism'', Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pessimism|Pessimists]] hold this world to be mainly bad, or even the worst possible, plagued with, among other things, unbearable and unstoppable suffering. Some identify suffering as the nature of the world, and conclude that it would be better if life did not exist at all. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] recommends us to take refuge in things like art, philosophy, loss of the [[will to live]], and tolerance toward 'fellow-sufferers'.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]],  first influenced by Schopenhauer, developed afterward quite another attitude, arguing that the suffering of life is productive, exalting the [[will to power]], despising weak compassion or pity, and recommending us to embrace willfully the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal return]]' of the greatest sufferings. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[Pain (philosophy)|Philosophy of pain]] is a philosophical specialty that focuses on physical [[pain]] and is, through that, relevant to suffering in general.

==Religion==

Suffering plays an important role in a number of religions, regarding matters such as the following: consolation or relief; moral conduct (do no harm, help the afflicted, show [[compassion]]); spiritual advancement through life hardships or through self-imposed trials ([[mortification of the flesh]], [[penance]], [[ascetism]]); ultimate destiny ([[salvation]], [[damnation]], [[hell]]). [[Theodicy]] deals with the [[problem of evil]], which is the difficulty of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent god with the existence of evil: a quintessential form of evil, for many people, is extreme suffering, especially in innocent children, or in creatures destined to an eternity of torments (see [[problem of hell]]).

The '[[Four Noble Truths]]' of [[Buddhism]] are about [[dukkha]], a term often translated as suffering. They state the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. Buddhism considers liberation from ''dukkha'' and the practice of compassion ([[Karuṇā|karuna]]) as basic for leading a holy life and attaining [[nirvana]].

Hinduism holds that suffering follows naturally from personal negative behaviors in one’s current life or in a past life (see [[karma in Hinduism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; One must accept suffering as a just consequence and as an opportunity for spiritual progress. Thus the soul or true self, which is eternally free of any suffering, may come to manifest itself in the person, who then achieves liberation ([[moksha]]). Abstinence from causing pain or harm to other beings ([[ahimsa]]) is a central tenet of Hinduism.  Suffering is thought to be an inclusive effect of human experience.  Beyond this, Hindus are looking to achieve enlightenment and end human suffering by answering questions about life.  This will lead to a unity in God as well as find the meaning of their suffering, ultimately achieving bliss.

Christianity also believes that human suffering plays an important role in religion. Suffering is only to be thought of as a positive experience in the case of achieving a higher meaning of life, such as Jesus suffering for the lives of other people as was the case during the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].  Suffering is the time to find God and value faith while doing so.  This allows Christians to face reality of human experience with suffering and find an understanding in the divine.

Hinduism and Christianity embrace similar aspects in suffering.  Both religions realize the need for God as well as the moral significance for God that suffering provides.  This allows enlightenment to be reached and suffering to be seen in the conditions that faith entails rather than an issue.  These human experiences with suffering in both Hinduism and Christianity help educators to emphasize the need for dialogue and religious education in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baring|first1=Rito|title=Analyzing Empirical Notions of Suffering:  Advancing Youth Dialogue and Education|journal=Religious Education|date=March 1, 2010|volume=105|issue=02|pages=157–172|doi=10.1080/00344081003645145|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=ce11b5d1-a752-4828-83cc-4cd82bd06fa5%40sessionmgr110&amp;hid=112|accessdate=30 September 2014}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the faithful must endure suffering with hope and faith, not resist or ask why, accept it as Allah's will and submit to it as a test of faith (Allah never asks more than can be endured). One must also work to alleviate suffering of others, as well as one's own. Suffering is also seen as a blessing in Islam for the mankind . Through the gift of suffering  the Veil of Forgetfulness is torn apart and the sufferer remembers God and connects with him. When people suffer God makes them think of him. Several Islamic Prophet Muhammad's traditions state that, suffering expunges the sins of mankind and cleanses their soul for the immense reward in afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Suffering an Islamic point of view:{{cite web |url=https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/sufferings-are-divine-grace/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001153423/https://seekingthedivinecountenance.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/sufferings-are-divine-grace/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible's [[Book of Job]] reflects on the nature and meaning of suffering. It is supplemented in the Hebrew bible by the passages found in the Book of Isaiah and the Book of Jeremiah which elaborate the emotional and physical suffering of a conquered nation with its vanquished inhabitants forced into the suffering of exile and captivity in a foreign land.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, suffering is portrayed both in the life of Jesus portrayed in the Synoptics, which narrate the suffering of the crucifixion, and in the post-Easter narratives. The suffering associated with punishment is further portrayed in the Apocalypse of John where suffering at the scene of the Last Judgment is depicted as the just recompense for sin and wrongdoing. Pope John Paul II wrote "On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html On the Christian Meaning of Human Suffering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930062256/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_11021984_salvifici-doloris_en.html |date=September 30, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning revolves around the notion of [[redemptive suffering]].

According to the [[Bahá'í Faith]], all suffering is a brief and temporary manifestation of physical life, whose source is the material aspects of physical existence, and often attachment to them, whereas only joy exists in the spiritual worlds. In the words of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], "''All these examples are to show you that the trials which beset our every step, all our sorrow, pain, shame and grief, are born in the world of matter; whereas the spiritual Kingdom never causes sadness. A man living with his thoughts in this Kingdom knows perpetual joy. The ills all flesh is heir to do not pass him by, but they only touch the surface of his life, the depths are calm and serene.''" ([[Paris Talks]], p.&amp;nbsp;110).

==Arts and literature==

Artistic and literary works often engage with suffering, sometimes at great cost to their creators or performers. The [http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Keyword?action=listann&amp;id=54 Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database] offers a list of such works under the categories art, film, literature, and theater. Be it in the tragic, comic or other genres, art and literature offer means to alleviate (and perhaps also exacerbate) suffering, as argued for instance in Harold Schweizer's ''Suffering and the remedy of art''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schweizer, Harold |title=Suffering and the remedy of art |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-7914-3264-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Brueghel painting is among those that inspired W. H. Auden's poem [[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]] :

''About suffering they were never wrong,'' &lt;br&gt;
''The Old Masters; how well, they understood'' &lt;br&gt;
''Its human position; how it takes place'' &lt;br&gt;
''While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;''&lt;br&gt;
''(...)''&lt;br&gt;

''Quite leisurely from the disaster; (...)''

==Social sciences==

''Social suffering'', according to [[Arthur Kleinman]] and others, describes "collective and individual human suffering associated with life conditions shaped by powerful social forces".&lt;ref&gt;Social suffering. Daedalus. Proc Amer Acad Arts Sciences 1996;125(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Such suffering is an increasing concern in medical anthropology, ethnography, mass media analysis, and Holocaust studies, says Iain Wilkinson,&lt;ref&gt;Iain Wilkinson, ''Suffering&amp;nbsp;– A Sociological Introduction'', Polity Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; who is developing a sociology of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/wilkinson.html |title=School of Social Policy, Sociology and Social Research|accessdate=July 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014817/http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/staff/academic/wilkinson.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]]'' is a work by the [[Union of International Associations]]. Its main databases are about world problems (56,564 profiles), global strategies and solutions (32,547 profiles), human values (3,257 profiles), and human development (4,817 profiles).

In law, "[[Pain and suffering]]" is a legal term that refers to the mental distress or physical pain endured by a plaintiff as a result of injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress. Assessments of pain and suffering are required to be made for attributing legal awards. In the Western world these are typical made by juries in a discretionary fashion and are regarded as subjective, variable, and difficult to predict,  for instance in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v100/n1/87/LR100n1Avraham.pdf |accessdate=February 17, 2013 |title=Putting a Price on Pain-And-Suffering Damages: A Critique of the Current Approaches and a Preliminary Peoposal for Change

==Biology, neurology, psychology==

Suffering and [[pleasure]] are respectively the negative and positive affects, or hedonic tones, or [[valence (psychology)|valences]] that psychologists often identify as basic in our emotional lives.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanna Colombetti, [http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_AppraisingValence05.pdf Appraising Valence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925233238/http://polorovereto.unitn.it/~colombetti/docs/GC_AppraisingValence05.pdf |date=September 25, 2007 }}, Journal of Consciousness Studies 12 (8-10), pp. 106–129 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary role of physical and mental suffering, through natural selection, is primordial: it [[warning system|warns]] of threats, motivates [[coping (psychology)|coping]] ([[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]], [[escapism]]), and [[reinforce]]s negatively certain behaviors (see [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]], [[aversives]]). Despite its initial disrupting nature, suffering contributes to the organization of meaning in an individual's world and psyche. In turn, meaning determines how individuals or societies experience and deal with suffering.

[[Image:MRI Head 5 slices.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Neuroimaging sheds light on the seat of suffering&lt;/center&gt;]]

Many brain structures and physiological processes are involved in suffering. Various hypotheses try to account for the experience of suffering. One of these, the ''pain overlap theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webscript.princeton.edu/~psych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf |title=Pain Overlap Theory |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229045200/http://webscript.princeton.edu/%7Epsych/psychology/related/socneuconf/pdf/eisenberger-lieberman2.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes note, thanks to neuroimaging studies, that the [[cingulate cortex]] fires up when the brain feels suffering from experimentally induced social distress '''or''' physical pain as well. The theory proposes therefore that physical pain and social pain (i.e. two radically differing kinds of suffering) share a common phenomenological and neurological basis.

According to [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]]’s online manifesto [[The Hedonistic Imperative]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm The Hedonistic Imperative: Table Of Contents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEC1EPkK?url=http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/tabconhi.htm |date=2013-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suffering is the avoidable result of Darwinian genetic design. Pearce promotes replacing the pain/pleasure axis with a robot-like response to noxious stimuli&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/vanity-fair.html Vanity Fair interview with Pearce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505015831/http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/vanity-fair.html |date=2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with gradients of bliss,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gradients.com/ Life in the Far North - An information-theoretic perspective on Heaven] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314162929/http://www.gradients.com/ |date=2016-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[genetic engineering]] and other technical scientific advances.

Hedonistic psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D., E. Diener and N. Schwartz (eds.) ''Well-being: The Foundations of Hedonistic Psychology'', Russell Sage Foundation, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[affective science]], and [[affective neuroscience]] are some of the emerging scientific fields that could in the coming years focus their attention on the phenomenon of suffering.

==Health care==
Disease and injury may contribute to suffering in humans and animals. For example, suffering may be a feature of mental or physical illness such as [[borderline personality disorder]]&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fertuck|first1=EA.|last2=Jekal|first2=A.|last3=Song|first3=I.|last4=Wyman|first4=B.|last5=Morris|first5=MC.|last6=Wilson|first6=ST.|last7=Brodsky|first7=BS.|last8=Stanley|first8=B.|title=Enhanced ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ in borderline personality disorder compared to healthy controls|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=December 2009|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1979–1988|doi=10.1017/S003329170900600X|pmc=3427787|pmid=19460187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM-IV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)|date=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89-042061-4|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally in [[Cancer|advanced cancer]].&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=KG.|last2=Chochinov|first2=HM.|last3=McPherson|first3=CJ.|last4=LeMay|first4=K.|last5=Allard|first5=P.|last6=Chary|first6=S.|last7=Gagnon|first7=PR.|last8=Macmillan|first8=K.|last9=De Luca|first9=M.|last10=O'Shea|first10=F.|last11=Kuhl|first11=D.|last12=Fainsinger|first12=RL.|title=Suffering With Advanced Cancer|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=May 1, 2007|volume=25|issue=13|pages=1691–1697|doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.08.6801|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/13/1691|accessdate=15 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329234159/http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/13/1691|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health care]] addresses this suffering in many ways, in subfields such as [[medicine]], [[clinical psychology]], [[psychotherapy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[hygiene]], [[public health]], and through various [[health care provider]]s.

Health care approaches to suffering, however, remain problematic.  Physician and author Eric Cassell, widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine, has defined suffering as "the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person".&lt;ref&gt;Eric J Cassell, ''The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cassell writes: "The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity. Despite this fact, little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education, research or practice." Mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice, medicine strongly distinguishes [[pain]] from suffering, and most attention goes to the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community, according to numerous reports.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the [http://www.ampainsoc.org/advocacy/legislative.htm National Pain Care Policy Act of 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515223432/http://www.ampainsoc.org/advocacy/legislative.htm |date=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, some medical fields like [[palliative care]], [[pain management|pain management (or pain medicine)]], [[oncology]], or [[psychiatry]], do somewhat address suffering 'as such'. In palliative care, for instance, pioneer [[Cicely Saunders]] created the concept of 'total pain' ('total suffering' say now the textbooks),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(03)00516-5/fulltext Existential pain&amp;nbsp;— an entity, a provocation, or a challenge?] in Journal of Pain Symptom and Management, Volume 27, Issue 3, Pages 241-250 (March 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully.

==Relief and prevention in society==
Since suffering is such a universal motivating experience, people, when asked, can relate their activities to its relief and prevention. Farmers, for instance, may claim that they prevent famine, artists may say that they take our minds off our worries, and teachers may hold that they hand down tools for coping with life hazards. In certain aspects of collective life, however, suffering is more readily an explicit concern by itself. Such aspects may include [[public health]], [[human rights]], [[humanitarian aid]], [[disaster relief]], [[philanthropy]], [[economic aid]], [[social services]], [[insurance]], and [[animal welfare]]. To these can be added the aspects of [[security]] and [[safety]], which relate to precautionary measures taken by individuals or families, to interventions by the military, the police, the firefighters, and to notions or fields like [[social security]], [[environmental security]], and [[human security]].

==Uses==
Philosopher Leonard Katz wrote: "But Nature, as we now know, regards ultimately only fitness and not our happiness (...), and does not scruple to use hate, fear, punishment and even war alongside affection in ordering social groups and selecting among them, just as she uses pain as well as pleasure to get us to feed, water and protect our bodies and also in forging our social bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Katz, Leonard David |title=Evolutionary origins of morality: cross-disciplinary perspectives |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Devon |year=2000 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=inmTyPPdR5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PR15,M1 xv] |isbn=0-907845-07-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People make use of suffering for specific social or personal purposes in many areas of human life, as can be seen in the following instances:

*In arts, literature, or entertainment, people may use suffering for creation, for performance, or for enjoyment. Entertainment particularly makes use of suffering in [[blood sport]]s and [[Violence#Violence in the media|violence in the media]], including [[Video game controversy|violent video games]] depiction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carlsson |first1=Ulla |title=Children and Media Violence |url=http://survivorbb.rapeutation.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=39&amp;start=5 |website=Altruistic World Online Library |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more or less great amount of suffering is involved in [[body art]]. The most common forms of body art include [[tattooing]], [[body piercing]], [[scarification]], [[human branding]]. Another form of body art is a sub-category of [[performance art]], in which for instance the body is mutilated or pushed to its physical limits.
*In business and various organizations, suffering may be used for constraining humans or animals into required behaviors.
*In a criminal context, people may use suffering for coercion, revenge, or pleasure.
*In interpersonal relationships, especially in places like families, schools, or workplaces, suffering is used for various motives, particularly under the form of [[abuse]] and [[punishment]]. In another fashion related to interpersonal relationships, the sick, or victims, or [[malingering|malingerers]], may use suffering more or less voluntarily to get [[Primary gain|primary, secondary, or tertiary gain]].
*In law, suffering is used for [[punishment]] (see [[penal law]] ); victims may refer to what legal texts call "[[pain and suffering]]" to get compensation; lawyers may use a victim's suffering as an argument against the accused; an accused's or defendant's suffering may be an argument in their favor; authorities at times use light or heavy [[torture]] in order to get information or a confession.
*In the news media, suffering is often the raw material.&lt;ref&gt;This observation is common. See for instance Public Acts: Disruptive Readings on Making Curriculum Public, by Jose Francisco Ibáñez-Carrasco, Erica R. Meiners, Suzanne De Castell: "In our era of information saturation, media uses pain, suffering, and desire to distract and to create spectacular roadkill out of poverty, deviancy, and violence (...)" (available at https://books.google.com/books?id=slYkeuZ3KQoC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22media+uses+pain%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=F_qccUl4dL&amp;sig=5HoSwY1BNPB_ydldia-Dgx-niOw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result). See also for instance [[Arthur Kleinman]] about the uses and abuses of images of suffering in the media.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In personal conduct, people may use suffering for themselves, in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Viktor Frankl's [[Man's Search for Meaning]]&lt;/ref&gt; Personal suffering may lead, if bitterness, depression, or spitefulness is avoided, to character-building, spiritual growth, or moral achievement;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fukuyama, Francis |title=Our posthuman future: consequences of the biotechnology revolution |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-374-23643-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; realizing the extent or gravity of suffering in the world may motivate one to relieve it and may give an inspiring direction to one's life. Alternatively, people may make self-detrimental use of suffering. Some may be caught in compulsive reenactment of painful feelings in order to protect them from seeing that those feelings have their origin in unmentionable past experiences; some may addictively indulge in disagreeable emotions like fear, anger, or jealousy, in order to enjoy pleasant feelings of arousal or release that often accompany these emotions; some may engage in acts of [[self-harm]] aimed at relieving otherwise unbearable states of mind.
*In politics, there is purposeful infliction of suffering in [[war]], [[torture]], and [[terrorism]]; people may use nonphysical suffering against competitors in nonviolent power struggles; people who argue for a policy may put forward the need to relieve, prevent or avenge suffering; individuals or groups may use past suffering as a political lever in their favor.
*In religion, suffering is used especially to grow spiritually, to expiate, to inspire compassion and help, to frighten, to punish.
*In [[rites of passage]] (see also [[hazing]], [[ragging]]), rituals that make use of suffering are frequent.
*In science, humans and animals are subjected on purpose to aversive experiences for the study of suffering or other phenomena.
*In sex, especially in a context of [[sadism and masochism]] or [[BDSM]], individuals may use a certain amount of physical or mental suffering (e.g. pain, humiliation).
*In sports, suffering may be used to outperform competitors or oneself; see [[sports injury]], and [[no pain, no gain]]; see also [[blood sport]] and [[violence in sport]] as instances of pain-based entertainment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5796">In [[philosophy]], a '''thick concept''' (sometimes: ''thick normative concept'', or ''thick evaluative concept'') is a kind of concept that both has a significant degree of descriptive content and is evaluatively loaded. Paradigmatic examples are various [[virtue]]s and [[vice]]s such as ''courage'', ''cruelty'', ''truthfulness'' and ''kindness''. Courage for example, may be given a rough characterization in descriptive terms as '…opposing danger to promote a valued end'. At the same time, characterizing someone as courageous typically involves expressing a pro-attitude, or a (prima facie) good-making quality – i.e. an evaluative statement.

== A middle position ==

Thick concepts thus seem to occupy a 'middle position' between (thin) descriptive concepts and (thin) evaluative concepts. Descriptive concepts such as ''[[water]]'', ''[[gold]]'', ''[[length]]'' and ''[[mass]]'' are commonly believed to pick out features of the world rather than provide reasons for action, whereas evaluative concepts such as ''right'' and ''good'' are commonly believed to provide reasons for action rather than picking out genuine features of the world. This 'double feature' of thick concepts has made them the point of debate between [[moral realism|moral realists]] and [[expressivism|moral expressivists]]. Moral realists have argued that the world-guided content and the action-guiding content cannot be usefully separated,{{disputed inline|date=August 2018}} indicating that competent use of thick concepts constitutes ethical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;1978, 1979, 1981; Dancy 1995, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Expressivists, favoring an account of moral values as attitudes projected onto the world, wants to uphold a distinction between the (morally neutral) descriptive feature of a thick concept and the evaluative attitudes that typically goes with them.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbard 1992, Blackburn 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two accounts of thick concepts ==

As mentioned above, thick concepts seem to combine the descriptive features of natural concepts such as water with an evaluative content similar to the thin evaluative concepts such as good and right. How are we to understand this ‘combination’? Many theorists treat it as a conjunctive: a thick concept should be analyzed as a conjunction of a descriptive part and an evaluative part, which, at least in principle may be separated.&lt;ref&gt;Hare 1952, Gibbard 1992, Blackburn 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; A basic feature of this analysis is thus that the descriptive content of a thick concept may be given in absence of the evaluative content. Returning to the example of courage, ‘…is courageous’ could on this account be analyzed as something along the lines of ‘…opposing danger to promote a valued end’  and ‘this is (prima facie) good-making’.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Elgin calls this the “skeleton account” in Elgin 2005, 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluative part, on this view, may thus be characterized as a ‘prescriptive flag’ attached to the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1985, 141&lt;/ref&gt; It is, on this view, in principle possible to construct a completely descriptive concept – i.e. without evaluative force – that picked out the same features of the world.

This account of thick concepts has been criticized by other theorists, notably of moral realist persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell 1978, 1979, 1981; Williams 1985; Dancy 1995, 2004; McNaughton and Rawling 2000; and Little 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the only way to understand a thick concept is to understand the descriptive and evaluative aspects as a whole. The idea is that for a thick concept, the evaluative aspect is profoundly involved in the practice of using it; one cannot understand a thick concept without understanding also its evaluative point.&lt;ref&gt;The rationale for calling an action cruel rather than merely describing it in more neutral terms is to tune into this evaluative aspect. Cf. McDowell 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, descriptive terms cannot completely fill in the ‘along the lines’ of a description such as ‘…opposing danger to promote a valued end’.  These descriptions may allow the novice to see the salient features. However a hooking on to the evaluative perspective allows the person to fully understand the 'thick' concept.

The '''unknot''' arises in the [[knot theory|mathematical theory of knots]]. Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] in it. A knot theorist would describe the unknot as an image of any [[embedding]] that can be deformed, i.e. [[ambient isotopy|ambient-isotoped]], to the '''standard unknot''', i.e. the embedding of the [[circle]] as a geometrically round circle. The unknot is also called the '''trivial knot'''. An unknot is the [[identity element]] with respect to the [[knot sum]] operation.

== Unknotting problem ==
{{main|Unknotting problem}}

Deciding if a particular knot is the unknot was a major driving force behind [[knot invariant]]s, since it was thought this approach would possibly give an efficient algorithm to [[unknotting problem|recognize the unknot]] from some presentation such as a knot diagram. Currently there are several well-known unknot recognition algorithms (not using invariants), but they are either known to be inefficient or have no efficient implementation. It is not known whether many of the current invariants, such as [[finite type invariant]]s, are a complete invariant of the unknot, but [[Floer homology#Heegaard Floer homology|knot Floer homology]] is known to detect the unknot. Even if they were, the problem of computing them efficiently remains.

== Examples ==

Many useful practical knots are actually the unknot, including all knots which can be tied in the [[bight (knot)|bight]].&lt;ref name="knotty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkerschatz.com/knots/knots.html|title=Knotty topics|author=Volker Schatz|accessdate=2007-04-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717230520/http://www.volkerschatz.com/knots/knots.html|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy unknots are those that consist of rigid line segments connected by universal joints at their endpoints (linkages), that yet cannot be reconfigured into a convex polygon, thus acquiring the name [[stuck unknot|''stuck'' unknots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Godfried Toussaint]] |title=A new class of stuck unknots in Pol-6|journal=Contributions to Algebra and Geometry''|date=2001|volume=42|issue=2|pages=301–306|url=http://www.emis.de/journals/BAG/vol.42/no.2/b42h2to1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030512075528/http://www.emis.de/journals/BAG/vol.42/no.2/b42h2to1.pdf |archivedate= 2003-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariants==
The [[Alexander-Conway polynomial]] and [[Jones polynomial]] of the unknot are trivial:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = 1,\quad \nabla(z) = 1,\quad V(q) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

No other knot with 10 or fewer [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossings]] has trivial Alexander polynomial, but the [[Kinoshita-Terasaka knot]] and [[Conway knot]] (both of which have 11 crossings) have the same Alexander and Conway polynomials as the unknot. It is an open problem whether any non-trivial knot has the same Jones polynomial as the unknot.

The [[knot group]] of the unknot is an infinite [[cyclic group]], and the [[knot complement]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[solid torus]].

In [[science fiction]] and [[ufology]], a '''Venusian''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ᵻ|ˈ|nj|uː|ʒ|ən|,_|-|ʃ|ən}}) or '''Venerian''' is a native inhabitant of the [[planet]] [[Venus]]. Many science fiction writers have imagined what [[extraterrestrial life]] on Venus might be like.

==Etymology==
The word ''Venusian'' – sometimes spelled ''Venutian'' – is a simple combination of the name of the planet ''Venus'' and the suffix ''-ian'', formed by analogy to ''[[Martian]]'' and other similar [[Demonym|demonyms]].

The classically derived demonym would be ''Venerean'' or ''Venerian'' (cf. {{lang-la|venereus, venerius}} "belonging to the goddess Venus"), but these forms have been used by only a few authors (e.g. [[Robert A. Heinlein]]). Scientists sometimes use the adjective ''[[Cytherean]]'' for things related to Venus, from [[Venus (mythology)|the goddess']] epithet ''Cytherea''. The similarly derived ''Venereal'' is not used due to its association with sexually transmitted infections as "[[venereal disease|venereal diseases]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dave Hanes, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610054843/http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~hanes/p014/Notes/Topic_033.html#PART%202 The Appearance of Venus: Its Importance]. Accessed Oct. 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{main|Venus in fiction}}Venusians appearing in works of fiction are usually fanciful, rather than plausible inhabitants of the planet. Before the mid 20th century, little was generally known about the planet except that it was solid and comparable in size to Earth; its cloud cover obscured remote observation of its environment. This allowed writers to speculate that Venusians might be similar to humans or other Earth species, much as they did for fictional Martians. As more was learned about Venus and the implausibility of humanoid or other life on it, Venusians became increasingly uncommon in science fiction.

=== In comics and manga ===
[[File:An Earth Man on Venus 78545.JPG|thumb|right|Cover of 1950 Avon comic adaptation of ''The Radio Man'']]
* In early [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] stories, Venusians are giant [[frog]]-like amphibians which are ruled over by the evil mad scientist [[Doctor Sivana]] and his family. They are used to the tropical jungles of Venus and find Earth cold, and are quite savage. Venus is inhabited by other savage creatures, some which resemble prehistoric beasts, such as the [[centaur]]-like Gorillalion (which is half-[[gorilla]] half-[[lion]]).
* The Hydrads of Venus, who resemble huge animated sponges, appear in ''[[Planet Comics]]'', in the Lost World section. If hurt, water can restore them to health. Though opposed to the [[Voltamen]] who have invaded Earth, they are also enemies to [[Hunt Bowman]].
* In the [[Superman]] story which had the first appearance of the [[Legion of Super-Villains]], one of the members was [[Cosmic King]], a scientist who worked on transmuting elements, but when he was struck by the ray he gained the power to send those beams from his eyes. However, he was exiled from Venus for these experiments.
* In DC Comics' ''All-Star Comics'' #13 the JSA are gassed by [[Nazi]]s and rocketed to different planets. Wonder Woman is sent to Venus and finds it to be inhabited by fairies led by [[Queen Desira]], who worship [[Aphrodite]], and claim to have been at peace for "a million years". She helps them in a war against the Meteor Men, large brutal males.
* In ''Showcase'' #23, [[Hal Jordan]] [[Green Lantern]] is sent by the Guardians, operating through the power battery to Venus where he meets blue-skinned primitive humanoids who are being attacked by pterosaur-like creatures. He seals the monsters in a cave, and leaves the world, saying the cavemen will one day be a great civilization.
* In the British comic ''[[Dan Dare]]'' (1950–1967), Venus is inhabited by green-skinned [[Treens]] and Therons, who are separated by a fire wall running across Venus. The Mekon, the Super-intelligent Treen leader is a primary villain. Most Treens are emotionless. The Therons are more friendly to Earth.
* [[Sailor Venus|Minako Aino]] of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' is the reincarnation of the Princess of Venus. The Sailor V Manga shows a diamond shaped structure that is her castle.

===In literature===
* In the "[[Venus series]]" of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], Burroughs created a fictitious 'Venusian' alphabet supposedly used by the Venusians (or "Amtorians" - as "Amtor" is what the natives call their planet). His artificial Amtor letters flow nicely together like [[Cursive|cursive writing]].&lt;ref name="Burroughs"&gt;{{cite book

* In [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Last and First Men]]'', when the Moon threatens to slowly spiral down to crash into Earth, humans leave Earth and colonize Venus; in the process of doing so, humans totally exterminate Venus' native inhabitants, a semi-intelligent deep ocean marine species. The descendants of the invaders, Sixth to Eighth Men, can be considered Venerians themselves.
* In [[Charles R. Tanner]]'s "Tumithak of the Corridors" (1932) and its sequels, Venus is the homeworld of the shelks, [[spider]]-like aliens who have conquered Earth and forced most of the few surviving humans underground.
* In [[William Lumley]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s "[[The Diary of Alonzo Typer]]" (written in 1935 and published in 1938), part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], there are mentions of the "Lords of Venus", and conflicting indications that the [[Serpent Men|Serpent People]] originated there. The story was followed by "[[In the Walls of Eryx]]," co-written by Lovecraft and [[Kenneth J. Sterling]], in which a prospector is trapped in a maze on Venus, apparently constructed by [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizardmen]].
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]' book ''[[Perelandra]]'' (1943), Professor Elwin Ransom travels to Venus (the title is the name of the planet in the Old Solar language), a planet mostly covered by water with floating islands on it, in order to fight a possessed Professor Weston and prevent the "[[Adam and Eve]]" of this young planet from bringing about the same fate that befell Earth (Thulcandra).  In the book, Lewis depicts a wide variety of flora and fauna, with some animals close to being sentient. The King and Queen of the planet are humanoid, but green, and their commandment is for them not to sleep on the fixed land, a still island. When this happens, the Oyarsa of this world, a type of angel-like being who seems feminine like the classical goddess, tells Ransom that this will be the start of a new age.
* ''[[Before Eden]]'', by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], is about a manned expedition to Venus which discovers an animated form of plant life. However, after the humans leave, the creature eats their abandoned garbage and other things left behind and this contamination eventually wipes out all native life on the planet.
* ''[[The Space Merchants]]'' is a science fiction novel, written by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] in 1952, about the campaign by [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] on an overpopulated Earth to convince humans to colonize Venus, which is depicted as having a harsh and stormy [[tropical climate]].
* "[[I Am the Doorway]]", a short story in [[Stephen King]]'s 1971 collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', concerns an astronaut who returns from a tragic mission to Venus to find himself possessed by a murderously terrified alien entity.
* In [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]'' (1972), [[Willy Wonka]] says that Venus used to be home to an alien race before they were "gobbled up" by Vermicious Knids.
* In [[Jacqueline Susann]]'s romance ''[[Yargo (novel)|Yargo]]'' (1979), Venus is said to be inhabited by bees that are as big as horses.
* In the [[self-help]] book by [[John Gray (U.S. author)|John Gray]], ''[[Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus]],'' women are occasionally (metaphorically) referred to as Venusians, while men are referred to as [[Martians]].
* In the book ''[[Venus (novel)|Venus]]'' by [[Ben Bova]], the inhabitants of Venus are strange snake-like creatures that use molten [[sulfur]] for blood. They are not sapient. There are also micro-organisms in the clouds that break down ceramics and metals.
* In [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]]'s story "[[Logic of Empire]]" the Venusians are an intelligent but primitive race of amphibians who trade valuable swamp roots to the human colonists in return for tobacco. In the novel ''[[Podkayne of Mars]]'' (depicting a fairly different Venus) Venusians are humanoids of great physical strength but also very primitive.
* The Gobsmacking Galaxy, an entry in the children's non-fiction series ''The Knowledge'' written by Kjartan Poskitt, humorously describes hypothetical alien life forms which might evolve on planets in the solar system; the Venusian creatures are small, squat and round to cope with Venus's atmospheric pressures and make their living selling life insurance to visiting astronauts (before they succumb to the planet's extreme heat and pressure).
* In Frederik Pohl's "Gateway", humans travel across the Galaxy using spaceships found on planet Venus, left there by its ancient civilization.

===In film===
* The creature in ''[[It Conquered the World]]'' (1956) was from Venus. It resembled a cone with a nasty grin. ''It Conquered the World'' was remade as ''[[Zontar, the Thing from Venus]]'' (1966), whose villain was also an alien from Venus.
* ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'' (1957) deals with the crash-landing on [[Sicily]] of a spaceship returning from an expedition to Venus and the resulting rampage by a creature which it brought back. The creature (called in production, but not in the film, a "[[Ymir]]") is a reptilian humanoid with perhaps the intelligence of a chimpanzee, which under Terran conditions grows to roughly 20 feet tall.  The film was animated by [[Ray Harryhausen]].
* ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]'' is a [[science fiction movie]] filmed in 1958 starring [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] as Talleah, the Venusian leader of the resistance to overthrow cruel [[Queen regnant|Queen]] Yllana.
* In the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', Jack Nicholson's character speaks of Venusians around a campfire after smoking marijuana.
* ''[[Venus Wars]]'' is a 1989 science fiction [[anime]] film about life on the planet Venus in the year 2089 after it has been colonized by humans.
* In the original Japanese version of ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Princess Selina Salno of the fictional country of Selginia claims to be a survivor of the destruction of Venus by King Ghidorah.

===In television===
* Venusian visitors sometimes appeared on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', (including the episodes "[[Mr. Dingle, the Strong]]" and "[[Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?]]"), as a means of further twisting stories already featuring Martian visitors with similar goals. In "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?," a Venusian appears disguised as a human [[chef]] with three eyes where the third eye is under his hat.
* Although never seen or actually discussed in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Third Doctor]] was a master of a martial art known as [[Venusian Aikido]] (or [[Karate]]). Also, the Doctor spoke the words of a Venusian lullaby in "[[The Dæmons]]", sang the lullaby (to the tune of "[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]") in ''[[The Curse of Peladon]]'', and was shown to carry a toothbrush containing "Venusian spearmint" in "[[The Shakespeare Code]]." In the spin-off novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'', the Venusians are revealed to be from our Solar System's distant past, before Venus had become the hellish world of today.
* Venusians work as members of the united galactic organisation in the 1962 television series ''[[Space Patrol (1962 TV series)|Space Patrol]]''.
* In the first episode of the show ''[[Futurama]]'', [[graffiti]] written in "Alien Language 1" is translated "Go Home Venusians".
* In the second episode of ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', Venus is shown to be inhabited by an advanced civilization called the Fearians. The Fearians are depicted as having three-heads with green skin and red eyes. The Fearian Leader (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) form an alliance with the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], who trick the Super Friends into changing the world so it can support Fearian life. This will allow the Fearians to form a colony and the Legion will rule the world. The Super Friends are trapped by the Fearian Leader in a force field. However, Green Lantern makes them invisible, causing the Leader to think they have escaped and turn off the field. He is defeated by Black Lightning and Green Lantern sends him back to Venus. The Super Friends then restore the world.
* In ''[[National Kid]]'', the Inca Venusians are an alien race who National Kid defends the Earth from.

==In ufology==
In the 1950s a group of [[contactees]] told stories in which they claimed to be in contact with friendly, light-haired, light-skinned humans from the planet Venus, as well as other planets in Earth's solar system.&lt;ref name="Peebles, pp. 113-119"&gt;(Peebles, pp. 113-119)&lt;/ref&gt; The first contactee, and the most famous, was [[George Adamski]] of Palomar Mountain, California. He claimed that on November 20, 1952 he met a Venusian named Orthon in a California desert. Adamski said that Orthon communicated with him via [[telepathy]] about the dangers of nuclear war and that he left behind footprints with mysterious symbols on them.&lt;ref&gt;(Peebles, pp. 113-115)&lt;/ref&gt; Adamski also displayed numerous photographs that he claimed showed the Venusian UFOs, and he said some of the photos had been given to him by Orthon. Copies of these photos were sold to visitors at Adamski's campground and restaurant at Palomar Mountain, but later studies by UFO investigators indicated that the photos were fakes; one scientist who analyzed the photos of a Venusian "scout ship" said the UFO's "landing struts" were [[General Electric]] light bulbs.&lt;ref name="Peebles, pp. 113-119"/&gt;

Adamski wrote or co-wrote three books in the 1950s and early 1960s about his meetings with Orthon and travels in a Venusian UFO through Earth's solar system; the first two books, ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' (1953), and ''Inside the Space Ships'' (1955), were both bestsellers.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17346/pg17346.html ''The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects'']. [[Edward J. Ruppelt]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Adamski's story, others, such as [[Howard Menger]], [[George Hunt Williamson]], [[Truman Bethurum]], [[George Van Tassel]], and [[Daniel Fry]], also wrote books and gave lectures in which they claimed to have met similar friendly, light-skinned humanoids from Venus and other planets in Earth's solar system, and to have taken trips with them in their spaceships. These humanoids were later called [[Nordic aliens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Lewis| first =Judith| title =Get a Piece of the Rock| publisher =[[LA Weekly]]| date =April 5, 2000| url =http://www.laweekly.com/general/travel/get-a-piece-of-the-rock/11493/| accessdate =2007-05-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the contactee movement garnered some popular interest through books, lectures, and conventions, such as the annual Giant Rock UFO conventions in California. In May 1959 Adamski had a private audience with Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] to discuss his claimed UFO experiences, which caused some controversy in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;
https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PYNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6uQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1129,3236964&amp;dq=1959+george-adamski&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

However, numerous investigations of the contactee movement revealed many flaws and inaccuracies in the contactees' claims that led most researchers to conclude that their stories were hoaxes.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"/&gt; Among the pieces of evidence noted by critics was that Venus has an environment that is extremely hostile to human life, and that none of the other planets in Earth's solar system are capable of supporting humanoid life. Also, investigators such as USAF Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], the head of the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], and ufologist [[James W. Moseley]], conducted extensive investigations into the claims and backgrounds of Adamski, Williamson, and other contactees, and concluded that they were either con artists or simply not being truthful in their stories and claims.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Peebles, pp. 118-`20)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
* In the teachings of the [[UFO religion]] the [[Unarius Academy of Science]], the capital of Venus, which, like the Venusians themselves, is said to exist on a ''[[Etheric plane|higher vibratory plane]]'', is called ''Azure''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Ernst and Ruth ''The Voice of Venus'' 1954 Unarius Academy of Science&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[guru]] [[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the Theosophical view that the [[Nordic aliens]] (like those seen by George Adamski—Creme accepts Adamski's UFO sightings as valid) pilot flying saucers from a civilization on Venus that exists on the [[etheric plane]] (Theosophists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the heat does not affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed in Theosophy that the governing [[deity]] of Earth, [[Sanat Kumara]] [http://www.sirius1-bg.net/sirius/images/sanat_kumara.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm Image of Sanat Kumara from Luis Prada’s "Brother Veritus'" Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Nordic alien originally from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 117&lt;/ref&gt; Sanat Kumara is said to live in a [[palace]] in a [[Mythological place|mythical city]] on the etheric plane of Earth called [[Shambhala|Shamballa]], which is said by Theosophists to be located above the [[Gobi Desert]].

== Background and Education ==
Cornish received her B.A. in chemistry in 1991, working with professor [[Ronald Breslow]]. Her Ph.D. research, on site-specific protein labeling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornish|first=Virginia W.|last2=Hahn|first2=Klaus M.|last3=Schultz|first3=Peter G.|date=1996-01|title=Site-Specific Protein Modification Using a Ketone Handle|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja961216x|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=en|volume=118|issue=34|pages=8150–8151|doi=10.1021/ja961216x|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mutagenesis, was carried out with [[Peter G. Schultz|Peter Schultz]]. Cornish was an NSF postdoctoral fellow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/24/style/weddings-virginia-cornish-donald-rollock.html|title=WEDDINGS; Virginia Cornish, Donald Rollock|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at MIT with Prof. [[Robert Sauer|Robert Sauer.]]

== Research ==
Cornish and her lab group use the tools of [[systems biology]], [[Synthetic biology|synthetic biology,]] and DNA encoding to produce desired chemical products from specific organismic hosts. In 2016, she was part of a notable group of genomic scientists calling for increased ethical study and self-regulation as the costs and effort of creating ''de novo'' genomes plummeted. As the "read" phase of the [[Human Genome Project]] was completed in 2004, this new effort was dubbed [[Genome Project-Write]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boeke|first=Jef D.|last2=Church|first2=George|last3=Hessel|first3=Andrew|last4=Kelley|first4=Nancy J.|last5=Arkin|first5=Adam|last6=Cai|first6=Yizhi|last7=Carlson|first7=Rob|last8=Chakravarti|first8=Aravinda|last9=Cornish|first9=Virginia W.|date=2016-07-08|title=The Genome Project-Write|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6295/126|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6295|pages=126–127|doi=10.1126/science.aaf6850|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27256881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
