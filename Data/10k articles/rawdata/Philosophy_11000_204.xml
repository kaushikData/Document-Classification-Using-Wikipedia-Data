'''''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom''''' was published in two volumes by [[Andrew Dickson White]], a founder of [[Cornell University]], in 1896.   
[[File:History of the warfare.jpg|300px|thumb|right]]
In the introduction White states the original goal of his 1874 lecture on ''The Battlefields of Science'' and elaborated in a book ''The Warfare of Science'' the same year:
:"In all modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest of religion, no matter how conscientious such interference may have been, has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science, and invariably; and, on the other hand, all untrammelled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to religion some of its stages may have seemed for the time to be, has invariably resulted in the highest good both of religion and of science."

In these volumes he chronicles the gradual emancipation of science from theology in various fields.

==Content==
;Chapter 1 From Creation to Evolution
The literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], including denial of all death and of animals not of use to man before the introduction of sin, gives way to the recognition of the enormous number of species in the world. Various [[evolution]]ary ideas opposed progressively by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] and [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]] led up to the theory of [[natural selection]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]]. The initial theological opposition gradually gave way to compromise by most churches.

;Chapter 2 Geography
The spherical ideas of [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] had replaced earlier ideas from [[Chaldean mythology|Chaldeans]] and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptians]] of a [[flat earth]]. The church fathers favoured the idea of a solid roof or [[firmament]] over the earth and this was elaborated early on, but in the Middle Ages most followed authorities such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in accepting [[Spherical earth|sphericity]]. [[Jerusalem]] was accepted as the centre of the world and a refusal to accept the existence of [[antipodes]] led many to assume that the other side of the world was entirely aqueous. Opposition to the antipodes did not cease for centuries after [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s voyages and also contributed to underestimates of the size of the [[earth]], which happened to help [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. Religious feeling encouraged the expansion of Europeans across the globe.

;Chapter 3 Astronomy
Despite earlier more literal ideas, the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic view]] of a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] universe was fully adopted by the Church, adding an immovable [[Empyrean|heavenly sphere]] above the stars and hell below the earth. In the sixteenth century, [[Copernicus]] challenged this view but his book was not published until after his death, when it was given a preface suggesting that it was simply a hypothesis. When [[Galileo]] used his telescope to show other reasons for rejecting the Ptolemaic view he faced opposition from both [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s. He was forced to renounce his sun-centred view, which was not formally accepted by the Catholic church before the nineteenth century. In England attacks continued into the eighteenth.

;Chapter 4 From "Signs and Wonders" to Law in the Heavens
[[Comet]]s, [[meteor]]s and [[eclipse]]s were widely seen as portents of doom by most early civilizations. Although natural explanations for eclipses were understood in the Christian era, comets and meteors continued to be regarded as warnings by [[Bede]], [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] and others and they could not be reconciled with conceptions of the heavenly spheres. Till the end of the seventeenth century there were attempts to keep astronomical explanations of comets from the university curriculum and church congregations.

;Chapter 5 From Genesis to Geology
Early Greek germs of explanations of fossils received no attention in Christendom before [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and even in the mid-eighteenth century [[Comte de Buffon]] was forced to retract simple geological truths by the theology faculty of the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]]. The doctrine of creation provided no room for animals, particularly carnivores, prior to Adam's fall and most theories of geology revolved around the flood which broke open "the fountains of the great deep". Attacks on geologists such as [[William Buckland]], [[William Conybeare (geologist)|Dean Conybeare]] and [[Adam Sedgwick|Prof Sedgwick]] from religious people continued into the nineteenth century, claiming that geology was "not a subject of lawful inquiry" and that they were "attacking the truth of God". But finally, Buckland abandoned his adherence to the special place of the flood in geological history and Lyell's [[uniformitarian]] doctrine held sway. Subsequently [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]]'s discovery that the Genesis story was an adaptation of earli—er Chaldean flood myths finished most attempts to use the flood story in science.

;Chapter 6 The Antiquity of Man, Egyptology, and Assyriology
The Biblical record was traditionally taken as a standard for the antiquity of mankind with estimates of 5199 BC under Pope Urban VIII in 1640 and 4004 BC of Bishop Ussher in 1650. [[Joseph Scaliger]] had previously argued for taking the histories of Egypt and Babylon into account and during the eighteenth century it became increasingly difficult to fit their chronologies into this timescale. In the nineteenth century, [[Menes]], the first king of Egypt was dated at more than 3,000 BC and that itself represented an advanced civilization, with its pyramids, sphinxes and astronomical knowledge. [[Manetho]] gave lists before this covering 24,000 years. Excavations of pottery in the Nile flood area gave times of 11,000 years. These periods were confirmed in Assyria and Babylon.

;Chapter 7 The Antiquity of Man and Prehistoric Archaeology
[[File:Bifaz micoquiense.jpg|thumb|right|Stone axes from Spain]]
From early ages people had found "[[Thunderstone (folklore)|thunder-stones]], [[Stone tool|shaped stones]] which were built into walls in Chaldea and hung round the necks of Egyptian dead. During the middle ages these were venerated as weapons used to drive out Satan in the "war in heaven". In the late 16th century, [[Michael Mercati]] attempted to prove they were weapons or implements of early races of men, but his and later finds were largely ignored until in 1847 [[Boucher de Perthes]] published the first volume of ''Celtic and Antediluvian Antiquities'' which included engravings of some of the thousands he had found close to the [[River Somme|Somme]]. In 1861, [[Edward Lartet]] showed evidence that humans had coexisted with extinct quaternary animals whose bones had cut marks on them and subsequently the existence of cave paintings at [[Les Eyzies]] and [[Abri de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]]. More finds even suggested that humans may have existed in the [[Tertiary]] period and showed "the utter inadequacy of the chronology given in our sacred books".

;Chapter 8 The "Fall of Man" and Anthropology
The Biblical view of the perfect creation of humans followed by a fall is paralleled by stories of a [[golden age]] in many cultures. The alternative, that man has slowly risen from low or brutal beginnings is also found in Greece and most notably [[Lucretius]]. Finds of [[Cro-Magnon]] and other skulls showed a rise in form. Finds in Scandinavia and elsewhere demonstrated a progression from stone to bronze to iron implements. Prehistoric buildings also showed development and this was also demonstrated by comparative [[ethnography]]. Attempts to challenge these have not been widely credited.

;Chapter 9 The "Fall of Man" and Ethnology
Study of groups of people in the early stages of development show many similarities with evidence of Egyptian or Jewish archaeology, demonstrating development. This was opposed by several otherwise liberal men including [[Archbishop Whately]] and the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] who argued that barbarous races were the remains of civilized races not their forerunners.

;Chapter 10 The "Fall of Man" and History
History shows many examples where weaker bodies of men driven out of society have not relapsed to barbarism but have risen even under the most unfavourable circumstances. Other civilizations that have declined have been replaced by richer. Thus "Anthropology and its handmaids Ethnology, Philology and History, have wrought out, beyond a doubt, proofs of the upward evolution of humanity".

;Chapter 11 From "The Prince of the Power of the Air" to Meteorology
The conceptions of the early church about the weather were largely concerned with the (solid) [[firmament]] above the earth, whether flat or spherical. Many writings were ascribed to [[Bede]] who thought the firmament was formed of ice. [[Albert the great]] attempted to reconcile the views of Aristotle with those of the fathers. But often the attempt was to explain scriptural ideas such as the promise of a rainbow given to Noah or to ascribe storms to demons. Disasters—floods, droughts, lightning—come as direct punishment from God for human sins. This applied up to the eighteenth century. The worst superstition blamed witches and used torture to extract confessions. Blaming demons for storms only ceased after [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]'s kite experiment with lightning in 1752.

;Chapter 12 From Magic to Chemistry and Physics
[[Alchemy|Magic]], which had been regarded with tolerance in the Roman empire as long as it was used for purposes such as healing, was seen in Christianity as the active interference of Satan. [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] quickly brought in severe laws against magic and magicians, though he subsequently said that his intention was only against malignant uses. But subsequent emperors forgot this distinction and severity against magic increased. By 1317 when [[Pope John XXII]] issued his [[Papal bull|bull]] aimed at the alchemists, he also dealt a severe blow to the beginnings of chemical science. In 1484 [[Pope Innocent VIII]] let inquisitors loose in Germany armed with the [[Witches Hammer]] to torture and destroy men and women for sorcery and magic. The Reformation did little to change things. Roger Bacon was deemed a superstitious alchemist. [[John Baptist Porta]]'s scientific society was broken up in the late 16th century. Even [[Robert Boyle]] was attacked from the Oxford pulpit. Attempts to resist scientific teaching continued into the 19th century.

;Chapter 13 From Miracles to Medicine 
Christianity brought hospitals and infirmaries following the lead of Jesus the healer. But there was a tendency to elevate normal acts of healing into subsequent accounts of miracles, as in the case of [[St. Francis Xavier]]. From this came an industry in healing [[relic]]s and belief in the '[[Laying on of hands#State use|royal touch]]'. For many years there was an idea that dissection was sacrilege and surgery was regarded as dishonourable. Until the 14th century it was mainly Jewish and Muslim physicians that promoted ideas of hygiene, and physical remedies risked the charge of magic. As [[Vesalius]] pioneered new approaches in the 16th century, many in the churches clung to the outmoded views of [[Galen]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries there was much religious opposition to the idea of inoculation.

;Chapter 14 From Fetich to Hygiene
Pestilences were frequent in medieval times but an idea took hold that cleanliness betokens pride and filthiness humility, leading to many of the great saints not washing for years. Since holy relics were regarded as cures, the church grew richer at times of epidemics. In the 16th century the blame for disease was often placed on heretics and witches who were widely tortured. But only in the 19th century was scientific hygiene widely introduced.

;Chapter 15 From "Demoniacal Possession" to Insanity
In Greek and Roman times, the idea of [[insanity]] as brain disease was gradually developed but this was forgotten by a church who believed in [[diabolic possession]], despite the efforts of some religious orders to keep scientific doctrines alive. This led to the tendency to punish the insane to combat the devils, particularly to eradicate Satan's pride. Only in the 18th century were more humane methods gradually introduced.

;Chapter 16 From Diabolism to Hysteria
As early as the 11th century there are accounts of diabolic possession taking the form of epidemics of raving, dancing and convulsions, particularly among women and children. This became pronounced at the end of the 14th century after the [[Black Death]]. In the 16th century [[Paracelsus]] suggested it might be a physical disease, but in the 17th there were further outbreaks such as the [[Loudun possessions]] and those leading to the witch trials at [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] and [[Würzburg witch trial|Würzburg]]. Later outbreaks were dispersed by more sceptical and humane means.

;Chapter 17 From Babel to Comparative Philology
Every people held that its language was given to it by its own deity. The Hebrew story recounts the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] as the source of multitudes of languages, a story which finds parallels in [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] and [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] mythologies. The early church generally took the view that the original language was [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], against which even [[Gregory of Nyssa]] argued in vain. There was trouble in the 16th century when some mistakenly argued that even the [[Hebrew alphabet|vowel signs]] in the Hebrew were part of the infallible text, not realising they were added by [[Rabbinic]] scribes between the 2nd and 11th centuries. Great efforts were made to trace the roots of European languages back to Hebrew, culminating in [[Brian Walton (bishop)|Bishop Walton]]'s [[Polyglot Bible]]. This was confounded when [[Sanskrit]], brought back to Europe originally by Jesuit missionaries, was shown by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] to be the root of all the [[Indo-European languages]], a verdict accepted by theologians, despite final skirmishes.

;Chapter 18 From the Dead Sea Legends to Comparative Mythology
[[File:MountSodom061607.jpg|thumb|The "Lot's Wife" pillar on Mount Sodom, Israel. The pillar is made of [[halite]].]]
Myths and legends abound in all countries and from all periods to explain natural phenomena. For centuries those of the countries surrounding Palestine were studied in comparison to each other, but never those of Palestine itself. But the legends such as the pillar of salt said to be [[Lot's wife]], near the [[Dead Sea]], were universally believed in Christendom, from [[St. Jerome]] to [[Sir John Mandeville]]. Yet from the 16th century, travellers from [[Pierre Belon]] were more sceptical, culminating in the visit of [[William F. Lynch|Lieutenant Lynch]] of the US Navy who sailed on the Dead Sea in 1847 and claimed justification for the Biblical story, but described the pillar of salt as a superstition. White welcomes the change by theologians and concludes "the worst enemy of Christianity could wish nothing more than that its main leaders should prove that it can not be adopted save by those who accept, as historical, statements which unbiased men throughout the world know to be mythical".

;Chapter 19 From Leviticus to Political Economy
The fathers of the church from [[Tertullian]] to [[St. Augustine]] joined with [[St. Basil]] in condemning money lent at interest as a 'fecund monster' and it was condemned at church councils from [[Synod of Elvira|Elvira]] in 304 to [[Council of Vienne|Vienne]] in 1311 and money-lenders were banned from communion. It was reinforced by Thomas Aquinas and [[Dante]]. Hence there was little capital and few lenders: rates of interest became 40% in England and 10% per month in Italy and Spain. The rich who had no way to invest their money spent it in ostentatious living and the Jews were hated as the money lenders. Eventually [[John Calvin|Calvin]] in the 16th century cut through the metaphysical arguments of Aristotle and declared that usury means ''illegal or oppressive interest''. Commerce and trade revived in Protestant countries, though more slowly in Germany. No change happened in Catholic countries until [[Benedict XIV]] in 1745 left open vague "occasions" and "special grounds" on which extra money could be charged. In 1830 the Inquisition at Rome decreed that in practice, confessors should no longer disturb lenders of money at legal interest. Slowly the church retreated from the many ways in which it dominated the economy.

;Chapter 20 From the Divine Oracles to the Higher Criticism
During the Renaissance, [[Erasmus]] noticed that a reference to the Trinity in the first letter of John was not in early manuscripts and omitted it from his Greek testament. There was an outcry. Luther omitted the same passage. The great Jewish scholar [[Aben-Ezra|Aben Ezra]] had discreetly questioned the [[Moses|Mosaic]] authorship of the [[Pentateuch]] in the 12th century and four centuries later a Catholic and a Protestant theologian both revived the idea but were suppressed. These ideas were revived by [[Spinoza]] a century later. By the early nineteenth century, it was shown in Germany that much of the [[Ritual Decalogue|Mosaic ceremonial law]] only dated from the [[Babylonian captivity|exile period]]. Techniques of criticism developed for secular history were applied to the sacred. In 1860, [[Samuel Wilberforce|Bishop Wilberforce]], who had a few months before battled Huxley over evolution, turned on [[Essays and Reviews]], which brought this thinking to England, creating a huge storm. By the end of the century, the same issues were facing the Catholic church. Meanwhile, the archeological results from Assyria and Egypt confirmed the radical readings of the Old Testament. Scholarship was also being brought to bear on the New Testament.

==Reception==
″No work—not even [[John William Draper]]'s best-selling History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874)—has done more than White's to instill in the public mind a sense of the adversarial relationship between [[science and religion]]. His Warfare remains in print to the present day, having appeared also in German, French, Italian, Swedish, and Japanese translations. His military rhetoric has captured the imagination of generations of readers, and his copious references, still impressive, have given his work the appearance of sound scholarship, bedazzling even twentieth-century historians who should know better. In recent decades, for example, the intellectual historian [[Bruce Mazlish]] certified White's thesis to have been established "beyond reasonable doubt," and the late [[George Sarton]], a distinguished [[historian of science]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] found White's argument so compelling that he urged its extension to non-Christian cultures.

Such judgments, however appealing they may be to foes of "scientific creationism" and other contemporary threats to established science, fly in the face of mounting evidence that White read the past through battle-scarred glasses, and that he and his imitators have distorted history to serve ideological ends of their own. Although it is not difficult to find instances of conflict and controversy in the annals of Christianity and science, recent scholarship has shown that the warfare metaphor to be neither useful or tenable in describing the relationship between science and religion.″&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of science Lawrence Principe writes, "No serious historians of science or of the science-religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis...The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men - John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White.  These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable."  
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Principe goes on to write "Despite appearances, White’s arguments are scarcely any better than Draper’s.  White uses fallacious arguments and suspect or bogus sources.  His methodological errors are collectivism (the unwarrantable extension of an individual’s views to represent that of some larger group of which he is a part), a lack of critical judgement about sources, argument by ridicule and assertion, failure to check primary sources, and quoting selectively and out of context.  White popularized the baseless notions that before Columbus and Magellan, the world was thought to be flat and that the Earth’s sphericity was officially opposed by the Church.  He is also responsible for the equally fallacious notion that the Church forbade human dissection.  The notion - eternally repopularized by Hollywood - that the medieval Church condemned all science as devilry runs throughout White; this view is likewise baseless."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In his course on Science and religion, Principe points out a couple of examples of White's poor scholarship, "Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat.  Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children.  The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC.  And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture."

Principe goes on to say, "White tells of a brave Columbus who fought mightily for the revolutionary notion of the earth’s sphericity.  And here he helps us out (damning himself) with a footnote that reads “W. Irving, Life of Columbus”  Yes, indeed, this is Washington Irving of Rip Van Winkle and headless horseman fame, who wrote a fictionalized account of Columbus in 1838.  Yet White uses it as a historical source.  This is an error of critical judgement."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Principe sums up White's book this way: "Refuting White is like shooting fish in a barrel.  With his combination of bad sources, argument by assertion, quoting out of context, collectivism, and general reliance on exclamation, rather than evidence and argument, White’s is not a book to be taken seriously.  Its real value is as a relic of its particular time and place, and as a museum of how not to write history...While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White’s writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that.  Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion.  Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds.  And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;


"Even a century after its publication, White's great work has much to teach us about the dangerous effects of religious doctrinalism on education and moral growth."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Conflict thesis|warfare motif]] which was popular in the 19th century has not worn well and most historians of science and religion have moved on from this. Current attitudes range over [[methodological naturalism]] and [[Stephen J. Gould|Gould]]'s [[Non-overlapping magisteria|NOMA]] although the conflict is still found between [[creationist]]s and scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=Tom Flynn - The Science vs. Religion Warfare Thesis|publisher=Point of Inquiry|date=February 22, 2008|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/tom_flynn_the_science_vs_religion_warfare_thesis/|accessdate=21 Aug 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of science and a self-confessed Christian, Ted Davis, has commented, "White was an historian himself, and for several generations his riveting narrative of enlightened and progressive science triumphing over ignorant and obscurantist theology set the tone for many other historical studies of science and religion. In the past few decades, however, historians of science have decisively rejected the ‘warfare’ view, along with many of the widely believed myths that White and Draper promulgated—such as the fictitious claim that John Calvin cited Psalm 93 against Nicolaus Copernicus or the wholly unfounded assertion that most Christians prior to Christopher Columbus believe in a flat earth. By insisting that all aspects of the history of science and religion must fit into one poorly chosen conceptual box, the ‘warfare’ view lied by gross oversimplification and led numerous scholars to overlook the large amount of historical material that just didn’t fit into that box."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Ted|title=Christianity and Science in Historical Perspective|url=http://www.qideas.org/blog/christianity-and-science-in-historical-perspective.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of science and the son of a Seventh-day Adventist preacher Ronald Numbers has stated, in a collection dealing with inaccuracies made by White and others, "Historians of science have known for years that White's and Draper's accounts are more propaganda than history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=9780674057418|page=6|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Christian writers' appeals that differences between science and religiosity have been resolved in a conciliatory manner, White's book was and continues to be a resounding and scholarly indictment of Draper's charge that "The history of Science is not a mere record of isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other."[7]

==Critical works==

In response to many of White's assertions, [[James Joseph Walsh]] wrote a historical response called ''The Popes and Science: The History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time'' in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=James Joseph|title=The Popes and Science: The History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time|origyear=1908|year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=9781440053023}} [https://archive.is/20141004065158/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433068298623;view=1up;seq=9 text online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adi Da Samraj''', born '''Franklin Albert Jones''' (November 3, 1939 – November 27, 2008&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=107501|title= Spiritual leader passes on|date= November 28, 2008|work= www.fijitimes.com|accessdate= February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was an American spiritual teacher, writer and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.adidam.org/adi-da/|title= An Introduction to Avatar Adi Da|work= www.adidam.org|accessdate= February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the founder of a [[new religious movement]] known as '''''Adidam'''''. He changed his name numerous times throughout his life;  these names included '''Bubba Free John''', '''Da Free John''', '''Da Love-Ananda''', '''Da Kalki''', '''Da Avadhoota''' and '''Da Avabhasa''', among others. From 1991 until his death, he was known as '''Adi Da Love-Ananda Samraj''' or '''Adi Da'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Vol.IV|last= Gallagher|first= Eugene V.|author2= Ashcraft, W.

Adi Da initially became known in the spiritual [[counterculture]] of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many [[eastern religions]] which see [[spiritual enlightenment]] as the ultimate priority of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Gurus in America |last= Forsthoefel|first= Thomas A.|author2= Humes, Cynthia Ann|year= 2005|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location=Albany, NY |isbn= 0-7914-6573-X |page= 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of New Religious Movements|last= Chryssides|first= George D.|authorlink= George D.

As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America [Five Volumes]|last= Gallagher|first= Eugene V.|author2= Ashcraft, W.

==Biography==

===Youth (1939–70)===
[[File:AdiDaInfant.jpg|thumb|left|Adi Da as an infant, 1940]]Adi Da was born Franklin Albert Jones on November 3, 1939, in [[Queens, New York]] and raised on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Ed, "The House Where Swami Lived"Long Island Newsday Magazine, September 14, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a salesman and his mother a housewife. A sister, Joanne, was born when he was eight years old. He served as an [[acolyte]] in the Lutheran church during his adolescence and aspired to be a minister, though after leaving for college in the autumn of 1957&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northcoastjournal.com/011499/cover0114.html |title=North Coast Journal, Humboldt County, CA – Cover story Jan. 14, 1999 |publisher=Northcoastjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed doubts about the religion to his Lutheran pastor. He graduated in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from [[Columbia University]] and went on to complete a master's degree in English literature at [[Stanford University]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated86"&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.86-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg, "Holy Madness," 1st ed., Arkana, 1992, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Columbia, Adi Da began using a variety of [[hallucinogenic]] and other drugs,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Franklin "[http://www.beezone.com/AdiDa/KneeofListening/book/ The Knee of Listening: The Life and Understanding  of Franklin Jones]" (1971), [http://www.beezone.com/AdiDa/KneeofListening/book/chapter4.html chapter 4] "He had some raw peyote, and we decided to take the drug, although neither of us had any idea what its effects would be. In the past months I had used marijuana a few times and found it very enjoyable and relaxing. And so I willingly accepted a chance for some kind of very powerful "high.""&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes heavily.&lt;ref&gt;Adi Da, "The Knee of Listening," Middletown, CA: Dawn Horse Press, 1995, p. 168, "I would often exploit the possibilities of sex or become deeply drunk on wine, engage in orgies of eating, or smoke marijuana for hours."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, after finishing at Stanford, for 6 weeks he was a paid test subject in drug trials of [[mescaline]], [[LSD]], and [[psilocybin]] that were conducted at a [[Veterans Administration]] hospital in California.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley, Edmiston "Adidam Comes to the North Coast", North Coast Journal Weekly, Jan. 14, 1999 "Following a summer job as a hotel waiter, during which time he experimented with peyote, Jones entered graduate school at Stanford University...During this time, his autobiography states, Jones took "large doses" of cough medicine and was a poorly paid subject for hallucinogenic drug trials which included mescaline, LSD and psilocybin that were being conducted at the local Veterans Administration hospital. Responding to what he called a vision, Jones prepared to leave California in June 1964 in search of a spiritual teacher in New York City."&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote later that he found these experiences "self-validating" in that they mimicked ecstatic states of consciousness from his childhood, but problematic as they often resulted in paranoia, anxiety, or disassociation.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Franklin "The Knee of Listening..." (1971), [http://www.beezone.com/AdiDa/KneeofListening/book/chapter8.html chapter 8] "By the spring of 1965 I had begun to use marijuana frequently. I found it relaxing and particularly necessary under the pressure of work and effort that Rudi required. But the drug began to have a peculiarly negative effect...I would realize a profound anxiety and fear...I took other drugs with my old friends. We took Romilar [cough syrup] again, but now its effects seemed minor...I took a drug called DMT which had a remarkable and miraculous effect...Such remarkable states of awareness combined with my rising sense of anxiety, fear and reluctance in relation to drugs, so that finally, in the early summer of 1965, I determined somehow to stop their use"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Franklin "The Knee of Listening..." (1971), chapter 4 "I voluntarily submitted to drug trials at the V.A. hospital in Fountain View, California…At the V.A. hospital I was given a dose of drugs one day per week. I was told that I would be given mescalin, LSD, or psilocybin at three separate sessions, and, during a fourth session, some combination of these…There were also various bizarre experiences and periods of anxiety...I suffered anxiety attacks and occasional nervousness for perhaps a year beyond the actual tests."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.88 "Jones discovered that his psychedelic drug experiences sometimes mimicked the ecstatic states he had known in childhood and was now desperate to recapture."&lt;/ref&gt; For over a year, Adi Da lived with his girlfriend Nina Davis in the hills of [[Palo Alto]]. While she worked to support them,&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.88 "He spent 1963–64 secluded in remote cabins in northern California working on his writing…he was supported by Nina Davis, a woman he later married, establishing a pattern of financial dependence that was to mark all but a few years of his life."&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote, took drugs, meditated informally, and studied books on [[hermeticism]] in order to make sense of his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Knee...Ashram (1972), p. 22-23 "After my experiences at the VA hospital, I went into a period of relative seclusion...Nina worked as a schoolteacher and supported our living."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, W.P., The Gurdjieff Journal, "Gurdjieff &amp; The New Age Part IX, Franklin Jones &amp; Rudi Part I": "Jones and his girlfriend, Nina, went to live in a cabin in the mountains above Santa Cruz where she supported them while after he meditated, did drugs and tried to make sense out of what he had experienced by immersing himself in books of hermetic wisdom."&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to an intuitive impulse, they left California in June 1964 in search of a spiritual teacher in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee..." Ashram (1972), p.35 "I saw pictures of a store with oriental sculpture...in New York..."&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in [[Greenwich Village]], Adi Da became a student of [[Albert Rudolph]], also known as "Rudi", an oriental art dealer and self-styled spiritual [[guru]]. Having studied a number of spiritual traditions, including "The Work" of [[G.I. Gurdjieff]] and [[Subud]], Rudolph was then a follower of [[Siddha Yoga]] founder [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]], who gave Rudi the name "Swami Rudrananda". Rudi taught an eclectic blend of techniques he called "kundalini yoga"&lt;ref&gt;Swami Rudrananda [Rudi]. Spiritual Cannibalism. Links Books, New York, 1973, First Edition{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historical dictionary of New Age movements by Michael York The Rowman Litterfield Publishing Group, 2004, pp 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; (having no literal relationship to the Indian tradition by that name.)&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," 1992 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da's father told Rudi of his son's onetime aspiration to become a Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary.&lt;ref name="Feuerstein, Holy Madness, p. 81"&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 'Knee', 1972, chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an [[anxiety attack]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee...", Ashram (1972), p.62&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first in a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights.&lt;ref name="Feuerstein, Holy Madness, p. 81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher,''New and Alternative Religions in America'' p. 89, "… Jones' himself describes [this event] as … "apparent evidence of a 'clinical breakdown.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's [[Russian Orthodox]] Seminary in [[Tuckahoe, Suffolk County, New York|Tuckahoe]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee..." (1971), [http://www.beezone.com/AdiDa/KneeofListening/book/chapter9.html chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for [[Pan American Airlines]], in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's [[ashram]] in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Eugene, Ashcraft, Michael, ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'', Vol. V, p. Greenwood Press. (2006). {{ISBN|0-275-98712-4}}. pages 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in New York, Adi Da and wife Nina became members and then employees of the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee...", Ashram, 1972, p.84 "I spent that year working for Scientology..."&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Disconnection|Scientology protocol]], he wrote Rudi a letter severing all contact.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee...", (1971), chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; After a little more than a year of involvement, Adi Da left [[Scientology]]. He then returned to India for a month-long visit in early 1969, during which Swami Muktananda authorized him to initiate others into Siddha Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Andrew, ''Book of Enlightened Masters: Western Teachers in Eastern Traditions''. Open Court (1997) {{ISBN|0-8126-9310-8}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness,"1992 p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and a friend from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their belongings and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee..." Ashram (1972), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or [[shakti]]) directed him to make a pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in Europe and the middle east, all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," a1992 p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee..." Ashram (1972), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Becoming a guru (1970–73)===
[[File:AdiDaLA1973.jpg|thumb|left|Adi Da in Los Angeles, 1973]]In September 1970, Adi Da said that while sitting in the [[Vedanta Society]] Temple in Hollywood,&lt;ref name="Feuerstein, Holy Madness, p. 82"&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; he permanently realized "The Bright", his term for a state of complete [[spiritual enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Feuerstein, Holy Madness, p. 82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher...''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'' Vol. IV, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Andrew, ''Book of Enlightened Masters: Western Teachers in Eastern Traditions'' Open Court (1997) {{ISBN|0-8126-9310-8}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an autobiography titled ''The Knee of Listening'', which was published in 1972. In it, Adi Da wrote that he had uniquely been born with full awareness of "the Bright," but this knowledge became obscured in childhood. His subsequent spiritual journey was a quest to recapture this awareness, and share it with others.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon/Baumann. Religions of The World- A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, Volume 1. ABC-CLIO Ltd. (2002). {{ISBN|1-57607-223-1}}. page 3 In his autobiography he asserts that he was born in a state of perfect awareness…. Jones spent his college and subsequent years in a spiritual quest...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg. (2006). Holy Madness: Spirituality, Crazy-Wise Teachers, And Enlightenment, Hohm Press. {{ISBN|1-890772-54-2}}, Pages 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1970, Swami Muktananda stopped in California on a worldwide tour largely underwritten by Rudi. Adi Da visited him and related his experience the previous month of "The Bright." Adi Da felt that the swami did not understand or properly acknowledge the full importance of his experience. During the visit Adi Da reconciled with Rudi.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, The Knee of Listening, 1972 ed., pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

With fellow former Scientology employee Sal Lucania as financier, Adi Da opened Ashram Books (later Dawn Horse Books), a spirituality bookshop in Los Angeles. He began giving lectures there based on his autobiography, soon attracting a small following due in part to his charismatic speaking style.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Eugene, Ashcraft, Michael. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Volume V, p.85 "...began to attract a small following"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"Hypnotic Da Free John – Svengali of the truth-seeking set", San Francisco Examiner/April 5, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; He taught in a traditional Indian style, lecturing from a raised dais surrounded by flowers and oriental carpets, with listeners seated on the floor. He incorporated many ideas from the [[Kashmir]] [[Shaivite]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]] schools of [[Hinduism]], but also expressed original insights and opinions about both spirituality and secular culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"The Gurdjieff Journal," Gurdjieff &amp; The New Age Part IX, Franklin Jones &amp; Rudi Part I, by William Patrick Patterson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher...''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'' Vol. IV, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of the first westerners to become well known as a teacher of meditation and eastern esoteric traditions at a time when these were of growing interest.&lt;ref name="Gallagher. p. 88"&gt;Gallagher...''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'' Vol. IV, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Some early participants stated that Adi Da demonstrated an ability to produce alterations in their consciousness, likening the effect to [[shaktipat]] of Indian [[yoga]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher..."Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America" Vol. IV, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

With an increasing number of followers, Adi Da founded a [[new religious movement]] called "The Dawn Horse Communion". In 1973, he traveled to India to meet a final time with Swami Muktananda in hopes of being recognized as a "[[Mahasiddha]]", or fully enlightened sage. They disagreed on a series of questions Adi Da had prepared. This effectively ended their relationship, and they went on to later disparage each other's relative level of spiritual accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Scott and Lane, David. (1996) "DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones", Mt. San Antonio College Philosophy Group: "In his evening talks, Da Free John frequently referred to Muktananda as a "black magician." Muktananda spoke of his former student in similar terms."&lt;/ref&gt; Adi Da nevertheless stated that he continued to appreciate and respect Muktananda as his onetime teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "Knee...", (1972), chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher...''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'' Vol. IV, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," p. 83 "[Jones] believed that his guru was settling for less than the ultimate, while Muk. dismissed [Jones] arguments as pretentious...a breach between them opened that never formally healed. [Jones] continued to criticize Muk. in talks and publications, while at the same time acknowledging his debt..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MountainOfAttention.jpg|thumb|The Mountain Of Attention Sanctuary in Lake County, California]]Upon returning to Los Angeles, Adi Da (then Franklin Jones) directed his students that he should now be addressed as "Bubba Free John," based on a nickname meaning "friend" combined with a rendering of "Franklin Jones". He divorced Nina, although she remained a follower.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," 1992 p. 87, 94&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1974, Adi Da told his followers that he was "the divine lord in human form".&lt;ref&gt;Gourley, Edmiston "Adidam Comes to the North Coast", North Coast Journal Weekly, Jan. 14, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the church obtained an aging hot springs resort in [[Lake County, California|Lake County]], California, renaming it "Persimmon" (it is now known as "The Mountain of Attention"). Adi Da and a group of selected followers moved there and experimented in [[communal living]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," 1992, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Most followers relocated from Los Angeles to San Francisco, where Dawn Horse Books also moved.

Adi Da often changed his name, saying it reflected differences or changes in the nature of his message and relationship to followers.  In 1979, he changed his name from "Bubba Free John" to "Da Free John". Subsequent names included Da Love-Ananda, Dau Loloma, Da Kalki, Hridaya-Samartha Sat-Guru Da, Santosha Da, Da Avadhoota, Da Avabhasa, and from 1994, Adi Da Love-Ananda Samraj, or Adi Da. Adi Da translated the Sanskrit syllable ''Da'' as "giver."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher...''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'' Vol. IV, pp. 85, 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg and Feuerstein, Patricia (1982) ''Remembrance Of The Divine Names of Da'', {{ISBN|0-913922-72-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Crazy Wisdom" (1973–84)===
[[File:CrazyWisdom.jpg|thumb|left|Adi Da during the Garbage and the Goddess period, 1974]]
In 1973, Adi Da began to use more unconventional means of instruction he called "[[crazy wisdom]]", likening his methods to a tradition of yogic adepts who employed seemingly un-spiritual methods to awaken observer's consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice By Georg Feuerstein; p25&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers reported having profound metaphysical experiences in Adi Da's presence, attributing these phenomena to his spiritual power.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," (1992) p.84 "(students) experienced visions, spontaneous body movements known as kriyas, bliss states, heart openings, kundalini arousals, and several were apparently drawn into the mystical unitive state or even into temporary sahaja-samadhi"&lt;/ref&gt; Others present remained skeptical, witnessing nothing supernatural.&lt;ref name="Lowe 1996"&gt;{{Cite book|title= DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones|last=Lowe |first=Scott |authorlink= |author2=Lane, David |year=1996 |publisher= Mt.

Adi Da initiated a period of teachings and activities that came to be known as the "Garbage and the Goddess". He directed his followers in "sexual theater", a form of [[psychodrama]]&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Katy: "Sex Practices Did Not Cease, Marin Cult Officials Admit" San Francisco Chronicle, April 9, 1985 "Officials of the Free John group said they participate in "spiritual theater," a kind of psychodrama in which people are encouraged to release sexual and emotional problems as they travel the path to union with God."&lt;/ref&gt; that often involved public and group sex, the making of pornographic movies, and other intensified sexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," p. 86-87 "In 1974 he started his "sexual theater", involving the switching of partners, sexual orgies, the making of pornographic movies, and intensified sexual practices – all of which led to the temporary or, in some case permanent breakups of relationships"&lt;/ref&gt; Drug and alcohol use were often encouraged, and earlier proscriptions against meat and "junk food" were no longer adhered to.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da said that this behavior was part of a radical overturning of all conventional moral values and social contracts&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," 1992, p. 84-86; p.89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Free John, Bubba, "Garbage and the Goddess: the last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John," DHP, 1974, p. 13 "This is what the spiritual life is all about...nothing conventional survives."&lt;/ref&gt; in order to help shock students into insights regarding habitual  patterns and emotional attachments so that they could more completely surrender to him and the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," 2006, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1996), ''Holy Madness: The Dangerous and Disillusioning Example of Da Free John'', What Is Enlightenment? Issue 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;Molly Colin, Peter Seidman, and Tony Lewis, "Defectors voice several charges" Mill Valley Record/April 3, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neary, Walt,''Inner Circle Privy to Parties'', Lake County Record Bee, April 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional marriage received Adi Da's particular criticism, and many couples were forced to split up or switch partners.&lt;ref&gt;Bubba Free John, "Garbage and the Goddess" (Lower Lake, CA: Dawn Horse Press, 1974), pp. 16, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," (1992) p.84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...Gurdjieff Journal: "In particular, Bubba attacked the "cult of pairs" and notions of marriage in particular, which he said only serves the seeking and separateness which at root are the denial of the Divinity of the simple here and now...Bubba first told them: "The instant you marry, you must discard it. Otherwise marriage is another cultic form, a sex contract, in which you become medievally involved with personality forms, making yourself strategically unavailable to the rest of life, and again mutually create the sensation of separate existence, including "poor me" or "fantastic me."... The cult of marriage is a principal obstacle in the affair of the spiritual Community..." Bubba then broke up couples and marriages and began what was called the "sexual theater," that of switching partners, instituting orgies and making pornographic movies.&lt;/ref&gt; Adi Da himself had nine or more polygamous partners during this time that he called his "wives", including [[Playboy]] [[centerfold]] Julie Anderson, aka "[[Whitney Kaine]]" who had entered the community as a follower's girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Leydecker, Mary: "Suit Shatters Calm for Sect Members, "Marin Independent-Journal, April 5, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; He likewise recommended polygamy or [[polyamory]] to some followers.&lt;ref&gt;Bubba Free John, "Garbage and the Goddess" (Lower Lake, CA: Dawn Horse Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da published his fourth book, titled ''Garbage and the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John''. It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures and activities of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, 1992, pp.266&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly sold out its first print run, and a second was sent to bookstores. However, due to the controversial nature of its contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da's behest.&lt;ref name="autogenerated86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kripal, "Gurus in America"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, 1992, pp.266–267: "Due to the controversial nature of material in the book, almost immediately at the behest of Da Love Ananda, every effort was made to retrieve all existing copies..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Adi Da moved with a group of about 40 followers to the Fijian island of [[Naitaba]], purchased by a wealthy follower from the actor [[Raymond Burr]].&lt;ref&gt;Leydecker, Mary: "Suit Shatters Calm for Sect Members,"Marin Independent-Journal, April 5, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It was his primary residence until the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;"Spiritual leader passes on", Fiji Times, November 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public controversy (1985–86)===
Accusations of Adi Da abusing his power as a spiritual leader attracted international attention in 1985.&lt;ref name="Lowe 1996"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt; Adi Da and Adidam (then known as Da Free John and The Johannine Daist Communion) were subjects of almost daily coverage in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', ''Mill Valley Record'', other newspapers, and regional television news and talk shows over several weeks early in the year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The story gained national attention with a two-part exposé on [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]] that aired May 9 and 10.&lt;ref name="Today Transcript"&gt;NBC Today Show, May 9, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In investigative reports and dozens of interviews, both named and anonymous ex-members made numerous specific allegations of Adi Da forcing members to engage in psychologically, sexually, and physically abusive and humiliating behavior, as well as accusing the church of committing tax fraud. Others stated that they never witnessed or were involved in any such activities.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1996), "Holy Madness: The Dangerous and Disillusioning Example of Da Free John," What Is Enlightenment? Issue 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Peter, "Sexual experiments continued after '76, JDC officiaIs admit"
Mill Valley Record/April 10, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Katy: "Sex Practices Did Not Cease, Marin Cult Officials Admit"
San Francisco Chronicle, April 9, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Molly Colin, Peter Seidman, and Tony Lewis, "Defectors voice several charges"
Mill Valley Record/April 3, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neary, Walt,'Inner Circle Privy to Parties,' Lake County Record Bee, April 12, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sex Slave Sues Guru: Pacific Isle Orgies Charged San Francisco Chronicle, April 4, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da and his organization were sued by Beverly O'Mahoney, then wife of the Adidam president, for [[fraud]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]], [[false imprisonment]], and [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] (among other things); the suit sought $5 million in damages.&lt;ref name="sfchron-04"/&gt;
To a local reporter, Adidam threatened to file its own lawsuit against O'Mahoney, as well as five others who had been named in stories and interviews making allegations of abuse (no suit was ever filed). Adidam charged that allegations against the church were part of an extortion plot.&lt;ref name=mvr-06&gt;Molly Colin, "Da Free John Sect Sues 6 Ex-Members On Extortion Charge, ''The Mill Valley Record'', April 17, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church issued conflicting statements in response to the coverage. A lawyer for the church said that controversial sexual activities had only occurred during the "Garbage and Goddess" period years earlier. Shortly after, an official church spokesman said that "[[tantra]]-style encounters" of the kind described in allegations were still occurring, but were mostly confined to an inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," Arkana, 1992, p.90 "sexual [experiments] were for the most part confined to an inner circle. But occasionally some relative newcomers were included. This happened to one couple in 1982, who provide this fascinating extensive account...(p. 92)Tantra-style encounters of this kind occurred periodically and more or less secretly until at least the end of 1985, and led to legal difficulties..."&lt;/ref&gt; This confirmed the stories by former members that such activities had continued up to the time of the lawsuits and interviews, but had been kept hidden.&lt;ref&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle, April 9, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Channel 2 News, San Francisco, March, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Peter, "Sexual experiments continued after '76, JDC officials admit" Mill Valley Record/April 10, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The church said that no illegal acts had taken place and that the movement had a right to continue experiments in lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;The Mill Valley Record, April 10, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="northcoastjournal.com"&gt;http://www.northcoastjournal.com/011499/cover0114.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lawsuits were filed against Adi Da and the church in California in 1985. The O'Mahoney suit was dismissed the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Wildermuth, John, "Sex Guru Touts Celibacy", The San Francisco ''Chronicle'', June 16th, 1986, "...a Marin County judge ruled that O'Mahony had no legal basis for bringing the (lawsuit)..."&lt;/ref&gt; The other lawsuit and several threatened suits in subsequent years were settled with payments and confidentiality agreements,&lt;ref&gt;"Deep Throat's Daughter, The Kindred Free Spirit", Washington Post, June 12, 2005 "The lawsuits and threatened suits that dogged the group in the mid-1980s were settled with payments and confidentiality agreements, says a California lawyer, Ford Greene, who handled three such cases."&lt;/ref&gt; negatively impacting member morale and bleeding the organization financially.&lt;ref name="northcoastjournal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher...Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America Vol. IV, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," Arkana, 1992, p.267-268 "Over the years, [Jones] has been sued several times by disaffected students, although institutional representatives have so far succeeded in keeping him out of court. Cases were settled by arbitration, which bled the [church] financially."&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Divine Emergence" and final years (1986–2008)===
[[File:AdiDa1986.jpg|thumb|left|Adi Da at The Mountain Of Attention Sanctuary, 1986]]On January 11, 1986, distressed by what he felt was the futility of his work, Adi Da experienced a physical and psychological crisis. Doctors diagnosed exhaustion and stress, but he afterward described it as a death and resurrection. As in previous and subsequent similar episodes, Adi Da attributed special significance to it, calling it his "Divine Emergence".&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg. (2006). Holy Madness: Spirituality, Crazy-Wise Teachers, An Enlightenment, Hohm Press. {{ISBN|1-890772-54-2}} pp. 166 – 167 "On January 11 he underwent what he describes as a "literal death experience" This was of many experiences of this kind since his days in college. This particular incident, however, was subsequently greatly elaborated and invested with special significance and it continues to shape his relationship with devotees into the present...In a talk given at the end of February 1986, he explained that on that eventful morning he has spoken to his close devotees of his grief sorrow and frustration and the seemingly futility of his teaching work..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p. 94 "the most loudly trumpeted event since Jones' initial enlightenment was his so-called 'Divine Emergence', the result of an apparent 'near-death' experience Jones had in 1986. As Jones describes it, he was in such despair over the failure of his work that he prayed for an immediate end to the charade."&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, he said that one needed only to meditate on his image or body in order to "participate in his enlightened state".&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg. (2006). Holy Madness: Spirituality, Crazy-Wise Teachers, And Enlightenment, Hohm Press. {{ISBN|1-890772-54-2}} "Page 166 – 167 "He explained that most enlightened beings "incarnate only partially" into the body. Adi Da said that in this event he "descended" fully into the body, becoming "utterly human"...it was sufficient for disciples to simply meditate upon him to "participate in his enlightened state"&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da had predicted that by the year 2000 he would be recognized by the entire world for his unique spiritual realization. When this failed to occur, he experienced another breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.95, "the year 2000 was momentous for Jones. He was not recognized by the entire world, contrary to expectations, and he died again."&lt;/ref&gt; This was said to initiate another period, where Adi Da would shift from "active teaching" to silent "spiritual blessing" to counteract negative forces in the world.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael, ''Historical Dictionary of New Age Movements'', Rowman Litterfield Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-4873-3}}, 2004, p. 12 "Since his "emergence" Adi Da has shifted his focus from teaching to..."Spiritual Blessing Work" to diminish the world's negative forces.&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless continued to write books, make art, and give talks to his followers, but with an increased emphasis on what he called "silent [[Darśana|darshan]]".&lt;ref name="Gallagher. p.96"&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, some followers of spiritual teacher [[Frederick Lenz]] joined Adidam, reportedly upsetting long-time followers who felt the new members were undeservedly privileged (Lenz, also known as "Zen Master Rama", had committed suicide in 1998). Adi Da claimed to have been [[Swami Vivekananda]] in a past life, and said that in a previous incarnation Lenz was then a disciple.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.95; Adi Da "actively recruited followers of [Lenz] after his highly sedated death by drowning. Lenz's followers were widely admired for their success in business and computing and represented an attractive potential "catch." From all reports, Jones pulled out all the stops, giving immediate satsang to Lenz's followers and inviting some directly into his inner circle, deeply offending his own long-suffering devotees. Jones also proclaimed that Lenz...had been a reincarnation of Swami Rama Tirtha...a former disciple."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Holy Madness (2006), p.176 "Also in the year 2000, Adi da welcomed into his church the remaining community of Fredrick P Lenz III"&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da later began exhibiting his digital art and photography.&lt;ref name="Gallagher. p.96"/&gt; Followers reported that he died of cardiac arrest on November 27, 2008 at his home in Fiji, while working on his art.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakeconews.com/content/view/6664/764/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627073749/http://lakeconews.com/content/view/6664/764/ |archivedate=2009-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from an email sent to the Adidam community by a spokesperson in Fiji

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Devotees, It is the middle of the night here at Adi Da Samrajashram, devotees remain in what is now clearly the Mahasamadhi Vigil of Beloved Bhagavan Sapta Na Adi Da Samraj. The time of Beloved Bhagavan's Divine Mahasamadhi is being placed at approximately 5:10 PM on Thursday, November 27th, 2008. Everyone here has been shocked at how quickly the Mahasamadhi occurred. Bhagavan Adi Da was sitting in His Chair Working in Picture Perfect. Just a minute before, He had been Giving Instructions relative to His Divine Image Art. A few minutes before that, He had been speaking humorously and laughing. And then He silently fell over on His Side and within a very short period of no more than a couple of minutes, He had entered into His Mahasamadhi. Dr. Charles Seage and Dr. Andrew Dorfman diagnose that Beloved Bhagavan suffered a fatal heart attack.[http://nonduality.org/2008/11/28/adi-da-is-dead/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adi Da had four children: three biological daughters with three different women, and one adopted daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, 2006, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  These include actress [[Shawnee Free Jones]].

==Philosophy==
Fundamental to Adi Da's religious philosophy is the essentially "eastern" religious concept that the purpose of human life is [[spiritual enlightenment]], an awakening to ultimate reality that is the natural state of all human beings (though seemingly obscured.)&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Eugene, Ashcraft, Michael. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Volume V, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Self-contraction"===
Adi Da said that what keeps human beings from experiencing this ultimate, enlightened reality is the activity of [[ego (spirituality)|ego]], which he stated is the source of all emotional, psychological, and spiritual dissatisfaction. He called this activity "self-contraction," and defined it as a psychological mechanism lying somewhere beneath the normal level of conscious awareness, leading people to believe they are limited, suffering individuals. He said that fundamentally, all efforts to unite with the divine from the point of view of a separate self were futile, since that separate self itself is illusory.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Eugene, Ashcraft, Michael. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Volume V, p.97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Seventh stage realization"===
Adi Da developed a map of potential human and spiritual evolution that he called "the seven stages of life".&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America [Five Volumes]
By Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft, Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0-275-98712-4}}, 2006, page 99&lt;/ref&gt;
*First Stage—"individuation/physical development"
*Second Stage—"socialization"
*Third Stage—"integration/mental development"
*Fourth Stage—"spiritualization/Divine Communion"
*Fifth Stage—"spiritual ascent"
*Sixth Stage—"abiding in consciousness"
*Seventh Stage—"Divine Enlightenment: awakening from all egoic limitations"

The first six stages account for all permutations of religion and culture throughout history, as well as levels of personal development. Adi Da categorized the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of life as the highest respective stages of human development. He characterized those who have reached these stages as "saints", "yogis", and "sages", including other religious figures such as [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Samraj, Adi Da (2004). The Knee of Listening. "I (Alone) Am The Adidam Revelation". pgs. 502–504. Dawn Horse Press. {{ISBN|1-57097-167-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative to this spectrum, Adi Da stated that while some  "yogis, saints, and sages" had occasionally indicated some awareness of a "seventh stage", only he as a unique [[avatar]] had ever been born fully invested with the capability to fully embody it; furthermore, as the first "Seventh Stage Adept" only he would ever need to (or be capable of) doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Samraj (2005b) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the seventh stage has nothing to do with development and does not come after the sixth stage in a sequential manner. The culminating awareness of this seventh stage is a permanent, natural state of "open-eyed ecstasy", for which Adi Da employed the Sanskrit term ''Sahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher...New Religions, p.100 "...despite this state being well attested in yogic literature (for instance among the ascetic Bauls of Bengal), Adi Da portrayed it as his own exclusive state."&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da insisted that since he solely embodied seventh stage realization, devotional worship of him would henceforth be the exclusive means for others to free themselves from "self-contraction", thereby allowing them to "participate in his enlightened state" (i.e. attain awareness themselves of the seventh stage, or "realize" it.)&lt;ref&gt;Samraj, Adi Da, ''Eleutherios'', Dawn Horse Press, 2006, p. 456; "I Am the First (and the Only One) to Realize and to Demonstrate seventh stage Realization, which (now, and forever hereafter) I Alone, and Uniquely, Reveal and Transmit to all my formally practicing true devotees and thus potentially to all beings."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg. (2006) ''Holy Madness'', p. 167 "it was sufficient for disciples to simply meditate upon him to "participate in his enlightened state"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher/Ashcraft, ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George D. Chryssides, ''The A to Z of New Religious Movements'', Rowan Litterfield Publishing Group, 2001, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adidam==
[[File:Da Love-Ananda Mahal in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Dome Temple at Da Love-Ananda Mahal in [[Kauai, Hawaii]]]]
[[File:AdiDaSamrajashram.jpg|thumb|Temple at Adi Da Samrajashram in [[Naitaba]], [[Fiji]]]]
''Adidam'' refers to both the organization of Adi Da's devotees and the religion he taught. The organization, or church, founded initially in 1972, went by many earlier names, including the Dawn Horse Communion, the Free Communion Church, the Laughing Man Institute, the Crazy Wisdom Fellowship, the Way of Divine Ignorance, and the Johannine Daist Communion.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Gary; "How Franklin Jones Became the Master", The Mill Valley Record/April 3, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Adidam presupposes an eastern view of divinity and accepts the concepts of [[karma]], [[reincarnation]], [[chakra]]s, etc. It also employs many [[Sanskrit]] terms and concepts. God, or the divine, is seen as a principle and energy, a consciousness that predates creation but is not a willful creator itself.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Though earlier manifestations were more eclectic and experimental, over time Adidam increasingly came to resemble the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition of [[Guru-shishya tradition#Bhakti yoga|bhakti yoga]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, The New Religious Movements Experience in America, p.98-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein 1992, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of Adidam is now defined by its emphasis on a devotional relationship to Adi Da, whom followers see as an enlightened source of power serving as the sole gateway to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Adi Da's followers often refer to him simply as "Beloved".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Through devotion and service, it is believed that the follower's consciousness is gradually transformed in the image of Adi Da's. While devotion to Adi Da and the study of his teachings are the primary features of Adidam, other specified practices are also prescribed, including the study of other religious texts, physical exercises, regulation of sexuality, and a raw vegan diet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"America 2004, Page 118"&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da said that after his death there would not be any further teachings or "revelations", and that his message was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; His artwork, writings, and the religious hermitages and sanctuaries "empowered" by his presence are to remain as expressions of his teaching and being. He was emphatic that no individual assert themselves as his representative or heir.&lt;ref name="Samraj 2007, pg.110"&gt;Samraj, Adi Da, "The Orders of My True and Free Renunciate Devotees", Dawn Horse Press, 2007, pg.110 "all those who truly devotionally recognize Avatar Adi Da serve as "instruments" of His Blessing-Regard in the world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, The New Religious Movements Experience in America, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

While the church is based on Naitaba Island, Fiji, there are five officially designated ashrams, or "sanctuaries", belonging to Adidam. Three are located in North America, with another in Hawaii. Followers of Adidam have been ambitious and prolific in their dissemination of Adi Da's books and teachings; however, the church is estimated to have remained more or less constant at approximately 1,000 members worldwide since 1974, with a high rate of turnover among membership.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, pp.86, 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein 1992, p. 93 "[He] has a flair for drama and it has been successful in keeping the attention of [some] for years...but it evidently is not a way that holds an attraction for larger numbers of spiritually motivated people."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
Adi Da wrote prolifically about his spiritual philosophy, creating the Dawn Horse Press in 1973 to publish his books. It continues to print many Adi Da-authored titles.&lt;ref name="dawnhorsepress.com"/&gt; Best known&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, (1992) p.80&lt;/ref&gt; among these is his autobiography, ''The Knee of Listening.'' First published in 1972, it has been reissued in a number of editions, undergoing extensive revisions and additions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated106"&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, p.106 "Jones significantly modified later editions of Knee, including...""...in later editions, Jones' childhood is presented as utterly exceptional...It is clear that Jones' autobiography might best be understood as a kind of auto-hagiography, since its purpose is to preserve for posterity a sanitized, mythologized, and highly selective account of  Jones' life and spiritual adventures."&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was 271 pages long; the latest is 840.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher... "Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, pp.106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In the last decade of his life, Adi Da created visual art. These works were primarily photographic and digitally produced. He labeled his style "Transcendental Realism." In 2007 Adi Da's works were included in an exhibition collateral to the [[Venice Biennale]] in Italy curated by Italian art historian [[Achille Bonito Oliva]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huma3.com/huma3-eng-reviews-id-202.html |title=Venice Biennale Collateral Exhibition: Adi Da Samraj |date= July 11, 2007|work= www.huma3.com|accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Biennale di Venezia: 52.

==Reception==

===Critique===

====Ken Wilber====
From 1980 to 1990, philosophical theorist and author [[Ken Wilber]] wrote a number of enthusiastic endorsements and forewords for Adi Da's books, including ''The Dawn Horse Testament'', ''The Divine Emergence of the World-Teacher'', and ''Scientific Proof of the Existence of God Will Soon Be Announced by the White House!''&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken (1985) [http://www.adidawilber.com/dawn_horse_testament_review/index.html Review of Adi Da's The Dawn Horse Testament] – www.adidawilber.com&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber also recommended Adi Da as a spiritual teacher to those interested in his own writings.

Later, Wilber alternated between praise and pointed criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ The Case of Adi Da] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213072728/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida.cfm/ |date=2008-02-13 }} ''Ken Wilber Online''. October 11, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wilber, Ken (1997) [http://www.adidawilber.com/letter_to_adidam_community/index.html "Private" letter to the Adidam community] – www.adidawilber.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida_update.cfm/ |title=Ken Wilber Online: An Update on the Case of Adi Da |publisher=Wilber.shambhala.com |date=1998-08-28 |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327071307/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida_update.cfm |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last public statement concerning Adi Da he wrote: "I affirm all of the extremes of my statements about Da: he is one of the greatest spiritual Realizers of all time, in my opinion, and yet other aspects of his personality lag far behind those extraordinary heights. By all means look to him for utterly profound revelations, unequaled in many ways; yet step into his community at your own risk."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida_update.cfm/ An Update on the Case of Adi Da] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327071307/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/misc/adida_update.cfm/ |date=March 27, 2010 }} ''Ken Wilber Online''. August 28, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
In 1982, yoga and religion scholar [[Georg Feuerstein]] formally became a follower of Adi Da, and wrote a number of introductions to Adi Da books. He later renounced this affiliation, becoming publicly critical of Adi Da and the community surrounding him in Fiji. Feuerstein devoted a chapter to Adi Da in his 1991 book ''Holy Madness: Spirituality, Crazy-Wise Teachers, and Enlightenment''.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, "Holy Madness," Arkana, 1992, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to the 2006 edition, Feuerstein describes having edited the sections devoted to Adi Da to reflect these changes in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein (2006), intro., chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian religions scholar Scott Lowe was an early follower of Adi Da and lived in the community in 1974. In an essay later analyzing what he had witnessed as well as Adi Da's subsequent career, he perceives a pattern of "abusive, manipulative, and self-centered" behavior, saying "does it necessarily follow that the individual who is 'liberated' is free to indulge in what appear to be egocentric, hurtful, and damaging actions in the name of spiritual freedom? I personally think not, while acknowledging the subtlety and complexity of the ongoing debate".&lt;ref&gt;"Lowe, Scott and Lane, David. (1996) ''DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones''. Mt. San Antonio College Philosophy Group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lightgate.net/daism/texts/TheStrangeCase.html |title=The Strange Case Of Franklin Jones |publisher=Lightgate.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108082323/http://www.lightgate.net/daism/texts/TheStrangeCase.html |archivedate=2010-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowe and others have also criticized Adi Da's claims toward the exclusivity of his realization. In part, critics point to his earlier message strongly rejecting the necessity for any religious authority or belief, due to "enlightenment" being every individual's natural condition.&lt;ref name="Ken Wilber Online 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher..."Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America," Vol IV, pp.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Scott and Lane, David. (1996) "DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones". Mt. San Antonio College Philosophy Group, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Da heavily edited subsequent editions of his books, for which they have been criticized as auto-[[hagiography]] and self-mythology.&lt;ref name="autogenerated106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, (1992) pp.83, 96 "the original published version has the ring of authenticity and can be appreciated as a remarkable mystical document...Later [editions], regrettably, tend toward mythologization..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Da: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones", by Scott Lowe and David Lane, Walnut CA: Mt. San Antonio College, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Southern California]] religion professor Robert Ellwood wrote, "Accounts of life with [Adi Da] in his close-knit spiritual community [describe] extremes of [[asceticism]] and indulgence, of [[authoritarianism]] and [[antinomian]]ism...Supporters of the alleged avatar rationalize such eccentricities as shock therapy for the sake of enlightenment."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, Robert. (1997)"Nova Religio" book review of "DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones", October 1997, Vol. 1, No. 1, Pages 153–153&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endorsements===
In a foreword to the 2004 edition of Adi Da's autobiography ''The Knee Of Listening'', religious scholar [[Jeffrey Kripal]] described Adi Da's total corpus as being "the most doctrinally thorough, the most philosophically sophisticated, the most culturally challenging, and the most creatively original literature currently available in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samraj|first= Adi Da|year = 2004| chapter = Foreword|title = The Knee Of Listening|page = xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kneeoflistening.com/f2-beyond-ego.html |title=Foreword (2) – Beyond Social Ego |publisher=Kneeoflistening.com |date=2003-11-02 |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713161940/http://www.kneeoflistening.com/f2-beyond-ego.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physician and homeopath [[Gabriel Cousens]] wrote an endorsement for Adi Da's biography ''The Promised God-Man Is Here'', saying, "it has deepened my experience of Him as the Divine Gift established in the cosmic domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = The Ruchira Sannyasin Order of Adidam Ruchiradam |title=Adi Da: The Promised God-Man Is Here |isbn = 1-57097-143-9 |publisher=Dawn Horse Press |date= March 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentions Adi Da in his books ''Spiritual Nutrition'' and ''Tachyon Energy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cousens|first= Gabriel|title=Spiritual Nutrition: Six Foundations for Spiritual Life and the Awakening of Kundalini|publisher= North Atlantic Books|year = 2005|isbn= 978-1-55643-499-0| page = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cousens| first = Gabriel|title= Tachyon Energy: A New Paradigm in Holistic Healing|publisher= North Atlantic Books|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-55643-310-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Elizabeth Kübler-Ross]] wrote an endorsement for Adi Da's book ''Easy Death'', referring to it as a "masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Easy Death: Spiritual Wisdom on the Ultimate |publisher=Dawn Horse Press|isbn = 1-57097-202-8|date = August 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''African Jazz Mokili Mobimba''''' (often referred to as '''''Africa Mokili Mobimba''''' or '''''Afrika Mokili Mobimba''''') was a popular song written in the [[Congolese rumba]] style by [[Mwamba Mongala]] and performed by [[Joseph Kabasele]]'s band, [[Le Grand Kallé et l'African Jazz|African Jazz]].

== History ==
[[File:African Jazz in 1961.jpg|thumb|African Jazz in a recording studio in 1961]]
Beginning in June 1961, the popular Congolese band [[Le Grand Kallé et l'African Jazz|African Jazz]] —led by [[Joseph Kabasele]]— made a series of recordings in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. One of their new songs was "''African Jazz Mokili Mobimba''" (meaning "African Jazz all over the world"), written by guitarist [[Mwamba Mongala|Mwamba "Déchaud" Mongala]]&lt;ref name= stewart97&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Congolese rumba]] style.&lt;ref name= Christgau193/&gt; It was released later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/76817| title = Joseph Kabasele Tshiamala, le héros national congolais de la musique| date = 4 July 2011| website = Digital Congo| access-date = 27 March 2017| language = French| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170328195350/https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/76817| archive-date = 2017-03-28| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[pastiche]] of two Latin American songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bemba|1984|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics caution against excessive travel abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ACCSA|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also references all of the performing musicians as well as several Congolese cities and African countries (a common way of expressing praise at the time). At just over five minutes in length, it was one of the first African recordings to make use of the larger [[Single (music)#7-inch format|45 rpm record]]s then only recently available in the continent.&lt;ref name= stewart97/&gt;

''African Jazz Mokili Mobimba'' went on to become a hit of the early 1960s.&lt;ref name= woodard64/&gt; It became particularly popular in Kenyan dance clubs in 1965.&lt;ref name= aai44&gt;{{harvnb|African-American Institute|1975|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be one of African Jazz's most memorable songs, though by the early 2000s it was commonly referred to as simply "''Africa Mokili Mobimba''".&lt;ref name= stewart97/&gt;

== Cover versions ==
In 1994 the song was covered by ex-[[OK Jazz]] musician [[Sam Mangwana]] and the [[Fania All-Stars]] for the former's album, entitled ''Rumba Music''.&lt;ref name= Christgau193&gt;{{harvnb|Christgau|2000|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Jazz vocalist [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]] later recorded "African Jazz Mokili Mobimba" as a solo artist to be the leading track on his 1996 live album ''Africa Worldwide''.&lt;ref name= woodard64&gt;{{harvnb|Woodard|1996|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= stewart390&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|2003|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-OK Jazz guitarist [[Papa Noel Nedule]] frequently featured Mangwana and Rochereau in his covers of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|C.

Four '''cardinal virtues ''' were recognized in [[classical antiquity]] and in traditional [[Christian theology]]:
*[[Prudence]] ({{lang|grc|φρόνησις}}, ''phronēsis''; {{lang-la|prudentia}}; also [[Wisdom]], ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'', ''sapientia''), the to ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a given situation at the appropriate time.
*[[Courage]] ({{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}}, ''andreia''; {{lang-la|fortitudo}}): also termed fortitude, forbearance, strength, endurance, and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation
*[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] ({{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}}, ''sōphrosynē''; {{lang-la|temperantia}}): also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, discretion, and moderation tempering the [[appetition]]. ''Sōphrosynē'' can also be translated as sound-mindedness. 
*[[Justice (virtue)|Justice]] ({{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}}, ''dikaiosynē''; {{lang-la|iustitia}}): also considered as fairness, the most extensive and most important virtue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm|title=Cardinal Virtues of Plato, Augustine and Confucius|work=theplatonist.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074259/http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek word also having the meaning righteousness
These [[virtue]]s derive initially from [[Plato]]'s scheme, discussed in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Book IV, 426–435  (and see ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 330b, which also includes [[piety]] (''hosiotes'')). [[Cicero]] expanded on them, and [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' II(I).61&lt;/ref&gt; adapted them while adding a set of [[theological virtues]].

The term ''cardinal'' comes from the Latin {{lang|la|cardo}} (hinge);&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|cardinal}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. They also relate to the [[Quadrivium]].

==In classical antiquity==

The four cardinal virtues appear as a group (sometimes included in larger lists) long before they are later given this title.

Plato identified the four cardinal virtues with the classes of the city described in  ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', and with the faculties of man. Plato narrates a discussion of the character of a good city where the following is agreed upon.  “Clearly, then, it will be wise, brave, temperate [literally: healthy-minded], and just.”  (427e; see also 435b) '''[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]''' was common to all classes, but primarily associated with the producing classes, the farmers and craftsmen, and with the animal appetites, to whom no special virtue was assigned; '''[[courage|fortitude]]''' was assigned to the warrior class and to the spirited element in man; '''[[prudence]]''' to the rulers and to reason.  '''[[Justice]]''' stands outside the class system and divisions of man, and rules the proper relationship among the three of them.

Plato sometimes (e.g., ''[[Protagoras_(dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 349b; cf. 324e, 329c, 330b, 331a-c) lists [[wikt:Special:Search/holiness|holiness]] (''hosiotes'', ''eusebeia'', ''aidos'') amongst the cardinal virtues. He especially associates holiness with justice, but leaves their precise relationship unexplained.

In Aristotle's ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' we read: “The forms of Virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, wisdom.”  (''Rhetoric'' 1366b1)

The Roman philosopher and statesman [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC), like Plato, limits the list to four virtues: {{quote|“Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind (''animi'') in harmony with reason and the order of nature.  It has four parts: wisdom (''prudentiam''), justice, courage, temperance.” (''De Inventione'', II, LIII) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/inventione2.shtml#159|title=Cicero: de Inventione II|work=thelatinlibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cicero discusses these further in ''[[De Officiis]]'' (I, V and following).

The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] discusses these in Book V:12 of ''[[Meditations]]'' and views them as the "goods" that a person should identify in one's own mind, as opposed to "wealth or things which conduce to luxury or prestige."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Aurelius|title=Meditations|date=1976|publisher=Penguin Classics trans. by Maxwell Staniforth|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinal virtues are listed in the Bible.  The deuterocanonical book [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]] 8:7 reads, "She [Wisdom] teaches temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life."

They are also found in the Biblical [[apocrypha]]. [[4 Maccabees]] 1:18–19 relates: “Now the kinds of wisdom are right judgment, justice, courage, and self-control.  Right judgment is supreme over all of these since by means of it reason rules over the emotions.”

[[Catholic moral theology|Catholic moral philosophy]] drew from all of these sources when developing its thought on the virtues.

==In Christian tradition==
{{Thomism}}
[[Ambrose]] (AD&amp;nbsp;330s–397) was the first to use the expression “cardinal virtues.”  “And we know that there are four cardinal virtues temperance, justice, prudence, fortitude.”   (''Commentary on Luke'', V, 62)

[[Augustine of Hippo]], discussing the morals of the church, described them:
{{quote|For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it. (''De moribus eccl.,'' Chap. xv)}}

The "cardinal" virtues are not the same as the [[Theological virtues|three theological virtues]]: Faith, Hope and Charity ([[Agape|Love]]), named in [[1 Corinthians 13]]. 
''And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.''
Because of this reference, a group of seven attributes is sometimes listed by adding the four cardinal virtues (prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice) and three theological virtues (faith, hope, charity).
Together, they comprise what is known as the [[seven virtues]].  While the first four date back to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers and were applicable to all people seeking to live moral lives, the ''theological virtues'' appear to be specific to [[Christian]]s as written by Paul in [[The New Testament]].

Efforts to relate the cardinal and theological virtues differ. Augustine sees faith as coming under justice.  Beginning with a wry comment about the moral mischief of pagan deities, he writes:
{{quote|They [the pagans] have made Virtue also a goddess, which, indeed, if it could be a goddess, had been preferable to many.  And now, because it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, let it be obtained by prayer from Him, by whom alone it can be given, and the whole crowd of false gods vanishes.  For as much as they have thought proper to distribute virtue into four divisions – prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance – and as each of these divisions has its own virtues, faith is among the parts of justice, and has the chief place with as many of us as know what that saying means, ‘The just shall live by faith.’ ([[City of God (book)|''City of God'']], IV, 20)}}

Later, in the High Middle Ages, some authors opposed the seven virtues (cardinal plus theological) to the seven capital sins.  However, “treatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Bejczy |first1= István P. |title= The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century |date=2011|publisher= Brill |location=Boston|pages=228, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And there are problems with this parallelism.
{{quote|The opposition between the virtues and the vices to which these works allude despite the frequent inclusion of other schemes may seem unproblematic at first sight.  The virtues and the vices seem to mirror each other as positive and negative moral attitudes, so that medieval authors, with their keen predilection for parallels and oppositions, could conveniently set them against each other. . . . Yet artistic representations such as Conrad’s trees are misleading in that they establish oppositions between the principal virtues and the capital vices which are based on mere juxtaposition.  As to content, the two schemes do not match each other.  The capital vices of lust and avarice, for instance, contrast with the remedial virtues of chastity and generosity, respectively, rather than with any theological or cardinal virtue; conversely, the virtues of hope and prudence are opposed to despair and foolishness rather than to any deadly sin.  Medieval moral authors were well aware of the fact.  Actually, the capital vices are more often contrasted with the remedial or contrary virtues in medieval moral literature than with the principal virtues, while the principal virtues are frequently accompanied by a set of mirroring vices rather than by the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;Bejczy, 2011, pp. 232-33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary Thought==
Jesuit scholars Daniel Harrington and James Keenan in their ''Paul and Virtue Ethics'' (2010) argue for seven "new virtues" to replace the classical cardinal virtues in complementing the three theological virtues, listed as "be humble, be hospitable, be merciful, be faithful, reconcile, be vigilant, and be reliable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=Daniel|last2=Keenan|first2=James|title=Paul and Virtue Ethics|date=2010|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|pages=125–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they don't explain why it has to be an either/or matter of replacing the cardinal virtues rather than supplementing them.

==Allegory==

[[File:Vertus cardinales par Germain Pilon (Louvre).jpg|thumbnail|Four cardinal virtues; Louvre, Paris. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]

The Cardinal Virtues are often depicted as female [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical figures]] and were a popular subject for funerary sculpture. The attributes and names of these figures may vary according to local tradition.

In many churches and artwork the Cardinal Virtues are depicted with symbolic items:

* '''Justice''' – sword, balance and scales, and a crown
* '''Temperance''' – wheel, bridle and reins, vegetables and fish, cup, water and wine in two jugs
* '''Fortitude''' – armor, club, with a lion, palm, tower, yoke, broken column
* '''Prudence''' – book, scroll, mirror (occasionally attacked by a serpent)

Notable depictions include sculptures on the [[tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany]] and the tomb of [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]]. They were also depicted in the garden at [[Edzell Castle]].

A humorous depiction of the four cardinal virtues appears in the children's book "Masterpiece" written by [[Elise Broach]] and illustrated by [[Kelly Murphy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5642">The tract '''''Defensor pacis''''' ('''''The Defender of Peace''''') laid the foundations of modern doctrines of [[sovereignty]]. It was written by [[Marsilius of Padua]] (Italian: '''Marsilio da Padova'''), an Italian medieval scholar. It appeared in 1324 and provoked a storm of [[controversy]] that lasted through the century. The context of the work lies in the political struggle between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Pope John XXII]]. The treatise is vehemently [[anticlerical]]. Marsilius' work was censured by [[Pope Benedict XII]] and [[Pope Clement VI]].

''Defensor pacis'' extends the tradition of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[De Monarchia]]'' separating the secular [[Sovereign state|State]] from religious authority. It affirmed the sovereignty of the people and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and sought to greatly limit the power of the [[Papacy]], which he viewed as the "cause of the trouble which prevails among men" and which he characterized as a "fictitious" power. He proposed the seizure of church property by civil authority and the elimination of [[tithe]]s.  In his view, the Papacy would retain only an honorary pre-eminence without any authority to interpret the [[Biblical canon|scriptures]] or define [[dogma]].

As its name implies, it describes the State as the defender of the public peace, which is the most indispensable benefit of human society. The author of the law expresses will of the people, not of the whole populace, but of the most important part (''valentior'') of the citizens; these people should themselves elect, or at least appoint, the head of the government, who, lest he should be tempted to put himself above the scope of the laws, should have at his disposal only a limited armed force. This chief is responsible to the people for his breaches of the law, and in serious cases they can sentence him to death. The real cause of the trouble which prevails among men is the Papacy, the development of which is the result of a series of usurpations.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Marsilius of Padua |volume=17 |pages=775–776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsilius denies, not only to the pope, but to the [[episcopacy|bishops]] and [[clergy]], any [[coercion|coercive]] jurisdiction or any right to pronounce in temporal matters. He also denies episcopal authority of [[excommunication]]s and [[interdict]]s, or other imposed interpretations of divine law. He is not opposed to penalties against [[heresy|heretics]], but he would have them pronounced only by civil tribunals. Desiring to see the clergy practice a holy poverty, he proposes the suppression of [[tithes]] and the seizure by the secular power of the greater part of the property of the church. The clergy, thus deprived of its wealth, privileges and jurisdiction, is further to be deprived of independence, for the civil power is to have the right of appointing to benefices, etc.  The supreme authority in the church is to be the council, but a [[ecumenical council|council]] summoned by the emperor.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The pope, no longer possessing any more power than other bishops (though Marsilius recognizes that the supremacy of the [[See of Rome]] goes back to the earliest times of Christianity), is to content himself with a pre-eminence mainly of an honorary kind, without claiming to interpret the [[Holy Scriptures]], define dogmas or distribute benefices; moreover, he is to be elected by the Christian people, or by the delegates of the people, i.e. the princes, or by the council, and these are also to have the power to punish, suspend or depose him. The theory was purely [[democracy|democratic]], but was all ready to be transformed, by means of a series of fictions and implications, into an imperialist doctrine; and in like manner it contained a visionary plan of reformation which ended, not in the separation of the church from the state, but in the subjection of the church to the state.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1535, [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] paid [[William Marshall (translator)|William Marshall]] to translate ''Defensor'' into English in order to give intellectual support towards the implementation of [[Acts of Supremacy|Royal Supremacy]].

{{Translation sidebar}}

'''Dynamic equivalence''' and '''formal equivalence''', terms coined by [[Eugene Nida]], are two dissimilar [[translation]] approaches, achieving differing level of literalness between the source text and the target text, as employed in biblical translation. 

The two have been understood basically, with the one as [[sense-for-sense translation]] (translating the meanings of phrases or whole sentences) with [[readability]] in mind, and with the other as [[word-for-word translation]] (translating the meanings of words and phrases in a more literal way) keeping literal fidelity.

== Approaches to translation ==
''Formal equivalence approach'' tends to emphasize fidelity to the lexical details and grammatical structure of the original language, whereas dynamic equivalence tends to employ a more natural rendering but with less literal accuracy.

According to [[Eugene Nida]], ''dynamic equivalence'', the term as he originally coined, is the "quality of a translation in which the message of the original text has been so transported into the receptor language that the ''response'' of the ''receptor'' is essentially like that of the original receptors."&lt;ref&gt;Nida, Eugene A., and Charles R. Taber. (1969). ''The Theory and Practice of Translation, With Special Reference to Bible Translating'', 200. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire is that the reader of both languages would understand the meanings of the text in a similar fashion.

In later years, Nida distanced himself from the term "dynamic equivalence" and preferred the term ''''functional equivalence''''.&lt;ref&gt;Let the words be written: the lasting influence of Eugene A. Nida p. 51 Philip C. Stine{{spaced ndash}}2004 "That probably would not have happened if it hadn't been for Nida's ideas" (Charles Taber, interview with author, 21 Oct. 2000).7 Nida later felt that the term "dynamic equivalence" had been misunderstood and was partly responsible for&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation and religion: holy untranslatable? p91 Lynne Long{{spaced ndash}}2005 "In order to avoid certain misunderstandings, de Waard and Nida (1986: 7, 36) later replaced the term 'dynamic equivalence' with 'functional equivalence', but they stated clearly that 'The substitution of "functional equivalence{{"'}} is not..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of the Reina-Valera 1960 Spanish Bible p98 Calvin George{{spaced ndash}}2004 "190 For this reason in his later writings he distanced himself from the term 'dynamic equivalence,' preferring instead 'functional equivalence.' 191 The idea is to produce the closest natural equivalent in the target or 188 190 Nida, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; What the term "functional equivalence" suggests is not just that the equivalence is  between the function of the source text in the source culture and the function of the [[target text]] (translation) in the target culture, but that "function" can be thought of as a property of the text. It is possible to associate functional equivalence with ''how people interact in cultures''.

== Theory and practice ==
Because ''functional equivalence'' approach eschews strict adherence to the grammatical structure of the original text in favor of a more natural rendering in the target language, it is sometimes used when the readability of the translation is more important than the preservation of the original grammatical structure.

''Formal equivalence'' is often more goal than reality, if only because one language may contain a word for a concept which has no direct equivalent in another language. In such cases, a more dynamic translation may be used or a [[neologism]] may be created in the target language to represent the concept (sometimes by borrowing a word from the source language).

The more the source language differs from the target language, the more difficult it may be to understand a literal translation without modifying or rearranging the words in the target language. On the other hand, formal equivalence can allow readers familiar with the source language to analyze how meaning was expressed in the original text, preserving untranslated [[idiom]]s, [[rhetoric]]al devices (such as [[chiastic structure]]s in the [[Hebrew Bible]]) and [[diction]] in order to preserve original information and highlight finer shades of meaning.

== Bible translation ==
Translators of the Bible have taken various approaches in rendering it into English, ranging from an extreme use of formal equivalence, to extreme use of dynamic equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Data collected from two sources that have nearly identical ranking with an overlapping (supplemental) list of translations studied: 1. [http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj1d.pdf Thomas, Robert L., ''Bible Translations: The Link Between Exegesis and Expository Preaching'', pages 63ff]; and 2.

The '''''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment''' ('''LTEE''') is an ongoing study in [[experimental evolution]] led by [[Richard Lenski]] that has been tracking genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of asexual ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacteria since 24 February 1988.&lt;ref name="Source"&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard E. |last=Lenski |url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/strainsource.html |title=Source of founding strain |publisher=Michigan State University |work=Richard E.

Lenski (@RELenski) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski performed the 10,000th transfer of the experiment on March 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/some-wrinkles-in-time/|title=Some Wrinkles in Time|date=2017-03-13|website=Telliamed Revisited|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the experiment, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the evolving populations. These have included changes that have occurred in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in ''E. coli'', in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blount2012 /&gt;

==Experimental approach==
The long-term evolution experiment was designed as an open-ended means of empirical examination of central features of [[evolution]].  The experiment was begun with three principal goals:
# To examine the dynamics of evolution, including the rate of evolutionary change.

As the experiment has continued, its scope has grown as new questions in evolutionary biology have arisen that it can be used to address, as the populations' evolution has presented new phenomena to study, and as technology and methodological techniques have advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Jeremy W.|last2=Lenski|first2=Richard E.|date=2015-06-23|title=From Here to Eternity—The Theory and Practice of a Really Long Experiment|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=13|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002185|issn=1544-9173|pmc=4477892|pmid=26102073|pages=e1002185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''E. coli'' as the experimental organism has allowed many generations and large populations to be studied in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, due to the long use of ''E .coli'' as a principle model organism in [[molecular biology]], a wide array of tools, protocols, and procedures were available for studying changes at the genetic, phenotypic, and physiological levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=Zachary D|title=The unexhausted potential of E. coli|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.05826|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4373459|pmid=25807083}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria can also be frozen and preserved while remaining viable. This has permitted the creation of what Lenski describes as a "frozen fossil record" of samples of evolving populations that can be revived at any time. This frozen fossil record allows populations to be restarted in cases of contamination or other disruption in the experiment, and permits the isolation and comparison of living exemplars of ancestral and evolved clones. Lenski chose an ''E. coli'' strain that reproduces only [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], lacks any [[plasmid]]s that could permit [[bacterial conjugation]], and has no viable [[prophage]]. As a consequence, evolution in the experiment occurs only by the core evolutionary processes of [[mutation]], [[genetic drift]], and [[natural selection]]. This strict asexuality also means that [[genetic marker]]s persist in lineages and clades by [[common descent]], but cannot otherwise spread in the populations.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004"/&gt;

Lenski chose to carry out the experiment with the bacteria grown in a glucose-limited minimal medium called DM25,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dm25liquid.html|title=DM25 Liquid Medium|website=myxo.css.msu.edu|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was initially developed by [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]] for use in isolating [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophic]] mutants of ''E. coli'' using [[penicillin]] as a selective agent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=George|last2=Williams|first2=Luther S.|date=1975-04-01|title=Modified Penicillin Enrichment Procedure for the Selection of Bacterial Mutants|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=122|issue=1|pages=345–346|issn=0021-9193|pmc=235679|pmid=1091629}}&lt;/ref&gt; DM25 is supplemented with a low concentration of glucose.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lenski chose this concentration to simplify analysis of the populations' evolution by reducing [[clonal interference]], in which multiple versions of [[allele]]s are competing in an evolving population, while also reducing the possibility of the evolution of ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004" /&gt;  This concentration of glucose used supports a maximum population of 500 million cells of the ancestor in a 10 mL culture, though the maximum now varies among the evolved populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  DM25 also contains a large amount of citrate (about 11 times the concentration of glucose), which was originally included by Davis because it improved the killing efficiency of [[penicillin]] during his experiments, though it is now known to aid in ''E. coli'''s acquisition of iron from the medium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagegg|first=W.|last2=Braun|first2=V.|date=1981-01-01|title=Ferric citrate transport in Escherichia coli requires outer membrane receptor protein fecA|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=145|issue=1|pages=156–163|issn=0021-9193|pmc=217256|pmid=7007312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
The 12 populations are maintained in a {{Convert|37|C}} incubator in Lenski's laboratory at [[Michigan State University]]. Each day, 1% of each population is transferred to a flask of fresh DM25 growth medium. The dilution means that each population experiences 6.64 generations, or doublings, each day.  Large, representative samples of each population are frozen with glycerol as a [[cryoprotectant]] at 500-generation (75-day) intervals. The bacteria in these samples remain viable, and can be revived at any time.  This collection of samples is referred to as the "frozen fossil record", and provides a history of the evolution of each population through the entire experiment.  The populations are also regularly screened for changes in [[mean fitness]], and supplemental experiments are regularly performed to study interesting developments in the populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard E. |last=Lenski |url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/overview.html |title=Overview of the ''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment |publisher=Michigan State University |work=Richard E.

===Founding strain===
The strain of ''E. coli'' Lenski chose to use in the long-term evolution experiment was derived from "strain Bc251", as described in a 1966 paper by Seymour Lederberg, via Bruce Levin, who had used it in a bacterial ecology experiment in 1972. The defining genetics traits of this strain were: T6&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, Str&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, r&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (unable to grow on [[arabinose]]).&lt;ref name="Source" /&gt; Lenski designated the original founding strain as REL606. Before the beginning of the experiment, Lenski isolated an Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variant  of the strain in which a [[point mutation]] in the ''ara'' [[operon]] had restored growth on arabinose, which he designated as strain REL607. When beginning the long-term evolution experiment, Lenski founded six populations with six individual Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; colonies of REL606. These populations are referred to as Ara-1 through Ara-6. Lenski also founded six more populations from six individual Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colonies of REL607. These are referred to as populations Ara+1 through Ara+6. The marker differences permit strains to be differentiated on Tetrazolium Arabinose plates, on which Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; colonies appear red, while Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colonies appear white to pink. Over the course of the experiment, each population has accumulated a large number of distinct mutations, which permit further means of identifying strains by their population of origin.

===Changes in fitness===

Much analysis of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004" /&gt; This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a [[power law]] model much better than the hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ribeck|first2=Noah|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|date=13 December 2013|title=Long-Term Dynamics of Adaptation in Asexual Populations|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1364|journal=Science|volume=342|issue=6164|pages=1364–1367|bibcode=2013Sci...342.1364W|doi=10.1126/science.1243357|first1=Michael J.|last1=Wiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment.&lt;ref name="Discover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/12/16/the-search-for-the-perfect-organism/#.VnOqbPGqdhP |title=Could Evolution Ever Yield a ‘Perfect’ Organism? |website=Discover Magazine |last1=Scharping |first1=Nathaniel |accessdate=18 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6drV64ro4?url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/12/16/the-search-for-the-perfect-organism/ |archivedate=18 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1821/20152292 |title=Sustained fitness gains and variability in fitness trajectories in the long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli |website=Proceedings B |publisher=The Royal Society |display-authors=etal |last1=Lenski |first1=Richard E |accessdate=18 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6drVZddgG?url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1821/20152292 |archivedate=18 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of increased cell size in all twelve populations===
[[Image:Lenski10.png|left|thumb|right|Growth in cell size of bacteria in the Lenski experiment]]
All twelve of the experimental populations show an increase in cell size concurrent with a decline in maximum population density, and in many of the populations, a more rounded cell shape.&lt;ref name="Philippe"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Pelosi|first2=Ludovic|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|last4=Schneider|first4=Dominique|year=2008|title=Evolution of Penicillin-Binding Protein 2 Concentration and Cell Shape during a Long-Term Experiment with ''Escherichia coli''|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=191|issue=3|pages=909–21|doi=10.1128/JB.01419-08|pmc=2632098|pmid=19047356|last1=Philippe|first1=Nadège}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the [[gene expression|expression]] of a gene for a [[penicillin-binding protein]], which allowed the mutant bacteria to outcompete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to [[osmotic stress]] and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures.&lt;ref name="Philippe" /&gt;

===Ecological specialization===
Over the course of the experiment, the populations have evolved to specialize on the glucose resource on which they grow. This was first described in 2000, when Cooper and Lenski demonstrated that all populations had experienced decay of unused metabolic functions after 20,000 generations, restricting the range of substances on which the bacteria could grow. Their analysis suggested that this decay was due to [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|antagonistic pleiotropy]], in which mutations that improved ability to grow on glucose had reduced or eliminated the ability to grow on others substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=V. S.|last2=Lenski|first2=R.

Moreover, they concluded that the metabolic losses were not due to antagonistic pleiotropy, but the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused portions of the genome, suggesting that adaptation to a simple environment might not necessarily lead to specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leiby|first=Nicholas|last2=Marx|first2=Christopher J.|date=2014-02-01|title=Metabolic erosion primarily through mutation accumulation, and not tradeoffs, drives limited evolution of substrate specificity in Escherichia coli|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=e1001789|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001789|issn=1545-7885|pmc=3928024|pmid=24558347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of aerobic citrate usage in one population===
====Background====
[[Image:Lenski's long-term lines of E. coli on 25 June 2008, close-up of citrate mutant.jpg|thumb|The population designated Ara-3 (center) is more [[turbid]] because that population evolved to use the [[citrate]] present in the growth medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/on-the-evolution-of-citrate-use/|title=On the Evolution of Citrate Use|date=2016-02-20|website=Telliamed Revisited|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''E. coli'' is normally unable to grow [[Aerobic respiration|aerobically]] on [[Citric acid|citrate]] due to the inability to express a citrate transporter when oxygen is present.&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lbc.msu.edu/evo-ed/pages/Ecoli/cellbio.html|title=Cell Biology: The Use of Citrate|website=EVO-ED|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''E. coli'' has a complete [[citric acid cycle]], and therefore metabolizes citrate as an intermediate during aerobic growth on other substances, including glucose. Most ''E. coli'' can grow anaerobically on citrate via [[fermentation]], if a co-substrate such as glucose is available to provide reducing power.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Stokes|first2=J.L.|date=1952|title=Oxidation of citrate by Escherichia coli|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=63|issue=3|pages=415–420|pmc=169284|pmid=14927574|last1=Lara|first1=F.J.S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lütgens|first=M.|last2=Gottschalk|first2=G.|date=1980-07-01|title=Why a co-substrate is required for anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli on citrate|journal=Journal of General Microbiology|volume=119|issue=1|pages=63–70|doi=10.1099/00221287-119-1-63|issn=0022-1287|pmid=6997437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] growth is possible due to the expression of a transmembrane citrate-succinate antiporter gene, ''citT'', which was first identified in 1998. This gene is co-regulated with other genes involved in citrate fermentation found on the ''cit'' operon, which is turned on only when oxygen is absent.&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pos|first=Klaas Martinus|last2=Dimroth|first2=Peter|last3=Bott|first3=Michael|date=1998-08-01|title=The Escherichia coli Citrate Carrier CitT: a Member of a  Novel Eubacterial Transporter Family Related to  the 2-Oxoglutarate/Malate Translocator  from Spinach Chloroplasts|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=180|issue=16|pages=4160–4165|issn=0021-9193|pmc=107412|pmid=9696764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inability to grow aerobically on citrate, referred to as a Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype, is considered a defining characteristic of ''E. coli'' as a species, and one that has been a valuable means of differentiating ''E. coli'' from pathogenic ''Salmonella''. While Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; strains of ''E. coli'' have been isolated from environmental and agricultural samples, in every such case, the trait was found to be due to the presence of a plasmid containing a foreign citrate transporter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=C.

====Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolves in the LTEE====
In 2008, Lenski's team, led by [[Zachary Blount|Zachary D. Blount]], reported that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate had evolved in one population. Around generation 33,127, a dramatic increase in turbidity was observed in the population designated Ara-3. They found that the population contained clones that were able to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). This metabolic capacity permitted the population to grow several-fold larger than it had previously, due to the large amount of citrate present in the medium. Examination of frozen fossil samples of the populations showed that Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones could be isolated as early as 31,500 generations. The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants in the population were found to possess a number of genetic markers unique to the Ara-3 population, which excluded the possibility that they were contaminants, rather than spontaneous mutants. In a series of experiments that "replayed" the tape of Ara-3 evolution from Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clones isolated from samples frozen at various time points in the population's history, they demonstrated that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate was more likely to re-evolve in a subset of genetically pure, evolved clones. In these experiments, they observed 19 new, independent instances of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; re-evolution, but only when starting from clones isolated from after generation 20,000. Fluctuation tests showed that clones from this generation and later displayed a rate of mutation to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait was significantly higher than the ancestral rate. Even in these later clones, the rate of mutation to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was on the order of one occurrence per trillion cell divisions.&lt;ref name=pmid18524956 /&gt;

Lenski and his colleagues concluded that the evolution of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; function in this one population arose due to one or more earlier, possibly nonadaptive, "potentiating" mutations that increased the rate of mutation to an accessible level. The data suggested that citrate usage involved at least two mutations subsequent to these "potentiating" mutations. More generally, the authors suggest these results indicate, following the argument of [[Stephen Jay Gould]], "that historical contingency can have a profound and lasting impact" on the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=pmid18524956/&gt; These findings have come to be considered a significant instance of the impact of historical contingency on evolution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=Zachary D.|date=2016-01-16|title=A case study in evolutionary contingency|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.12.007|issn=1879-2499|pmid=26787098|volume=58|pages=82–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desjardins|first=Eric|date=2011-01-01|title=Historicity and Experimental Evolution|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/DESHAE|journal=Biology and Philosophy|volume=26|issue=3|pages=339–364|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9256-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beatty|first=John|last2=Carrera|first2=Isabel|date=2011-01-01|title=When What Had to Happen Was Not Bound to Happen: History, Chance, Narrative, Evolution|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/BEAWWH|journal=Journal of the Philosophy of History|volume=5|issue=3|pages=471–495|doi=10.1163/187226311x599916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genomic analysis of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait and implications for evolutionary innovation====
[[File:Novel rnk-citT module and citT expression - actualization of Cit+ trait in LTEE population Ara-3.svg|thumb|418x418px|The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait was actualized by a duplication mutation that created a new regulatory module by placing a copy of the ''citT'' gene that encodes a citrate-succinate antiporter under the control of a promoter that supports expression under aerobic conditions. This mutation results in the CitT transporter being expressed when oxygen is present, permitting growth on citrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blount-lab.org/photos.html|title=Photos|website=Blount Lab|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2012, Lenski and his team reported the results of a genomic analysis of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait that shed light on the genetic basis and evolutionary history of the trait. The researchers had sequenced the entire genomes of twenty-nine clones isolated from various time points in the Ara-3 population's history. They used these sequences to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the population, which showed that the population had diversified into three [[clades]] by 20,000 generations.  The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants had evolved in one of these, which they called Clade 3. Clones that had been found to be potentiated in earlier research were distributed among all three clades, but were over-represented in Clade 3. This led the researchers to conclude that there had been at least two potentiating mutations involved in Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolution.&lt;ref name="Blount2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blount ZD, Barrick JE, Davidson CJ, Lenski RE |title=Genomic analysis of a key innovation in an experimental ''Escherichia coli'' population |journal=Nature |date=2012-09-27 |volume=489 |issue=7417 |pages=513–518 |doi=10.1038/nature11514 |pmid=22992527 |pmc=3461117|bibcode = 2012Natur.489..513B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that all Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones had mutations in which 2933 base pair segment of DNA was duplicated or amplified. The duplicated segment contained the gene for the citrate transporter protein used in anaerobic growth on citrate, ''citT''. The duplication is tandem, and resulted in copies that were head-to-tail with respect to each other. This new configuration placed a copy of the previously silent, unexpressed ''citT'' under the control of the adjacent ''rnk'' gene's promoter, which directs expression when oxygen is present. This new ''rnk-citT'' module produced a novel regulatory pattern for ''citT'', activating expression of the citrate transporter when oxygen was present, and thereby enabled aerobic growth on citrate.&lt;ref name=Blount2012 /&gt;

Movement of this ''rnk-citT'' module into the genome of a potentiated Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clone was shown to be sufficient to produce a Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. However, the initial Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype conferred by the duplication was very weak, and only granted a ~1% fitness benefit. The researchers found that the number of copies of the ''rnk-citT'' module had to be increased to strengthen the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait sufficiently to permit the bacteria to grow well on the citrate. Further mutations after the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria became dominant in the population continued to accumulate improved growth on citrate.

The researchers concluded that the evolution of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait occurred in three distinct phases in which mutations accumulated that increased the rate of mutation to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the trait itself appeared in a weak form, and, finally, the trait was improved by later mutations. Blount et al. suggested that this pattern might be typical of how novel traits in general evolve, and proposed a three-step model of evolutionary innovation:
# '''Potentiation''': a genetic background evolves in which a trait is mutationally accessible, making the trait's evolution possible.
# '''Actualization''': a mutation occurs that produces the trait, making it manifest, albeit likely in a weak form.
# '''Refinement''': Once the trait exists, if it provides selective benefit, mutations will accumulate that improve the trait, making it effective. This phase is open-ended, and will continue so long as refining mutations arise and the trait remains beneficial.&lt;ref name="Blount2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
This model has seen acceptance in evolutionary biology. In 2015 paleontologist [[Douglas Erwin]] suggested a modification to a four-step model to better reflect a possible distinction between evolutionary novelty and evolutionary innovation, and to highlight the importance of environmental conditions: potentiation, generation of novel phenotypes (actualization), adaptive refinement, and exploitation (conversion of a novelty to an innovation as it becomes important for the ecological establishment of possessing organisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erwin|first=Douglas H.|date=2015-10-05|title=Novelty and Innovation in the History of Life|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=19|pages=R930–940|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.019|issn=1879-0445|pmid=26439356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investigation of potentiation====
In 2014, a research team led by Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] described the application of a new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify potentiating mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quandt|first=Erik M.|last2=Deatherage|first2=Daniel E.|last3=Ellington|first3=Andrew D.|last4=Georgiou|first4=George|last5=Barrick|first5=Jeffrey E.|date=2014-02-11|title=Recursive genomewide recombination and sequencing reveals a key refinement step in the evolution of a metabolic innovation in Escherichia coli|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=6|pages=2217–2222|doi=10.1073/pnas.1314561111|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3926077|pmid=24379390|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.2217Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method used multiple rounds of a process in which [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|F plasmid]] based [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] between a 33,000 generation Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clone, CZB154, and the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait, which they refer to as Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;. They found that the ''rnk-citT'' module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was sufficient to produce a weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that conferred a strong, Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the ''rnk-citT'' module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called ''dctA'', caused a massive increase in the expression of the [[Dcu family|DctA transporter]], which functions to import C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells to re-uptake [[Succinic acid|succinate]], [[Malic acid|malate]], and [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]] released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, ''dcuS'', that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the ''dctA'' mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a genetic background and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit.

Quandt and colleagues later published findings definitively identifying a mutation that did potentiate Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quandt|first=Erik M.|last2=Gollihar|first2=Jimmy|last3=Blount|first3=Zachary D.|last4=Ellington|first4=Andrew D.|last5=Georgiou|first5=George|last6=Barrick|first6=Jeffrey E.|date=2015-01-01|title=Fine-tuning citrate synthase flux potentiates and refines metabolic innovation in the Lenski evolution experiment|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.09696|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4718724|pmid=26465114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mutation was in the ''gltA'' gene, which encodes [[Citrate synthase family|citrate synthase]], an enzyme involved in the flow of carbon into the [[citric acid cycle]]. It had the effect of increasing citrate synthase activity, and they showed that it permitted improved growth on [[acetate]]. Moreover, with the ''gltA'' mutation, the ''rnk-citT'' module that causes the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait has a neutral-to-slightly beneficial fitness effect, while, without it, the module was strongly detrimental. The ''gltA'' mutation therefore seems to have permitted early, weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants to persist in the population until later refining mutations could occur, consistent with their earlier conclusions. After a strong Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype evolved, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. The researchers found that later mutations in ''gltA'' countered the first mutation, reducing citrate synthase activity, and further improving growth on citrate. They concluded that the series of mutation in ''gltA'' first potentiated, and then refined growth on citrate. They also suggested that the lineage in which Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; arose might have occupied a niche in Ara-3 based on growth on acetate, and that the potentiating mutations that led to evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in Ara-3 were originally adaptive for acetate use.

====Investigation of post-Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ecology and persistent diversity====
A small subpopulation of Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells unable to grow on citrate, and belonging to a separate clade persisted in the population after the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells became dominant. Early findings showed that this diversity was partly due to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells being better at growing on the glucose in the medium.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt; Turner et al. later found that another factor behind the coexistence was that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells evolved the ability to cross feed on the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; majority. They showed that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells release [[Succinic acid|succinate]], [[Malic acid|malate]], and [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]] during growth on citrate, as the CitT transporter pumps these substances out of the cell while pumping citrate into the cell. The Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells had rapidly evolved the ability to grow on these substances due to a mutation that restored expression of an appropriate transporter protein that was silent in the ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Turner|first=Caroline B.|last2=Blount|first2=Zachary D.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Daniel H.|last4=Lenski|first4=Richard E.|date=2015-06-17|title=Evolution and coexistence in response to a key innovation in a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli|biorxiv=020958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulation eventually went [[Extinction|extinct]] in the population between 43,500 and 44,000 generations. This extinction was shown to not be due to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; majority evolving to be able to [[Invasive species|invade]] the niche occupied by the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; minority. Indeed, Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clones could invade Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations from after the extinction event. Moreover, in an experiment in which they restarted twenty replicates of the Ara-3 population from the sample frozen 500 generations before the extinction, Turner et al. found that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulation had not gone extinct in any of the replicates after 500 generations of evolution. One of these replicates was continued for 2,500 generations, over which Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; continued to coexist. The researchers concluded that the extinction of Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; had been due to some unknown "rare environmental perturbation", similar to that which can impact natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extinction-lab-bottle-was-fluke-experiment-finds|title=Extinction in lab bottle was a fluke, experiment finds|last=Saey|first=Tina Hesman|website=Science News|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final replicate was integrated into the main LTEE experiment, becoming the thirteenth population, Ara-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Caroline B.|last2=Blount|first2=Zachary D.|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|date=2015-11-18|title=Replaying Evolution to Test the Cause of Extinction of One Ecotype in an Experimentally Evolved Population|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142050|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0142050|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0142050|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651540|pmid=26581098|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1042050T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of citrate-usage findings====
Other researchers have experimented on evolving aerobic citrate-utilizing ''E. coli''. Dustin Van Hofwegen et al., working in the lab of [[Scott Minnich]], were able to isolate 46 independent citrate-utilizing mutants of ''E. coli'' in just 12 to 100 generations using highly prolonged selection under starvation, during which the bacteria would sample more mutations more rapidly.&lt;ref name="Rapid Evolution Van Hofwegen"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hovde|first2=Carolyn J.|last3=Minnich|first3=Scott A.|last4=Silhavy|first4=T. J.|date=1 April 2016|title=Rapid Evolution of Citrate Utilization by Escherichia coli by Direct Selection Requires citT and dctA|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=198|issue=7|pages=1022–1034|doi=10.1128/JB.00831-15|last1=Van Hofwegen|first1=Dustin J.|pmid=26833416|pmc=4800869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, the genomic DNA sequencing revealed an amplification of the ''citT'' and ''dctA'' loci, and rearrangement of DNA were the same class of mutations identified in the experiment by Richard Lenski and his team. They concluded that the rarity of the citrate-utilizing mutant in Lenski's research was likely a result of the selective experimental conditions used by his team rather than being a unique evolutionary speciation event.&lt;ref name="Rapid Evolution Van Hofwegen" /&gt;

John Roth and Sophie Maisnier-Patin reviewed the approaches in both the Lenski team's delayed mutations and the Van Hofweges team's rapid mutations on ''E. coli''. They argue that both teams experienced the same sequence of potentiation, actualization, and refinement leading up to similar Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Maisnier-Patin|first2=Sophie|last3=Silhavy|first3=T. J.|date=1 April 2016|title=Reinterpreting Long-Term Evolution Experiments: Is Delayed Adaptation an Example of Historical Contingency or a Consequence of Intermittent Selection?|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=198|issue=7|pages=1009–1012|doi=10.1128/JB.00110-16|last1=Roth|first1=John R.|pmc=4800865}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, the period of less than a day during which citrate usage would be under selection, followed by 100-fold dilution, and a period of growth on glucose that would not select for citrate use, ultimately lowered the probability of ''E. coli'' being able accumulate early adaptive mutations from one period of selection to the next.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting" /&gt; On the other hand, Van Hofwegen's team allowed for a continuous selection period of 7 days, which yielded a more rapid development of citrate-using ''E. coli''. Roth and Maisnier-Patin suggest that the serial dilution of ''E. coli'' and short period of selection for citrate-use under the conditions of the LTEE perpetually impeded each generation of ''E. coli'' from reaching the next stages of aerobic citrate utilization.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting" /&gt;

In response, Blount and Lenski acknowledge that the problem is not with the experiments or the data, but with the interpretations made by Van Hofwegen et al. and Maisnier-Patin and Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45423/title/Similar-Data--Different-Conclusions/|title=Similar Data, Different Conclusions {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|website=The Scientist|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski notes that the rapid evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was not necessarily unexpected since his team was also able to produce multiple Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mutants in a few weeks during the replay experiments they reported in the 2008 paper in which his team first described the evolution of aerobic citrate use in the LTEE.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/on-the-evolution-of-citrate-use/|title=On the Evolution of Citrate Use|website=Telliamed Revisited|last1=Lenski|first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a "speciation event" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said "that becoming Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was only a first step on the road to possible speciation", and thus did not propose that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; Lenski acknowledges that scientists, including him and his team, often use short hand and jargon when discussing speciation, instead of writing more carefully and precisely on the matter, and this can cause issues.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; However, he notes that speciation is generally considered by evolutionary biologists to be a process, and not an event.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; He also criticizes Van Hofwegen et al. and Roth and Maisnier-Patin for positing "false dichotomies" regarding the complex concept of historical contingency. He argues that historical contingency means that history matters, and that their 2008 paper presented data that showed that the evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the LTEE was contingent upon mutations that had accumulated earlier. He concludes that "...historical contingency was invoked and demonstrated in a specific context, namely that of the emergence of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the LTEE—it does not mean that the emergence of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is historically contingent in other experimental contexts, nor for that matter that other changes in the LTEE are historically contingent—in fact, some other evolved changes in the LTEE have been highly predictable and not (or at least not obviously) contingent on prior mutations in the populations."&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt;

'''Elena Oznobkina''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Ознобкина, Елена Вячеславовна) was a philosopher, theorist, historian of philosophy, lecturer, translator, editor, journalist, researcher of penitentiary systems, and [[Russia]]n human rights activist. She is best known as a researcher of modern Western philosophy, a translator and editor of translations of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] into Russian, a critic of the Russian penitentiary system, and the editor of the Russian edition of [[Index on Censorship]] magazine.

==Life and career==
Born in Moscow [[USSR]], Oznobkina grew up in a family, whose parents were a government official and an agricultural scientist. She received a typical cultured middle-class upbringing. Oznobkina attended [[Moscow State University]] from 1977 to 1982, majoring in the history of Western philosophy. She defended her Specialist Diploma thesis, entitled "The Unity of three Kant's Critiques", in 1982. After graduation, Oznobkina worked as a lecturer/assistant professor at the Moscow Institute of Agricultural Engineers, and did research as a part-time graduate student at the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of USSR.

She defended her Candidate of Science Dissertation (equivalent of PhD. thesis), entitled "Heidegger's Critique of Kant", in 1987, and become a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of USSR in 1988.&lt;ref name=KANT_PROJECT&gt;{{cite book|chapter=IN MEMORIAM: Elena Oznobkina. Immanuel Kant’s anthropological project (compiled and published by A. Zhavoronkov)|url=http://eng.iph.ras.ru/hpy_2010.htm|accessdate=March 30, 2012|title=History of Philosophy, 2010 Yearbook, 2011|date=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked at the Institute of Philosophy since 1988, first, as a researcher, at the section of Postclassic Western Philosophy, and afterwards, as a senior researcher, at the section of the section of Analytical Anthropology until her death, which followed after a long period of incurable disease, which limited her to her apartment in the last years of her life.

As it often happens in Russian philosophy, her thought found its expression not in monographs, but mostly in articles, university courses, interviews, and reviews. Although these are "small forms", they were no less influential, than many books. As well, her editorship legacy is very influential in ideological culture of modern Russia.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Academic activity==
In 1982 Oznobkina started her academic career as Lecturer/Assistant Professor at the Moscow institute of Agricultural Engineers, where she delivered various courses on history of philosophy until 1987, when she became a full-time researcher.
In 1993–2002, she was an invited lecturer at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and at State Academic University for the Humanities. She developed and taught such courses as: "Introduction into Philosophical Anthropology", "Corporeality in Philosophy of Modernity", "Kant's Anthropology: Modern Revision", "Classic and Modern Philosophy of Punishment", and others.&lt;ref name=INDEX&gt;{{cite news|title=Lena Oznobkina's Obituary|url=http://www.index.org.ru/journal/lena_oznobkina_nekrolog.html|accessdate=March 30, 2012|newspaper=Index on Censorship|date=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant's Anthropology ===

In a series of lectures for [[Russian State University for the Humanities]], Oznobkina built an interpretation of Kant, which is in many ways opposite to the classic for modern Russia, [[Merab Mamardashvili]]'s interpretation. She insists that Kant's philosophical experience is very "aggressive", and entails removal of many phenomena from the space of classic European philosophy, due to natural  language limitation. Oznobkina states that comparison of Kant's logic and classic logic allows to discover borders of Kant's "cultural utopia", and causes of incongruency of his philocophical  language.

==Editorship, translation and publishing activities==
In last 15 years, Oznobkina concentrated her research interests on the analytical critique of penitentiary system. She combined it with research on variegated aspects of the Russian and Soviet prison system, and the promotion of human rights of prisoners. She was one of editors of the Russian edition of the [[Index on Censorship]] magazine (from 1997 &lt;ref name="INDEX"/&gt;).

She was also a prominent translator and editor of the modern Russian translations of works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], as well as other Western philosophers.

She edited many important Russian books on philosophy and human rights.&lt;ref name="INDEX"/&gt;

She actively published in leading Russian literary magazines.&lt;ref name=RUSSIAN_MAGAZINE&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lena Oznobkina's Publications|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/authors/o/oznobkina/|accessdate=March 30, 2012|newspaper=Russian Magazine|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights activism==
Starting in 1992 Oznobkina became active in human rights movement. She participated in activities of the "Glastnost Defence Foundation", and the Committee for Public Investigation on Chechnya (since 1994),.&lt;ref name=KGB1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=KGB--Vchera, Segodnia, Zavtra|url=http://www.bookfinder.com/dir/i/KGB--Vchera,_Segodnia,_Zavtra-Mezhdunarodnye_Konferentsii_I_Kruglye_Stoly/5884450052/|accessdate=March 30, 2012|title=KGB|date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voina_Checnhya&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Voina V Chechne: Mezhdunarodnyi Tribunal Rabochaia Vstrecha|url=http://www.bookfinder.com/dir/i/Voina_V_Chechne-Mezhdunarodnyi_Tribunal_Rabochaia_Vstrecha,_Stokgolm,_15-16/5884450079/|accessdate=March 30, 2012|title=Chechnya_War|date=December 16, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equanimity''' ([[Latin]]: ''æquanimitas'', having an even mind; ''aequus'' even; ''animus'' mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.  The [[virtue]] and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of  major religions and ancient philosophies.
{{wikt}}

==Etymology==
From Fr. ''équanimité'', from L. ''aequanimitatem'' (nom. ''aequanimitas'') "evenness of mind, calmness," from ''aequus'' "even, level" (see equal) + ''animus'' "mind, spirit" (see animus). Meaning "evenness of temper" in English is from 1610s.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व ''[[samatva]]m'' (also rendered ''samatva'' or ''samata'').&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' one reads: ''yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate''. [[Srila Prabhupada]] translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita As it Is'', A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;
                
In his book ''Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity'', [[Swami Sivananda]] states: 

"An aspirant who treads the path to ''samatvam'' must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: ''[[Viveka]]'', discrimination; ''[[vairagya]]'', dispassion; ''shadsampat'', the six virtues (''shama'', mental calmness and control; ''dama'', restraint of the senses; ''[[uparati]]'', sense withdrawal or ''[[pratyahara]]''; ''[[titiksha]]'', endurance; ''shraddha'', faith and ''[[samadhana]]'', mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, ''mumukshutva''. In order to possess the virtue of ''Samatvam'', he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career..."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3, "The Pathway to Samatvam", ''Samatvam: The Yoga of Equanimity'', Swami Sivananda Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Another Sanskrit term for equanimity is ''[[Upeksha (Indian thought)|upekṣhā]]''. This is the term used by [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' (1.33),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Commentary on the Yoga Sutras|author=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|publisher=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-13339.htm#1.33|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''upekṣhā'' is considered to be one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]], along with [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] (''maitri''), [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''karuṇā''), and [[mudita|joy]] (''mudita''). It is related to the idea of [[Vairagya]] or "dispassion". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a [[yoga]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upekshayoga.com/yoga/Principles.html Upeksha yoga]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Yoga]] traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular [[meditation]], combined with regular practice of [[pranayama]], asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.

==Stoicism==
Equanimity is a central concept in [[Stoic ethics]] and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word ''[[apatheia]]'' or ''[[ataraxia]]'' whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word ''aequanimitas''. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father [[Antoninus Pius]]'s last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon "aequanimitas" (equanimity). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Pyrrhonism==
In [[Pyrrhonism]] the term used for equanimity is ''[[ataraxia]]'', which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. 

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], [[upekkha|equanimity]] (''[[upekkhā]]'', ''upekṣhā'') is one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]] and is considered:

{{quote|Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for [[wisdom]] and [[free will|freedom]] and the protector of [[compassion]] and [[love]]. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The [[Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will."|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Equanimity|author=[[Gil Fronsdal]]|publisher=Insight Meditation Center|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/equanimity.html|date=2004-05-29|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Equanimity can also be cultivated through meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahmana|first=Metteyya|date=2016-05-14|title=NEW EQUANIMITY MEDITATION AND TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE TO TEST ITS EFFECTIVENESS|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303111890_NEW_EQUANIMITY_MEDITATION_AND_TOOLS_FROM_PSYCHOLOGY_AND_NEUROSCIENCE_TO_TEST_ITS_EFFECTIVENESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development.  The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv|Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv]].

==Christianity==
[[Samuel Johnson]] defined equanimity as "evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed." In [[Christian philosophy]], equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the [[theological virtues]] of [[gentleness]], [[contentment]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twenty Essays on the Practical Improvement of God's Providential Dispensations as Means of Moral Discipline to the Christian|publisher=RB Seeley and W Burnside|page=51|year=1838|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lFwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Johnson&amp;dq=Equanimity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The word “[[Islam]]” is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''aslama'', which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a [[Muslim]] can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.

==Baha'i Faith==
The voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than "equanimity" in the Baha'i Writings are "detachment" and "selflessness" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: "Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is written about him: "So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: "Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} He wrote: "Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world." {{Citation needed|reason=Source must be directly cited and linked to as footnote|date=June 2018}}

'''Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff''' (born 24 November 1949) is a Danish author and philosopher who has published within the genres of science fiction, science, [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[prose]] and non-fiction.

== Life ==
Neutzsky-Wulff is the son of [[Aage Neutzsky-Wulff]] (1891–1967). His half-sister [[Vita Andersen]] is known for her poetry and fiction.

Neutzsky-Wulff attended courses in philosophy at the [[University of Copenhagen]], but broke off his studies after his first year. Having lived in [[Copenhagen]] all of his life, he moved into an abandoned school in [[Vinstrup]] north of [[Randers]] with his wife, where he presently spends his time expanding his authorship. He occasionally holds courses on themes drawn from extensive interests.

== Competencies and influence ==
Neutzsky-Wulff has written in both fiction and non-fiction, on subjects as diverse as history, philosophy, [[cognition]], religion, the [[occult]], [[psychology]] and [[horror fiction]]. He also authored a number of books on [[computer programming]] during the 1980s. He is mainly self-taught and has mastered several languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Latin]], German, French, English and the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]].

== Activities and interests ==
Neutzsky-Wulff keeps in touch with his readers through his fan magazine ''Bathos''{{Ref label|Bathos|2}} and his official home page. ''[[Bathos]]'', in addition to offering reviews of mainly old [[horror film]]s, also contains in-depth articles on philosophy, religion, culture and various [[esoteric]] subjects. In addition, the magazine expounds on the author's philosophy and on various themes in his literature.

== Works ==
In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The ''[[Dialog om det 21. århundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer]]{{Ref label|Dialogue|3}}'', (1971), is a philosophical [[dialogue]] modelled on the classical style of [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new [[humanistic]] view on mankind and its new ideology (or anti-ideology), called ''[[Wulffianism]]''. ''Wulffianism'' is [[anarchism|anarchic]] in the word's real sense, entailing an accept of violence as a mean and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy.{{Ref label|Controversy|4}} Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned [[dialogue]]s. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in [[rhymed|rhyme]], [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] with a touch of subtle [[pastiche]].

With the [[episodic novel]] ''[[Adam Harts Opdagelser]]'' &lt;'''5'''&gt; (1972), Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as "[[occult detective]]s". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic ''[[Adam Hart og sjælemaskinen]]'' &lt;'''6'''&gt; (1977) ''[[Victor Janis og søn]]'' &lt;'''7'''&gt; (1977), both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, ''[[Oiufael]]'' (1977), mainly written on verse. An episode from ''[[Adam Hart og sjælemaskinen]]'' was adapted as the short film ''[[Adam Hart i Sahara]]'' (1990), based on his own screenplay.

Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the [[genre]], Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. ''[[Anno Domini]]'' (1975) tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a [[macrohistorical]] version of the evolution of humankind. In ''[[Gud (novel)|Gud]]'' &lt;'''8'''&gt; (1976), the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With ''[[Den 33. marts]]'' &lt;'''9'''&gt; (1977), the plot is altered from ''outer'' to "''inner space''", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, [[Philip K. Dick]]. A person living in the 1970s Copenhagen discovers effects of society as mere stage equipment. Library books are empty and he is trapped within city borders. In a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]], this person "[[hallucinates]]" about another world where he features as an awaited [[Messiah]]. ''[[Havet]]'' &lt;'''10'''&gt; (1978) is, like ''Anno Domini'' and ''Gud'', a novel about [[Spaceflight|space travel]]. The supernatural setting pivots around the [[Tarot cards|cards of Tarok]]. In ''[[Menneske]]'' &lt;'''11'''&gt; (1982), a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a [[human being]] is like. Consequently, it embarks on a [[stone age]] [[odyssey]], following the history of man, ending in a [[parody]] of the 1970s of Denmark.

=== Demons and computers ===
Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff describes by novel form esoteric initiation and demonic possession in ''[[Indsigtens sted]]'' &lt;'''12'''&gt; (1980). The narration is set through a schoolteacher's diary as he is experiencing increasingly interest in the occult. This is an effective horror story which distinguishes itself from his other books. For Neutzsky-Wulff, the eighties were to stand under the parole of prose. Neutzsky-Wulff had taught himself computer programming and when the first [[home computer]]s entered the market, he published an introductory manual, ''[[Mikrodatamaten]] – Programmering og anvendelse'' (1982), followed by several similar guides the following years. At the time, computer programming was still seen as an intellectual pursuit in a rather anti-intellectual climate.

His prosaic studies of the supernatural followed with ''[[Okkultisme]]'' &lt;'''13'''&gt; (1985) and ''[[Magi]]'' &lt;'''14'''&gt; (1986). ''Okkultisme'' raises its groundwork from epistemology, modern physics and neurology, as well as interpretations of visionary [[lyrics]], for instance [[William Blake]]'s. The book's second part gives an historical briefing on the [[history of religion]]s, from [[tribe|tribal]] religion through [[Judaism]] and Christianity, to [[Satanism]]. "Satanism" is in Neutzsky-Wulff's authorship used partly as a common denominator of a quite specific group, and partly as a philosophical term for the ideology of modern society. This ideology is, as explained, essentially [[anti-Christian]].

''Magi'' treats themes such as the supernatural, its practice, supernatural experiences and the citizens of the world beyond ours. Our present day civilization is depicted evil to an extent that hatred is given as the primary human condition (p.&amp;nbsp;222). ''Magi'' was followed by ''[[Oprindelse]]'' &lt;'''15'''&gt; (1988), the first and only volume of an abortive world history, covering a time line from the [[Big Bang]] until app. 2700 BC.

''[[Faust]]'', (1989) resembles, by structure and form, to a certain point the earlier "Den 33. marts". Neutzsky-Wulff's modern [[Faust]] is not a theologian, but rather a [[psychoanalyst]] who defies his discipline. On 20 August 1989, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff preached at [[:da:Hellig Kors Kirke|Hellig Kors Kirke]], a church in central Copenhagen, declaring that Christianity had come to an end.

=== Brick novels ===
In Neutzsky-Wulff's authorship the traditional novel form now appears to be cracking, as his novels grow in size and are thoroughly embedded with several subplots parallel to the main story. Furthermore, they attain a more objective form and prosaic essence, which provides his [[ontological platform]] with deeper insights. Also the author himself becomes [[omnipresent]], frequently either commenting on fictional actions or directly addressing the reader. [[2000 (novel)|2000]] (1991) is a science fictional [[Decameron]], where a handful of persons are isolated and share information between themselves. Around them, civilization deteriorates and a brand new kind of [[humankind|human]] is born. In the epic ''Verden'' &lt;'''16'''&gt; (1994), Neutzsky-Wulff includes time travels and similar phenomena, as he tries to delete Christ from history. Døden &lt;'''17'''&gt; (1996), distinguishes itself from other novels by its political main theme, especially the 1990s' emerging [[chauvinist]] and [[neofascist]] tendencies. This novel attracted public spotlights, as the dissolution of the journal [[Faklen]] caused a public dispute between its editors. Neutzsky-Wulff himself added yet another creation to his authorship with ''[[UFO]]'' (1999). ''UFO'' enhances his science fiction-novels of the 70s by reviewing the occult and mythological foundations of the UFO-phenomenon. In between his novel writing, Neutzsky-Wulff translated [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], which was published as ''[[For længe siden]]'' &lt;'''19'''&gt; (2000). In his ''[[Abattoir]]'' &lt;'''20'''&gt; (2003), he returns to his lighter style, reminiscent of the Adam Hart series.

=== A modern grimoire ===
[[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcend]]ent ambitions forges the massive arguments appearing in Rum &lt;'''21'''&gt; (2001), his greatest fictional work to date, and the prose work ''[[Det overnaturlige]]'' &lt;'''22'''&gt; (2004) expounding on the essence and forms of religious experience and reality itself, treating much the same topics as the earlier ''Okkultisme'' and ''Magi'', only now in much more depth. These parallel works fulfil these ambitions fully from two different holds.

The heavy ''Rum'' is illustrated with a deliberate "bad taste" by [[Jørgen Bitsch]]. The plot is set in separated rooms: A girl selling herself as a [[sex slave]], a man in a bunker after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], an expedition to an [[alien planet]], a [[haunted house]] investigator and finally, a poet not knowing he is an inspirational source for a [[mass murderer]]. These rooms can be thought of as [[:wikt:interlink|interlinked]]: They are books read by the man in the bunker or visions seen by the slave girl etc. Neutzsky-Wulff and his wife also appear. Later, the characters exchange locations. Reality constrains itself to self-created rooms and the apparently incoherent action is deliberately supposed to influence the reader to assume a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] way of thinking. It is an abyssal book, hardly fully comprehensible by any but a few.

The prose ''Det overnaturlige'', more or less exact than ''Okkultisme'' and ''Magi'', is at the same time meant to displace them by writing a modern [[grimoire]]. It is information-dense, cut to the bone and indirectly demands that the reader study a number of texts only referred to in the book to properly understand it. The book describes the [[mysticism|mystic]] initiation, a radical practice requiring women to be sexually [[Slavery|enslaved]] (as in ''Rum''), whereas men have to undergo a kind of virtual [[castration]]. Themes as diverse as [[kabbalah]], the mystic traditions of the [[Holy Grail]], [[Gnosticism]], [[fairy tales]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[The Magic Flute]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] are treated in depth.

=== Critique ===
Neutzsky-Wulff's books are quite unlike most contemporary Danish literature and can read like the texts of a strange, foreign religion at times. Time has shown that critics have a tendency to either praise them wholeheartedly or else distance themselves from them.

{{Sikh practices}}
{{SikhBeliefs}}
In [[Sikhism]], the '''Five Virtues''' are fundamental qualities which one should develop in order to reach [[Moksha|Mukti]], or to reunite or merge with God. The [[Sikh Gurus]] taught that these positive human qualities were [[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]] (truth), [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]] (compassion), [[Santokh]] (contentment), [[Nimrata]] (humility), and [[Pyaar]] (love).

==Sat==
[[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]] is the virtue of truthful living, which means practising "righteousness, honesty, justice, impartiality and fair play."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansukhani |first=Gobind Singh |title=Introduction to Sikhism |url=http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/mansukh/047.htm |accessdate=2007-02-10 |year=1977 |publisher=Hemkunt Press |location=[[New Delhi]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The Lord's humble servants are True — they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth.|[[Guru Granth Sahib]], page 600}}

==Santokh==
[[Santokh]], or contentment, is freedom "from ambition, envy, greed and jealousy. Without contentment, it is impossible to acquire peace of mind."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life. One who is so blessed by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all.|Guru Granth Sahib, ang 51}}

==Daya==

The exercise of [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]], or compassion, involves "considering another's difficulty or sorrow as one's own and helping to relieve it as far as possible. Compassion also includes the overlooking of imperfections and mistakes of others, for to err is human."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Be kind to all beings-this is more meritorious than bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage and the giving of charity.|Guru Granth Sahib, ang 136}}

==Nimrata==
[[Nimrata]], translated as "humility", "benevolence" or "humbleness", is the fourth virtue.

{{Quotation|The God-conscious being is steeped in humility.|Guru Granth Sahib, page 273}}

==[[Pyaar]]==

[[Pyaar]] requires Sikhs to be filled with the love of God.

{{Quotation|Let the Fear of God be your feet, and let His Love be your hands; let His Understanding be your eyes.|Guru Granth Sahib,ang  139}}

'''George C. Christie''' (born March 3, 1934) is the [[James Buchanan Duke|James B. Duke]] Emeritus Professor of Law at [[Duke University School of Law]] in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], where he taught [[jurisprudence]] and [[tort law]] before retiring from teaching in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.duke.edu/news/former-students-faculty-pay-tribute-christie |title=Former students, faculty pay tribute to Christie |publisher=Duke Law |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Christie was born in [[New York City]] in 1934. His father, himself a lawyer, emigrated from [[Greece]] to the United States in 1920.&lt;ref name="Athens"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.duke.edu/news/professor-george-christie-be-honored-university-athens |title=Professor George Christie to be Honored by University of Athens |publisher=Duke Law |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in 1955 and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1957, both from [[Columbia University]]. While at Columbia he was editor-in-chief&lt;ref name="ColumLRev"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1957-CLR-MASTHEAD.pdf |title=Columbia Law Review vol. 57 (1957) Masthead |publisher=Colum. L. Rev. |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Columbia Law Review]]. In 1962 he was granted a Diploma in International Law from [[Cambridge University]]. Later, in 1966 he received [[Doctor of Juridical Science|S.J.D.]] from [[Harvard Law School|Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="mdale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.martindale.com/Search_Tools/Law_Schools/schl0228.aspx |title=Law School Profile: Duke University School of Law |publisher=martindale.com |accessdate=2015-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Christie was admitted to the bar in New York in 1957 and in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1958. He spent two years in private practice in Washington D.C. and from 1960-1961 he was a Ford Fellow at Harvard Law School. From 1961-1962 he was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]] at Cambridge University. Following his time at Cambridge he became a member of the faculty at [[University of Minnesota Law School]]. In 1966 he left the University of Minnesota and returned to Washington D.C. where he served as the Assistant General Counsel for the Near East and South Asia of the [[Agency for International Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.duke.edu/fac/christie |title=George C. Christie |publisher=Duke Law |accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been on the faculty of Duke University School of Law since 1967.

He received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Athens]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="Athens"/&gt;

Christie influenced the Duke University academic governance through the so-called ''Christie Rule'', recommended by a committee he was chairing in 1972. The rule aims to guarantee that the voice of the faculty be heard prior to the Board of Trustees reaching significant decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://academiccouncil.duke.edu/academic-council-history |title=Academic Council History |publisher=Duke University |accessdate=2015-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women and Spirituality Trilogy}}'''''Goddess Remembered''''' is a 1989 Canadian [[Documentary film|documentary]] on the [[Goddess movement]] and feminist theories surrounding [[Goddess]] worship in [[Old European culture]] according to [[Marija Gimbutas]], and [[Merlin Stone]]'s ''[[When God Was a Woman]]''.

This poetic documentary is a salute to 35 000 years of "pre-history," to the values of ancestors only recently remembered, and to the goddess-worshipping religions of the ancient past. Goddess Remembered features Merlin Stone, Carol Christ, [[Luisah Teish]], [[Starhawk]], [[Charlene Spretnak]], and [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]], who link the loss of goddess-centred societies with today's environmental crisis. They propose a return to the belief in an interconnected life system, with respect for the earth and the female, as fundamental to our survival.

''Goddess Remembered'' is the first film in the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s ''Women and Spirituality'' series, followed by ''[[The Burning Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/index.php?id=29928]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theme of the film, composed by [[Loreena McKennitt]], was released as the track "Ancient Pines" on her album ''[[Parallel Dreams]]''.

'''Henry of Ghent''' (c. 1217 – 29 June 1293) was a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]], known as '''''[[List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages|Doctor Solemnis]]''''' (the "Solemn Doctor"), and also as '''Henricus de Gandavo''' and '''Henricus Gandavensis'''.

== Life ==
Henry was born in the district of Mude, near [[Ghent]]. He is supposed to have belonged to an Italian family named Bonicolli, in Dutch ''Goethals'', but the question of his name has been much discussed (see authorities below). He studied at Ghent and then at [[Cologne]] under [[Albertus Magnus]]. After obtaining the degree of doctor he returned to Ghent, and is said to have been the first to lecture there publicly on [[philosophy]] and [[theology]].

Attracted to Paris by the fame of the [[university]], he took part in the many disputes between the orders and the secular priests, on the side of the latter. While Henry was a regent master at the University of Paris, the [[Condemnations of 1277]] took place. The bishop of Paris, [[Stephen Tempier]], promulgated a condemnation of some 219 propositions put forth by the masters of the Faculty of Theology.  Henry had a hand in the creation of these propositions and because of that he was summoned to the [[papal legate]] after a fellow Augustinian, [[Giles of Rome]]. The summons was supposed to change Henry's mind concerning Thomas Aquinas and his unicity thesis (which stated that the human soul, the substantial form of the body, is the undivided principle of the individual's life, sensitivity and rationality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Gordon A.|title=A Companion to Henry of Ghent|year=2011|publisher=Brill|location=The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-18349-0|pages=25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the papal bull ''Ad fructus uberes'' by [[Pope Martin IV]] in 1281, Henry supported the secular clergy against the [[Mendicant Order]]s over the question of the 'reiteration of confession' (the obligation to confess to their parish priest, at least once a year, sins already confessed to a friar). Henry was engaged in this violent controversy for the rest of his life.  He died at [[Tournai]] (or [[Paris]]).

== Work ==

=== Being of essence ===
Henry argued that not only do individual creatures have a being corresponding to their [[essence]] - the being of essence or ''esse essentiae'', they also have a 'somethingness' (''aliquitas''). The being created by [[God]] is not the being of actual [[existence]], but the being of essence, also called ''esse latissimum'' (being in the widest sense), or ''esse communissimum'', the most general form of being. The determination of essence respecting its being made actual is a delimitation, or specification, of that being. Thus, ''esse essentiae'' comes first, then comes ''esse aliquid per essentiam'', being a ''something'' through essence, finally the whole essence thus made up is put into actuality.

=== Intentional distinction ===

An intentional distinction is where the very same thing is expressed by different concepts in different ways (''Quodl''. V, q. 12). Unlike a purely logical distinction, an intentional distinction always implies a sort of composition, although it is minor with regard to that implied by a distinction in reality.

For example, ''rational'' and ''animal'', as they are found in man, is not a distinction of reason, since one is not a definition of the other. Nor is a real distinction, otherwise the conjunction of 'animal' and 'rational' in some particular person would be purely accidental (''per accidens''). Therefore, there must be some intermediate distinction, which Henry defines as 'intentional'. This principle was later developed by Scotus into the [[formal distinction]].

=== Illumination ===

Henry's doctrines are infused by a strong [[Platonism]]. He distinguished between knowledge of actual objects and the divine inspiration by which we cognize the being and existence of God. The first throws no light upon the second. Individuals are constituted not by the material element but by their independent existence, i.e. ultimately by the fact that they are created as separate entities. [[Universals]] must be distinguished according as they have reference to our minds or to the divine mind. In the divine intelligence exist exemplars or types of the genera and species of natural objects.

On this subject Henry is far from clear; but he defends [[Plato]] against the current Aristotelian criticism, and endeavours to show that the two views are in harmony. In psychology, his view of the intimate union of soul and body is remarkable. The body he regards as forming part of the substance of the soul, which through this union is more perfect and complete.

=== Scientific knowledge ===

Henry's standards for truth exceeded what is now commonly accepted in [[science]]. Following closely Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', he demanded that "First, it must be certain, i.e. exclusive of deception and doubt; secondly, it must be of a necessary object; thirdly, it must be produced by a cause that is evident to the intellect; fourthly, it must be applied to the object by a syllogistic reasoning process". He thus excluded from the realm of the knowable anything about contingent objects. In this respect he was contradicted by his younger contemporary [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hugh G. Gauch]]|title=Scientific method in practice|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-01708-4|pages=52 and 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20148">'''Hexspeak''', like [[leet]]speak, is a novelty form of variant [[English language|English]] spelling using the hexadecimal digits. Created by programmers as memorable [[magic number (programming)|magic numbers]], hexspeak words can serve as a clear and unique identifier with which to mark memory or data.

[[hexadecimal|Hexadecimal notation]] represents numbers using the 16 digits &lt;tt&gt;0123456789ABCDEF&lt;/tt&gt;.  Using only the letters &lt;tt&gt;ABCDEF&lt;/tt&gt; it is possible to spell several words. Further words can be made by treating some of the decimal numbers as letters - the digit "&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;" can represent the letter "O", and "&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;" can represent the letters "I" or "L". Less commonly, "&lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;" can represent "S", "&lt;tt&gt;7&lt;/tt&gt;" represent "T", "&lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;" represent "R" and "&lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;" or "&lt;tt&gt;9&lt;/tt&gt;" can represent "G" or "g", respectively. Numbers such as &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt; can be used in a manner similar to [[leet]] or [[rebus]]es; e.g. the word "defecate" can be expressed either as &lt;tt&gt;DEFECA7E&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;DEFEC8&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Notable magic numbers ==

== Alternative letters ==
Many computer languages require that a hexadecimal number be marked with a prefix or suffix (or both) to identify it as a number. Sometimes the prefix or suffix is used as part of the word.
* The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] uses the "0x" prefix to indicate a hexadecimal number, but the "0x" is usually ignored when reading it as a word.  C also allows the suffix L to declare an integer as &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt;, or LL to declare it as &lt;tt&gt;long long&lt;/tt&gt;, making it possible to write "0xDEADCELL" (dead cell). In either case a U may also appear in the suffix to declare the integer as &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt;, making it possible to write "0xFEEDBULL" (feed bull).
* In the [[x86-assembly|Intel assembly language]], hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a "h" suffix, making it possible to write "0beach" (beach). Note that numbers in this notation that begin with a letter must be prefixed with a zero to distinguish them from variable names.
* [[Visual Basic]] uses a &amp;H prefix, for example, "&amp;HEADED" (headed).
* In Pascal and [[6502]] [[assembly language]], hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a "$" prefix.  This allows for words starting with the letter "S", for example "$EED" (seed).
* In [[Elektronika B3-34|Б3-34]] [[programmable calculator]]s alternative hexadecimal alphabet was used, where the symbol "−", "L", "C", "Г", "E", "&amp;nbsp;" (space) were used instead of Latin letters. Using these it was possible to display messages like "EГГ0Г" (error).

== PlayStation 3 RSX ==

In reverse engineering aspects of the Sony [[PlayStation 3]], a number of hexspeak codes were found to either trigger, effect or were present in aspects of communicating to and through the PlayStation 3 Hypervisor in communication to its GPU, the [[RSX Reality Synthesizer]].&lt;ref name="hexspeak_rsx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/RSXFIFOCommands |title=RSXFIFOCommands - PS3 Developer Wiki|publisher=psdev wiki|date=2014-05-20|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These projects were largely born out of PS3 homebrew operating on the PS3's [[OtherOS]] which allowed Linux to be installed, initially with extremely limited GPU access.

'''''Honkyoku''''' (本曲, "original pieces") are the pieces of [[shakuhachi]] music played by [[mendicant]] [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Zen]] monks called [[komusō]].  Komusō played honkyoku for [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] and [[alms]] as early as the 13th century. Honkyoku is part of the practice of [[suizen]] (吹禅, "blowing Zen"). The [[Fuke sect]] which originated from this practice ceased to exist in the 19th century, after which several shakuhachi guilds were formed, and the verbal and written lineage of many honkyoku continues today, though the music is now often practised in a concert or performance setting.

There are many [[Ryū (school)|ryū 流]], or schools, of honkyoku, each with their own style, emphasis, and teaching methods.

"Motion in ''honkyoku'' is significantly static, precisely because of the dominance of the sacred purpose and function, and to a certain extent, it is also subject to breathing meditation,''' '''the principle of the ''suidan - ''the phrase of one full breath - thus a form of breathing exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shakuhachi.cz/original/en_rec.html|title=Specifics of the Musical Language of Fuke Honkyoku|last=Matoušek|first=Vlastislav|date=|website=shakuhachi.cz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinko Ryū ==

In the 18th century, a komusō named [[Kinko Kurosawa]] of the [[Fuke sect]] of Zen [[Buddhism]] was commissioned to travel [[Japan]] and collect these musical pieces.  Although it is commonly thought that the 36 pieces of the Kinko Ryū Honkyoku repertoire were collected and played by Kinko Kurosawa, these pieces were significantly changed and codified by later generations, including Miura Kindo and others.

According to his enlightenment story, he had been an accomplished scholar of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[sutra|sūtra]]''s, but for many years had made very little headway in his meditation practice. One day, his master asked him what his [[original face]] was before birth, to which he could not respond—this question became his ''[[koan|kōan]]'', and he subsequently burned his ''sūtra''s and set out to settle the matter.

He is one of the earliest creators of the "[[New-age music|new age]]" genre. His company, Inter-Dimensional Music, is based in [[Sausalito, California]]. The psychology department at [[Plymouth State College]] rated his ''Angelic Music'' album as being closest to the music heard by people who have had [[Near-death experience]]s.&lt;ref name="Angelic Music' 1998"&gt;''Angelic Music'' 1998, Bluestar Communications (U.S.), Aquamarin Verlag (Europe)&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist philosopher [[Alan Watts]] has said "Iasos is doing the classical music of the New Age."&lt;ref name="Angelic Music' 1998"/&gt; Guitarist [[Lee Underwood]] has said "''Angelic Music''...perhaps exemplif(ies) the best this genre has to offer."&lt;ref&gt;Pulse!, The Magazine of Tower Records, March 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical development==

He began studying piano at age 8, with formal music education through high school. In 1967, he began to "hear" music, which he referred to as "paradise music." He moved to California in 1968, to work on creating this music. In 1975, he released his first album, ''Inter-Dimensional Music Through Iasos,'' the same year his friend and colleague [[Steven Halpern]] released his first album, thus being an early pioneer in the "new age music" genre. In 1982, Iasos produced one of the first New Age videos, "Crystal Vista. "In 1989, the psychology department of Plymouth State College in [[New Hampshire]] conducted research with people who had had near-death experiences. The conclusion of the research was that Iasos' music received the highest rating for being most like the music people heard while in their near death state.&lt;ref name="Angelic Music' 1998"/&gt; Iasos has performed and lectured internationally, and his music is distributed worldwide. His music has been used by [[NASA]] and the [[Ivan Dryer|Laserium]] laser light show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolsforwellness.com/tb502cd.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''If Women Counted''''' (1988) by [[Marilyn Waring]], former New Zealand Member of Parliament, is a book in academic [[feminism]], [[political economy]] and [[feminist economics]]. The book is a groundbreaking and systematic critique of the system of [[national accounts]], the international standard of measuring economic growth, and the ways in which women's [[unpaid work]] as well as the value of [[Nature]] have been excluded from what counts as productive in the economy.

The book "persuaded the [[United Nations]] to redefine [[gross domestic product]], inspired new accounting methods in dozens of countries, and became the founding document of the discipline of [[feminist economics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html |title=Women Unaccounted for in Global Economy Proves Waring Influence |last1=Langeland |first1=Terje |date=18 June 2013 |work= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HU4a0KMl?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html |accessdate=18 June 2013 |archivedate=19 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely cited book, it made the analysis of this topic known to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|authorlink=Lourdes Benería|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92706-4|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

According to [[Julie A. Nelson]], 
:"Marilyn Waring's work woke people up.  She showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems, and the damage this causes. Her book [...] encouraged and influenced a wide range of work on ways, both numerical and otherwise, of valuing, preserving, and rewarding the work of care that sustains our lives. By pointing to a similar neglect of the natural environment, she also issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability that have only grown more pressing over time. In recent decades, the field of feminist economics has broadened and widened to encompass these topics and more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Julie A.|authorlink=Julie A.

The noted economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] called ''If Women Counted'' "a splendid work... no concerned man or woman can ignore it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Benet, Lorenzo Benet|title=Economics And The Invisible Woman|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date= April 2, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics''===
''Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics'', an anthology edited by [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] and [[Ailsa McKay]], was published in 2014, with contributions by a diverse group of scholars on recent advances in the field of [[feminist economics]]. It was described by economist [[Alison Preston]] as "a timely reminder of the politics and economics underpinning what, how and by whom activities and outputs are valued. For those concerned with social justice and sustainable futures this important and powerful book provides an invaluable and practical insight into issues that are in need of greater visibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marilynwaring.com/news/2014-Counting.html |title= Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |last1= |first1= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425202614/http://marilynwaring.com/news/2014-Counting.html |archivedate=April 25, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the magazine ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]]'', the book explores "a wide range of issues—including the fundamental meaning of economic growth and activity to consumption, health care, mortality, unpaid household work, mothering, education, nutrition, equality, and sustainability" and reveals "the breadth, depth, and substance that can grow from innovative ideas and critical analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sullivan |first=T.E. |year= 2014 |title= Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |url= |journal=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]] |publisher= |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages= |doi= 10.5860/CHOICE.185300 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diane Elson]] argues that "despite many valiant efforts, women do not as yet really count in the conduct of economic policy. This book is an imaginative contribution to an ongoing struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Elson |first=Diane |authorlink= Diane Elson |year= 2015 |title= Book Review: Counting on Marilyn Waring: new advances in feminist economics |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/journal/v109/n1/full/fr201458a.html |journal= Feminist Review |publisher= |issue=109 |pages= |doi= 10.1057/fr.2014.58 |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review in ''[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]]'', Patricia E. Perkins calls the book "a joy to read and a revelation", and "a fitting culmination of [McKay's] lifelong work using economics to advance equity for women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Perkins |first=Patricia E. |year= 2015 |title= Book Review: Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |url=|journal= [[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |publisher= |issue=|pages= |doi= 10.1080/13545701.2015.1069370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irrealism''' is a philosophical position first advanced by [[Nelson Goodman]] in "Ways of Worldmaking",&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and [[aesthetics]].

==Nelson Goodman's irrealism==
Irrealism was initially motivated by the debate between [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]] in [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than viewing either as prior to the other, Goodman described them both as alternative "world-versions", both useful in some circumstances, but neither capable of capturing the other in an entirely satisfactory way, a point he emphasizes with examples from psychology.&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 : Ch. V)&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to extend this [[epistemology|epistemic]] pluralism to all areas of knowledge, from equivalent [[formal system]]s in [[mathematics]] (sometimes it is useful to think of points as primitives, sometimes it is more useful to consider lines the primitive) to alternative schools of [[art]] (for some paintings thinking in terms of representational accuracy is the most useful way of considering them, for others it is not). However, in line with his consideration of [[phenomenalism]] and [[physicalism]], Goodman goes beyond saying merely that these are "world-versions" of ''the'' world, instead he describes worlds as "made by making such versions".&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.94)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysically, Goodman's irrealism is distinct from [[anti-realism]] though the two concepts are frequently confused. "We are not speaking in terms of multiple possible alternatives to a single actual world but of multiple actual worlds."&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.2)&lt;/ref&gt; He makes no assertions regarding "the way the world is" and that there is no primary world version i.e. "no true version compatible with all true versions." As Goodman says, "Not only motion, ... but even reality is relative."&lt;ref&gt;(Goodman 1978 p.20)&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that Goodman accepts many forms of realism and anti-realism without being troubled by the resulting contradictions.

==Other Irrealists==

The artist [[Tristan Tondino]] has had several exhibitions entitled "Irreality" which crossover into other fields and include philosophy, mathematics, [[ophthalmology]], science and politics. He writes, "Realism is an Irrealism. Reality is plurality - we partially create it, we must open our universes and our perceptions to all new versions that may promote the concept of human rights and expand its possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Émile Brisson, Plurielle Ouverture, AGIR, Amnestie Internationale, vol 25, #3, septembre 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a painting depicting a chair and entitled "The Hegemony of the Real", Tondino has written "That the Real must be regarded as a fiction does not detract from its hegemony".

The [[sociologist]] [[Nikolas Rose]] subscribes to irrealism in his ''Powers of Freedom'', though his irrealism differs from Nelson's in being 'technical, not psychologistic, furthering Nelson's assertions of the human mind are only capable of a limited understanding and that it is a construct built upon itself."

==Other Forms of Irrealism==

The philosophical term may be used in more specific or arguably narrower senses, such as "colour irrealism".&lt;ref&gt;https://frodo.ucsc.edu/~jellis/Papers/Color.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">'''James Edwin Creighton''' (April 8, 1861, [[Pictou, Nova Scotia]] – October 8, 1924, [[Ithaca, NY]]), was an American [[philosopher]] who believed no system of thought can be the product of an isolated mind. 

He was early influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]] and [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bosanquet]], and later accepted some of the views of [[Wilhelm Windelband|Windelband]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]], without sharing all of their opinions. Creighton differentiated between what he considered as intelligible in philosophy and what is intelligible in the natural sciences.

Creighton (1902) was the founding president of the American Philosophical Association. His most important essays were compiled in ''Studies in Speculative Philosophy'' (Creighton, 1925; see also Sabine, 1917).

[[File:BahubaliBhagwan-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bahubali]] practicing meditation in standing Kayotsarga posture. (Photo: Gommateshwara statue, [[Shravanbelagola]])]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Kayotsarga''' ({{Lang-sa|कायोत्सर्ग}} {{IAST|Kāyotsarga}}, {{lang-pka|काउस्सग्ग}} {{IAST|Kāussagga}}) is a [[Yoga|yogic]] posture which is an important part of the [[Jain meditation]]. It literally means "dismissing the body".{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=210}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Kayotsarga: A jaina technique of relaxation|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/kayotsarga-a-jaina-technique-of-relaxation/15806607.shtml|journal=www.merinews.com|date = 8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tirthankara]] is represented either seated in yoga posture or standing in the kayotsarga posture.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=209–210}} ''Kayotsarga'' means "to give up one's physical comfort and body movements", thus staying steady, either in a standing or other posture, and concentrating upon the true nature of the soul. It is one of the six essentials (''avasyaka'') of a [[Jain monasticism|Jain ascetic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The nature of the Whole: Holism in Ancient Greek and Indian Medecine|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=Qj0er3XA5MsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=kayotsarga+jain+ascetic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eWcpCyqaIH&amp;sig=-cTFHC1R30OYk4cTzZb32PHjhDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI6-_3rKSNxwIVhgUsCh1PnwUw#v=onepage&amp;q=kayotsarga%20jain%20ascetic&amp;f=false|journal=books.google.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the 28 primary attributes of a [[Digambara monk]]

Twenty-one of the tīrthankaras of [[Jainism]] are said to have attained ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' in the kayotsarga “standing meditation” posture. An example of unflinching standing meditation is that of ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]] [[Bahubali]]'' who is said to have stood in kayotsarga for a year.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=212}}

== Sāmayika ==
{{Main|Samayika}}
In performing ''sāmayika'' (daily meditation), the ''śrāvaka'' has to stand facing north or east and bow to the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]''.{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=44, 61}} He then sit down and recites the [[Namokara mantra]] a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in:{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=45}}
*''pratikramana'', recounting the sins committed and repenting for them, 
*''pratyākhyanā'', resolving to avoid particular sins in future, 
*''sāmayika karma'', renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike, 
*''stuti'', praising the four and twenty Tīrthankaras, 
*''vandanā'', devotion to a particular ''Tirthankara'', and 
*''kāyotsarga'', withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self.

'''Mahāyāna''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɑː|h|ə|ˈ|j|ɑː|n|ə}}; [[Sanskrit]] for "Great Vehicle")&lt;!--Please do not insert other languages as the term Mahayana derives from Sanskrit and not any other languages.--&gt; is one of two  main existing branches of [[Buddhism]] (the other being [[Theravada]]) and a term for classification of [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophies]] and practice. This movement added a further set of discourses, and although it was initially small in India, it had long-term historical significance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916409066|title=Religions in the modern world : traditions and transformations|others=Woodhead, Linda,, Partridge, Christopher H. (Christopher Hugh), 1961-, Kawanami, Hiroko,|isbn=9780415858809|edition=Third|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=916409066}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist tradition of [[Vajrayana]] is sometimes classified as a part of Mahayana Buddhism, but some scholars consider it to be a different branch altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/budvaj.htm |title=Buddhism: Description of the Vajrayāna tradition |date=25 April 2010 |website=Religious Tolerance |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the teachings of Mahāyāna traditions, "Mahāyāna" also refers to the path of the [[Bodhisattva]] seeking complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings, also called "Bodhisattvayāna", or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"&gt;[[Damien Keown]] (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=985a1M7L1NcC&amp;pg=PA38 A Dictionary of Buddhism]'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The Mahayana, 'Great Vehicle' or 'Great Carriage' (for carrying all beings to nirvana), is also, and perhaps more correctly and accurately, known as the Bodhisattvayana, the bodhisattva's vehicle." - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 338}} A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a [[samyaksaṃbuddha]], or "fully enlightened Buddha". A samyaksaṃbuddha can establish the [[Dharma]] and lead disciples to enlightenment.

The Mahāyāna tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today, with 53.2% of practitioners, compared to 35.8% for [[Theravada]] and 5.7% for [[Vajrayana]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson |first1=Todd M. |last2=Grim |first2=Brian J. |title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography |url=http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ |page=36 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020100448/http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of its history, Mahāyāna Buddhism spread from India to various other [[South Asia|South]], [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n countries such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Mahayana Buddhism also spread to other South and Southeast Asian countries, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], the [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Iran]] and other Central Asian countries before being replaced by Theravada Buddhism or other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZRGAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=buddhist+viharas+found+in+modern+day+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6fa8kamUbK&amp;sig=TrrlAWcGC-OtT9yWpqHTrnfrPG0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxxY-w8ZPYAhUOw2MKHbBkCpIQ6AEIdDAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20viharas%20found%20in%20modern%20day%20iran&amp;f=false |last=Foltz |first=Richard |title=Religions of Iran:From Prehistory to the Present |page=95 |quote=In the centuries before the Arab conquests Buddhism was spread throughout the eastern Iranian world.

Large Mahāyāna scholastic centers thrived during the latter period of Buddhism in India, between the seventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhism today include [[Chan Buddhism]], [[Korean Seon]], [[Japanese Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] and [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnamese Buddhism]]. It may also include the [[Vajrayana]] traditions of [[Tiantai]],  [[Tendai]], [[Shingon Buddhism]], and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which add esoteric teachings to the Mahāyāna tradition.

==Etymology==

According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' ("Great Vehicle") was originally an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'' ("[[Bodhisattva]] Vehicle")&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— the vehicle of a bodhisattva seeking [[buddhahood]] for the benefit of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt; The term ''Mahāyāna'' (which had earlier been used simply as an epithet for Buddhism itself) was therefore adopted at an early date as a synonym for the path and the teachings of the bodhisattvas. Since it was simply an honorary term for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', the adoption of the term ''Mahāyāna'' and its application to Bodhisattvayāna did not represent a significant turning point in the development of a Mahāyāna tradition.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"/&gt;

The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term ''Mahāyāna'' as a synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', but the term ''[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]'' is comparatively rare in the earliest sources. The presumed dichotomy between ''Mahāyāna'' and ''Hīnayāna'' can be deceptive, as the two terms were not actually formed in relation to one another in the same era.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest and most important references to ''Mahāyāna'' are those that occur in the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'') dating between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;W. Rahula, (1996). [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha125.htm ''Theravada - Mahayana Buddhism'']; in: "Gems of Buddhist Wisdom", Buddhist Missionary Society, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt; Seishi Karashima has suggested that the term first used in an earlier [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhāri]] [[Prakrit]] version of the ''Lotus Sūtra'' was not the term ''mahāyāna'' but the Prakrit word ''mahājāna'' in the sense of ''mahājñāna'' (great knowing).&lt;ref name=Williams2004&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3. The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism.'' Routledge. 2004. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, Seishi (2000), [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705053037/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-04.pdf Who composed the Lotus Sutra?], Annual Report of The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University  4, p. 170 (note 115)&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage when the early Prakrit word was converted into Sanskrit, this ''mahājāna'', being phonetically ambivalent, was mistakenly converted into ''mahāyāna'', possibly because of what may have been a double meaning in the famous [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Parable of the Burning House]], which talks of three vehicles or carts (Skt: ''yāna'').{{refn|group=note|Karashima: "I have assumed that, in the earliest stage of the transmission of ''the Lotus Sūtra'', the Middle Indic forn ''jāṇa'' or *''jāna'' (Pkt &amp;lt; Skt ''jñāna'', ''yāna'') had stood in these places ... I have assumed, further, that the Mahāyānist terms ''buddha-yānā'' ("the Buddha-vehicle"), ''mahāyāna'' ("the great vehicle"), ''hīnayāna'' ("the inferior vehicle") meant originally ''buddha-jñāna'' ("buddha-knowledge"), ''mahājñāna'' ("great knowledge") and ''hīnajñāna'' ("inferior knowledge")."

===Origins===

The origins of Mahāyāna are still not completely understood.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 260"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Western views of Mahāyāna assumed that it existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called "Hīnayāna" schools. The earliest Mahāyāna texts often depict strict adherence to the path of a bodhisattva, and engagement in the ascetic ideal of a monastic life in the wilderness, akin to the ideas expressed in the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra|Rhinoceros Sūtra]]''.{{refn|group=note|"As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahayana sūtras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of “wandering alone like a rhinoceros”. ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494}}

The earliest textual evidence of "Mahāyāna" comes from [[sūtras]] originating around the beginning of the common era. Jan Nattier has noted that some of the earliest Mahāyāna texts such as the ''[[Ugrapariprccha Sutra|Ugraparipṛccha Sūtra]]'' use the term "Mahāyāna", yet there is no doctrinal difference between Mahāyāna in this context and the early schools, and that "Mahāyāna" referred rather to the rigorous emulation of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the path of a bodhisattva seeking to become a fully enlightened buddha.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194"/&gt; Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[Vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the [[early schools of Buddhism]], and therefore each [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] or [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. Membership in these ''nikāyas'', or monastic sects, continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] nikāya in East Asia, and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] nikāya in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harrison clarifies that while monastic Mahāyānists belonged to a nikāya, not all members of a nikāya were Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that, formally, Mahāyāna would have been understood as a group of monks or nuns within a larger monastery taking a vow together (known as a "''kriyākarma''") to memorize and study a Mahāyāna text or texts.

The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]], who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mahayana sūtras are called the Mahāyānists, while those who do not perform these are called the Hīnayānists.}}

Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts. These Mahāyāna teachings were first propagated into [[China]] by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], the first translator of Mahāyāna sūtras into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] during the 2nd century CE.{{refn|group=note|"The most important evidence&amp;nbsp;— in fact the only evidence&amp;nbsp;— for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Zürcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema." ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}}

===Earliest Mahayana sutras===

Based on the testimony of [[Chandrakirti|Candrakīrti]] (7th cent.) several scholars have suggested that the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā sūtras]], which are among the earliest [[Mahayana sutras]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; developed among the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]] in the [[Andhra Pradesh#Early history|Āndhra]] region of southern India.&lt;ref name=Xing65-66&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65-66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krishna River."&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently Seishi Karashima has argued for their origin in the Gandhara region.&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The earliest Mahāyāna sūtras include the very first versions of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] genre, along with texts concerning [[Aksobhya|Akṣobhya Buddha]], which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: pp. 253, 263, 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana Sutras"&amp;nbsp;– Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Guang Xing states, "Several scholars have suggested the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahāsāṃghikas in southern India, in the Āndhra country, on the Kṛṣṇa River."&lt;ref name=Xing65-66/&gt; [[A.K. Warder]] believes that "the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Āndhra country."&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that "historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as [[Nāgārjuna]], [[Dignaga]], [[Candrakīrti]], [[Āryadeva]], and [[Bhavaviveka]], among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in Āndhra."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They note that the ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Kṛṣṇa Valley, including [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Nagarjunakonda|Nāgārjunakoṇḍā]] and [[Jaggaiahpet|Jaggayyapeṭa]] "can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Hirakawa notes the "evidence suggests that many Early Mahayana scriptures originated in South India."&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras were mainly composed in the south of India, and later the activity of writing additional scriptures was continued in the north.{{refn|group=note|Warder: "The sudden appearance of large numbers of (Mahayana) teachers and texts (in North India in the second century AD) would seem to require some previous preparation and development, and this we can look for in the South." - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.}} However, the assumption that the presence of an evolving body of Mahāyāna scriptures implies the contemporaneous existence of distinct religious movement called "Mahāyāna", may be a serious misstep.{{refn|group=note|"But even apart from the obvious weaknesses inherent in arguments of this kind there is here the tacit equation of a body of literature with a religious movement, an assumption that evidence for the presence of one proves the existence of the other, and this may be a serious misstep." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}} Some scholars further speculate that the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sūtras were written in response to the ultrarealism of [[abhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew (2004 ). ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Mahāyāna sūtras were translated by the [[Kushan|Kuṣāṇa]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], who came to China from the kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. His first translations to Chinese were made in the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] between 178 and 189 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahāyāna sūtras translated during the 2nd century CE include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993).

This corpus of texts often emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, absorbed in states of meditative concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations:'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Harrison points to the enthusiasm in the Lokakṣema sūtra corpus for the extra ascetic practices, for dwelling in the forest, and above all for states of meditative absorption (''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]''). Meditation and meditative states seem to have occupied a central place in early Mahāyāna, certainly because of their spiritual efficacy but also because they may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.}}

===Earliest inscriptions===

The earliest stone inscription containing a recognizably Mahāyāna formulation and a mention of the Buddha [[Amitābha]] was found in the Indian subcontinent in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and dated to around 180 CE. Remains of a statue of a Buddha bear the [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] inscription: "Made in the year 28 of the reign of King [[Huvishka|Huviṣka]], ... for the Blessed One, the Buddha Amitābha." There is also some evidence that Emperor Huviṣka himself was a follower of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and a Sanskrit manuscript fragment in the [[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Collection]] describes Huviṣka as having "set forth in the Mahāyāna."&lt;ref&gt;Neelis, Jason. ''Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks.'' 2010. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of the name "Mahāyāna" in Indian inscriptions in the period before the 5th century is very limited in comparison to the multiplicity of Mahāyāna writings transmitted from [[Central Asia]] to [[China]] at that time.{{refn|group=note|"Certainly, we have for this period an extensive body of inscriptions from virtually all parts of India. ... But nowhere in this extensive body of material is there any reference, prior to the fifth century, to a named Mahāyāna.", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}}{{refn|group=note|"What is particularly disconcerting here is the disconnect between expectation and reality: We know from Chinese translations that large numbers of Mahāyāna sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century. But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different&amp;nbsp;— in fact seemingly older&amp;nbsp;— ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior, and old and established Hinayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported., ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494}}{{refn|group=note|"In other words, once nontextual evidence is taken into account the picture changes dramatically. Rather than being datable to the beginning of the common era, this strand of Mahayana Buddhism, at least, appeared to have no visible impact on Indian Buddhist cult practice until the 2nd century, and even then what impact it had was extremely isolated and marginal, and had no lasting or long-term consequences&amp;nbsp;— there were no further references to Amitabha in Indian image inscriptions. Almost exactly the same pattern occurs (concerning Mahayana) on an even broader scale when nontextual evidence is considered." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}}

===Early Mahāyāna Buddhism===

During the period of early Mahāyāna Buddhism, four major types of thought developed: [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]], [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Buddha-nature]] (''Tathāgatagarbha''), and [[Buddhist logic]] as the last and most recent.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 8,9&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahāyāna were the Mādhyamaka and the later Yogācāra.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Kushan Empire]], Mahayana Buddhism teachings encouraged societies to give generous donations to the Buddhist monasteries, which gave the people "religious merits".&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier stage forms of Mahāyāna such as the doctrines of Prajñāpāramitā, Yogācāra, Buddha Nature, and the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] teachings are still popular in East Asia. In some cases these have spawned new developments, while in others they are treated in the more traditional syncretic manner. Paul Williams has noted that in this tradition in the Far East, primacy has always been given to study of the sūtras.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.103"&gt;Williams, Paul (1989). ''Mahayana Buddhism'': p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahāyāna constitutes an inclusive tradition characterized by plurality and the adoption of new [[Mahayana sutras]] in addition to the earlier [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgama]]s.

For example, the inferior was taught to the merchants [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Trapuṣa and Ballika]] because they were ordinary men; the middle was [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|taught to the group of five]] because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold ''Prajñāpāramitās'' were taught to bodhisattvas, and [the ''Prajñāpāramitās''] are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms.}}

There is also a tendency in Mahāyāna sūtras to regard adherence to these sūtras as generating spiritual benefits greater than those that arise from being a follower of the non-Mahāyāna approaches to Dharma. Thus the ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]'' claims that the Buddha said that devotion to Mahāyāna is inherently superior in its virtues to following the [[śrāvaka]] or [[pratyekabuddha]] paths.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Dr. Shenpen, trans. (1998). ''The Shrimaladevi Sutra''. Oxford: Longchen Foundation: p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental principles of Mahāyāna doctrine were based on the possibility of universal liberation from [[dukkha]] for all beings (hence the "Great Vehicle") and the existence of buddhas and bodhisattvas embodying Buddha-nature. The Pure Land school of Mahāyāna simplifies the expression of [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] by allowing salvation to be alternatively obtained through the grace of the buddha [[Amitābha]] by having faith and devoting oneself to [[nianfo|mindfulness of the Buddha]]. This [[Buddhist devotion|devotional lifestyle]] of Buddhism has greatly contributed to the success of Mahāyāna in East Asia, where spiritual elements traditionally relied upon mindfulness of the Buddha, mantras and [[dhāraṇī]]s, and reading sutras. In Chinese Buddhism, most monks, let alone lay people, practice Pure Land, some combining it with [[Chan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1967). ''Practice of Chinese Buddhism''. Harvard: p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mahāyāna schools believe in supernatural bodhisattvas who devote themselves to the [[pāramitā]]s, ultimate knowledge (Skt. ''sarvajñāna''), and the liberation of all sentient beings.

===Bodhisattva===
{{Main|Bodhisattva}}
The Mahāyāna tradition holds that pursuing only the release from suffering and attainment of Nirvāṇa is too narrow an aspiration, because it lacks the motivation of actively resolving to liberate all other sentient beings from [[saṃsāra]], "suffering". One who engages in this path is called a bodhisattva. Bodhisattvas could reach nirvana, but they believe it is more important to help others on their path of finding nirvana rather than committing fully to nirvana themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristic of a bodhisattva is [[bodhicitta]], the intention to achieve omniscient Buddhahood ([[Trikaya]]) as fast as possible, so that one may benefit infinite sentient beings. Sometimes the term bodhisattva is used more restrictively to refer to those sentient beings on the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|grounds]]. As Ananda Coomaraswamy notes, "The most essential part of the Mahayana is its emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal, which replaces that of the [[arhat]], or ranks before it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books, Inc. |location=Boston|page=229 |lccn=64056434}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahāyāna teachings, being a high-level bodhisattva involves possessing a mind of great compassion and [[prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (wisdom) to realize the reality of inherent [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]. Mahāyāna teaches that the practitioner will finally realize the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Expedient means===
{{Main|Upaya}}
Expedient means&lt;ref&gt;Pye, Michael (1978). Skilful Means&amp;nbsp;— A concept in Mahayana Buddhism. London, UK: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7156-1266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Skt. ''[[upaya|upāya]]'') is found in the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', one of the earliest-dated sutras, and is accepted in all Mahāyāna schools of thought. It is any effective method that aids awakening. It does not necessarily mean that some particular method is "untrue" but is simply any means or stratagem that is conducive to spiritual growth and leads beings to awakening and [[nirvana]]. Expedient means could thus be certain motivational words for a particular listener or even the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] itself. Basic Buddhism (what Mahāyāna would term ''[[śrāvakayāna]]'' or ''[[pratyekabuddhayāna]]'') is an expedient method for helping people begin the noble Buddhist path and advance quite far. But the path is not wholly traversed, according to some schools, until the practitioner has striven for and attained Buddhahood for the liberation of all other sentient beings from suffering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Some scholars have stated that the exercise of expedient means, "the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is also of enormous importance in the Pāli canon."{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "It is true that the term translated 'expounding in means', upaya-kausalya, is post-canonical, but the exercise of expounding to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon." Gombrich, Richard F. (1997). ''How Buddhism Began''. Munshiram Manoharlal: p. 17}} In fact the Pāli term ''upāya-kosalla'' does occur in the Pāli Canon, in the ''Sangiti Sutta'' of the ''Digha Nikāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, M. trans. (1987). ''Thus Have I Heard: the Long Discourses of the Buddha''. Wisdom: p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberation===
Mahāyāna Buddhism includes a rich cosmology, with various Buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in different worlds and buddha-realms. The concept of [[trikaya|the three bodies]] (''trikāya'') supports these constructions, making the Buddha himself a transcendental figure. Dr. Guang Xing describes the Mahāyāna Buddha as "an omnipotent divinity endowed with numerous supernatural attributes and qualities ...[He] is described almost as an omnipotent and almighty godhead."&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing (2005). ''The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory''. Oxford: Routledge Curzon: pp.1 and 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Under various conditions, the realms Buddha presides over could be attained by devotees after their death so, when reborn, they could strive towards buddhahood in the best possible conditions. Depending on the sect, liberation into a buddha-realm can be obtained by faith, visualization, or sometimes even by the repetition of Buddha's name. These practices are common in Pure Land Buddhism.{Dr. Guang Xing, The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory, RoutledgeCurzon, Oxford, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1}

===Buddha nature===
[[File:Ajanta Ellora buddha statue aurangabad maharastra.jpg|thumb|The Buddha flanked by [[bodhisattva]]s. Cave 4, [[Ajanta Caves|Ajaṇṭā Caves]], [[Maharashtra|Mahārāṣtra]], India]]

{{Main|Buddha nature}}

''Buddha-nature'', ''Buddha-dhatu'' or ''Buddha Principle'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''Buddha-dhātu'', ''Tathāgatagarbha''; [[Japanese language|Jap]]: ''Bussho''), is taught differently in various Mahayana Buddhism traditions. Broadly speaking Buddha-nature is concerned with ascertaining what allows sentient beings to become Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, Buddha nature, is a translation of the Sanskrit coinage, 'Buddha-dhātu', which seems first to have appeared in the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, Oxford, 2009, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; where it refers to "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas",&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and where it is also spoken of as the 'Self' (''atman'').&lt;ref name="Professor Michael Zimmermann 2002 pp. 82"&gt;Zimmermann, Michael (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023508/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/BPPB/pdf/BPPB-06.pdf  ''A Buddha Within: The Tathāgatagarbhasūtra''], Biblotheca Philologica et Philosophica Buddhica VI, The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology, Soka University, pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

It is called ''Tathāgatagarbha'' ''Buddha-dhātu'' at the stage of sentient beings because it is covered with defilements, and it is called ''[[Dharmakaya|Dharmakāya]]'' at the stage of Buddhahood, because its pure nature is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Guang (2005), ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikāya Theory'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Dharmakaya is in "Tibetan Buddhism [...] considered to be equivalent to the mind of the Buddha", since it is synonymous with perfect enlightenment (saṃbodhi).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Buddhism "dharma-kaya", Oxford University Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The teaching of a "Buddha nature" (Skt. ''tathāgatagarbha'') may be based on the "[[luminous mind]]" concept found in the ''[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]''. The essential idea, articulated in the Buddha nature sūtras, but not accepted by all Mahāyānists, is that no being is without a concealed but indestructible interior link to the awakening of ''[[bodhi]]'' and that this link is an uncreated element (''dhātu'') or principle deep inside each being, which constitutes the deathless, diamond-like "essence of the self".&lt;ref&gt;''Nirvāṇa Sūtra''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2014}} The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' states: "The essence of the Self (''ātman'') is the subtle Buddha nature..." while the later ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' states that the Buddha nature might be taken to be self (''ātman''), but it is not. In the ''sagathakam'' section of that same sutra, however, the Tathagatagarbha as the Self is not denied, but affirmed: "The ''Atma'' [Self] characterised with purity is the state of self-realization; this is the Tathagata's Womb (''garbha''), which does not belong to the realm of the theorisers."&lt;ref&gt;Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, ''The Lankavatara Sutra'', Prajna Press, Boulder, 1978, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddha nature class of sūtras, the word "self" (''ātman'') is used in a way defined by and specific to these sūtras. (See [[Atman (Buddhism)]].)

[[File:Descent of Amida and 25 Bodhisattvas (Fukushima Museum).jpg|thumb|150px|''Descent of [[Amitābha|Amida]] and 25 [[Bodhisattva]]s'', [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333), [[Fukushima Museum]], [[Japan]]]]

According to some scholars, the Buddha nature discussed in some Mahāyāna sūtras does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''); rather, it is a positive language and expression of [[Shunyata|emptiness]] (''śūnyatā'') and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073728/http://zencomp.com/greatwisdom/ebud/ebdha191.htm Heng-Ching Shih, ''The Significance Of "Tathagatagarbha"—A Positive Expression Of "Sunyata".'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is the "[[true self]]" in representing the innate aspect of the individual that makes actualizing the ultimate personality possible.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The actual "seeing and knowing" of this Buddha essence is said to usher in nirvanic liberation. This Buddha essence or "Buddha nature" is stated to be found in every single person, ghost, god and sentient being. In the Buddha nature sūtras, the Buddha is portrayed as describing the Buddha essence as uncreated, deathless and ultimately beyond rational grasping or conceptualisation. Yet, it is this already real and present, hidden internal element of [[bodhi|awakeness]] (''bodhi'') that, according to the Buddha nature sūtras, prompts beings to seek liberation from worldly suffering, and lets them attain the spotless bliss that lies at the heart of their being. Once the veils of negative thoughts, feelings, and unwholesome behaviour (the ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|kleśas]]'') are eliminated from the mind and character, the indwelling Buddha principle (''Buddha-dhātu'': Buddha nature) can shine forth unimpededly and transform the seer into a Buddha.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Prior to the period of these sūtras, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] was dominated by teachings on [[Shunyata|emptiness]], in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] and on the mysterious reality of nirvana using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sūtras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary that described a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;King, Sallie B. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha-Nature is impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-179. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view is propounded by Tathagatagarbha specialist,  Michael Zimmermann, who sees key Buddha-nature sutras such as the ''Nirvana Sutra'' and the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutra'', as well as the ''Lankavatara Sutra'', enunciating an affirmative vision of an eternal, indestructible Buddhic Self. Zimmermann observes:&lt;ref name="Professor Michael Zimmermann 2002 pp. 82"/&gt;

{{quote|the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the ''TGS'' [''Tathagatagarbha Sutra''] ... the ''Mahaparinirvanasutra'' and the ''Lankavatarasutra'' characterize the ''tathagatagarbha'' explicitly as ''atman'' [Self].}}

The ''[[Uttaratantra]]'' (an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] treatise on [[Buddha nature]]) sees Buddha nature not as [[samskrta|caused and conditioned]] (''saṃskṛta''), but as eternal, uncaused, unconditioned, and incapable of being destroyed, although temporarily concealed within worldly beings by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; According to C. D. Sebastian, the ''Uttaratantra's'' reference to a transcendental self (''[[Ātman (Buddhism)|ātma]]-[[paramita|pāramitā]]'') should be understood as "the unique essence of the universe",&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 151; cf. also p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; thus the universal and [[immanent]] essence of Buddha nature is the same throughout time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian,  C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptures==

===Āgamas===

{{Main|Mahayana sutras}}
Mahāyāna Buddhism takes the basic teachings of the Buddha as recorded in early scriptures as the starting point of its teachings, such as those concerning karma and rebirth, [[Anatman|anātman]], [[Shunyata|emptiness]], [[dependent origination]], and the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Mahāyāna Buddhists in East Asia have traditionally studied these teachings in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]. "Āgama" is the term used by those traditional Buddhist schools in India who employed Sanskrit for their basic canon. These correspond to the [[Nikāya]]s used by the Theravāda school. The surviving Āgamas in Chinese translation belong to at least two schools, while most of the Āgamas teachings were never translated into Tibetan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In addition to accepting the essential scriptures of the [[early Buddhist schools]] as valid, Mahāyāna Buddhism maintains large collections of sūtras that are not used or recognized by the Theravāda school. These were not recognized by some individuals in the early Buddhist schools. In other cases, Buddhist communities were divided along these doctrinal lines. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] are often given greater authority than the Āgamas. The first of these Mahāyāna-specific writings were written probably around the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 252"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993). ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Buddhism 2004, page 293"&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work ''Abhidharmasamuccaya'', [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] refers to the collection which contains the āgamas as the ''Śrāvakapiṭaka'' and associates it with the [[sravaka|śrāvaka]]s and [[pratyekabuddha]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Asaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the ''Bodhisattvapiṭaka'', which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"/&gt;

===Turnings of the Dharma Wheel===

Dating back at least to the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' is a classification of the corpus of Buddhism into three categories, based on ways of understanding the nature of reality, known as the "[[three turnings of the wheel of dharma|Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel]]". According to this view, there were three such "turnings":&lt;ref name=Kitagawa80&gt;[[Joseph Kitagawa|Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo]] (2002). ''The Religious Traditions of Asia: Religion, History, and Culture''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7007-1762-5}}: p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

#In the first turning, the Buddha taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] at [[Varanasi]] for those in the [[shravaka|śravaka]] vehicle. It is described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana&gt;Keenan, John (2000). ''The Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning''. Numata Center. {{ISBN|1-886439-10-9}}: p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrines of the first turning are exemplified in the ''[[Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta|Dharmacakra Pravartana Sūtra]]''. This turning represents the earliest phase of the Buddhist teachings and the earliest period in the history of Buddhism.
#In the second turning, the Buddha taught the Mahāyāna teachings to the bodhisattvas, teaching that all phenomena have no-essence, no arising, no passing away, are originally quiescent, and essentially in cessation. This turning is also described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; Doctrine of the second turning is established in the Prajñāpāramitā teachings, first put into writing around 100 BCE. In Indian philosophical schools, it is exemplified by the Mādhyamaka school of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].
#In the third turning, the Buddha taught similar teachings to the second turning, but for everyone in the three vehicles, including all the śravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These were meant to be completely explicit teachings in their entire detail, for which interpretations would not be necessary, and controversy would not occur.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; These teachings were established by the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'' as early as the 1st or 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name="Powers_1993"&gt;{{Citation |last=Powers |first=John |year=1993 |title=Hermeneutics and tradition in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |pages=4–11 |isbn=90-04-09826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian philosophical schools, the third turning is exemplified by the Yogācāra school of Asaṅga and [[Vasubandhu]].

Some traditions of Tibetan Buddhism consider the teachings of Esoteric Buddhism and Vajrayāna to be the third turning of the Dharma Wheel. Tibetan teachers, particularly of the [[Gelug]]pa school, regard the second turning as the highest teaching, because of their particular interpretation of Yogācāra doctrine. The [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha Nature]] teachings are normally included in the third turning of the wheel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Chinese tradition has a different scheme.

The Chinese T'ien-T'ai believed the Buddha taught over Five Periods. These are:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Flower Garland Period.
# The Agama Period.
# The Correct and Equal Period (provisional Mahayana Sutras, including the Amida, Mahavairochana and Vimalakirti Sutras).
# The Wisdom Period (Perfection of Wisdom Sutras).
# The Lotus and Nirvana Period (when Shakyamuni taught from the standpoint of his Enlightenment).

===Early canon===
Scholars have noted that many key Mahāyāna ideas are closely connected to the earliest texts of Buddhism. The seminal work of Mahāyāna philosophy, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'', mentions the canon's ''Katyāyana Sūtra'' (SA 301) by name, and may be an extended commentary on that work.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna systematized the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school of Mahāyāna philosophy. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the canon. In his eyes the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna also referred to a passage in the canon regarding "[[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]]" in two different works.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 322. Lindtner says that Nāgārjuna is referencing the DN.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], the other prominent Mahāyāna school in dialectic with the Mādhyamaka school, gave a special significance to the canon's ''Lesser Discourse on Emptiness'' (MA 190).&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage there (which the discourse itself emphasizes) is often quoted in later Yogācāra texts as a true definition of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the thought presented in the Yogācāra school's ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' is undeniably closer to that of the Pali [[Nikayas]] than is that of the Theravadin [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, page 44, note 5. Lusthaus draws attention to Rahula's ''Zen and the Taming of the Bull.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Mādhyamikas and the Yogācārins saw themselves as preserving the Buddhist Middle Way between the extremes of nihilism (everything as unreal) and substantialism (substantial entities existing). The Yogācārins criticized the Mādhyamikas for tending towards nihilism, while the Mādhyamikas criticized the Yogācārins for tending towards substantialism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key Mahāyāna texts introducing the concepts of [[bodhicitta]] and [[Buddha nature]] also use language parallel to passages in the canon containing the Buddha's description of "[[luminous mind]]" and appear to have evolved from this idea. &lt;ref&gt;Analayo "The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses" Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, 2017, 13: 10-51;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1989).Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha. In Werner, Karel ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press: p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravāda school==
{{Main|Theravada}}

===Role of the Bodhisattva===
In the early Buddhist texts, and as taught by the modern Theravada school, the goal of becoming a teaching Buddha in a future life is viewed as the aim of a small group of individuals striving to benefit future generations after the current Buddha's teachings have been lost, but in the current age there is no need for most practitioners to aspire to this goal. Theravada texts do, however, hold that this is a more perfectly virtuous goal.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (2000). ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics''. Cambridge University Press: p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in [[Thailand]] are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cholvijarn observes that prominent figures associated with the [[Dhammakaya Movement|Self perspective]] in Thailand have often been famous outside scholarly circles as well, among the wider populace, as Buddhist meditation masters and sources of miracles and sacred [[amulet]]s. Like perhaps some of the early Mahāyāna forest hermit monks, or the later Buddhist Tantrics, they have become people of power through their meditative achievements. They are widely revered, worshipped, and held to be arhats or (note!) bodhisattvas.}}

===Theravāda and Hīnayāna===
In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] describes the concurrent existence of the [[Mahavihara|Mahāvihara]] and the [[Abhayagiri Dagaba|Abhayagiri]] Vihara in [[Sri Lanka]]. He refers to the monks of the Mahāvihara as the "Hīnayāna Sthaviras" (''Theras''), and the monks of the Abhayagiri Vihara as the "Mahāyāna Sthaviras".&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang further writes:&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul.

The modern Theravāda school is usually described as belonging to Hīnayāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monier-Williams |first=Sir Monier |year=1889 |title=Buddhism in Its Connexion with Brāhmanism and Hindūism: And in Its Contrast with Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhism&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=ykWVSNfIPIbujgGgrbXqAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhism&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gombrich&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis (1988).

''The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions'': P.83&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that it should not be considered such from the Mahāyāna perspective. Their view is based on a different understanding of the concept of Hīnayāna. Rather than regarding the term as referring to any school of Buddhism that hasn't accepted the Mahāyāna canon and doctrines, such as those pertaining to the role of the bodhisattva,&lt;ref name=gombrich/&gt;&lt;ref name=gellner/&gt; these authors argue that the classification of a school as "Hīnayāna" should be crucially dependent on the adherence to a specific [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] position. They point out that unlike the now-extinct [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school, which was the primary object of Mahāyāna criticism, the Theravāda does not claim the existence of independent [[Dharma#In Buddhist phenomenology|entities]] (''dharmas''); in this it maintains the attitude of early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Frank J. and Mahinda, Deegalle (1996). ''Pali Buddhism.'' Routledge Press: p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999). ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought.'' Edinburgh University Press: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika, Nyaponika Thera, Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi (1998). ''Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time.'' Wisdom Publications: p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Mahāyāna Buddhism disagreed with the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]], and in emphasizing the doctrine of [[sunyata|emptiness]], Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikas (and other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravāda arguments are preserved in the ''[[Kathavatthu|Kathāvatthu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary Theravādin figures have indicated a sympathetic stance toward the Mahāyāna philosophy found in texts such as the ''[[Heart Sutra|Heart Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya'') and Nāgārjuna's ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Fundamental Stanzas on the Middle Way]]'' (Skt. ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. and Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel (2006). ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel.''

'''Cal Henrik Max Magnus Norman''' (born July 30, 1973) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[artist]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[sculpture|sculptor]].

Norman was born in [[Sundsvall]], [[Medelpad]], he currently resides in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmlund |first=Susanne |coauthors= |title=Sundsvallskonstnärer gör affischer |work= |pages= |language=Swedish |publisher=Sundsvalls Tidning |date=2006-11-03 |url=http://www.st.nu/nyheter/lokalt.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=596555 |accessdate=2009-01-30 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fredriksson |first=Johanna |coauthors= |title=Kulturfakta om Sundsvall |work= |pages= |language=Swedish |publisher=Sundsvalls Tidning |date=2007-08-04 |url=http://www.st.nu/noje/index.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=660897 |accessdate=2009-01-30 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paints [[Vision (religion)|vision]]s and dreamlike images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmlund |first=Susanne |coauthors= |title=Modernt och historiskt möts i Röklandsgården |work= |pages= |language=Swedish |publisher=Sundsvalls Tidning |date=2008-07-01 |url=http://www.st.nu/noje/kultur.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=742250 |accessdate=2009-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702004943/http://www.st.nu/noje/kultur.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=742250 |archivedate=July 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as accurately as possible, which results in paintings with a [[photorealistic]] quality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} His works are intended to spread virally among social networks on the Internet; his art and stunts often deal with everyday events spiced up with a touch of the absurd.

A few examples of such works created for the Internet are the illustrated essay "[http://maxmagnusnorman.com/artist_blog/art_day_171.shtml The LED (minor) Artcrime Tutorial]" and the ''[http://maxmagnusnorman.com/artist_blog/art_day_188.shtml Moose graffiti]'' stunt, where the artist sneaks up on a wild moose and paints graffiti on it. His sculpture and plastic arts projects have received some exposure in Sweden, such as his art project that consisted of a woodpecker placed on a traffic camera on the [[European route E4|E4]] near [[Stockvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Östberg |first=Anita |coauthors= |title=Hacke hackspett - i stället för rondellhund |work= |pages= |language=Swedish |publisher=Sundsvalls Tidning |date=2007-09-25 |url=http://www.st.nu/nyheter/lokalt.php?action=visa_artikel&amp;id=672748 |accessdate=2009-01-30 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In another of Max Magnus Norman's art projects the artist created an unknown (but huge) number of plastic monkeys, about 1 metres in length. One night in early May 2009 he put up these monkeys in different settings all over the small city Sundsvall. One monkey was riding a crocodile in the middle of the central stream Selångersån and one was placed upon a traffic light making it look like the monkey controlled the traffic, some monkeys were even placed under water. A few of these monkeys still remain, amongst other one flying 20 metres up in the air, holding a beer can above the intersection Köpmangatan-Thulegatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Unreferenced|date=October 2012}}
In [[philosophy]], the term "'''means to an end'''" refers to any action (the [[Means (philosophy)|means]]) carried out for the sole purpose of achieving something else (an [[End-in-itself|end]]). It can be thought of as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] distinction as no [[Empiricism|empirical]] information differentiates actions that are means to ends from those that are not—that are "ends in themselves". It has been inferred that all actions are means to other ends—this is relevant when considering the [[meaning of life]].

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s theory of [[morality]], the [[categorical imperative]], states that it is immoral to use another person merely as a means to an end and that people must—under all circumstances—be treated as ends in themselves. This is in contrast to some interpretations of the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view, which allow for use of individuals as means to benefit the many.

== Idiom ==
A means to an end is also an [[idiom]]. It often refers to an activity (such as an undesirable job) that is not as important as the goal you hope to achieve (monetary gains for example). For example, Sam does not have any professional ambitions. For her, work is just a means to an end. One starts something and finishes it, without that something leading into something else, thus it is an end in itself.

Professor '''Mohammed Arkoun''' ({{Lang-kab|Muḥemmed Arkun}}; {{lang-ar|محمد أركون}}; 1 February 1928 – 14 September 2010) was an [[Algeria]]n scholar and thinker. He was considered to have been one of the most influential secular scholars in [[Islam]]ic studies contributing to contemporary intellectual [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|Islamic reform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-478/_nr-262/_cmt-b03c7854f73d795c1485a51443e67b60/i.html Mohammed Arkoun:A Modern Critic of Islamic Reason]&lt;/ref&gt; In a career of more than 30 years, he had been a critic of the tensions embedded in his field of study, advocating Islamic [[modernism]], [[secularism]], and [[humanism]]. During his academic career, he wrote his numerous books mostly in French, and occasionally in English and Arabic. He appeared on numerous occasions on French TV and magazines, on [[Berbère Radio Télévision|Berbère Télévision]] speaking in [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], his mother tongue, and on [[Al Jazeera]] speaking in Arabic. 

==Academic career==
Arkoun was born in 1928 in Taourirt Mimoun, a Berber village in [[Kabylie|Great Kabylia]] in northern [[Algeria]]. His family were traditional religious and relatively poor. His father was a shopkeeper in Ain al-Arba'a, a wealthy French settlement in east of [[Oran]]. He attended primary school in his Berber-speaking home village until he was nine-years-old. As the eldest son, he was expected to learn his father’s trade, while continuing to attend primary school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=|title=Mohammed Arkoun|author=Günther, Ursula|version=3|via=Brill Online Reference Works|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27338|accessdate=June 21, 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the Faculty of Literature of the University of [[Algiers]] and at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] ([[Agrégation|agrégé]] in [[Arabic language]] and [[Arabic literature|Literature]], 1956 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1968). He established his academic reputation with his studies of the [[historian|history]] and philosophy of [[Ibn Miskawayh]]. As he began to consider how one might rethink Islam in the contemporary world, his questioning provided a counterpoint to the predominant interpretations of both the Muslim world and the non-Muslim West. As the editor of ''Arabica'', he broadened the journal's scope, and played a significant role in shaping Western-language scholarship on Islam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} He is the author of numerous books in French, English and Arabic, including most recently: ''Rethinking Islam'' ([[Boulder, Colorado]], 1994), ''L'immigration: défis et richesses'' (Paris, 1998) and ''The Unthought in Contemporary Islamic Thought'' (London, 2002).&lt;ref name="TIO20100917"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/1087/Passing-of-influential-professor-of-Islamic-Studies-leaves-a-gap-that-will-be-impossible-to-fill |title=Passing of influential professor of Islamic Studies leaves ‘a gap that will be impossible to fill’ |date=2010-09-17 |publisher=TheIsmaili.org |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His shorter studies have appeared in many academic journals and his works have been translated into several languages.

He was decorated as an Officer of the French [[Légion d'honneur]] in July 1996. In 2001, Professor Arkoun was asked to deliver the [[Gifford Lectures]], which enable a notable scholar to contribute to the advancement of [[theology|theological]] and philosophical thought and was announced as the recipient of the Seventeenth [[Georgio Levi Della Vida Award]] for his lifelong contribution to the field of Islamic Studies.

[[File:Bibliothèque_Mohammed-Arkoun,_Paris_6_July_2015.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Mohammed Arkoun Library, Paris]]
Arkoun taught at the [[Lumière University Lyon 2|Lyon 2 University]] (1969–1972), as a professor at the [[Paris 8 University]], and at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle|New Sorbonne University of Paris]] (1972–1992). He was a Fellow at [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin]] (1986–1987 and 1990) and at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], U.S.A (1992–1993), visiting professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1969), [[Princeton University]] (1985), [[Temple University]], the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, [[Wallonia]], Belgium, (1977–1979), the Pontifical Institute of Arabic Studies in [[Rome]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] (1991–1993) and served as a jury member for the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]]. At the time of his death he was [[Emeritus Professor]] at La Sorbonne as well as Senior Research Fellow and member of the Board of Governors of [[Institute of Ismaili Studies|The Institute of Ismaili Studies]] &lt;small&gt;[http://www.iis.ac.uk (IIS)]&lt;/small&gt;, At IIS, he has taught various graduate courses including unthought in contemporary Islamic thought, rethinking Islam, contemporary challenges of Muslim world and traditions for almost a decade.&lt;ref name="IIS20100916"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=111895 |title=In Memory of Professor Mohammed Arkoun |date=2010-09-16 |publisher=The Institute of Ismaili Studies |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkoun died on the evening of September 14, 2010, in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/4705.html |title=Death in Paris of Mohamed Arkoun |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919153708/http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/news/4705.html |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

Arkoun advocated a radical paradigm shift that would allow for the rethinking of Islam as a cultural and religious system and subvert ideological and dogmatic constructs with hegemonic claims. He was committed to contribute to an archaeology of the hidden, repressed, and marginalised elements of Islam, in order to uncover, and set free, what he called, 'the exhaustive tradition' of Islam. Most of his work is written in French rather than Arabic. In order to counter-act the philological and historical bias of traditional Islamic studies, he advocated what he called “applied Islamology”—following Roger Bastide’s concept of “applied anthropology.” Applied Islamology aims to establish a “disciplinary space between political and historical sciences” (Arkoun, The answers, 25), taking into consideration elements of the courte and longue durée, as well as contemporary social factors. Arkoun has developed an inclusive approach which seeks to deal with Islamic tradition in its entirety, including elements characterised by the representatives of orthodoxy (or official religion) as heterodox, and therefore marginalised and repressed. He has adopted a multifaceted and holistic approach which looks between traditional dogma and axioms. Arkoun’s critique of Islamic reason serves as the unifying theme, or leitmotif for the different concepts he elaborated over the course of time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Monique Canto-Sperber''' is a French philosopher. She was born on May 14, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puf.com/wiki/Auteur:Monique_Canto-Sperber Monique Canto-Sperber par elle-même], sur le site des [[Presses universitaires de France|PUF]].&lt;/ref&gt; Her works, translated in several languages, are focused on ethics and contemporary political issues. A former Director of the [[École normale supérieure (rue d'Ulm)|École normale supérieure]] from 2005 to 2012, she has been President of [[Paris Sciences et Lettres – Quartier latin]], a French higher education and research institution, since 2012.

==Biography==
Monique Canto-Sperber was born in [[French Algeria]] and has been living in France since 1964. An alumnus of the Ecole normale supérieure de jeunes filles, she is Agrégée and holds a PhD in philosophy.

After teaching at the universities of Rouen and Amiens, she became Research Director at the CNRS in 1993. Between 2001 and 2004, she was a member of the Comité consultatif national d'éthique and served as its President from 2004 to 2007.

She produces the radio programme "Questions d'éthique" on France Culture, broadcast every Monday evening.

She is officier de la Légion d'honneur&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iRO3khDjYask_HxdntRmVKSGZBqQ « Légion d'honneur : Bolloré, Varda, la mode et l'édition pour la promotion de Pâques »], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 11 avril 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020506686&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id Décret de promotion]&lt;/ref&gt; officier de l'ordre du Mérite et chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.

Her work in ancient philosophy is centred on ethical theory and epistemology; she has published several commented translations of Plato (Gorgias, Ion, Euthydème, Ménon) and various books. She has also taken an active part in the renewal of moral philosophy in France, with the creation in 1993 of a book collection by the Presses Universitaires de France.

==Direction of the ENS==
Monique Canto-Sperber has been the head of the Ecole normale supérieure since 2005 (renewed in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023126163&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id « Décret du 23 novembre 2010 portant nomination de la directrice de l'École normale supérieure (enseignements supérieurs) - Mme Canto-Sperber (Monique) »], ''Journal officiel de la République française'', No. 0273, 25 novembre 2010, p. 21030, texte No. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;). She has introduced the practice of scientific advisory committees in humanities and social sciences departments, created an International Council for Strategic Orientation, developed a specific ENS Diploma and started a rehabilitation of research spaces.

She has also encouraged the projection of the Ecole normale supérieure as an institution of research and higher education comparable to leading international research universities, rather than as a specific French creation. She has promoted the creation of a group of institutions called [[Paris Sciences et Lettres - Quartier latin]]. On February 2012, she was elected as the President of [[Paris Sciences et Lettres - Quartier latin]].

==Direction of PSL==

[[Paris Sciences et Lettres – Quartier latin]] (PSL) is a new research university, made of cooperative actions between the [[École normale supérieure]], the [[Collège de France]], [[ESPCI ParisTech]], [[Chimie ParisTech]], [[Paris Observatory]], [[Paris Dauphine University]] and the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]]. 
 
Paris Sciences et Lettres aims to rapidly become one of the world's outstanding universities with a strong international presence and a common citation policy for its publications (PSL Research University). PSL was chosen as an Excellence Initiative in July 2011 [[PSL*]] and was the beneficiary of a significant endowment.
 
The institutions which have founded PSL, recently joined by [[Mines ParisTech]] as well as the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], the Conservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique [[CNSAD]], the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs]], [[La Fémis]], the [[Lycée Henri-IV]], the [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Foundation]], the [[Louis-Bachelier Institute]] and the [[Rothschild Foundation (IBPC)]], enjoy a prestigious reputation. Each has an identity that PSL wishes to respect, in order to maintain the performances in teaching and research that form the basis of their excellence.
 
PSL brings together a range of institutions with diverse histories and strong identities, bound together by the practices and values shared by all its members: teaching through innovative and groundbreaking research. Thus, the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and [[Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale]], as transversal research organisms, have committed to PSL as founding members, and [[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control]] as an associate member.
 
Paris Sciences et Lettres endorses a shared institutional ambition, a research strategy that encompasses the whole spectrum of academic disciplines and a common teaching strategy through the awarding of PSL degrees and shared initiatives to promote and disseminate knowledge.
 
Heirs to the French meritocratic tradition, the institutions of PSL have come together to write a new chapter in their histories, in a shared commitment to continued renewal and a genuine spirit of openness.

==Philosophy==

===Ethics===
A specialist of ancient philosophy, Monique Canto-Sperber has worked on and translated dialogues of Plato. In her book, ''Greek Ethics'', Monique Canto-Sperber argues notably that the contemporary conception of Greek moral philosophy as essentially forms of eudemonism is an artefact and that contemporary debates only present a very partial view on the topic.

She has also played an important role in the introduction in France of contemporary debates in Anglo-American philosophy.

She has edited at the Presses Universitaires de France a ''Dictionnaire d'éthique et de philosophie morale'', with numerous French and international specialists, on major issues of moral philosophy.

===Political philosophy===
During the last 15 years, Monique Canto-Sperber has also written important works of political philosophy. In books such as ''Rules of Freedom'' or ''Does liberalism need to be saved?'', she offers an analysis of liberalism that attempt to give the notion a new legitimacy in progressive political thinking.

Recent books such as ''L'Idée de guerre juste'' and ''La Morale du monde'' offer her vision of international relations.

'''Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig''' ({{IPA-da|ˈneɡolajˀ ˈfʁæːˀðʁæɡ ˈsɛvəʁin ˈɡʁɔndvi}}; 8 September 1783 – 2 September 1872), most often referred to as '''N. F. S. Grundtvig''', was a [[Denmark|Danish]] pastor, author, poet, philosopher, historian, teacher and politician. He was one of the most influential people in Danish history, as his philosophy gave rise to a new form of nationalism in the last half of the 19th century. It was steeped in the national literature and supported by deep spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Grundtvig holds a unique position in the [[cultural history]] of his country. Grundtvig and his followers are credited with being very influential in the formulation of modern Danish national consciousness. He was active during the [[Danish Golden Age]],  but his style of writing and fields of reference are not immediately accessible to a foreigner, thus his international importance does not match that of his contemporaries [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Early life and education ==
[[File:N.F.S. Grundtvig (1831 painting).jpg|thumb|upright|N. F. S. Grundtvig (1831)]]
Called Frederik rather than Nikolaj by those close to him, N. F. S. Grundtvig was the son of a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor, Johan Ottosen Grundtvig (1734–1813). He was brought up in a very religious atmosphere, although his mother also had great respect for old Norse legends and traditions. He was schooled in the tradition of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but his faith in reason was also influenced by German [[romanticism]] and the ancient history of the [[Nordic countries]].{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 30–31}}

In 1791 he was sent to Thyregod in [[Southern Jutland|Sydjylland]] to live and study with pastor Laurids Svindt Feld (1750–1803).  He subsequently studied at the [[Aarhus Katedralskole]], the [[cathedral school]] of [[Aarhus]], from 1798 until graduation. He left for [[Copenhagen]] in 1800 to study theology and was accepted to the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1801.{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 20–25}}{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 33}}  At the close of his university life, Grundtvig began to study [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the [[Icelandic Sagas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Career ==
[[File:N. F. S. Grundtvig by Vilhelm Bissen - DSC07150.JPG|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Grundtvig by [[Vilhelm Bissen]] at [[Frederik's Church]]]]
In 1805 Grundtvig took a position as tutor in a house on the island of [[Langeland]]. The next three years he used his free time to study writers [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]],  and [[Fichte]].{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 31–32}}  In 1802 his cousin, the philosopher [[Henrich Steffens]], returned to [[Copenhagen]] full of the teaching of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].  His lectures and the early poetry of [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger|Adam Oehlenschläger]] opened Grundtvig's eyes to the new era in literature.{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 35}}  His first work, ''On the Songs in the Edda'', attracted no attention.

Returning to Copenhagen in 1808, Grundtvig achieved greater success with his ''Northern Mythology'', and again in 1809 with a long drama, ''The Fall of the Heroic Life in the North''.  Grundtvig boldly denounced the clergy of the city in his first sermon in 1810.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 33}}  When Grundtvig published the sermon three weeks later it offended the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities, and they demanded him punished.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 33}}{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 48}}

In 1810 Grundtvig underwent a religious crisis and converted to a strongly held [[Lutheranism]].  He retired to his father's country parish in Udby as his chaplain.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 33–36}}  His new-found conviction was expressed in his ''The First World Chronicle'' ({{lang|da|Kort Begreb af Verdens Krønike i Sammenhæng}}) of 1812, a presentation of European history in which he attempted to explain how belief in God has been viewed throughout human history and in which he criticized the ideology of many prominent Danes.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 39}}{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 115–117}}  It won him notoriety among his peers and cost him several friends, notably the historian [[Christian Molbech]].{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 115–117}}  Upon his father's death in 1813, Grundtvig applied to be his successor in the parish but was rejected.&lt;ref name=adlbio&gt;{{Citation

In the following years his rate of publication was staggering: aside from a continuing stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two more histories of the world (1814 and 1817); the long historical poem ''Roskilde-Riim'' (''Rhyme of Roskilde''; 1813); and a book-sized commentary, ''Roskilde Saga''.{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 125–133}}  From 1816 to 1819 he was editor of and almost sole contributor to a philosophical and polemical journal entitled ''Danne-Virke'', which also published poetry.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 39}}

From 1813 to 1815, he attempted to form a movement to support the [[Norwegians]] against the [[Swedish government]].  Later he preached on how the weakness of the Danish faith was the cause of the loss of [[Norway in 1814]].  His sermon was met by an enthusiastic congregation in Copenhagen.  Grundtvig withdrew from the pulpit because of lacking his own parish, and being barred by other churches.{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | pp = 55–57}}  In 1821 he resumed preaching briefly when granted the country living of [[Præstø]], and returned to the capital the year after.

[[File:GrundtvigByHansen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|N. F. S. Grundtvig by [[Constantin Hansen]]]]
In 1825 Grundtvig published a pamphlet, ''The Church's Rejoinder'' ({{lang|da|Kirkens Gienmæle}}), a response to [[Henrik Nicolai Clausen]]'s work on the doctrines, rites and constitutions of [[Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].  A professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen, Clausen argued that although the Bible was the principal foundation of Christianity, it was in itself an inadequate expression of its full meaning.  He described the church as a "community for the purpose of advancing general religiousness."{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 105}}  In his reply, Grundtvig denounced Clausen as an anti-Christian teacher and argued that Christianity was not a theory to be derived from the [[Holy Bible]] and elaborated by scholars.  He questioned the right of theologians to interpret the Bible.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 105–106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grundtvig was publicly prosecuted for libel and fined.  The [[Church of Denmark]] forbade him to preach for seven years.  During this time he published a collection of theological works, visited [[England]] three times (1829–31), and studied [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]].&lt;ref name=adlbio /&gt;

In 1832 Grundtvig obtained permission to again enter active ministry.  In 1839 he was called as pastor of the workhouse church of Vartov hospital in Copenhagen, a post he held until his death. Between 1837 and 1841 he published ''Sang-Værk til den Danske Kirke'' (Song Work for the Danish Church), a rich collection of sacred poetry; in 1838 he brought out a selection of early Scandinavian verse; in 1840 he edited the Anglo-Saxon poem "[[The Phoenix (Old English poem)|The Phoenix]]", with a Danish translation.  In 1843 he visited England for a fourth time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 1844 until after the [[First Schleswig War]], Grundtvig took a prominent part in politics, developing from a conservative into an absolute liberal.  In 1861 he received the titular rank of Bishop in the [[Church of Denmark]], but without a [[Episcopal see|see]]. He continued to write and publish until his death. He spoke from the pulpit at Vartov Church every Sunday until a few days before his death.  His preaching attracted large congregations, and he soon had a following. His hymn book effected a great change in Danish church services, substituting the [[hymn]]s of the national poets for the slow measures of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]s.  In all Grundtvig wrote or translated about 1500 hymns, including "[[God's Word Is Our Great Heritage]]" and "[[Det kimer nu til julefest]]".

== Christian thinking ==
Grundtvig's theological development continued over his lifetime, and took a number of important turns.  He moved from his "Christian awakening" of 1810 to believing in a congregational and sacramental Christianity in later years. He was most notable for the latter thinking. He always called himself a pastor, not a theologian, reflecting the distance between his ideas and academic theology. The chief characteristic of his [[theology]] was the substitution of the authority of the "living word" for the apostolic commentaries.  He desired to see each congregation act as a practically independent community.

== Thought on education ==
[[File:Grundtvig Vartov Copenhagen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Sculpture of Grundtvig in Vartov  (Grundtvigsk Forum)  by [[Niels Skovgaard]]]]

Grundtvig is the ideological father of the [[folk high school]], though his own ideas on education had another focus. He advocated reforming the ailing [[Sorø Academy]] into a popular school aiming at another form of higher education than what was common at the university. Rather than educating learned scholars, he believed the university should educate its students for active participation in society and popular life. Thus practical skills as well as national poetry and history should form an essential part of the instruction.  This idea came very close to implementation during the reign of King [[Christian VIII]], whose wife [[Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Caroline Amalie]] was an ardent supporter of Grundtvig.  The death of the monarch in 1848 and the dramatic political development in Denmark during this and the following years put an end to these plans.  However, by that time,  one of Grundtvig's supporters, [[Kristen Kold]], had already established the first folk high school.

Grundtvig's ambitions for school reform were not limited to the popular folk high school. He also dreamed of forming a Great Nordic University (the School for Passion) to be situated at the symbolic point of intersection between the three Scandinavian countries in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. The two pillars of his school program, the School for Life (folk high school) and the School for Passion (university) were aimed at quite different horizons of life. The popular education should mainly be taught within a national and patriotic horizon of understanding, yet always keeping an open mind towards a broader cultural and intercultural outlook, while the university should work from a strictly universal, i.e. humane and scientific, outlook.

The common denominator of all Grundtvig's [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] efforts was to promote a spirit of freedom, poetry and disciplined creativity, within all branches of educational life. He promoted values such as wisdom, compassion, identification and equality.  He opposed all compulsion, including exams, as deadening to the human soul.  Instead Grundtvig advocated unleashing human creativity according to the universally creative order of life. Only ''willing hands make light work''. Therefore, a spirit of freedom, cooperation and discovery was to be kindled in individuals, in science, and in the civil society as a whole.

== Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon literature ==
In 1815 [[Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin]] published the first edition of the {{Citation
  | title = Epic of [[Beowulf]]
}} titled {{Citation
  | title = De Danorum rebus gestis secul. III &amp; IV : Poëma Danicum dialecto Anglosaxonica
}} in a Latin translation.  Despite his lack of knowledge of [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], Grundtvig quickly discovered a number of flaws in Thorkelin's rendering of the poems.  After his heated debate with Thorkelin, Johan Bülow (1751–1828), who had sponsored Thorkelin's work, offered to support a new translation by Grundtvig — this time into Danish. The result, Bjovulfs Drape (1820), was the first modern language translation of Beowulf.

Grundtvig went on to explore the extensive literature of the Anglo-Saxons which survived in Old English and Latin.  In both poetry and prose, it revealed the spirituality of the early Church in [[Northern Europe]].  Grundtvig was very influenced by these ancient models of Christian and historical thought (notably the 8th-century Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', written in Latin).  Using the resources of the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] in Copenhagen and of the libraries at the universities of Exeter, Oxford and Cambridge in three successive summer visits to England (1829–31), he went on to make transcriptions of two of the four great codices of Anglo-Saxon poetry: the ''Exeter Book'' and the codex designated ''Junius 11'' in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford.  Although he thought to publish them, this project was never realized. ''Beowulf'' and Anglo-Saxon literature continued to be a major source of inspiration to Grundtvig.  It had a wide-ranging influence upon his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Marriage and family ==
Grundtvig was married three times, the last time in his seventy-sixth year. His first wife, Elisabeth Blicher (1787–1851), was a clergyman's daughter. They were married in 1818 and had three children. His second wife, Marie Toft (1813–54) was the daughter of a landowner. She died a few months after giving birth to a son. In 1858,  he married Asta Reedtz (1826–1890) of an old aristocratic Danish family. His son [[Svend Grundtvig]] (1824–83) collected and edited Danish ballads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Bibliography ==

=== Editions ===
No comprehensive foreign language edition of his work exists. A three-volume edition in German, however, is under preparation and projects for an English edition are in progress as well. Grundtvig's secular poetical works were published in a nine-volume edition, the first seven volumes by his second son, the philologist [[Svend Grundtvig]]. The philological practice of this work, however, is not up to the standards of modern philology. His hymns have been collected in the philologically more stable five-volume edition ''Grundtvigs Sang-Værk''.

The best overall collection of his writings is the 10 volume edition ''Grundtvigs udvalgte Skrifter'' edited by Holger Begtrup (1859–1937). His enormous oeuvre is presented in Steen Johansen: ''Bibliografi over N.F.S. Grundtvigs Skrifter'' (I-IV, 1948–54).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Paul K. Moser''' (born 1957 in [[Bismarck, North Dakota]]) is an American philosopher who writes on [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]. He is Professor of Philosophy at [[Loyola University Chicago]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/faculty/pmoser/ Home page]&lt;/ref&gt;  and past editor of the ''American Philosophical Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/apq.html American Philosophical Quarterly]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of many works in [[epistemology]] and the philosophy of religion, in which he has supported versions of epistemic foundationalism and volitional [[theism]]. His work brings these two positions together to support volitional evidentialism about theistic belief, in contrast to fideism and traditional natural theology. He draws from some epistemological and theological insights of the apostle Paul, Kierkegaard, P.T. Forsyth, H.R. Mackintosh, and H. H. Farmer,&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Farmer, The World and God. London: Nisbet, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; but he adds (i) a notion of purposively available evidence of God’s existence, (ii) a notion of authoritative evidence in contrast with spectator evidence, (iii) a notion of personifying evidence of God whereby some willing humans become salient evidence of God's existence, and (iv) a notion of convictional knowledge of divine reality. His most recent work emphasizes the importance of experiential foundational evidence from the self-manifestation of God's moral character to cooperative humans, particularly in moral conscience. An evidential role for experienced ''agapē'', along the lines of Romans 5:5, is central to his theistic epistemology, as is his view that God is self-authenticating or self-evidencing via self-manifestation and conviction toward unselfish love. One result is a distinctive approach to divine hiddenness and the evidence for God's reality and presence.

'''Paul Reps''' (15 September 1895 - 12 July 1990) was an American artist, poet, and author. He is best known for his unorthodox [[haiku]]-inspired [[poetry]] that was published from 1939 onwards. He is considered one of America's first haiku poets.

In association with his writing, Reps was also a well-received artist. Many of his books have artwork influenced by [[Zen]] Buddhism displayed in association with his writings.

Reps was widely travelled and spent a large amount of his time in [[Asia]]. In [[Japan]], his art was widely accepted and he often went there in association with the displays of his artwork in galleries and to reaffirm his [[Buddhist]] understanding.

In the later years of his life, Reps made his home on the island of [[Maui]] in [[Hawaii]]. In the two years before his death, he lived at the [[Haven Institute]] with his friends [[Jock McKeen]] and [[Bennet Wong]] {{Harv |McKeen|Wong|1991|}}.

He also wrote ''The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It'' and ''The Sin of Certainty: Why God Desires Our Trust More than Our 'Correct' Beliefs''.

==Biography==
Peter Enns was born in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], (January 2, 1961) to [[German American]] immigrant parents. He grew up in [[River Vale, New Jersey]] and graduated from [[Pascack Valley High School]] ([[Hillsdale, New Jersey]]) in 1978.  He holds a B.A. in [[behavioral science]] from [[Messiah College]] in [[Grantham, Pennsylvania]] (1982), an M.Div. from [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] (1989), and an M.A. (1993) and Ph.D. (1994) from [[Harvard University]] (Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Enns, "[http://peterennsonline.com/about/ About Peter Enns]" a time to tear down | A Time to Build Up&lt;/ref&gt;

Enns returned to [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in 1994 to begin his teaching career. He was tenured in 2000 and promoted to full professor in 2005 as a professor of Old Testament and Biblical hermeneutics. Among other duties, he served as Associate Academic Dean from 1998 to 2001, chair of the [[Hermeneutics]] (Ph.D.) Field Committee (1997-2000), and edited the ''[[Westminster Theological Journal]]'' (2000-2005).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Enns, "[http://peterennsonline.com/cv/ CV]" a time to tear down | A Time to Build Up&lt;/ref&gt; His publication of the book ''Inspiration and Incarnation'' led to loss of Enns's teaching position at Westminster Theological Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jesus Christ and the Life of the Mind |last=Noll |first=Mark  |year=2011 |publisher=Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids |page=132–133 |isbn=978-0-8028-7076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enns was a senior fellow of Biblical studies with the [[BioLogos Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://biologos.org/about/team/pete-enns/ About Peter Enns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717164734/http://biologos.org/about/team/pete-enns |date=2010-07-17 }}", The BioLogos Forum&lt;/ref&gt; a Christian organization that "explores, promotes, and celebrates the integration of science and Christian faith".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://biologos.org/about/ About BioLogos]" The BioLogos Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote nearly 100 blog posts at the BioLogos Forum, "[http://biologos.org/blog/ Science and the Sacred]." He also has written several pieces for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'''s religion section.

Enns is a member of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] and has served on the Wisdom in Israel and Cognate Literature Session steering committee since 2006. He is also a member of the [[Institute for Biblical Research]], where he served on the board of directors from 2004 to 2007 and the editorial board for the ''[[Bulletin for Biblical Research]]'' from 2002 to 2004.

Enns is the Abram S. Clemens professor of biblical studies at Eastern University ([[St. Davids, Pennsylvania]])

Enns is married to Susan (1984) and has three children, Erich (1987), Elizabeth (1990), and Sophia (1993).

==Academic work==

Enns's academic interests include [[Old Testament]] [[theology]], [[Biblical Theology]], [[Wisdom Literature]] (especially [[Ecclesiastes]]), the [[New Testament]] use of the Old Testament, [[Second Temple]] literature, and the general issue of how the historical context of the Bible affects how the nature of Scripture is understood within [[Ca!vinism|Reformed tradition]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Enns, "[http://peterennsonline.com/about/ About Peter Enns]", A Time to Tear Down - A Time to Build Up.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written many articles, essays, dictionary and encyclopedia entries, and book reviews on varied topics surrounding the Old Testament and its interpretation (see "Books" and "Articles and Essays" below). His 2008 edited volume (with [[Tremper Longman III]]), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry, and Writings'' (IVP), won the ''[[Christianity Today]]'' “Award of Merit” for 2009&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/february/10.26.html?start=2 2009 Christianity Today Book Awards]" Christianity Today Magazine Online&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Evangelical Christian Publishers Association]]’s “2009 Christian Book of the Year” award in the Bible Reference and Study category.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ecpa.org/christianbookawards/winners2009.php 2009 Christian Book Awards Winners]" Evangelical Christian Publishers Association.&lt;/ref&gt; His 2012 publication, ''The Evolution of Adam: What the Bible Does and Doesn't Say about Human origins'', won the gold award in the Religion category of the 2012 ForeWord Reviews Book of the Year Awards. 
Enns has also contributed to a Bible curriculum for grades 1-12 ''Telling God's Story'', and a book on the hermeneutical implications of the discussion between [[Christianity]] and [[evolution]],  He has also taught courses at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], [[Harvard University]], [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], [[Eastern University (United States)|Eastern University]], and [[Biblical Theological Seminary]].

==''Inspiration and Incarnation''==
Enns garnered significant attention for his 2005 book ''Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament''. His stated purpose for writing the book is “to bring an evangelical doctrine of Scripture into conversation with the implications generated by some important themes in modern biblical scholarship—particularly the Old Testament—over the past 150 years”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament |last=Peter |first=Enns  |year=2005 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids |page=13 |isbn=0-8010-2730-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enns’s primary audience is those readers who find it difficult to maintain their faith in God because “familiar and conventional” evangelical approaches often mishandle the challenges raised by modern biblical scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Enns 2005, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Enns writes that evangelicals commonly take a defensive posture to new ideas, and that such defenses are “exercises in special pleading, attempts to hold on to comfortable idea despite evidence that makes such ideas problematic. It is precisely the ineffectiveness of certain ways of thinking about the Bible that can sometimes cause significant cognitive dissonance for Christians who love and want to hold on to their Bible, but who also feel the weight of certain kinds of evidence”.&lt;ref name="Enns 2005, p. 15"&gt;Enns 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enns looks at three issues raised in modern biblical scholarship that he feels are mishandled by Evangelicals: (1) the strong similarities between the Old Testament and the literature of other ancient societies; (2), theological diversity among the Old Testament authors; (3) how New Testament writers interpreted the Old Testament in inventive ways that reflect Jewish practices of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Enns 2005, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all three cases, the Bible behaves in ways that don’t seem very “inspired,” but rather very “human.” Enns argues for an “incarnational” understanding of the Bible as a way to take seriously these types of challenges. This model draws an analogy between Jesus and the Bible: “In the same way that Jesus is—''must be''—both God and human, the Bible is also a divine and human book”.&lt;ref&gt;Enns 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible is not “an abstract, otherworldly book, dropped out of heaven. It was connected to and therefore spoke to those ancient cultures….precisely because Christianity is a historical religion, God’s word reflects the various historical moments in which Scripture was written”.&lt;ref&gt;Enns 2005, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Enns feels that the problems raised by the “human dimension” of the Bible for many evangelicals “has less to do with the Bible itself and more to do with our own preconceptions” of how the Bible “ought” to be.&lt;ref name="Enns 2005, p. 15"/&gt; Enns advocates an incarnational model to help evangelicals reorient their expectations of Scripture and so come to peace with new developments in their understanding of the Bible.

''Inspiration and Incarnation'' has been endorsed by such notable scholars as [[Hugh G. M. Williamson]], [[Bill T. Arnold]], [[David W. Baker]], [[Tremper Longman III]], [[Joel B. Green|Joel Green]] and others for its creative approach to solving the modern problem of the Bible. While commending the book, Bruce Waltke also expressed serious disagreement with Enns' views on [[biblical inerrancy]].  It has also met with criticism by [[D. A. Carson]], [[Paul Helm]], and [[Gregory Beale|G. K. Beale]], who claim it abandons the traditional evangelical doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]].

Baker Books released the 10th-anniversary edition of ''Inspiration and Incarnation'' in the summer of 2015, which includes an essay on the reception and continued impact of the book.

==Suspension from Westminster Theological Seminary==
Enns's book, ''Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament'', proved controversial at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] (WTS). WTS President [[Peter Lillback]] expressed that it "has caught the attention of the world so that we have scholars that love this book, and scholars who have criticized it very deeply…. We have students who have read it say it has liberated them. We have other students that say it's crushing their faith and removing them from their hope. We have churches that are considering it, and two Presbyteries have said they will not send students to study under Professor Enns here."&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/aprilweb-only/114-24.0.html |journal=Christianity Today |title=Westminster Theological Suspension |author=Sarah Pulliam |date=4/01/2008 |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general content of ''Inspiration and Incarnation'' was taught by Enns over his fourteen-year teaching career at Westminster Theological Seminary. It was only after the book’s publication in 2005 that a lengthy controversy ensued in the wake of major administrative changes, most notably the election of Peter Lillback as president in 2005. The main point of contention was whether the book was within the theological boundaries of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]]. Westminster faculty members take an oath that their teaching will be in line with that confession.

Lillback initiated a series of regular faculty meetings ("Faculty Theology Fellowship") to discuss Enns and his book. Those meetings, moderated by Lillback, took place over a two-year period and led to the preparation of two written reports, at Lillback's direction, to aid the faculty in determining whether or not Enns was in violation of his oath. (Although Westminster has had a Board of Trustees for some time, it has historically been governed by its faculty, particularly in theological matters.) These reports were written by the two field committees: the Historical and Theological Field Committee, composed of faculty members generally opposed to Enns's book, and the Hermeneutics Field Committee, composed of members generally favorable towards Enns's ideas.  After both committees reported their findings in the form of written reports, as well as written response by each committee to the other's report, faculty members William Edgar and Michael Kelly prepared a motion (known as the Edgar-Kelly Motion) declaring that Enns's writing and teaching were within the bounds of his faculty oath. All official documents used in these faculty debates, including both field committee reports and the Edgar-Kelly Motion, can be downloaded from the Westminster Theological Seminary web site here [http://www.wts.edu/about/beliefs/statements/theological_discussion_documen.html]. The motion was approved by the faculty, 12-8, in December 2007. Despite the work of these committees and the resulting faculty vote, President Lillback referred the matter immediately to the Board of Trustees.

On March 26, 2008, the Board of Trustees at Westminster Theological Seminary voted 18–9 to suspend Enns from his position effective May 23, 2008.&lt;ref name="Board March"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wts.edu/stayinformed/view.html?id=104  |publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary |title=A Message from the Board of Trustees |date=March 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the faculty voted 12–8 that the work falls within the parameters of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]],&lt;ref name="Board March"/&gt; the chairman of the Board said that a majority of the members on the Board at that time felt the book was incompatible with the Confession.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;  As of August 1, 2008, Enns and the seminary agreed to part ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wts.edu/stayinformed/view.html?id=187 |title=Joint Statement by WTS and Professor Enns |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Board's vote, nine trustees resigned from the board.

Polina was born in Grozny, USSR, and began keeping her diary when she was 9 years old, at the start of the [[First Chechen War]]. She was still living in Grozny when the [[Second Chechen War]] began. On October 21, 1999, the market in Grozny where she was helping her mother sell newspapers was shelled, and Polina was moderately wounded.

She has always offered publishing rights for translations of all of her books by herself, without the use of services of literary agents.

==Biography==
She came from a family of [[Don Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krugozormagazine.com/show/Chechnya.1855.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polina Zherebtsova.jpg|thumbnail|Polina Zherebtsova, Moscow 2011]]
Polina's father was a lawyer, who died when Polina was a child. Her mother, Elena, worked as a senior goods manager at a large company. She devoted her spare time to her daughter's education.
Polina grew in a family that equally revered books like the [[Torah]], the Bible and the [[Koran]]. Since childhood, she had studied religion, history, and philosophy.

Polina Zherebtsova was born in 1985 in Grozny and lived there for almost twenty years. She considers herself a cosmopolitan as she has multi-national ancestry. Polina's father died when she was very young. Polina's maternal grandfather Zherebtsov Anatoly Pavlovich, with whom she had formed a friendship, worked in Grozny for more than 25 years as a TV journalist-cameraman. Polina's maternal grandmother was a professional artist. Paternal grandfather was an actor and musician. Polina's paternal grandmother was a professional actress.

In 1994, Polina started keeping a diary in which she recorded what was happening around her. Her diaries cover her childhood, adolescence and youth that witnessed three Chechen wars. School, first love, quarrels with parents, what is familiar to any teenager, side by side in the life of Polina with the bombing, starvation, devastation and poverty.
On October 21, 1999 she was wounded by shrapnel during a missile attack on Grozny Central Market. 

Since 2002, she has begun to work as a journalist. In 2003–2004, she studied at the School of Correspondents.

In 2004, Chechen diary was completed when the author was 19 years old.

In 2006, she has been awarded the Janusz Korczak international prize in Jerusalem in two categories (narrative and documentary prose). Competition theme was "terror and children."

Since 2007, she has been a member of the Russian Union of Journalists.

In 2010, she graduated from the Stavropol North Caucasus University with a degree in General Psychology.

In 2011, "Polina Zherebtsova's Journal: Chechnya 1999–2002" was published.

Since 2012, she has been a member of PEN International.

In 2012, she was awarded The Andrei Sakharov Award “For Journalism as an Act of Conscience”.

In 2013, she has received a political asylum in Finland. &lt;ref&gt;[http://neweasterneurope.eu/2018/07/10/forgetting-chechnya/ Forgetting Chechnya]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, "Ant in a Glass Jar" was published.

==First Chechen War==
The first military campaign started in 1994. At the beginning of the war, Zherebtsova's grandfather, Anatoly, was killed by shells from airplanes. Zherebtsova made the first serious entries in her diary at this time. She kept the diary to herself, and wrote about humorous and sad moments in the life of her neighbors and friends.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;  Because of the name of her grandfather's stepfather, Zherebtsov, Polina was subjected to repeated insults at school.

==Second Chechen War==
[[File:Фрагмент дневника Жеребцовой Полины..jpg|thumb|left|Diary of Polina Zherebtsova]]
In 1999 a new round of war in Grozny began in the [[North Caucasus]], when Polina was 14 years old, which she describes in her diary.

While helping her mother trade in the central market in Grozny after high school, Polina was wounded in her leg on October 21, 1999 when the [[marketplace]] was shelled, as described in a preliminary report "The indiscriminate use of force by federal troops during the armed conflict in Chechnya in September–October 1999".

Due to injury and illness Polina and her mother didn't have time to escape from the war. She faced hunger and eviction along with other neighbors in the "[[Ethnic cleansing|cleansing]]", as described in pages of the diary. Her main goal was to make people understand the need to avoid war, especially in the same country. The diary also says that before the conflict began in 1994 in the Republic, the relationship between Russian and Chechen peoples was relatively friendly.

In February 2000, five months after her injury, 14-year-old Polina was operated on by surgeons of the 9th Moscow hospital, removing the biggest piece of shrapnel of the 16 pieces.

She had to change schools five times in the city, as all were destroyed in turn during the war in Chechnya. In 2002, 17-year-old Polina entered ChPGI ([[Chechen State Pedagogical Institute]]). In 2004 she graduated from the school of reporters with honors.

Since 2003, she had worked as a staff member for the newspaper.

In 2005, Polina moved to [[Stavropol]]. In Stavropol she transferred to the North Caucasus [[State Technical University]], where she obtained her diploma for General Psychology in 2010.

In 2006, Polina was the winner of the international literary contest named after [[Janusz Korczak]] in two categories. In the same year, she wrote a letter to [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], asking for help with the publication of her diaries. Staff members of Solzhenitsyn's foundation helped Polina move to Moscow, but failed to publish the diaries.

Polina continues to publish in the Moscow magazine ''Banner'', the magazine ''Big City'', and the newspaper ''Free Word''.

In 2011, Polina published the book ''The Diary of Polina Zherebtsova'', which is about Chechnya.

'''LiveLib.ru''' LiveLib has included the book "Ant in a glass jar. Chechen diaries of 1994–2004" in a list "The 100 best books of all time" based on rating and voting results.

'''Library "Bestseller"''' has awarded the book with the first place in the project "With a book to peace and harmony", dedicated to the presentation of books about wartime.

==Emigration==
Because of threats which Polina reported she had begun to receive, by mail and phone from people representing themselves as "patriots of Russia", she left Russia in January 2012, taking [[political asylum]] in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.vdok.org/page.aspx?id=8066 Author of a book about Chechnya seeks asylum in Finland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017060404/http://news.vdok.org/page.aspx?id=8066 |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Threats were constantly set in the fact that I must stop writing on this subject if I want to live and if I don't want to have my family killed. It's unbearable to live in constant fear. I'm very worried about my family. We were able to go, and we asked for political asylum...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013 she was granted political asylum.

==Action==

Polina signs petition "[[Putin must go]]".

She wrote a [[Letter to Khodorkovsky|Letter]] to [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky|Khodorkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://halldor2.blogspot.fi/2013/12/letter-to-khodorkovsky.html  Letter to Khodorkovsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''.......'''

I was very sympathetic to you when you were in prison. I considered the sentences you were given unjust, political. Even now I think that you may have been subjected to pressure. But you in your interview you said: “Putin is no weakling. I am ready to fight in order to keep the North Caucasus as part of our country. This is our land, we conquered and won it!” Consider: now you will have to share responsibility for those war crimes, which in the Caucasus are not the costs of “conquest”, but its essence.

Read my diary.

Read how we were conquered.

How we buried our murdered neighbours under fire, having first covered the graves with branches so that the hungry dogs would not tear the bodies apart. How thousands of women and children were murdered in the Chechen Republic.

Do you still want integration with such a Russia?

I do not.

And I do not need her citizenship. I am embarrassed by it, like the shameful brand-mark on a slave.

== Reviews ==

"''Agonizing Zherebtsova's storytelling already caused a comparison to her predecessors – [[Anne Frank]], who kept a diary during the Second World War, and Zlata Filipovic, whose diary tells about the war in Bosnia. Publishers highly valued the diary, however, for a long time, one after another, they refused to print it, being "loyal to the government of modern Russia.''-"

'''Alissa de Carbonne''', "[[Reuters]]", United Kingdom.

Polina Zherebtsova was 14 when the bombs started raining down. They hit the market where she worked with her mother, the streets she walked down daily, until Grozny was reduced to rubble, a hometown no longer recognisable. From the start, Zherebtsova wrote about it, an act of catharsis as much as a document on the second Chechnya war. She filled dozens of diaries in a messy, scribbled cursive, sometimes embellished with doodles – bomb blasts that look like flowers, blocks of flats seen from a distance.

'''Miriam Elder, journalist, correspondent of [[The Guardian]]'''

The girl born in 1985 in the Soviet Union, sees herself not Russian or Chechen, but a citizen of the world. Her homeland is on the pages of books, written in Russian. But in war-torn Grozny, the word "Russian" is a stigma. Russians are "guilty" of everything around, although they themselves are a suffering party.
Because of the Russian name girl is beaten by peers at school in each of the five schools that she had a chance to study in. Over the years, Polina learned to fight to defend her dignity. In the book, a lot of the episodes show that courage and perseverance inspire respect, but cowards do not survive. Enemies are always challenging and eyeing for how the victim will behave: break or hold out.
In Russia, where the mother and daughter Zherebtsova get at the end of the book, they are considered "Chechen women", and they are again disenfranchised outcasts. Polina has repeatedly reiterated that she is a person of the world as her lineage intertwined many bloodlines. The concept of "personality" for her means more than "a representative of some nation", and “cultural identity” more than “national."

'''Alice Orlova, Miloserdie.ru'''

These sheets from children's notebook are valuable: as evidence of surprising strength of the terrible events of the previous days, as the story of a person that existed inside a history textbook, as a document depicting the ruthless picture by a ruthless eye of a child, as a miraculously survived note of a contemporary. But it is also an extremely talented and thoughtful narration, in which are intertwined stories of growing up, love and death. You can say that this is: "a document of the era", "adventure novel","war prose", a "drama of growing up", "a love saga" ... But all these definitions are not accurate, these pages are about: the value of individual human life above any geopolitical considerations, national differences and global concepts, and the love and the will to live is stronger than a call of blood and explosions of shells.

'''Philip Dzyadko, editor of "Big City" magazine.'''

The case of the war diaries is exceptional because among confusion in the news, reticence, and many conflicting assessments, just observations of ordinary people, who by the will of fate have become hostages of the war, can give an accurate picture of what is happening. One example of such literature now is the Chechen diary of Polina, the issue of which was a notable event. The book is a real diary that Grozny's resident Polina Zherebtsova kept as a teenager in 1999–2002, at the height of the second Chechen war. Some fragments of the diary were published earlier (in particular, for those Polina won a literary prize in Jerusalem named after Janusz Korczak in 2006), but to publish the entire book she managed not at once since no publishing house take the responsibility to publish "the truth about Chechnya".

'''Lydia Chesed, a critic. “Location – the war.”, magazines.russ.ru'''

This book can be quoted from any place and in any order. And everything will be an endless terror. Perhaps you can rashly decide that reading is the only way to get people to reject war forever. Polina kept Chechen diaries from 1994 to 2004: 10 years of fire, death, hunger, cold, diseases, humiliations, lies, betrayals, sadism – all, that together is denoted by four letters: "hell."

'''Igor Zotov, www.kultpro.ru'''

Chechen diaries of Polina Zherebtsova are real documents of the era, without any quotes and winks, without the embarrassment for the lack of soft language, which is fully justified by the events that served as material for the diaries. The real document of the era, which also has real artistic value. So it is definitely worth reading.

'''Elena Makeyenko, Siburbia.ru, “Diary as a way to survive”'''

Diary of Polina Zherebtsova is valuable by the fact that it upsets the balance of the roles and calls for the voices of other characters: girls, women, old women, waiting for the death from young, strong Russian men in military uniforms. Polina called them "Germans" or "white" because how can she, born at the turn of the Soviet Union and growing up with the Soviet films, name enemies any different? Russians as "Germans", shooting in poor or old women or cackling over the girl who skedaddle from them on all fours – these paintings are not so easy to accept even for the most liberal and unblinkered consciousness, but it makes the effort of every reader to open "Diary" even more valuable.

'''Elena Rybakova, the correspondent of "Moscow News"'''

I read the diaries of Polina Zherebtsova in small portions, they simply cannot be read in bulk. And I am thinking about the following ...
It was also very difficult for us to live in the mid-nineties. Well, or so it seemed to us ...
Then one side demanded an immediate end to the war and the recognition of independence, while other side – fighting to the bitter end.
But what about those who have been there, in Chechnya, between the carpet bombing and sweeps from one side and stoned fanatics on the other  – those were rarely remembered by both sides. People were expendable.
Let's not call it the flowering of freedoms and human rights. Yes, we were beginning to travel abroad, to discover the world, to read a free press, to earn money. And beside us, in our country, people lived like that.
Do you think this all could pass without consequences? For free?
It seems that today a little more is talked about those who are now surviving and dying in the Donbass. A little more. But this will repeat itself over and over, I'm afraid, as long as we as a society, as a nation, as a country do not learn a simple truth: the defenceless people come first and foremost.

'''Andrew S Desnitsky, Russian Bible scholar, translator, essayist and writer. Doctor of Philology.'''

Polina Zherebtsova with her moral stance is much more convincing as a symbol of resistance to the fascist regime than Khodorkovsky and Navalny.

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''''Purgatorio''''' ({{IPA-it|purɡaˈtɔːrjo|pron}}; Italian for "[[Purgatory]]") is the second part of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', following the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', and preceding the ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.  The poem was written in the early 14th century.  It is an [[allegory]] telling of the climb of Dante up the Mount of [[Purgatory]], guided by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Virgil]], except for the last four cantos at which point [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] takes over as Dante's guide.

Purgatory in the poem is depicted as a mountain in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], consisting of a bottom section (Ante-Purgatory), seven levels of suffering and spiritual growth (associated with the [[seven deadly sins]]), and finally the [[Garden of Eden|Earthly Paradise]] at the top. Allegorically, the ''Purgatorio'' represents the penitent Christian life.&lt;ref name="DLS7"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto VII.&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the climb Dante discusses the nature of sin, examples of vice and virtue, as well as moral issues in politics and in the Church. The poem outlines a theory that all sins arise from love – either perverted love directed towards others' harm, or deficient love, or the disordered or excessive love of good things.

==Background==
{{main article|Inferno (Dante)}}
As described in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first twenty-four hours of Dante's journey took place on earth and started on the evening of [[Maundy Thursday]], 24 March (or 7 April) 1300 (''Inf.'' I and II), and the next full day ([[Good Friday]]) was spent exploring the depths of Hell with [[Virgil]] as a guide (''Inf.'' III-XXXIV.69). Dante and Virgil spent the next day ascending from Hell to see the stars (''Inf.'' XXXIV.70-139). They arrive at the shore of the Mountain of Purgatory—the only land in the Southern Hemisphere—at 6 AM on the morning of [[Easter|Easter Sunday]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto I: "Thus behind all the references that the canto makes to regeneration and rebirth there is the realization that all life and all redemption depends upon Christ's Resurrection from the dead."&lt;/ref&gt; which is 6 PM on Sunday evening in [[Jerusalem]], since the two points are [[antipodes|antipodal]]. Dante describes Hell as existing underneath Jerusalem, having been created by the impact of [[Lucifer]]'s fall; the Mountain of Purgatory was created by a displacement of rock caused by the same event.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto 34, lines 121-126, Mandelbuam translation "This was the side on which he fell from Heaven; / for fear of him, the land that once loomed here / made of the sea a veil and rose into / our hemisphere; and that land which appears / upon this side perhaps to flee from him / left here this hollow space and hurried upward."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Purgatorio'' picks up where the ''Inferno'' left off, describing Dante's three-and-one-day trip up the mountain that ends with Dante in the [[Purgatorio#The Earthly Paradise|Earthly Paradise]] at the time of noon on Wednesday, March 30 (or April 13).

==Ante-Purgatory==

===Shore of the Island (Cantos I – II)===
[[File:Eustache Le Sueur 002.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Canto I: Dante begins the ''Purgatorio'' by invoking the [[Muse]]s]]

In ''Purg.'' I.4-9, with the sun rising on Easter Sunday, Dante announces his intention to describe Purgatory by invoking the mythical [[Muse]]s, as he did in Canto II of the ''Inferno'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now I shall sing the second kingdom&lt;br&gt;
there where the soul of man is cleansed,&lt;br&gt;
made worthy to ascend to Heaven.&lt;br&gt;

Here from the dead let poetry rise up,&lt;br&gt;
O sacred Muses, since I am yours.&lt;br&gt;
Here let [[Calliope]] arise...&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto I, lines 4–9, Hollander translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the shores of [[Purgatory]], Dante and [[Virgil]] meet [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], a pagan who has been placed by God as the general guardian of the approach to the mountain (his symbolic significance has been much debated). The ''Purgatorio'' demonstrates the medieval knowledge of a [[spherical Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vuW4Z7Y79zYC&amp;pg=PA328 The Dante Encyclopedia]'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8153-1659-3}}, pp. 328–330 (EARTH, GLOBE).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Brian Harley and David Woodward, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJaP4i7-_MIC&amp;pg=PA321 The History of Cartography]'', Humana Press, {{ISBN|0-226-31633-5}}, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; with Dante referencing the different stars visible in the Southern Hemisphere, the altered position of the sun, and the various timezones of the Earth. For instance, at the start of Canto II, the reader learns that it is [[Aurora (mythology)|dawn]] in Purgatory; Dante conveys this concept by explaining that it is [[sunset]] at Jerusalem (antipodal to the Mount of Purgatory), midnight (six hours later) over [[India]] on the [[Ganges|River Ganges]] (with the constellation [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]] overhead there), and noon (six hours earlier) over [[Spain]]. The journey is conceived as taking place during the [[vernal equinox]], when the days and nights are of the same length.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By now the sun was crossing the horizon&lt;br&gt;
of the meridian whose highest point&lt;br&gt;
covers Jerusalem; and from the Ganges,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
night, circling opposite the sun, was moving&lt;br&gt;
together with the Scales that, when the length&lt;br&gt;
of dark defeats the day, desert night's hands;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
so that, above the shore that I had reached,&lt;br&gt;
the fair Aurora's white and scarlet cheeks&lt;br&gt;
were, as Aurora aged, becoming orange."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto II, lines 1–9, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pur 02 dore.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Purgatorio'', Canto II: Christian souls arrive singing, escorted by an angel]]
In a contrast to [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'s ferry across the [[Acheron]] in the ''Inferno'', Christian souls are escorted by an Angel Boatman from their gathering place somewhere near [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the seaport of Rome at the mouth of the [[Tiber]], through the [[Pillars of Hercules]] across the seas to the Mountain of Purgatory. The souls arrive singing ''In exitu Israel de Aegypto''&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 114 (Psalm 113 in the Latin Vulgate): [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%20114&amp;version=NIV "When Israel came out of Egypt" (NIV).]&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto II). In his ''Letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala|Cangrande]]'', Dante explains that this reference to Israel leaving Egypt refers both to the [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] of [[Christ]] and to "the conversion of the soul from the sorrow and misery of sin to the state of grace".&lt;ref&gt;"The Letter to Can Grande," in ''Literary Criticism of Dante Alighieri'', translated and edited by Robert S. Haller (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1973), 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Excommunicate===
The poets begin to climb in the early hours of morning. On the lower slopes (designated as "Ante-Purgatory" by commentators), Dante and Virgil encounter two main categories of souls whose penitent Christian life was delayed or deficient: the [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] and the late repentant. The former are detained at the base of the cliff for a period thirty times as long as their period of [[contumacy]]. The excommunicate include [[Manfred of Sicily]]. Manfred explains that prayer from those currently alive and in the grace of God may reduce the amount of time a soul spends in purgatory.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' III.140-145&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting with Manfred is over by about 9 AM.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' III.15-16&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto III).

===The Late-Repentant===
{{anchor|The Late-Repentant}}
[[File:Stefano Ussi, La Pia de' Tolomei.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Pia de' Tolomei]] (La Pia) in a painting by [[Stefano Ussi]], Canto V.]]
[[File:Dante and Virgilio (Trento).JPG|thumb|upright|right|Dante and Virgil meet [[Sordello]], in a sculpture by Cesare Zocchi, Canto VII.]]
The Late-Repentant includes (1) those too lazy or too preoccupied to repent (the Indolent), (2) those who repented at the last minute without formally receiving [[Last Rites|last rites]], as a result of violent deaths, and (3) the Negligent Rulers. These souls will be admitted to Purgatory thanks to their genuine repentance, but must wait outside for an amount of time equal to their lives on earth. The lazy include [[Belacqua]] (possibly a deceased friend of Dante), whom Dante is relieved to discover here, rather than in Hell. The meeting with Belacqua is over by noon (Canto IV).

Those not receiving last rites include [[Pia de' Tolomei]] of Siena, who was murdered by her husband, Nello della Pietra of the [[Maremma]] (Canto V):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"may you remember me, who am La Pia;&lt;br&gt;
Siena made, Maremma unmade me:&lt;br&gt;
he who, when we were wed, gave me his pledge&lt;br&gt;
and then, as nuptial ring, his gem, knows that."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto V, lines 133–136, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in this category is the troubadour [[Sordello]] who, like Virgil, is from [[Mantua]]. When Sordello discovers the great poet's identity, he bows down to him in honour. This helps keep Virgil in the foreground of the poem, since (as a resident of Limbo) Virgil is less qualified as a guide here than he was in Hell.&lt;ref name="DLS7"/&gt; As a resident of Purgatory, Sordello is able to explain the '''Rule of the Mountain''': that after sunset souls are incapable of climbing any further. Allegorically, the sun represents God, meaning that progress in the penitent Christian life can only be made through [[Divine Grace]]&lt;ref name="DLS7"/&gt; Virgil's conversation with Sordello ends as the sun is moving downward, that is, after 3 PM&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' VII.43&lt;/ref&gt; (Cantos VI to VII).

It is sunset, so Dante and his companions stop for the night in the beautiful Valley of the Princes where they meet persons whose preoccupation with public and private duties hampered their spiritual progress, particularly deceased monarchs such as [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph]], [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar]], [[Philip III of France|Philip the Bold]], and [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (Cantos VII and VIII). [[John Ciardi]] writes that these Negligent Rulers are "elevated above their negligent subjects because their special duties made it difficult for them to think about the welfare of their own souls".&lt;ref&gt;John Ciardi, ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto VII, pg. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Dante also speaks with the souls of contemporary Italian statesmen [[Conrad Malaspina (The Young)|Currado Malaspina]] and [[Nino Visconti]], the latter being a personal friend whom Dante rejoices at not having found among the damned.

As night approaches, the souls sing the [[Compline]] hymns ''[[Salve Regina]]'' and ''[[Te lucis ante terminum]]''. Dante's beautiful description of evening in this valley was the inspiration for a similar passage in [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blake Dante Purgatory 9.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Gate of Purgatory, painted by [[William Blake]], Canto 9.]]
Dante falls asleep at 8:30 PM; his dream takes place just before the dawn of [[Easter Monday]]&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' IX.13&lt;/ref&gt; and he awakens just after 8 AM.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' IX.44&lt;/ref&gt; Waking, Dante finds that he has been carried up to the gate of Purgatory proper. This gate has three steps: polished white (reflecting the purity of the penitent's true self), black (the colour of mourning; cracked in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]), and red (symbolising the blood of Christ and the restoration of true life)&lt;ref name="DLS9"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto IX.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKS9"&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto IX.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto IX).

The gate of Purgatory, Peter's Gate, is guarded by an angel who uses the point of his sword to draw the letter "P" (signifying ''peccatum'', sin) seven times on Dante's forehead, bidding him "take heed that thou wash / These wounds, when thou shalt be within."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto IX, lines 113–114, Longfellow translation.&lt;/ref&gt; With the passage of each terrace and the corresponding purgation of his soul that the pilgrim receives, one of the "P"s will be erased by the angel granting passage to the next terrace.  The angel at Peter's Gate uses [[Keys of Heaven|two keys]], silver (remorse) and gold (reconciliation) to open the gate &amp;ndash; both are necessary for redemption and salvation.&lt;ref name="DLS9"/&gt;

==Seven terraces of Purgatory==
After passing through the gate of Purgatory proper, Virgil guides the pilgrim Dante through the mountain's seven terraces. These correspond to the [[seven deadly sins]] or "seven roots of sinfulness":&lt;ref name="DLSintro65"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, pp. 65–67 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Avarice (and Prodigality), Gluttony, and Lust. The classification of sin here is more psychological than that of the ''Inferno'', being based on '''motives''', rather than '''actions'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, p. 15 (Penguin, 1955): "Hell is concerned with the fruits, but Purgatory with the roots, of sin."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also drawn primarily from Christian theology, rather than from classical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', Introduction, p. xiv (Penguin, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the classification is based on '''love''': the first three terraces of Purgatory relate to perverted love directed towards actual harm of others, the fourth terrace relates to deficient love (i.e. sloth or [[acedia]]), and the last three terraces relate to excessive or disordered love of good things.&lt;ref name="DLSintro65"/&gt; Each terrace purges a particular sin in an appropriate manner. Those in Purgatory can leave their circle voluntarily, but will only do so when they have corrected the flaw within themselves that led to committing that sin.

The structure of the poetic description of these terraces is more systematic than that of the ''Inferno,'' and associated with each terrace are an appropriate [[prayer]] and [[beatitude]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, p. 61 (Penguin, 1955): "it is only to be expected that [Purgatory] should be more highly and more serenely organised than Hell."&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hollander describes the shared features of all the terraces as "(1) description of the physical aspect of the terrace, (2) exemplars of the [[Seven virtues|virtue that counters the sin]] repented here, (3) description of the penitents, (4) recitation of their sins by particular penitents, (5) exemplars of the vice, (6) appearance to Dante of the angel representing the countering virtue".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hollander, ''Purgatorio'', Introduction, pg. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

===First terrace (Pride)===
[[File:Cathédrale d'Auch 12.jpg|thumb|right|Dante's first example of humility is taken from the [[Annunciation]]. Relief in [[Auch]] Cathedral, Canto 10.]]
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|right|Building the [[Tower of Babel]] was, for Dante, an example of pride. Painting by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], Canto 12.]]
The first three terraces of Purgatory relate to sins caused by a perverted love directed towards actual harm of others.

The first of the sins is [[Pride]]. Dante and Virgil begin to ascend this terrace shortly after 9 AM.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' X.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; On the terrace where proud souls purge their sin, Dante and Virgil see beautiful sculptures expressing [[humility]], the opposite virtue. The first example is of the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Virgin Mary]], where she responds to the angel [[Gabriel]] with the words ''Ecce [[ancilla Dei]]'' ("Behold the handmaid of the Lord," Luke 1:38&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%201:38&amp;version=KJV Luke 1:38, KJV.]&lt;/ref&gt;). An example of humility from classical history is the Emperor [[Trajan]], who, according to a medieval legend, once stopped his journey to render justice to a poor widow (Canto X).

Also associated with humility is an expanded version of the [[Lord's Prayer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our Father, You who dwell within the heavens&lt;br&gt;
but are not circumscribed by them out of&lt;br&gt;
Your greater love for Your first works above,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Praised be Your name and Your omnipotence,&lt;br&gt;
by every creature, just as it is seemly&lt;br&gt;
to offer thanks to Your sweet effluence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Your kingdom's peace come unto us, for if&lt;br&gt;
it does not come, then though we summon all&lt;br&gt;
our force, we cannot reach it of our selves.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Just as Your angels, as they sing Hosanna,&lt;br&gt;
offer their wills to You as sacrifice,&lt;br&gt;
so may men offer up their wills to You.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Give unto us this day the daily manna&lt;br&gt;
without which he who labors most to move&lt;br&gt;
ahead through this harsh wilderness falls back.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Even as we forgive all who have done&lt;br&gt;
us injury, may You, benevolent,&lt;br&gt;
forgive, and do not judge us by our worth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Try not our strength, so easily subdued,&lt;br&gt;
against the ancient foe, but set it free&lt;br&gt;
from him who goads it to perversity."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XI, lines 1–21, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After being introduced to humility, Dante and Virgil meet the souls of the proud, who are bent over by the weight of huge stones on their backs. As they walk around the terrace, they are able to profit from the sculpted examples of humility. The first of these souls is [[Omberto Aldobrandeschi]], whose pride lies in his descent ("I was Italian, son of a great Tuscan: / my father was Guiglielmo Aldobrandesco"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XI, line 58–59, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;), although he is learning to be more humble&lt;ref name="DLS11"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XI.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I / do not know if you have heard his name"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XI, line 59–60, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;). Oderisi of Gubbio is an example of pride in achievements – he was a noted artist of [[illuminated manuscript]]s.&lt;ref name="DLS11"/&gt; [[Provenzano Salvani]], leader of the Sienese [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]], is an example of pride in dominating others&lt;ref name="DLS11"/&gt; (Canto XI).

In Canto XIII, Dante points out, with "frank self-awareness,"&lt;ref&gt;Guy P. Raffa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ndVBh8BVb6UC&amp;pg=PA164 The Complete Danteworlds: A Reader's Guide to the Divine Comedy]'', University of Chicago Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-226-70270-7}}, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; that pride is also a serious flaw of his own:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I fear much more the punishment below;&lt;br&gt;
my soul is anxious, in suspense; already&lt;br&gt;
I feel the heavy weights of the first terrace"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XIII, lines 136–138, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After his conversations with the proud, Dante notes further sculptures on the pavement below, this time illustrating pride itself. The sculptures show [[Satan]] ([[Lucifer]]), the building of the [[Tower of Babel]], King [[Saul]], [[Niobe]], [[Arachne]], King [[Rehoboam]], and others.

The poets reach the stairway to the second terrace at noon.&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XII.81&lt;/ref&gt; As they ascend, an angel brushes Dante's forehead with his wings, erasing the letter "P" (''peccatum'') corresponding to the sin of pride, and Dante hears the [[beatitude]] ''Beati pauperes spiritu'' ("Blessed are the poor in spirit", Matthew 5:3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:3&amp;version=NIV Matthew 5:3 NIV.]&lt;/ref&gt;) (Canto XII).

===Second terrace (Envy)===
[[File:Orestes Elektra Pylades Louvre K428.jpg|thumb|right|Dante's classical example of generosity is the friendship between [[Orestes]] and [[Pylades]]. According to [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Amicitia]]'', Pylades pretended to be Orestes in order to save his friend from execution, Canto 13.]]
Envy is the sin that "looks with grudging hatred upon other men's gifts and good fortune, taking every opportunity to run them down or deprive them of their happiness".&lt;ref name="DLS13"/&gt; (This in contrast to covetousness, the excessive desire to have things like money.&lt;ref name="DLSintro65"/&gt;) As one of the envious souls on this terrace says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"My blood was so afire with envy that,&lt;br&gt;
when I had seen a man becoming happy,&lt;br&gt;
the lividness in me was plain to see."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XIV, lines 82–84, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On entering the terrace of the envious, Dante and Virgil first hear voices on the air telling stories of generosity, the opposite virtue. There is, as in all the other terraces, an episode from the life of the [[Virgin Mary]]; this time, the scene from the [[Life of the Virgin]] is the [[Wedding at Cana]], in which she expresses her joy for the newly married couple and encourages [[Christ]] to perform his first miracle.  There is also Jesus' saying "Love your enemies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205:44&amp;version=NIV |title= Holy Bible, New International Version | chapter= Matthew 5:44 | publisher = Biblica, Inc. |origyear = 1973|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classical story shows the friendship between [[Orestes]] and [[Pylades]].&lt;ref name="DLS13"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

The souls of the envious wear penitential grey cloaks,&lt;ref name="DLS13"/&gt; and their eyes are sewn shut with iron wire, resembling the way a [[Falconry|falconer]] sews shut the eyes of a falcon in order to train it.&lt;ref name="DLS13"/&gt; This results in audible, rather than visual, examples here (Canto XIII).

[[File:Cain leadeth abel to death tissot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Cain and Abel|Cain]]'s jealousy of his brother Abel is Dante's Biblical example of envy. Painting by [[James Tissot]], Canto 14.]]
The souls of the envious include Guido del Duca, who speaks bitterly about the ethics of people in towns along the River [[Arno]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"That river starts its miserable course&lt;br&gt;
among foul hogs, more fit for acorns than&lt;br&gt;
for food devised to serve the needs of man.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then, as that stream descends, it comes on curs&lt;br&gt;
that, though their force is feeble, snap and snarl;&lt;br&gt;
scornful of them, it swerves its snout away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And, downward, it flows on; and when that ditch,&lt;br&gt;
ill-fated and accursed, grows wider, it&lt;br&gt;
finds, more and more, the dogs becoming wolves.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Descending then through many dark ravines,&lt;br&gt;
it comes on foxes so full of deceit&lt;br&gt;
there is no trap that they cannot defeat."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XIV, lines 43–54, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The voices on the air also include examples of envy. The classical example is [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglauros]], who, according to [[Ovid]], was turned to stone because she was jealous of [[Hermes]]' love for her older sister [[Herse]]. The Biblical example is [[Cain and Abel|Cain]],&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XIV, line 133, Mandelbaum translation: "Whoever captures me will slaughter me," cf [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%204:14&amp;version=NIV Genesis 4:14 (NIV)]: "whoever finds me will kill me."&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned here not for his act of fratricide, but for the jealousy of his younger brother [[Abel]] that led to it (Canto XIV).

As he is leaving the terrace, the dazzling light of the terrace's angel causes Dante to reveal his scientific knowledge, observing that [[Reflection (physics)|the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto XV.&lt;/ref&gt; "as theory and experiment will show"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XV, line 21, [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] translation, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XV).

===Third terrace (Wrath)===
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 150.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The stoning of [[Saint Stephen]] provides an example of wrath, as well as of meekness, its opposite virtue. [[The Stoning of Saint Stephen|Painting]] by [[Rembrandt]], Canto 15.]]
On the terrace of the [[wrath]]ful, which the poets reach at 3 PM,&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XV.1-6&lt;/ref&gt; examples of meekness (the opposite virtue) are given to Dante as visions in his mind. The scene from the Life of the Virgin in this terrace of purgation is the [[Finding in the Temple]]. Whereas most parents would be angry at their child for worrying them, Mary is loving and understanding of Christ's motives behind his three-day disappearance. In a classical example, the wife of [[Peisistratos]] wanted a young man executed for embracing their daughter, to which Peisistratos responded: "What shall we do to one who'd injure us / if one who loves us earns our condemnation?"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XV, lines 104–105, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Stephen]] provides a Biblical example, drawn from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 7:54–60&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207:54-60&amp;version=NIV Acts 7:54–60, NIV.]&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XV):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Next I saw people whom the fire of wrath&lt;br&gt;
had kindled, as they stoned a youth and kept&lt;br&gt;
on shouting loudly to each other: Kill!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kill! Kill! I saw him now, weighed down by death,&lt;br&gt;
sink to the ground, although his eyes were bent&lt;br&gt;
always on Heaven: they were Heaven's gates,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Praying to his high Lord, despite the torture,&lt;br&gt;
to pardon those who were his persecutors;&lt;br&gt;
his look was such that it unlocked compassion."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XV, lines 106–114, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The souls of the wrathful walk around in acrid smoke, which symbolises the blinding effect of anger:&lt;ref name="DLS16"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Darkness of Hell and of a night deprived&lt;br&gt;
of every planet, under meager skies,&lt;br&gt;
as overcast by clouds as sky can be,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
had never served to veil my eyes so thickly&lt;br&gt;
nor covered them with such rough-textured stuff&lt;br&gt;
as smoke that wrapped us there in Purgatory;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
my eyes could not endure remaining open;&lt;ref&gt;'Purgatorio'', Canto XVI, lines 1–7, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marco Lombardo discourses with Dante on [[free will]] – a relevant topic, since there is no point being angry with someone who has no choice over his actions&lt;ref name="DLS16"/&gt; (Canto XVI). Dante also sees visions with examples of wrath, such as [[Procne]], [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] and [[Lavinia]].

The prayer for this terrace is the ''[[Agnus Dei]]'': "''Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis... dona nobis pacem''" ("Lamb of God, you who take away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us... grant us peace") The poets leave the third terrace just after nightfall&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XVII.70-72&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XVII).

While staying on the fourth terrace, Virgil is able to explain to Dante the organization of Purgatory and its relationship to perverted, deficient, or misdirected love. The three terraces they have seen so far have purged the proud ("he who, through abasement of another, / hopes for supremacy"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XVII, lines 115–116, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;), the envious ("one who, when he is outdone, / fears his own loss of fame, power, honor, favor; / his sadness loves misfortune for his neighbor."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XVII, lines 118–120, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the wrathful ("he who, over injury / received, resentful, for revenge grows greedy / and, angrily, seeks out another's harm."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XVII, lines 121–123, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;). Deficient and misdirected loves are about to follow. Virgil's discourse on love concludes at midnight&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XVIII.76-78&lt;/ref&gt; (Cantos XVII and XVIII).

===Fourth terrace (Sloth)===
On the fourth terrace we find souls whose sin was that of deficient love – that is, sloth or [[acedia]]. Since they had failed in life to act in pursuit of love, here they are engaged in ceaseless activity. The examples of sloth and of zeal, its opposite virtue, are called out by these souls as they run around the terrace. A scene from the life of the Virgin outlined in this terrace is [[Visitation (Christianity)|the Visitation]], with Mary going "in haste" to visit her cousin [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]. These examples also include episodes from the lives of [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Aeneas]]. This activity also replaces a verbal prayer for this terrace. Since the formerly slothful are now too busy to converse at length, this section of the poem is a short one.

Allegorically, spiritual laziness and lack of caring lead to sadness,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Cantos XVIII and XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; and so the [[beatitude]] for this terrace is ''Beati qui lugent'' ("Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted," Matthew 5:4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:4&amp;version=NIV Matthew 5:4 NIV.]&lt;/ref&gt;) (Canto XVIII and XIX).

Dante's second night's sleep occurs while the poets are on this terrace, and Dante dreams shortly before Tuesday's dawn&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XIX.1-6&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]], symbol of disordered or excessive love represented by [[greed]], [[gluttony]] and [[lust]]. The dream ends in the light of the sun, and the two poets climb toward the fifth terrace&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XIX.38-39&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XIX).

===Fifth terrace (Avarice)===
[[File:Pur 19 avari.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The souls on the fifth terrace lie face-downward, Canto 19.]]
On the last three terraces are those who sinned by loving good things, but loving them in an excessive or disordered way.

On the fifth terrace, excessive concern for earthly goods – whether in the form of greed, ambition or extravagance – is punished and purified. The [[Avarice|avaricious]] and prodigal lie face-down on the ground, unable to move. Their prayer is ''Adhaesit pavimento anima mea'', taken from [[Psalm]] 119:25 ("My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119:25&amp;version=KJV Psalm 119:25, KJV.] In the [[Vulgate]], this is Psalm 118:25.&lt;/ref&gt;), which is a prayer expressing the desire to follow God's law. Dante meets the shade of [[Pope Adrian V]], an exemplar of desire for ecclesiastical power and prestige, who directs the poets on their way (Canto XIX).

The scene from the Life of the Virgin, used here to counter the sin of avarice, is the humble [[Virgin birth of Jesus|birth of Christ]]. Further down the terrace, [[Hugh the Great]] personifies greed for worldly wealth and possessions. He bemoans the way that, in contrast, avarice has motivated the actions of his successors, and "prophesies" events which occurred after the date in which the poem is set, but before the poem was written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The other, who once left his ship as prisoner&lt;br&gt;
I see him sell his daughter, bargaining&lt;br&gt;
as pirates haggle over female slaves.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
O Avarice, my house is now your captive:&lt;br&gt;
it traffics in the flesh of its own children&lt;br&gt;
what more is left for you to do to us?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That past and future evil may seem less,&lt;br&gt;
I see the fleur-de-lis enter Anagni&lt;br&gt;
and, in His vicar, Christ made prisoner.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I see Him mocked a second time; I see&lt;br&gt;
the vinegar and gall renewed and He&lt;br&gt;
is slain between two thieves who're still alive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And I see the new Pilate, one so cruel&lt;br&gt;
that, still not sated, he, without decree,&lt;br&gt;
carries his greedy sails into the Temple."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XX, lines 79–93, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Templars on Stake.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knights Templar|Templars]] being burned for heresy at the instigation of [[Philip IV of France]]. In Dante's view, this was a political action motivated by [[avarice]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto XX: "At every point in canto 20, avarice is identified as the driving force in the ambition of the Capetian dynasty."&lt;/ref&gt; Canto 20.]]
These events include [[Charles II of Naples]] selling his daughter into marriage to an elderly and disreputable man,&lt;ref name="DLS20"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XX.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philip IV of France]] ("the fleur-de-lis") arresting [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in 1303 (a pope destined for Hell, according to the ''Inferno'', but still, in Dante's view, the [[Vicar of Christ]]&lt;ref name="DLS20"/&gt;). Dante also refers to the suppression of the [[Knights Templar]] at Philip's instigation in 1307, which freed Philip from debts he owed to the order. Following the exemplars of avarice (these are [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]], [[Midas]], [[Achan (biblical figure)|Achan]], [[Ananias and Sapphira]], [[Heliodorus (minister)|Heliodorus]], [[Polymestor]], and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]]), there is a sudden earthquake accompanied by the shouting of ''[[Gloria in excelsis Deo]]''. Dante desires to understand the cause of the earthquake, but he does not question Virgil about it (Canto XX).

In a scene that Dante links to the episode where Jesus meets two disciples on the road to [[Emmaus]],&lt;ref name="DLS21"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante and Virgil are overtaken by a shade who eventually reveals himself as the Roman poet [[Statius]], author of the ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]''. Statius explains the cause of the earthquake: there is a tremor when a soul knows that it is ready to ascend to heaven, which he has just experienced. Dante presents Statius, without obvious or understandable basis, as a convert to Christianity; as a Christian, his guidance will supplement Virgil's.&lt;ref name="DLS21"/&gt; Statius is overjoyed to find himself in the company of Virgil, whose ''Aeneid'' he so greatly admired (Canto XXI).

Dante follows Virgil and Statius upward. Statius explains that he was not avaricious but prodigal, but that he "converted" from prodigality by reading Virgil, which directed him to poetry and to God. Statius explains how he was [[Baptism|baptized]], but he remained a secret Christian—this is the cause of his purgation of Sloth on the previous terrace. Statius asks Virgil to name his fellow poets and figures in Limbo, which he does&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hollander, ''Purgatorio'', outline of Canto XXII&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XXII).

===Sixth terrace (Gluttony)===
[[File:Piero di Cosimo 015.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Lapith|Battle of Centaurs and Lapiths]] is a classical example of gluttony. Painting by [[Piero di Cosimo]], Canto 24.]]
It is between 10 and 11 AM,&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'' XXII.115-126&lt;/ref&gt; and the three poets begin to circle the sixth terrace where the [[Gluttony|gluttonous]] are purged, and more generally, those who over-emphasised food, drink, and bodily comforts.&lt;ref name="DLS22"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXII.&lt;/ref&gt; In a scene reminiscent of the punishment of [[Tantalus]], they are starved in the presence of trees whose fruit is forever out of reach.&lt;ref name="DLS22"/&gt; The examples here are given by voices in the trees. The Virgin Mary, who shared her Son's gifts with others at the [[Wedding at Cana]], and [[John the Baptist]], who only lived on [[locust]]s and [[honey]] (Matthew 3:4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+3:4&amp;version=NIV Matthew 3:4, NIV.]&lt;/ref&gt;), is an example of the virtue of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name="DLS22"/&gt;  A classical example of the opposite vice of gluttony is the drunkenness of the [[Centaur]]s that led to the [[Lapith|Battle of Centaurs and Lapiths]].&lt;ref name="DLS22"/&gt;

The prayer for this terrace is ''Labia mea Domine'' (Psalm 51:15: "O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+51:15&amp;version=NIV Psalm 51:15, NIV.] In the [[Vulgate]], this is Psalm 50:17.&lt;/ref&gt;)  These are the opening words from the daily [[Liturgy of the Hours]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. J. Stravinskas, Catholic Dictionary, 2nd ed., Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2002, p. 415, {{ISBN|0-87973-390-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the source of prayers for the fifth and seventh terraces (Cantos XXII through XXIV).

Here Dante also meets his friend [[Forese Donati]] and his poetic predecessor [[Bonagiunta Orbicciani]]. Bonagiunta has kind words for Dante's earlier poem, ''[[La Vita Nuova]]'', describing it as the ''dolce stil novo'' ("[[Dolce Stil Novo|sweet new style]]").&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIV, line 57, Longfellow translation&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes the line "Ladies that have intelligence of love,"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIV, line 51, Longfellow translation.&lt;/ref&gt; written in praise of [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], whom he will meet later in the ''Purgatorio'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Ladies that have intelligence of Love,&lt;br&gt;
I of my lady wish with you to speak;&lt;br&gt;
Not that I can believe to end her praise,&lt;br&gt;
But to discourse that I may ease my mind.&lt;br&gt;
I say that when I think upon her worth,&lt;br&gt;
So sweet doth Love make himself feel to me,&lt;br&gt;
That if I then should lose not hardihood,&lt;br&gt;
Speaking, I should enamour all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;''[[La Vita Nuova]]'', Section XIX, lines 1–8, translated by Charles Eliot Norton.[http://www.elfinspell.com/DanteNewLife2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is 2:00 PM when the three poets leave the sixth terrace and begin their ascent to the seventh terrace, meaning that they have spent four hours among the Gluttonous.&lt;ref&gt;''Purg.'' XXV.1-3&lt;/ref&gt; During the climb, Dante wonders how it is possible for bodiless souls to have the gaunt appearance of the souls being starved here. In explaining, Statius discourses on the nature of the soul and its relationship to the body (Canto XXV).

===Seventh terrace (Lust)===
[[File:Pur 25.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Virgil, Dante, and Statius beside the flames of the seventh terrace, Canto 25.]]
The terrace of the [[lust]]ful has an immense wall of flame through which everyone must pass. As a prayer, they sing the hymn ''Summae Deus Clementiae''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/SummaeDeus.html Summae Deus Clementiae.]&lt;/ref&gt; (''God of Supreme Clemency'') from the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. Souls repenting of misdirected sexual desire call forth in praises of [[chastity]] and marital fidelity (the [[Perpetual virginity of Mary|Virgin Mary's chastity]] and the chastity of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]) (Canto XXV).  

Two groups of souls run through the flames calling out examples of lust ([[Sodom and Gomorrah]] by the [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Pasiphaë]] by the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]). As they circle the terrace, the two groups of penitents greet each other in a way Dante compares to ants:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There, on all sides, I can see every shade&lt;br&gt;
move quickly to embrace another shade,&lt;br&gt;
content they did not pause with their brief greeting,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
as ants, in their dark company, will touch&lt;br&gt;
their muzzles, each to each, perhaps to seek&lt;br&gt;
news of their fortunes and their journeyings."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXVI, lines 31–36, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pur 27.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dante dreams of [[Leah]] picking flowers, symbol of the active (non-monastic) Christian life, Canto 27.]]
Among the flames, which he dare not enter, are the poets of love [[Guido Guinizelli]] and [[Arnaut Daniel]], with whom Dante speaks (Canto XXVI). 

Shortly before sunset, the Poets are greeted by the Angel of Chastity, who instructs them to pass through the wall of fire. By reminding Dante that Beatrice can be found in the Earthly Paradise on the other side, Virgil finally persuades Dante to pass through the intense fire. After the poets pass through the flame, the sun sets and they lie down to sleep on the steps between the final terrace and the Earthly Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;''Purg.'' XXVII.61-68&lt;/ref&gt; On these steps, just before the dawn of Wednesday morning, Dante has his third dream: a vision of [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]]. They are symbols of the active (non-monastic) and contemplative (monastic) Christian lives, both of which are important&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXVII.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
".. in my dream, I seemed to see a woman&lt;br&gt;
both young and fair; along a plain she gathered&lt;br&gt;
flowers, and even as she sang, she said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Whoever asks my name, know that I'm Leah,&lt;br&gt;
and I apply my lovely hands to fashion&lt;br&gt;
a garland of the flowers I have gathered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To find delight within this mirror I&lt;br&gt;
adorn myself; whereas my sister Rachel&lt;br&gt;
never deserts her mirror; there she sits&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
all day; she longs to see her fair eyes gazing,&lt;br&gt;
as I, to see my hands adorning, long:&lt;br&gt;
she is content with seeing, I with labor."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXVII, lines 97–108, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dante awakens with the dawn,&lt;ref&gt;''Purg.'' XXVII.109&lt;/ref&gt; and the Poets continue up the rest of the ascent until they come in sight of the Earthly Paradise (Canto XXVII).

==The Earthly Paradise==
[[File:Beatrice Addressing Dante (by William Blake).jpg|thumb|300px|''Beatrice Addressing Dante'', by [[William Blake]], showing the "chariot triumphal" bearing Beatrice and drawn by the Griffin, as well as four of the ladies representing virtues, Canto 29.]]

At the summit of Mount Purgatory is the Earthly Paradise or [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref name="DLS28"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegorically, it represents the state of innocence that existed before [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] fell from grace – the state which Dante's journey up Mount Purgatory has been recapturing.&lt;ref name="DLS28"/&gt; Here Dante meets Matilda, a woman whose literal and allegorical identity "is perhaps the most tantalizing problem in the ''Comedy''."&lt;ref name="DLS28"/&gt;
Critics up to the early twentieth century have connected her with the historical [[Matilda of Tuscany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binyon|first=Lawrence|title=The portable Dante|year=1978|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0140150323|edition=Rev.|authorlink=Laurence Binyon|article="Argument", Canto XXVIII|editor=Paolo Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others suggested a connection with the dream of [[Leah]] in Canto XXVII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The portable Dante|year=1995|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=0140231145|authorlink=Note 40|editor=Mark Musa}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Matilda clearly prepares Dante for his meeting with [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]],&lt;ref name="DLS28"/&gt; the woman to whom (historically) Dante dedicated his previous poetry, the woman at whose request (in the story) Virgil was commissioned to bring Dante on his journey,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on Canto II.&lt;/ref&gt; and the woman who (allegorically) symbolizes the path to God&lt;ref name="DLS30"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XXVIII).

With Matilda, Dante witnesses a procession which forms an allegory within the allegory, somewhat like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[play within a play]]. It has a very different style from the ''Purgatorio'' as a whole, having the form of a [[masque]], where the characters are walking symbols rather than real people. The procession consists of (Canto XXIX):

* "Twenty-four elders"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, line 83, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; (a reference to Revelation 4:4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+4:4&amp;version=NIV Revelation 4:4, NIV.]&lt;/ref&gt;), representing the 24 books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], as classified by [[Jerome]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Four animals" with "six wings as plumage"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, lines 92–105, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; (a reference to Revelation 4:6–8&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%204:6-8&amp;version=NIV Revelation 4:4:6–8, NIV.]&lt;/ref&gt;), a traditional representation of the [[four Evangelists]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;
* "A chariot triumphal on two wheels,"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, line 107, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; bearing Beatrice, which is drawn by…
* A [[griffin]],&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, lines 108–114, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the conjoined divinity and humanity of [[Christ]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;
* "Three circling women" coloured red, green, and white,&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, lines 121–129, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the three [[theological virtues]]: [[Charity (virtue)|Love]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Faith (virtue)|Faith]], respectively&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;
* "Four other women"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, line 130, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; dressed in purple,&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, line 131, Longfellow translation.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the four [[cardinal virtues]]: [[Prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], and [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;
* "Two elders, different in their dress,"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, lines 134–141, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Pauline epistles]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;
* "Four of humble aspect,"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, line 142, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[general epistles]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;
* "When all the rest had passed, a lone old man,"&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXIX, lines 143–144, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[Book of Revelation]]&lt;ref name="DLS29"/&gt;

[[File:John William Waterhouse - Dante and Matilda.jpg|thumb|''Dante and Matilda'' (formerly called ''Dante and Beatrice'') by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1915.]]
The appearance of Beatrice,&lt;ref&gt;John Laskin, ''[http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/9pp7614f The Entrance of Beatrice in Dante's Purgatorio: Revelation, Duality and Identity]'', Carte Italiane, 1(14), 1994, p. 120: "Virgil slips unnoticed offstage while our attention is cleverly diverted to the visual splendor of the 'cloud of flowers' effect."&lt;/ref&gt; and a dramatic reconciliation scene between Beatrice and Dante, in which she rebukes his sin (Cantos XXX and XXXI), help cover the disappearance of Virgil, who, as a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities, can help him no further in his approach to God&lt;ref&gt;Robin Kirkpatrick, ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto XXX and XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; (and in the rest of the ''Divine Comedy'', Beatrice is Dante's guide):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But Virgil had deprived us of himself,&lt;br&gt;
Virgil, the gentlest father, Virgil, he&lt;br&gt;
to whom I gave my self for my salvation;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and even all our ancient mother lost&lt;br&gt;
was not enough to keep my cheeks, though washed&lt;br&gt;
with dew, from darkening again with tears."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXX, lines 49–54, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pur 31.jpg|thumb|upright|Matilda helps Dante pass through the River [[Lethe]], Canto 31.]]
Dante then passes through the River [[Lethe]], which erases the memory of past sin (Canto XXXI),&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, p. 68 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; and sees an allegory of Biblical and Church history. This allegory includes a denunciation of the corrupt [[Pope|papacy]] of the time: a [[wikt:harlot|harlot]] (the papacy) is dragged away with the chariot (the Church) by a giant (the French monarchy, which under King Philip IV engineered the move of the [[Avignon Papacy|Papal Seat to Avignon]] in 1309)&lt;ref name="DLS32"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', notes on Canto XXXII.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XXXII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Just like a fortress set on a steep slope,&lt;br&gt;
securely seated there, ungirt, a whore,&lt;br&gt;
whose eyes were quick to rove, appeared to me;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and I saw at her side, erect, a giant,&lt;br&gt;
who seemed to serve as her custodian;&lt;br&gt;
and they again, again embraced each other."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXXII, lines 148–153, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is noon as the events observed in the Earthly Paradise come to a close.&lt;ref&gt;''Purg.'' XXXIII.103-105&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Dante drinks from the River [[Eunoe|Eunoë]], which restores good memories, and prepares him for his ascent to Heaven (described in the ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'', the final ''cantica''). As with the other two parts of the ''Divine Comedy'', the ''Purgatorio'' ends on the word "stars" (Canto XXXIII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"From that most holy wave I now returned&lt;br&gt;
to Beatrice; remade, as new trees are&lt;br&gt;
renewed when they bring forth new boughs, I was&lt;br&gt;
pure and prepared to climb unto the stars."&lt;ref&gt;''Purgatorio'', Canto XXXIII, lines 142–145, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the arts==
{{commons category}}
{{Main article|Dante and his Divine Comedy in popular culture}}

The ''Divine Comedy'' has been a source of inspiration for countless artists for almost seven centuries. While references to the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' are the most common, there are also many references to the ''Purgatorio''. [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Dante Symphony|Symphony to Dante's Divina Commedia]]'' (1856) has a "Purgatorio" movement, as does [[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy (Smith)|The Divine Comedy]]'' (2006). [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and others have referenced the ''Purgatorio'' in their writing.  Many visual artists have depicted scenes from the ''Purgatorio'', including [[Gustave Doré]], [[John Flaxman]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[John William Waterhouse]], and [[William Blake]].

The '''scientific community''' is a diverse network of interacting [[scientist]]s. It includes many "[[working groups|sub-communities]]" working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]] is expected to be achieved by the [[scientific method]]. [[Peer review]], through discussion and debate within journals and conferences, assists in this objectivity by maintaining the quality of research methodology and interpretation of results.&lt;ref name=SCMet&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kornfeld |first1=W |last2=Hewitt |first2=CE |year=1981 |title=The Scientific Community Metaphor |journal=IEEE Trans. Sys., Man, and Cyber. |volume=SMC-11 |issue=1 |pages=24–33 |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5693/AIM-641.pdf?sequence=2 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of scientific communities==

The eighteenth century had some societies made up of men who studied nature, also known as [[natural philosophers]] and [[natural history|natural historians]], which included even amateurs. As such these societies were more like local clubs and groups with diverse interests than actual scientific communities, which usually had interests on specialized disciplines.&lt;ref name=Cahan /&gt; Though there were a few older societies of men who studied nature such as the [[Royal Society of London]], the concept of scientific communities emerged in the second half of the 19th century, not before, because it was in this century that the language of modern science emerged, the professionalization of science occurred, specialized institutions were created, and the specialization of scientific disciplines and fields occurred.&lt;ref name=Cahan /&gt;

For instance, the term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and the wider acceptance of the term along with the growth of specialized societies allowed for researchers to see themselves as a part of a wider imagined community, similar to the concept of nationhood.&lt;ref name=Cahan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cahan|first1=David|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287|pages=291–328|chapter=Institutions and Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership, status and interactions==
Membership in the community is generally, but not exclusively, a function of [[education]], [[employment|employment status]], research activity and [[research institute|institutional affiliation]]. [[Achieved status|Status]] within the community is highly correlated with [[Academic publishing|publication record]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Yearley | first1 = Steven | last2 = Collins | first2 = Harry M. | author-link1 = Steven Yearley | author-link2 = Harry Collins | contribution = Epistemological chicken | editor-last = Pickering | editor-first = Andrew | editor-link = Andrew Pickering | title = Science as practice and culture | pages = 301–326 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780226668017 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also depends on the status within the institution and the status of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Höhle, Ester (2015). From apprentice to agenda-setter: comparative analysis of the influence of contract conditions on roles in the
scientific community. Studies in Higher Education 40(8), 1423-1437. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2015.1060704&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers can hold roles of different degrees of influence inside the scientific community. Researchers of a stronger influence can act as mentors for early career researchers and steer the direction of research in the community like ageanda setters.&lt;ref&gt;Höhle, Ester (2015). From apprentice to agenda-setter: comparative analysis of the influence of contract conditions on roles in the scientific community. Studies in Higher Education 40(8), 1423-1437.http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03075079.2015.1060704&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scientists are usually trained in [[academia]] through [[university|universities]]. As such, [[academic degree|degrees]] in the relevant scientific sub-disciplines are often considered prerequisites in the relevant community. In particular, the [[PhD]] with its [[doctoral dissertation|research requirements]] functions as a marker of being an important integrator into the community, though continued membership is dependent on maintaining connections to other researchers through publication, technical contributions, and [[scientific conference|conferences]]. After obtaining a PhD an academic scientist may continue through being on an academic position, receiving a [[postdoc|post-doctoral fellowships]] and onto [[professor]]ships. Other scientists make contributions to the scientific community in alternate ways such as in [[industry]], [[education]], [[think tank]]s, or the [[government]].

Members of the same community do not need to work together.&lt;ref name=SCMet /&gt; Communication between the members is established by disseminating research work and hypotheses through articles in [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journals|journals]], or by attending [[academic conference|conferences]] where new research is presented and ideas exchanged and discussed. There are also many informal methods of communication of scientific work and results as well. And many in a coherent community may actually ''not'' communicate all of their work with one another, for various professional reasons.

==Speaking for the scientific community==
Unlike in previous centuries when the community of scholars were all members of few [[learned society|learned societies]] and similar institutions, there are no singular bodies or individuals which can be said today to speak for all science or all scientists. This is partly due to the specialized training most scientists receive in very few fields. As a result, many would lack expertise in all the other fields of the sciences. For instance, due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602|doi=10.1038/493602a|pmid=23364725|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are still multiple societies and academies in many countries which help consolidate some opinions and research to help guide public discussions on matters of policy and government-funded research. For example, the [[United States]]' [[National Academy of Science]] (NAS) and [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] sometimes act as surrogates when the opinions of the scientific community need to be ascertained by [[public policy|policy makers]] or the national [[government]], but the statements of the National Academy of Science or the Royal Society are not binding on scientists nor do they necessarily reflect the opinions of every scientist in a given community since membership is often exclusive, their commissions are explicitly focused on serving their governments, and they have never "shown systematic interest in what rank-and file scientists think about scientific matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivity of membership in these types of organizations can be seen in their election processes in which only existing members can officially nominate others for candidacy of membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce Alberts|first=Kenneth R. Fulton|title=Election to the National Academy of Sciences: Pathways to membership|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/21/7405.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.0503457102|pmid=16586925|volume=102|issue=21|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=7405–7406|pmc=1140467|date=2005-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election to the Fellowship of the Royal Society|url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/election/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unusual for organizations like the National Academy of Science to engage in external research projects since they normally focus on preparing scientific reports for government agencies.&lt;ref name="US Academy uncharted waters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=Helen|title=Oil money takes US academy into uncharted waters|journal=Nature|volume=494|issue=7437|pages=295|doi=10.1038/494295a|pmid=23426305|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how rarely the NAS engages in external and active research can be seen in its struggle to prepare and overcome hurdles, due to its lack of experience in coordinating research grants and major research programs on the environment and health.&lt;ref name="US Academy uncharted waters" /&gt;

Nevertheless, general [[scientific consensus]] is a concept which is often referred to when dealing with questions that can be subject to [[scientific method]]ology. While the consensus opinion of the community is not always easy to ascertain or fix due to paradigm shifting, generally the standards and utility of the [[scientific method]] have tended to ensure, to some degree, that scientists agree on some general corpus of [[fact]]s explicated by [[scientific theory]] while rejecting some ideas which run counter to this realization. The concept of scientific consensus is very important to science pedagogy, the evaluation of new ideas, and research funding. Sometimes it is argued that there is a [[closed shop]] [[bias]] within the scientific community toward new ideas. [[Protoscience]], [[fringe science]], and [[pseudoscience]] have been topics that discuss demarcation problems. In response to this some non-consensus claims [[scientific skepticism|skeptical organizations]], not research institutions, have devoted considerable amounts of time and money contesting ideas which run counter to general agreement on a particular topic.

[[Philosophy of science|Philosophers of science]] argue over the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limits of such a consensus and some, including [[Thomas Kuhn]], have pointed to the existence of [[scientific revolution]]s in the [[history of science]] as being an important indication that scientific consensus can, at times, be wrong. Nevertheless, the sheer explanatory power of science in its ability to make [[accuracy|accurate]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] predictions and aid in the design and [[engineering]] of new [[technology]] has ensconced "science" and, by proxy, the opinions of the scientific community as a highly respected form of [[knowledge]] both in the [[academia|academy]] and in [[popular culture]].

===Political controversies===
The high regard with which scientific results are held in Western society has caused a number of [[Politicization of science|political controversies over scientific subjects]] to arise. An alleged [[conflict thesis]] proposed in the 19th century between [[religion and science]] has been cited by some as representative of a struggle between tradition and substantial change and [[faith and reason]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. A popular example used to support this thesis is when [[Galileo]] was tried before the [[Inquisition]] concerning the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;Page 37 John Hedley Brooke: Science and Religion – Some Historical Perspectives, Cambridge 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution began after Pope Urban VIII permitted Galileo to write about the Copernican model. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" which caused great offense to him.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo Project - Pope Urban VIII Biography|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though many historians of science have discredited the conflict thesis &lt;ref name="sci rel hist intro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferngren|first=Gary|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|pages=Introduction, p.ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it still remains a popular belief among many including some scientists. In more recent times, the [[creation-evolution controversy]] has resulted in many [[creationism|religious believers in a supernatural creation]] to challenge some [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] assumptions that have been proposed in some of the branches of scientific fields such as [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]], and [[astronomy]]. Although the dichotomy seems to be of a different outlook from a [[Continental Europe|Continental]] [[Europe]]an perspective, it does exist. The [[Vienna Circle]], for instance, had a paramount (i.e. symbolic) influence on the [[semiotic regime]] represented by the [[Scientific]] [[Community]] in Europe.

In the decades following [[World War II]], some were convinced that [[nuclear power]] would solve the pending [[energy crisis]] by providing energy at low cost. This advocacy led to the construction of many [[nuclear power plants]], but was also accompanied by a global political movement opposed to nuclear power due to safety concerns and associations of the technology with [[nuclear weapons]]. Mass protests in the United States and Europe during the 1970s and 1980s along with the disasters of [[Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island]] led to a decline in nuclear power plant construction.

In the last decades or so, both [[Global warming controversy|global warming]] and [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]] have placed the opinions of the scientific community in the forefront of political debate.

{{Italic title}}
[[Kenneth Arrow]]'s [[monograph]]  '''''Social Choice and Individual Values''''' (1951, 2nd ed., 1963) and a theorem within it created modern [[social choice theory]], a rigorous melding of social [[ethics]] and [[voting theory]] with an [[economics|economic]] flavor.  Somewhat formally, the "social choice" in the title refers to Arrow's representation of how ''social values'' from the ''set of individual orderings'' would be implemented under the ''constitution''.  Less formally, each social choice corresponds to the feasible set of laws passed by a "vote" (the set of orderings) under the constitution even if not every individual voted in favor of all the laws.

The work culminated in what Arrow called the "General Possibility Theorem," better known thereafter as [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's (impossibility) theorem]]. The theorem states that, absent restrictions on either individual preferences or neutrality of the constitution to feasible alternatives, there exists no social choice rule that satisfies a set of plausible requirements. The result generalizes the [[voting paradox]], which shows that majority voting may fail to yield a stable outcome.

== Introduction ==
The Introduction contrasts voting and markets with dictatorship and social convention (such as those in a religious code).  Both exemplify social decisions.   Voting and markets facilitate ''social'' choice in a sense, whereas dictatorship and convention limit it.  The former amalgamate possibly differing tastes to make a social choice.  The concern is with formal aspects of generalizing such choices.  In this respect it is comparable to analysis of the [[voting paradox]] from use of [[majority rule]] as a value.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|In the simplest case of the voting paradox, there are 3 candidates, A, B, and C, and 3 voters with preferences listed in decreasing order as follows. 
:Voter 1:   A B C
:Voter 2:   B C A
:Voter 3:   C A B
By majority rule for 2-candidate votes, A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A.  Majority rule works for an individual selecting consistently among the 3 candidates but not necessarily for the "social choice" in any general sense. 
|}
Arrow asks whether other methods of taste aggregation (whether by voting or markets), using other values, remedy the problem or are satisfactory in other ways.  Here logical consistency is one check on acceptability of all the values.  To answer the  questions, Arrow proposes removing the distinction between voting and markets in favor of a more general category of collective social choice.

The analysis uses [[ordinal utility|ordinal rankings]] of individual choice to represent  behavioral patterns.   [[cardinal utility|Cardinal measures]] of individual  [[utility]] and, ''a fortiori'', interpersonal comparisons of utility are avoided on grounds that such measures are unnecessary to represent behavior and depend on mutually incompatible value judgments (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Following [[Abram Bergson]], whose formulation of a [[social welfare function]] launched ordinalist [[welfare economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Abram Bergson, 1938. "A Reformulation of Certain Aspects of Welfare Economics," 1938. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 52(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1881737 p. 310]-334 ([http://google.com/scholar?q=cache:uoJ0KiOk-UwJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000000000000 [HTML.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow avoids locating a social good as independent of individual values.  Rather, social values inhere in actions from social-decision rules (hypostatized as ''constitutional conditions'') using individual values as input.  Then 'social values' means "nothing more than social choices" (p.&amp;nbsp;106).

Topics implicated along the way include [[game theory]],  the [[compensation principle]] in [[welfare economics]], [[extended sympathy]], Leibniz's principle of the [[identity of indiscernibles]], [[logrolling]], and similarity of social judgments through [[Arrow's impossibility theorem|single-peaked preferences]], Kant’s [[categorical imperative]], or the [[decision making|decision process]].

== Terminology ==
The book defines a few terms and logical symbols used thereafter and their applied empirical interpretation (pp.&amp;nbsp;11–19, 23).   Key among these is the "vote" ('set of orderings') of the society (more generally "collectivity") composed of  individuals (“voters” here) in the following form:  
*'''Voters''', a finite set with at least two members, indexed as ''i'' = ''1'', ''2'', ... ''n''.
*'''Commodities''', the objects of choice (things that voters might want, goods and services), both private and public (municipal services, statecraft, etc.).
*A '''social state''' is a specification (formally, an element of a [[vector space|vector]]) of a distribution among voters of commodities, labor, and resources used in their productions. 
*The '''set of social states''',  the set of all 'social states', indexed as ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', . ., with at least three members.
*A (weak) '''ordering''', a ranking by a voter of all 'social states' from more to less preferred, including possible ties.
*The '''set of 'orderings'''', the set of all ''n'' orderings, one ordering per voter.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Example: Three voters {''1,2,3''} and three states {''x,y,z''}. Given the three states, there are 13 logically possible orderings (allowing for ties).''*''  Since each of the individuals may hold any of the orderings, there are 13*13*13  = 2197 possible "votes" (sets of orderings).  A well-defined social-decision rule selects the social state (or states, in case of tie) corresponding to each of these "votes."

''*'' Namely, from highest to lowest ranked for each triplet and with 'T's indexing ties:
:x y z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y T z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  (x z T y is the same ranking as x y T z, so is omitted, etc.)
:y x z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    y T x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;z
:z x y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x T y
:x z y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    x T z&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y
:y z x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;z T x
:z y x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z T y&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    z T y T x
|}The ordering of each voter ranks social states, including the ''distribution'' of commodities (possibly based on equity, by whatever metric, or any other consideration), not merely direct consumption by that voter.  So, the ordering is an "individual value," not merely, as in earlier analysis, a purely private "taste."  Arrow notes that the distinction is not sharp.  [[Resource allocation]] is specified in the production of each social state in the ordering.

The comprehensive nature of  ''commodities'', the ''set'' of ''social states'', and the ''set'' of ''orderings'' was noted by early reviewers.

The two properties that define any ordering of the set of ''objects'' in question (all ''social states'' here) are:

* '''connectedness''' ('''completeness'''): ''All'' the objects in the set are included in the ranking (no "undecideds" nor "abstentions") and
* '''transitivity''':  If, for any objects ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in the set, ''x'' is ranked at least as high as ''y'' and ''y'' is ranked at least as high as ''z'', then ''x'' is ranked at least as high as ''z''.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|A standard [[indifference curve|indifference-curve map]] for an individual has these properties and so is an ordering.  Each [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] from the origin ranks (conceivable) commodity bundles from least preferred on up (no ties in the ranking).  Each indifference curve ranks commodity bundles as equally preferred (all ties in the ranking).  
|}
 
The earlier definition of an '''ordering''' implies that any given ordering entails one of three responses on the "ballot" as between any pair of social states (''x'', ''y''):  ''better than'', ''as good as'',  or ''worse than'' (in preference ranking).  (Here "as good as" is an "equally-ranked," not a "don't know," relation.)  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|The denotations of these three "ballot" options are respectively:

* '''x P y''' (voter prefers ''x'' to ''y'')
* '''x I y''' (voter indifferent between ''x'' and ''y'')
* '''y P x''' (voter prefers ''y'' to ''x'').

It is convenient for deriving implications to compact the first two of these options on the ballot to one, an "''at least'' as good as" relation, denoted ''R'':

* '''x R y''': voter either prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between ''x'' and ''y'' but not both.

The above two properties of an ordering are then axiomatized as:

'''connectedness''': For all (the objects of choice in the set) ''x'' and ''y'', either ''x R y'' or ''y R x''.

'''transitivity''':  For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', ''x R y'' and ''y R z'' imply ''x R z''.

Thus, alternation ('or')  and conjunction ('and') of ''R'' relations represent both the properties of an ordering for all the objects of choice.

The ''I'' and ''P'' relations are then defined as:

'''x I y''':  ''x R y'' and ''y R x'' (''x'' as good as ''y'' means  ''x'' at least as good as ''y'' and vice versa).

'''x P y''':  not ''y R x'' (''y R x'' includes one of two options. Negating that option leaves only ''x P y'', the third of the original three options, on the ballot.)

From this, conjunction ('and') and negation ('not') of mere pairwise ''R'' relations can (also) represent all the properties of an ordering for all the objects of choice.  Hence, the following shorthand.   
|}
An [[Total order|ordering]] of a voter is denoted by '''R'''.  That ordering of voter ''i'' is denoted with a subscript as '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'''.

If voter ''i'' changes orderings, primes distinguish the first and second, say '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;''' compared to '''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' '''.  The same notation can apply  for two different hypothetical orderings of the same voter.

The interest of the book is in amalgamating sets of orderings. This is accomplished through a 'constitution'.  
  
*A '''constitution''' (or '''social welfare function''') is a ''voting rule'' mapping each (of at least one) set of orderings onto a '''social ordering''', a corresponding ordering of the set of social states that applies to each voter.

A social ordering of a constitution is denoted '''R'''. (Context or a subscript distinguishes a voter ordering ''R'' from the same symbol for a social ordering.)

For any two social states ''x'' and ''y'' of a given social ordering ''R'':

'''x P y''' is "social preference" of ''x'' over ''y'' (''x'' is selected over ''y'' by the rule).

'''x I y''' is "social indifference" between ''x'' and ''y'' (both are ranked the same by the rule).

'''x R y''' is either "social preference" of ''x'' over ''y'' or "social indifference" between ''x'' and ''y'' (''x'' is ranked least as good as ''y'' by the rule).

A social ordering applies to each ordering  in the set of orderings (hence the "social" part and the associated amalgamation).  This is so regardless of (dis)similarity between the social ordering and any or all the orderings in the set.  But Arrow places the constitution in the context of ordinalist [[welfare economics]], which attempts to aggregate different tastes in a coherent, plausible way.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
| The social ordering for a given set of orderings as to the set of social states is analogous to an [[Consumer theory|indifference-curve map]]  for an individual as to the set of commodity bundles.  There is no necessary interpretation from this that "society" is just a big voter. Still, the relation of a set of voter orderings to the outcome of the voting rule, whether a social ordering or not, is a focus of the book.
|}

Arrow (pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 26–28) shows how to go from the social ordering ''R'' for a given set of orderings to a particular 'social choice' by specifying:

* the '''environment''', '''S''':  the ''subset'' of social states that is (hypothetically) ''available'' ([[Production possibilities frontier|feasible]] as to [[Factors of production|resource]] quantity and productivity), not merely conceivable.

The social ordering ''R'' then selects the top-ranked social state(s) from the subset as the ''social choice'' set.  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
| This is a generalization from [[consumer theory|consumer demand theory]] with [[perfect competition]] on the buyer's side.  ''S'' corresponds to the set of commodity bundles on or inside the budget constraint for an individual. The consumer's top choice is at the highest indifference curve on the budget constraint.  
|} 
Less informally,  the '''social choice function''' is the function mapping each environment ''S'' of available social states (at least two) for any ''given'' set of orderings (and corresponding social ordering ''R'') to the '''social choice''' set, the set of social states each [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of which is top-ranked (by ''R'') for that environment and that set of orderings.

The social choice function is denoted '''C(S)'''.  Consider an environment that has just two social states, ''x'' and ''y'':  ''C(S)'' = ''C([x, y])''.  Suppose ''x'' is the only top-ranked social state.  Then C([''x'', ''y''])   = {''x''}, the ''social choice'' set.  If ''x'' and ''y'' are instead tied, ''C([x, y])'' = {''x'', ''y''}.  Formally (p.&amp;nbsp;15), ''C(S)'' is the set of all ''x'' in ''S'' such that, for all ''y'' in ''S'', ''x R y'' ("''x'' is at least as good as ''y''").

The next section invokes the following.  Let ''R'' and ''R' '' stand for social orderings of the constitution corresponding to any 2 sets of orderings.  If ''R'' and ''R' '' for the same environment ''S'' map to the same social choice(s), the relation of the identical social choices for ''R'' and ''R' ''is represented as: C(''S'') = C'(''S'').

== Conditions and theorem ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]] --&gt;
A constitution might seem to be a promising alternative  to dictatorship and  vote-immune social convention or external control.  Arrow describes the ''connectedness'' of a social ordering as requiring only that ''some'' social choice be made from any environment of available social states.  Since some social state will prevail, this is hard to deny (especially with no place on the ballot for abstention).  The  ''transitivity'' of a social ordering has an advantage over requiring unanimity (or much less) to change between social states if there is a maladapted ''status quo'' (that is, one subject to "[[path dependence|democratic paralysis]]"). Absent deadlock, transitivity crowds out any reference to the ''status quo'' as a privileged default blocking the path to a social choice (p.&amp;nbsp;120).

Arrow proposes the following "apparently reasonable" '''conditions''' to constrain the social ordering(s) of the constitution (pp.&amp;nbsp;25, 96-97).&lt;ref&gt;The [[mnemonic]] labels`for the conditions are those of Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', p. 41, with the following correspondence.&lt;br&gt;
Arrow  Sen&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''1' '''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''U'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''P'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''3'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   '''I'''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''5'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''D'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1.  '''Universal (Unrestricted) Domain U''' (subsequently so called):  Every logically possible set of orderings maps to its own social ordering.

Each voter is permitted by the constitution to rank the set of social states in any order, though with only one ordering per voter for a given set of orderings.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Arrow refers to a constitution satisfying this condition as '''collective rationality'''.  It can be compared to  the '''rationality''' of a voter ordering.  But the ''[[Universal prescriptivism|prescription]]'' of collective rationality, which Arrow proposes, is distinct from the descriptive use of a voter ordering, which he deploys. Hence, his denial at the end of the book that collective rationality is "merely an illegitimate transfer from the individual to society." (p.&amp;nbsp;120)
|}
*  2.  '''[[Independence of irrelevant alternatives#IIA in social choice theory|Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives]] I''': Let ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;' '', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;' '' be 2 sets of orderings in the constitution. Let ''S'' be a ''subset'' of hypothetically ''available'' (not merely ''conceivable'') social states, say ''x'' and ''y'', from the set of social states. For each voter ''i'', let the ranking of ''x'' and ''y'' be the same for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;'' and  for ''&lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' ''. (Different voters could still have different rankings of the 2 social states.) Then the social orderings for the 2 respective sets of orderings select the same state(s) from the subset as the social choice.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition I''':  Let ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; '' and ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;' '', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;' '' be 2 sets of orderings in the constitution. Let ''S'' be ''any'' subset of hypothetically available social states from the set of social states. For each voter ''i'' and for each pair of ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', let ''x &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;  y'' if and only if ''x &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;' y''. Then the social choice functions for the 2 respective sets of orderings map to an identical social choice set:   ''C(S)'' = ''C'(S)''.
|}
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|This identical mapping happens even with differences in rankings of any voter between the two sets of orderings ''outside that subset'' of social states.  Consider a hypothetical “run-off vote” between say only 2 available social states. The social choice is associated with the sets of rankings ''for that subset'',  not with rankings of unavailable social states ''beyond the subset''.  Thus, that social choice for the subset is unaffected by say a change in orderings only ''beyond'' the subset.    
|}Arrow describes this condition as an extension of [[ordinal utility|ordinalism]] with its emphasis on prospectively observable behavior (for the subset in question).  He ascribes practical advantage to the condition from "every known electoral system" satisfying it (p.&amp;nbsp;110).

*  3.  The (weak) '''Pareto Principle P''':   For any ''x'' and ''y''  in the set of social states, if all prefer ''x'' over ''y'',  then ''x'' is socially selected over ''y''.'''#'''
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"

|As Sen suggests,&lt;ref&gt;Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', ch. 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Pareto unanimity (with universal domain) overrides ''any'' social convention selecting some social state.     
|}
The conditions, particularly the second and third, may seem minimal, but jointly they are harsh, as may be represented in either of two ways.

*  '''[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow’s Theorem]] [1]''':  The 3 conditions of the constitution imply a '''dictator''' who prevails as to the social choice whatever that individual's preference and those of all else.

An alternate statement of the theorem adds the following condition to the above:

*4.  '''Nondictatorship D''':  No voter in the society is a dictator.  That is, there is no voter ''i'' in the society such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of distinct social states ''x'' and ''y'', if voter ''i'' strictly prefers ''x'' over ''y'',  ''x'' is socially selected over ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution" is included here, though not Arrow's statement of '''D''', to remove an ambiguity suggesting that absolute indifference of a voter, negating the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], would constitute dictatorship. On this, see Amartya K. Sen, 1970, ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|'''Condition D''':  There is no voter ''i'' in {''1'', ..., ''n''} such that for every set of orderings in the domain of the constitution and every pair of social states ''x'' and ''y'', ''x &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; y'' implies ''x P y''.
|}
*'''[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's Theorem]] [2]''':  The constitution is '''impossible''', that is, the 4 conditions of a constitution imply a contradiction.

{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|Each voter has an ordering (by attribution). Yet a set of orderings used as an argument of the voting rule does not carry over to a social ordering, with a corresponding loss of social adaptivity and constitutional generality, whether descriptive or prescriptive.
|}   
'''#''' Pareto is stronger than necessary in the proof of the theorem that follows above.  But it is invoked in Arrow (1963, ch. VIII) for a simpler proof than in Arrow (1951). In the latter, Arrow uses 2 other conditions, that with (2) above imply Pareto (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;97; 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;127):  
* 3a. '''[[Monotonicity]] M''' ('''Positive Association of Individual and Social Values'''), as in Arrow (1987, p.&amp;nbsp;125):  For a given set of orderings with social ordering ''R'', such that state ''x'' is socially preferred  to  state ''y'', if the preference for ''x'' rises in some individual ordering(s) and falls in none, ''x'' is also socially preferred to ''y'' in the social ordering for the new set of orderings.
Arrow (1951, p.&amp;nbsp;26) describes social welfare here as at least not negatively related to individual preferences.  
* 3b.  As defined by Arrow (1951, pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29), an '''Imposed Constitution''' is a constitution such that for some alternative social states ''x'' and ''y'' and for any set of orderings  ''&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;'', ..., ''&lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt;'' in the domain and corresponding social ordering ''R'', the social ranking is ''x R y''.
:'''Non-imposition N'''  ('''Citizens' Sovereignty'''): A constitution is not to be imposed.

Under imposition, for every set of orderings in the domain, the social ranking for at least one ''x'' and ''y'' is only ''x R y''.  The vote makes no difference to the outcome.  
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="10"
|For the special case of all preferring ''y'' over ''x'', the vote  still makes no difference.  If the invariant social ranking applies to only one pair of distinct social states, the constitution would violate '''N'''.  In this respect, as a representation of excluding convention, '''N''' is thorough.   
|}

==Proof==
The proof is in two parts (Arrow, 1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;97–100).  The first part considers the hypothetical case of some one voter's  ordering that ''prevails'' ('is decisive') as to the social choice for ''some'' pair of social states no matter what that voter's preference for the pair, despite all other voters opposing.   It is shown that, for a constitution satisfying '''Unrestricted Domain''', '''Pareto''' and '''Independence''',  that voter's ordering would prevail for ''every'' pair of social states, no matter what the orderings of others.   So, the voter would be a '''Dictator'''. Thus, '''Nondictatorship''' requires postulating that no one would so prevail for even one pair of social states.

The second part considers more generally a set of voters that would prevail for some pair of social states, despite all other voters (if any) preferring otherwise.  '''Pareto'''  and '''Unrestricted Domain''' for a constitution imply that such a set would at least include the entire set of voters.  By '''Nondictatorship''', the set must have at least 2 voters.  Among all such sets, postulate a set such that no other set is smaller.   Such a set can be constructed with '''Unrestricted Domain''' and an adaptation of the [[voting paradox]] to imply a still smaller set. This contradicts the postulate and so proves the theorem.

== Summary, interpretation, and aftereffects ==
The book proposes some apparently reasonable conditions for a "voting" rule, in particular, a 'constitution', to make consistent,  feasible social choices in a [[welfarism|welfarist]] context. But then any constitution that allows dictatorship requires it, and any constitution that requires nondictatorship contradicts one of the other conditions.  Hence, the ''paradox of social choice''.

The set of ''conditions'' across ''different'' possible votes refined [[welfare economics]] and differentiated Arrow's constitution from the ''pre-Arrow [[social welfare function]]''.  In so doing, it also ruled out any one consistent social ordering to which an [[agent (economics)|agent]] or official might appeal in trying to implement social welfare through the votes of other''s'' under the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abram Bergson]], 1954. "On the Concept of Social Welfare," ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 68(2), p. 242 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1884448 &amp;#91;pp. 233&amp;#93;-252] — an interpretation, which Arrow (1963, pp. 106-7) notes as in agreement with his own view of the constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result generalizes and deepens the [[voting paradox]] to any voting rule satisfying the conditions, however complex or comprehensive.

The 1963 edition includes an additional chapter with a simpler proof of [[Arrow's Theorem]] and corrects an earlier point noted by Blau.&lt;ref&gt;Julian H. Blau, 1957. "The Existence of Social Welfare Functions,"  ''Econometrica'', 25(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1910256 p. 302]-313.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also elaborates on advantages of the conditions and cites studies of [[William H. Riker|Riker]]&lt;ref&gt;William H. Riker, 1958.  “The Paradox of Voting and Congressional Rules for Voting on Amendments.” ''American Political Science Review'', 52, p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1952321 p. 349]-366.&lt;/ref&gt;   and [[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Dahl, 1956. ''A Preface to Democratic Theory'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95Zpl8C0-wYC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22A+Preface+to+Democratic+Theory%22+39&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDvIKL8_Pv&amp;sig=zgye9PpbHZDDy25kKESWqXLxUPg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pqHhS_qGI8OBlAeOyfyLAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 39-41.]&lt;/ref&gt; that as an empirical matter [[intransitivity]] of the voting mechanism may produce unsatisfactory inaction or majority opposition.  These support Arrow's characterization of a constitution across possible votes (that is, collective rationality) as "an important attribute of a genuinely democratic system capable of full adaptation to varying environments" (p.&amp;nbsp;120).

The theorem might seem to have unravelled a skein of behavior-based social-ethical theory from [[invisible hand|Adam Smith]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] on.  But Arrow himself expresses hope at the end of his Nobel prize lecture that, though the philosophical and distributive implications of the paradox of social choice were "still not clear,"  others would "take this paradox as a challenge rather than as a discouraging barrier."

The large subsequent literature has included reformulation to extend, weaken, or replace the conditions and derive implications.  In this respect Arrow's framework has been an instrument for generalizing [[voting theory]] and critically  evaluating and  broadening [[economic policy]] and [[social choice theory]].

{{Socialist Republic of Romania}}

The '''Socialist Republic of Romania''' ({{lang-ro|Republica Socialistă România, RSR}}) refers to [[Romania]] under [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Communist state|communist rule]] that existed officially from 1947 to 1989. From 1947 to 1965, the state was known as the '''Romanian People's Republic''' ({{lang|ro|Republica Populară Romînă, RPR}}). The country was a [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet-aligned]] [[Eastern Bloc]] state with a dominant role for the [[Romanian Communist Party]] enshrined in [[:Template:RomanianConstitutions|its constitutions]].

As [[World War II]] ended, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], a former [[Axis powers|Axis]] member, was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], the sole representative of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. On 6 March 1945, after mass demonstrations by communist sympathizers and political pressure from the Soviet representative of the [[Allied Control Commission]], a new pro-Soviet government that included members of the previously outlawed [[Romanian Workers' Party]] was installed. Gradually, more members of the Workers' Party and communist-aligned parties gained control of the administration and pre-war political leaders were steadily eliminated from political life. In December 1947, [[Michael of Romania|King Michael]] was coerced to [[abdicate]] and the People's Republic of Romania was declared.

At first, Romania's scarce post-war resources were drained by the "[[SovRom]]s", new tax-exempt Soviet-Romanian companies that allowed the Soviet Union to control Romania's major sources of income.&lt;ref name="Zwass"&gt;Zwass, A. From Failed Communism to Underdeveloped Capitalism: Transformation of Eastern Europe, the Post-Soviet Union, and China. M.E. Sharpe, 1995 {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drain was the [[war reparations]] paid to the Soviet Union. In the 1950s, however, Romania's communist government began to assert more independence, inducing, for example, the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Romania by 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1989-803-01-Verona.pdf |title=Final report |date= December 1989|website=www.ucis.pitt.edu|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] became General Secretary of the Communist Party (1965), Chairman of the State Council (1967) and assumed the newly established role of [[President of Romania|President]] in 1974. Ceaușescu's denunciation of the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] and a brief relaxation in internal repression helped give him a positive image both at home and in the West. However, rapid economic growth fueled in part by foreign credits gradually gave way to an [[Austerity in Romania|austerity]] and [[July Theses|political repression]] that led to [[Romanian Revolution|the fall]] of his [[totalitarian]] government in [[Revolutions of 1989|December 1989]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A large number of people were executed or died in custody during communist Romania's existence, most during the Stalinist era of the 1950s.

The author gives an estimate of 200,000 dead at the Danube-Black Sea Canal alone.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more were imprisoned for political, economical or other reasons and suffered abuse, torture and/or death.

Geographically, Romania bordered the [[Black Sea]] to the east; the [[Soviet Union]] (via the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSRs]]) to the north and east; [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] to the west and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] to the south.

{{Eastern Bloc sidebar| Allied states}}

===Soviet occupation and rise of the Communists===
{{main|Soviet occupation of Romania}}
When [[Michael of Romania|King Michael]], supported by the main political parties, overthrew [[Ion Antonescu]] in August 1944, breaking Romania away from the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and bringing it over to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] side, Michael could do nothing to erase the memory of his country's recent active participation in the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Romanian forces fought under Soviet command, driving through Northern [[Transylvania]] into Hungary proper, and on into [[Czechoslovakia]] and Austria. However, the Soviets treated Romania as conquered territory,&lt;ref&gt;Romulus Rusan (dir.), in ''Du passé faisons table rase ! Histoire et mémoire du communisme en Europe'', Robert Laffont, Paris, 2002, p. 376–377&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet troops remained in the country as occupying forces under the pretext that Romanian authorities could not guarantee the security and stability of Northern Transylvania.

The [[Yalta Conference]] had granted the Soviet Union a predominant interest in Romania, the [[Paris Peace Treaties]] failed to acknowledge Romania as a [[co-belligerence|co-belligerent]], and the [[Red Army]] was sitting on Romanian soil. The Communists, as all political parties, played only a minor role in the first Michael's wartime governments, headed by General [[Constantin Sănătescu]], though their presence increased in the one led by [[Nicolae Rădescu]]. This changed in March 1945, when Dr. [[Petru Groza]] of the [[Ploughmen's Front]], a party closely associated with the Communists, became prime minister. His government was broad-based on paper, including members of most major prewar parties except the [[Iron Guard]]. However, the Communists held the key ministries, and most of the ministers nominally representing non-Communist parties were, like Groza himself, [[fellow traveler]]s.

The King was not happy with the direction of this government, but when he attempted to force Groza's resignation by refusing to sign any legislation (a move known as "the royal strike"), Groza simply chose to enact laws without bothering to obtain Michael's signature. On 8 November 1945, King Michael's [[name day]], a pro-monarchy demonstration in front of the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Royal Palace]] in [[Bucharest]] escalated into street fights between opposition supporters and soldiers, police and pro-government workers, resulting in dozens of killed and wounded; Soviet officers restrained Romanian soldiers and police from firing on civilians, and Soviet troops restored order.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;David R. Stone, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592290500533775 "The 1945 Ethridge Mission to Bulgaria and Romania and the Origins of the Cold War in the Balkans"], Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft, Volume 17, no. 1, March 2006, pp. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the King's disapproval, the first Groza government brought [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and women's [[suffrage]]. However, it also brought the beginnings of Soviet domination of Romania. In the [[Romanian general election, 1946|elections of 19 November 1946]], the Communist-led Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD) claimed 84% of the votes. These elections were characterized by widespread irregularities, including intimidation, electoral fraud, and assassinations&lt;!--ref&gt;Giurescu, "«Alegeri» după model sovietic", p.17 (citing Berry), 18 (citing Berry and note); Macuc, p.40; Tismăneanu, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giurescu p.18"&gt;Giurescu, "«Alegeri» după model sovietic", p.18&lt;/ref--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Cioroianu, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Archives confirm suspicions at the time that the election results were, in fact, falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Frucht, R. ''Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture, Volume 1'', pg. 759. ABC-CLIO (2005).&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After forming a government, the Communists moved to eliminate the role of the [[centrist]] parties; notably, the [[National Peasants' Party]] was accused of espionage after it became clear in 1947 that their leaders were meeting secretly with United States officials. A [[show trial]] of their leadership was then arranged, and they were put in jail. Other parties were forced to "merge" with the Communists. In 1946 and 1947, several high-ranking members in the pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] government were executed as war criminals, primarily for their involvement in the Holocaust and for attacking the Soviet Union. Antonescu himself was executed 1 June 1946.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

By 1947, Romania remained the only monarchy in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. On 30 December that year, Michael was at his palace in Sinaia when Groza and Gheorghiu-Dej summoned him back to Bucharest. They presented him with a pretyped instrument of abdication and demanded that he sign it.  With pro-Communist troops surrounding his palace and his telephone lines cut, Michael was forced to sign the document.  Hours later, Parliament abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Romania a [[People's Republic]]. In February 1948, the Communists forced what remained of the Social Democrats to merge with them to form the '''[[Romanian Workers' Party]].'''  However, the few remaining independent-minded Socialists were soon pushed out, and the merged party was the PCR with a new name. Meanwhile, most non-Communist politicians had either been imprisoned or fled into exile.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Communist regime was formalized with the [[1948 Constitution of Romania|constitution of 13 April 1948]]. The new constitution was a near-copy of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]. It forbade and punished any association which had a "fascist or anti-democratic nature"—- which was broadly interpreted to ban any party not willing to do the Communists' bidding.  It also granted freedom of the press, speech and assembly for the working class. In the face of wide-scale killings, imprisonments and harassment of local peasants during forced collectivization, private-property nationalization and political oppression, the rights and freedoms spelled out in the Constitution of 1948 and its two successors (in [[1952 Constitution of Romania|1952]] and [[1965 Constitution of Romania|1965]]) were never respected by governments or the new judges appointed during the 42 years of undisguised Communist rule.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although these successive constitutions provided a simulacrum of religious freedom, the regime in fact had a policy of promoting atheism, coupled with [[Religious persecution in Communist Romania|religious persecution]]. The role of religious bodies was strictly limited to their houses of worship, and large public demonstrations were strictly forbidden. In 1948, in order to minimize the role of the clergy in society, the government adopted a decree nationalizing church property, including schools.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Chiriac, ''Provocările diversitătii: politici publice privind minoritățile naționale și religioase în România'', p. 111.

After the initial waves of militant atheism were spent, a strong spiritual renewal movement took place in the late 1950s, and there has been a stream of notable spiritual figures both before and after communism. ... There was also a lack of consistent suppression of the Romanian Orthodox church by communist authorities.  A large number of churches were left open, and monasteries continued to function."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanian People's Republic===

====Early years====
[[Image:РумынияСталин.jpg|thumb|left|1949 stamp celebrating Romanian-Soviet friendship.]]

The early years of Communist rule in Romania were marked by repeated changes of course and by numerous arrests and imprisonments as factions contended for dominance. The country's resources were also drained by the Soviet's [[SovRom]] agreements, which facilitated shipping of Romanian goods to the Soviet Union at nominal prices.

On 11 June 1948, all banks and large businesses were [[Nationalization|nationalized]].

In the Communist leadership, there appear to have been three important factions, all of them [[Stalinist]], differentiated more by their respective personal histories than by any deep political or philosophical differences:

#The "Muscovites", notably [[Ana Pauker]] and [[Vasile Luca]], had spent the war in Moscow.
#The "Prison Communists", notably [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], had been imprisoned during the war.
#The somewhat less firmly Stalinist "Secretariat Communists", notably [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]] had made it through the Antonescu years by hiding within Romania and had participated in the broad governments immediately after [[Romania during World War II#The royal coup|King Michael's 1944 coup]].

Pauker and her allies were labeled as the "Muskovite [foreign] faction" and accused of deviating to the left and right. For instance, they were initially allied on not liquidating the rural bourgeoise, but later shifted their position.

Ultimately, with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s backing, Gheorghiu-Dej and the "Prison Communists" won out. Pauker was purged from the party (along with 192,000 other party members); Pătrășcanu was executed after a [[show trial]].

====Gheorghiu-Dej era====
[[File:IICCR FA186 Dej post 1946 elections meeting.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] speaking at a workers' rally in [[Piața Unirii|Nation Square, Bucharest]] after the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 general election]].]]

[[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej|Gheorghiu-Dej]], a committed Stalinist, was unhappy with the reforms in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s Soviet Union after Stalin's death in 1953. He also balked at [[Comecon]]'s goal of turning Romania into the "breadbasket" of the East Bloc, pursuing an economic plan based on heavy industry and energy production. He closed Romania's largest labor camps, abandoned the [[Danube–Black Sea Canal]] project, halted rationing and hiked workers' wages. These factors combined to put Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej on a relatively independent and nationalist route.

Gheorghiu-Dej identified with [[Stalinism]], and the more liberal Soviet government threatened to undermine his authority. In an effort to reinforce his position, Gheorghiu-Dej pledged cooperation with any state, regardless of political-economic system, as long as it recognized international equality and did not interfere in other nations' domestic affairs. This policy led to a tightening of Romania's bonds with China, which also advocated national self-determination and opposed Soviet hegemonism.

Gheorghiu-Dej resigned as the party's general secretary in 1954 but retained the premiership; a four-member collective secretariat, including [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], controlled the party for a year before Gheorghiu-Dej again took up the reins. Despite its new policy of international cooperation, Romania joined the Warsaw Treaty Organization ([[Warsaw Pact]]) in 1955, which entailed subordinating and integrating a portion of its military into the Soviet military machine. Romania later refused to allow Warsaw Pact maneuvers on its soil and limited its participation in military maneuvers elsewhere within the alliance.

In 1956, the Soviet premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], denounced Stalin in a [[Secret Speech|secret speech]] before the Twentieth Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). Gheorghiu-Dej and the leadership of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]] (''Partidul Muncitoresc Român, PMR'') were fully braced to weather de-Stalinization. Gheorghiu-Dej made Pauker, Luca and Georgescu scapegoats for the Romanian communist past excesses and claimed that the Romanian party had purged its Stalinist elements even before Stalin died in 1953. In all likelihood, Gheorghiu-Dej himself ordered the violence and coercion in the collectivization movements, since he did not rebuke those who perpetuated abuses. In fact, Pauker reprimanded any cadre who forced peasants, and once she was purged, the violence reappeared.

In October 1956, Poland's communist leaders refused to succumb to Soviet military threats to intervene in domestic political affairs and install a more obedient [[politburo]]. A few weeks later, the Communist Party in Hungary virtually disintegrated during a popular revolution. Poland's [[Polish October|defiance]] and Hungary's popular uprising inspired Romanian students to organize meetings in București, Cluj and Timișoara calling for liberty, better living conditions, and an end to Soviet domination. Under the pretext that the Hungarian uprising might incite his nation's own revolt, Gheorghiu-Dej took radical measures which meant persecutions and jailing of various "suspects", especially people of Hungarian origin. He also advocated swift Soviet intervention, and the Soviet Union reinforced its military presence in Romania, particularly along the Hungarian border. Although Romania's unrest proved fragmentary and controllable, Hungary's was not, so in November Moscow mounted a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|bloody invasion]] of Hungary.

After the Revolution of 1956, Gheorghiu-Dej worked closely with Hungary's new leader, [[János Kádár]], who was installed by the Soviet Union. Romania took Hungary's former premier (leader of the 1956 revolution) [[Imre Nagy]] into custody. He was jailed at Snagov, north of Bucharest. After a series of interrogations by Soviets and Romanian authorities, Nagy was returned to [[Budapest]] for trial and execution.
In [[Transylvania]], the Romanian authorities merged Hungarian and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] universities at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], putting an end to the Hungarian Bólyai University, and also worked on gradually eliminating Hungarian education in middle schools by transforming them into Romanian ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Gheorghiu-Dej spread fears about Hungary wanting to take over Transylvania. He took a two-pronged approach to the problem, arresting the leaders of the Hungarian People's Alliance, but, under Soviet pressure, establishing a nominally [[Magyar Autonomous Region|autonomous Hungarian region]] in the [[Székely Land]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Romania's government also took measures to reduce public discontent by reducing investments in heavy industry, boosting output of consumer goods, decentralizing economic management, hiking wages and incentives, and instituting elements of worker management. The authorities eliminated compulsory deliveries for private farmers but reaccelerated the collectivization program in the mid-1950s, albeit less brutally than earlier. The government declared collectivization complete in 1962, when collective and state farms controlled 77% of the [[arable land]].

Despite Gheorghiu-Dej's claim that he had purged the Romanian party of Stalinists, he remained susceptible to attack for his obvious complicity in the party's activities from 1944 to 1953. At a plenary PMR meeting in March 1956, [[Miron Constantinescu]] and [[Iosif Chișinevschi]], both [[Politburo]] members and deputy premiers, criticized Gheorghiu-Dej. Constantinescu, who advocated a Khrushchev-style liberalization, posed a particular threat to Gheorghiu-Dej because he enjoyed good connections with the Moscow leadership. The PMR purged Constantinescu and Chișinevschi in 1957, denouncing both as Stalinists and charging them with complicity with Pauker. Afterwards, Gheorghiu-Dej faced no serious challenge to his leadership. Ceaușescu replaced Constantinescu as head of PMR cadres.

The cadres — anyone who was not a rank-and-file member of the Communist Party — were deemed the Party's vanguard, as they were entrusted with the power to construct a new social order and the forms of power that would sustain it. They still underwent extensive surveillance, which created an environment of competition and rivalry.

====Persecution, the labour camp system and anti-communist resistance====
{{main|Romanian anti-communist resistance movement|Bărăgan deportations|Pitești prison}}
[[File:Romania's Resistance 1948-1960.jpg|thumb|left|Armed resistance against the government]]
{{History of Romania| expanded= Socialist Republic of Romania}}

Once the Communist government became more entrenched, the number of arrests increased. All strata of society were involved, but particularly targeted were the prewar elites, such as intellectuals, clerics, teachers, former politicians (even if they had left-leaning views) {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and anybody who could potentially form the nucleus of anti-Communist resistance. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The existing prisons were filled with political prisoners, and a new system of forced labor camps and prisons was created, modeled after the Soviet Gulag. A decision to put into practice the century-old project for a [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]] served as a pretext for the erection of several labor camps, where numerous people died. Some of the most notorious prisons included [[Sighet]], [[Gherla]], [[Pitești]] and [[Aiud]], and forced labor camps were set up at lead mines and in the [[Danube Delta]].

One of the most notorious and infamous brainwashing experiments in Eastern Europe's history took place in Romania, in the political prison of Piteşti, a small town, about 120&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Bucharest. This prison is infamous in Romania still for the so-called 'Piteşti experiment' or Piteşti phenomenon, conducted there between 1949 and 1952. The [[Pitești prison|prison in Pitești]] and the Pitesti experiment aimed to 'reeducate' the (real or imagined) opponents of the regime. It involved psychological and physical torture of prisoners, and the submission of them to humiliating, degrading and dehumanizing acts. Tens of people died in this 'experiment', but its aim was not to kill the people, but to 'reeducate' them. Some of those who were thus 'reeducated' later became torturers themselves. Of those who survived Piteşti, many either took their own lives or ended up in mental institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Dragomir, Mircea Stănescu, 'The Media vs. Historical Accuracy. How Romania's Current Communist Trials Are Being Misrepresented', http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2015/01/11/the-media-vs-historical-accuracy-how-romanias-current-communist-trials-are-being-misrepresented/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist government also decided on the [[Bărăgan deportations|deportation of peasants]] from the [[Banat]] (south-west Transylvania, at the border with Yugoslavia), started on 18 June 1951. About 45,000 people were forcibly "resettled" in lesser populated regions on the eastern plains ([[Bărăgan Plain|Bărăgan]]). The government decision was directed towards creating a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], but was also used as an intimidation tactic to force the remaining peasants to join collective farms. Most deportees lived in the Bărăgan for 5 years (until 1956), but some remained there permanently.

Anti-communist resistance also had an organized form, and many people opposing the government took up arms and formed partisan groups, comprising 10–40 people. There were attacks on police posts and sabotage. Some of the famous partisans were [[Elisabeta Rizea]] from [[Nucșoara]] and [[Gheorghe Arsenescu]]. Despite a large number of secret police (''[[Securitate]]'') and army troops massed against them, armed resistance in the mountains continued until the early 1960s, and one of the best known partisan leaders was not captured until 1974.

Another form of anti-communist resistance, non-violent this time, was the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956|student movement of 1956]]. In reaction to the anti-communist revolt in Hungary, echoes were felt all over the Eastern bloc. Protests took place in some university centers resulting in numerous arrests and expulsions. The most organised student movement was in [[Timișoara]], where 3000 were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/2007-10-25/trei-mii-de-studenti-timisoreni-arestati-si-torturati.html Trei mii de studenți timișoreni, arestați și torturați]", ''România liberă'', 25 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bucharest and Cluj, organised groups were set up which tried to make common cause with the anti-communist movement in Hungary and coordinate activity. The authorities' reaction was immediate – students were arrested or suspended from their courses, some teachers were dismissed, and new associations were set up to supervise student activities.

Tens of thousands of people were killed as part of repression and [[Collectivization in Romania|agricultural collectivization]] in Communist Romania primarily under Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;Valentino, Benjamin A (2005). Final solutions: mass killing and genocide in the twentieth century. Cornell University Press. pp. 91–151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, Rudolph, Statistics of Democide, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ceaușescu government===
[[File:Nicolae Ceaușescu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]]]
[[Gheorghiu-Dej]] died in 1965 in unclear circumstances{{spaced ndash}}his death apparently occurred when he was in Moscow for medical treatment{{spaced ndash}}and, after a  power struggle, was succeeded by the previously obscure [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]. Where Gheorghiu-Dej had hewed to a Stalinist line while the Soviet Union was in a reformist period, Ceaușescu initially appeared to be a reformist.

During his last two years, Gheorghiu-Dej had exploited the Soviet–Chinese dispute and begun to oppose the [[hegemony]] of the Soviet Union. Ceaușescu, supported by colleagues of Gheorghiu-Dej such as Maurer, continued this popular line. Relations with Western countries and many other states began to be strengthened in what seemed to be the national interest of Romania. The forced Soviet (mostly Russian) cultural influence in the country which characterized the 1950s [[De-Russification#Romania 1960s|was stopped]] and Western media was allowed to circulate in Romania instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oIZkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UnQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=710,2798537 |title=Henry Shapiro, "Red Cultural Influence Vanishing in Romania", United Press International published in the Wilmington (N.C.) '&amp;#39;Star-News'&amp;#39;, July 16, 1965 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1965-07-17 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First years====
On 21 August 1965, following the example of Czechoslovakia, the name of the country was changed to "Socialist Republic of Romania" (''Republica Socialistă România, RSR'') and PMR's old name was restored (''Partidul Comunist Român, PCR''; "Romanian Communist Party").

In his early years in power, Ceaușescu was genuinely popular, both at home and abroad. Agricultural goods were abundant, consumer goods began to reappear, there was a cultural thaw, and, what was important abroad, he spoke out against the 1968 Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]]. While his reputation at home soon paled, he continued to have uncommonly good relations with Western governments and with international capitalist institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] because of his independent political line. Romania under Ceaușescu maintained and sometimes improved diplomatic and other relations with, among others, [[West Germany]], [[Israel]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], and [[Pinochet]]'s [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973-90)|Chile]], all for various reasons not on good terms with Moscow.

====Human rights issues====
[[File:BirthDeath_1950_RO.svg|thumb|Demographics graphs. A huge surge of the birth rate in 1967, as a result of [[Decree 770]], is the most prominent feature of these graphs]]
Concerned about the country's low birthrates, Nicolae Ceaușescu enacted an aggressive [[natalist]] policy, which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people. This period has later been depicted in movies and documentaries (such as ''[[4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days]]'', ''Children of the Decree''). To counter the sharp decline of the population, the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] decided that the Romanian population should be increased from 23 to 30 million inhabitants. In October 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legex.ro/Decretul-770-1966-363.aspx|title=Decretul 770/1966 - Legislatie gratuita|website=www.legex.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decree 770]] was authorized by Ceaușescu.

These pro-natalist measures had some degree of success, as a baby boom resulted in the late 1960s, with the generations born in 1967 and 1968 being the largest in the country's history.  The natalist policies temporarily increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a later decline due to an increased use of [[illegal abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/16/6/590/743745|title=Europe the continent with the lowest fertility|date=1 November 2010|publisher=|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=16|issue=6|pages=590–602|via=humupd.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://srh.bmj.com/content/39/1/2|title=The remarkable story of Romanian women's struggle to manage their fertility|first1=Mihai|last1=Horga|first2=Caitlin|last2=Gerdts|first3=Malcolm|last3=Potts|date=1 January 2013|publisher=|journal=J Fam Plann Reprod Health Care|volume=39|issue=1|pages=2–4|via=jfprhc.bmj.com|doi=10.1136/jfprhc-2012-100498|pmid=23296845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu's policy resulted in the deaths of over 9,000 women due to illegal abortions,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of Ceaușescu's natalist policy was that a generation that may not otherwise have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=|via=Clays Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other restrictions of human rights included invasion of privacy by the secret police (the "[[Securitate]]"), censorship and relocation, but not on the same scale as in the 1950s.

During the Ceaușescu era, there was a secret ongoing "trade" between Romania on one side and Israel and West Germany on the other side, under which Israel and West Germany paid money to Romania to allow Romanian citizens with certified Jewish or German ancestry to emigrate to Israel and West Germany, respectively.

====Industrialization====
[[File:Defilare 23 August.jpg|thumb|left|23 August demonstration.]]

Ceaușescu's Romania continued to pursue Gheorghiu-Dej's policy of [[industrialization]]. Romania made progress with the economy. From 1951 to 1974, Romania's gross industrial output increased at an average annual rate of 13 percent. Several branches of heavy industry were founded, including the  machine-tool, tractor, and automotive industries; large-tonnage shipbuilding; the manufacture of electric diesel locomotives; and the electronics and petrochemical industries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the realm of foreign trade, Socialist Romania exported machinery, consumer goods, chemicals, agricultural products, and petroleum products.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Prior to the mid-1970s, Bucharest, as most other cities, was developed by expanding the city, especially towards the south, east and west. High density residential neighbourhoods were built on the outskirts of the city, some (such as [[Drumul Taberei]], [[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]], [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]] or [[Giurgiului]]) of architectural and urban planning value. Conservation plans were made, especially during the 1960s and early 1970s, but all were halted after Ceaușescu embarked on what is known as "The Small [[Cultural Revolution]]" ("Mica revoluție culturală"), after visiting [[North Korea]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] and then delivering a speech known as the [[July Theses]]. In the late 1970s, the construction of the [[Bucharest Metro]] system was started. After two years, 10&amp;nbsp;km of network were already complete and after another 2 years, 9&amp;nbsp;km of tunnels were ready for use. By 17 August 1989, 49.01&amp;nbsp;km of the subway system and 34 stations were already in use.

[[File:TimbruPionieri1.png|thumb|right|1979 [[postage stamp]].]]

The [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|earthquake of 1977]] shocked Bucharest; many buildings collapsed, and many others were weakened. This was the backdrop that led to a policy of large-scale demolition which affected monuments of historical significance or architectural masterpieces such as the monumental Vǎcǎrești Monastery (1722), the "Sfânta Vineri" (1645) and "Enei" (1611) Churches, the Cotroceni (1679) and Pantelimon (1750) Monasteries, and the [[art deco]] "Republic's Stadium" (ANEF Stadium, 1926). Even the Palace of Justice – built by Romania's foremost architect, [[Ion Mincu]] – was scheduled for demolition in early 1990, according to the systematisation papers. Yet another tactic was abandoning and neglecting buildings and bringing them into such a state that they would require being torn down.

Thus, the policy towards the city after the earthquake was not one of reconstruction, but one of demolition and building anew. An analysis by the Union of Architects, commissioned in 1990, claims that over 2000 buildings were torn down, with over 77 of very high architectural importance, most of them in good condition. Even Gara de Nord (the city's main railway station), listed on the Romanian Architectural Heritage List, was scheduled to be torn down and replaced in early 1992.

Despite all of this, and despite the much-questioned treatment of HIV-infected [[orphan]]s,&lt;ref name="nytimes-children"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/24/magazine/romania-s-lost-children-a-photo-essay-by-james-nachtwey.html | work=The New York Times | title=ROMANIA'S LOST CHILDREN: A Photo Essay by James Nachtwey | first=Kathleen | last=Hunt | date=24 June 1990 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the country continued to have a notably good system of schools. Also, not every industrialization project was a failure: Ceaușescu left Romania with a reasonably effective system of power generation and transmission, gave Bucharest [[Bucharest Metro|a functioning subway]], and left many cities with an increase in habitable apartment buildings.

Romania continued to make progress. High rates of growth in production created conditions for raising living standards of the people. From 1950 to the mid-1980s, average net wages increased more than eightfold. The consumption fund increased 22-fold, and a broad program of building cultural facilities and housing was carried out. Over 80 percent of the country's population had moved to new apartments during this period.&lt;ref name="International Affairs 1985"&gt;''International Affairs'',  No. 3,  Vol.31, 1985, page(s): 141–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all this, living standards in the country remained some of Europe's lowest and as early as 1981, there were clear signs of public discontent, such as riots and an angry mob throwing rocks at Ceaușescu's helicopter while it made a flight to Transylvania that October. Ceaușescu desired to repay Western loans, and thus enacted a harsh austerity policy, including [[rationing]] of food, gas, heating and electricity. People in cities had to turn to natural gas containers (''"butelii"'') or charcoal stoves, even though they were connected to the gas mains.
With full-scale food rationing in place, the Communist Party published official guidelines on how Romanians could eat nutritiously while reducing their calorie intake by 25%. There was a shortage of available goods for the average Romanian. By 1984, despite a high crop yield and increased food production, wide-scale food rationing was introduced. The government promoted it as "rational eating" and "a means to reduce obesity". Most of what was available were export rejects, as most of the quality goods were exported, even underpriced, in order to obtain [[hard currency]], either to pay the debt, or to push forward in the ever-growing pursuit of heavy industrialization.

Measures in the mechanization and chemicalization of farming helped to increase the output of agricultural products. In 1950, more than 300&amp;nbsp;kg of cereals was gathered per head of the population; by 1982 this amount had increased to 1 ton per person. Meat production increased from 29.5 to 100&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="International Affairs 1985"/&gt;

In the late 1980s, the United Nations Human Development report classified Romania as having had high human development. The life expectancy was 71 years, the literacy rate was 96%, and the Real GDP per capita was $3000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_1990_en_indicators1.pdf|title=- Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985, despite Romania's huge refining capacity, petroleum products were strictly rationed with supplies drastically cut, a Sunday curfew was instated, and many buses used [[methane]] propulsion (they were mockingly named "bombs"); taxis were converted to burning [[methanol]]. Electricity was rationed to divert supplies to heavy industry, with a maximum monthly allowed consumption of 20 [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] per family (everything over this limit was heavily taxed). Only one in five streetlights was kept on, and television was reduced to a single channel broadcasting just 2 hours each day. All these policies combined led Romanians to have the lowest standard of living in Europe, with the possible exception of Albania.

====Systematization: demolition and reconstruction====
{{Main|Systematization (Romania)}}
[[File:Boulevard Unirii.jpg|thumb|left|Civic Center, Bucharest]]
[[Systematization (Romania)|Systematization]] ({{lang-ro|Sistematizarea}}) refers to the  program of [[urban planning]] carried out under  Ceaușescu's  regime. After a visit to [[North Korea]] in 1971, Ceaușescu was impressed by the ''[[Juche]]'' ideology of that country, and began a massive campaign shortly afterwards.

Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a "multilaterally developed [[Communist state|socialist society]]". The policy largely consisted in the mass construction of high-density blocks of flats (''blocuri'').

During the 1980s, Ceaușescu became obsessed with building himself a [[Palace of the People (Romania)|palace]] of unprecedented proportions, along with an equally grandiose neighborhood, [[Centrul Civic]], to accompany it. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted [[Art Deco]] sports stadium, in order to make way for the grandiose [[Centrul Civic]] (Civic center) and the House of the Republic, now officially renamed the [[Palace of Parliament]], were the most extreme manifestation of the systematization policy.

====Last years: increased social control====
[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Communist government fostered the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|personality cult of Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena]]]]
[[File:Soimii_Patriei_1983.jpg|thumb|Children members of ''Șoimii Patriei'', a communist youth organization created in 1976 for children aged 4-7. Notice Nicolae Ceaușescu's  portrait on the wall]]

Control over society became stricter and stricter, with an [[East Germany|East German]]-style [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc|phone bugging system]] installed, and with [[Securitate]] recruiting more agents, extending censorship and keeping tabs and records on a large segment of the population. By 1989, according to CNSAS (the Council for Studies of the Archives of the Former Securitate), one in three Romanians was an informant for the Securitate. Due to this situation, income from tourism dropped substantially, the number of foreign tourists visiting Romania dropping by 75%, with the three main tour operators that organized trips in Romania leaving the country by 1987. Ceausescu also started becoming the subject of [[Nicolae Ceausescu's cult of personality|a vast personality cult]], his portrait on every street and hanging in every public building.

By 1988, with [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] policies in effect in the Soviet Union and China undergoing [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]], Romania's [[Stalinist]] sociopolitical system began to look increasingly out-of-place, but all attempts were made to keep the populace isolated from events going on outside the country. Also, while the West had been willing in the past to overlook Ceausescu's human rights record in lieu of his independent, anti-Soviet stance, this was becoming less relevant with the Cold War winding down. As such, Romania started coming under fire from the US and its allies, but such complaints were merely brushed off as "unwelcome interference in our nation's internal affairs".

There was also a revival of the effort to build:
*a [[Danube–Black Sea Canal]], which was completed,
*a nationwide canal system and irrigation network, some of which was completed, but most of which is still a project, or was abandoned,
*an effort to improve the railway system with electrification and a modern control system,
*the [[Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant]],
*a national [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power system, including the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Porțile de Fier]] power station on the [[Danube]] in cooperation with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]],
*a network of oil refineries,
*a fairly developed oceanic fishing fleet,
*naval shipyards at [[Constanța]],
*a good industrial basis for the chemical and heavy machinery industries, and
*a rather well-developed foreign policy

====Pollution====
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=June 2009}}
Another legacy of this era was pollution: Ceaușescu's government scored badly on this count even by the standards of the Eastern European communist states. Examples include [[Copșa Mică]] with its infamous [[Copșa Mică works|Carbon Powder factory]] (in the 1980s, the whole city could be seen from [[satellite]] as covered by a thick black cloud), [[Hunedoara steel works|Hunedoara]], or the plan, launched in 1989, to convert the unique [[Danube Delta]] – a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] – to plain agricultural fields.

===Downfall===

====Brașov Riot====
{{main|Brașov Rebellion}}
December 1989 was the last act of a finale that had started in 1987, in Brașov. The anti-communist riot in Brașov on 15 November 1987 was the main political event that announced the imminent fall of communism in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Hurezeanu, as quoted (see note below) by: {{ro icon}} "Ziua care nu se uita. 15 noiembrie 1987, Brasov", Polirom, 2002, {{ISBN|973-681-136-0}}.&lt;br/&gt; This is documented by the book's revision, available at {{ro icon}} [http://www.librarie.net/carti/17126/Ziua-care-nu-se-uita-15-noiembrie-1987-Brasov-Marius librarie.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt started at the enterprise of Trucks Brașov, as a strike that began on the night of 14 November, on the night-shift, and continued the next morning with a march downtown, in front of the Council of the [[Romanian Communist Party]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The population had heard about this event through [[Radio Free Europe]]. As Emil Hurezeanu tells it: "I remember that Neculai Constantin Munteanu, the moderator of the show, started the broadcast: 'Brașov! So Brașov! Now it started!'  This was the tone of the whole broadcast. We had interviews, information, interpretations of some political interpretations, older press articles announcing open street protests against Ceaușescu."{{Cite quote|date=November 2009}}

The reprisals against strikers were rapid. The workers were arrested and imprisoned and their families terrorized, but this act of courage on the part of the workers of Brașov set the stage for future mass revolts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Emil Hurezeanu continues: "... All these have been turned into an offensive. The reaction of the regime was expected.. Very soon it was seen that the regime wants to hide it, to cancel it, practically not to respond to claims, not to take measures, to change anything, not to turn this protest into a public debate or even inside the party, in the Political Executive Committee. And then, the recipe of street confrontations with the regime became the only...possible. It became the leitmotif of all the media analysis. [...] It was the beginning of an action against the system that comprises more items. It was a labor protest in a citadel of Ceaușescu, it was an antidictatorial message, it was a clear political context: the pressures of Moscow, Ceaușescu's refusal to accept the demands of Gorbachev, the breaking with the West, who changed the views towards the regime – all these have made us to believe that the beginning of the end was coming".{{Cite quote|date=November 2009}}

====Protests in 1989 before the Revolution====
In March 1989, several leading activists of the PCR protested in a letter that criticized the economic policies of Nicolae Ceaușescu, but shortly thereafter Ceaușescu achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$11&amp;nbsp;billion several months earlier  than even the Romanian dictator had expected. Ceaușescu was formally reelected secretary general of the Romanian Communist Party—-the only political party of the Romanian Socialist Republic—-on 14 November at the party's XIVth Congress.

On 11 November 1989, before the party congress, on Bucharest's Brezoianu Street and Kogalniceanu Boulevard, students from [[Cluj-Napoca]] and Bucharest demonstrated with placards that read "We want Reforms against Ceaușescu government."{{Cite quote|date=November 2009}} &lt;!-- and what is the Romanian original?--&gt; The students—Paraschivescu Mihnea, Vulpe Gratian, the economist Dan Caprariu from Cluj and others—were arrested and investigated by the Securitate at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rahova Penitentiary|ro|3=Penitenciarul Rahova}}, accused of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14.00. There were other letters and other attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the communist police and Securitate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Revolution====
{{main|Romanian Revolution}}

On 16 December, a protest broke out in [[Timișoara]] in response to an attempt by the government to evict the dissident pastor [[László Tőkés]] from his church flat. Tőkés had recently made critical comments against the regime to the Hungarian media,&lt;ref&gt;Brubaker, Rogers: ''Nationalist politics and everyday ethnicity in a Transylvanian town''. Princeton University Press, 2006, page 119. {{ISBN|0691128340}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government alleged that he was [[inciting ethnic hatred]]. His parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passers-by, including Romanian students, spontaneously joined the protest. Subsequently, police and ''Securitate'' forces showed up at the scene. By 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, the protest had spread, and the original cause became largely irrelevant. Some of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the District Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR). The ''Securitate'' responded with [[tear gas]] and water jets, while the police attacked rioters and arrested many of them. Around 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm, the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the [[Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral|Romanian Orthodox Cathedral]] and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.

Riots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the District Committee building. The army failed to establish order and chaos ensued, with gunfire, fighting, burning of cars, and casualties.

Unlike the Soviet Union at the same time, Romania had not developed a large, privileged elite. Ceausescu's family maintained all control of politics and Communist Party officials were paid poorly and often rotated from job to job, thus preventing any political rivals from developing. This prevented the rise of the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]-era reformist communism found in Hungary or the Soviet Union. Similarly, unlike in Poland, Ceaușescu reacted to strikes entirely through a strategy of further oppression. Romania was nearly the last of the Eastern European communist governments to fall; its fall was also the most violent up to that time. The events of December 1989 are much in dispute.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Protests and riots broke out in [[Timișoara]] on 17 December and soldiers opened fire on the protesters, killing about 100 people. After cutting short a two-day trip to Iran, Ceaușescu gave a televised speech on 20 December in which he condemned the events of Timișoara, saying he considered them an act of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Romania and an aggression through foreign secret services on Romania's sovereignty, and declared National Curfew, convoking a mass meeting in his support in Bucharest for the next day. The uprising of Timișoara became known across the country, and on the morning of 21 December, protests spread to [[Sibiu]], Bucharest and elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

On 21 December, the meeting at the [[Central Committee Building]] (CC) in Bucharest turned into chaos.  The crowd, in a reaction that would have been unthinkable for most of the previous quarter-century, openly booed and jeered Ceaușescu as he spoke.   He was forced to hide himself in the CC Building after losing control of his own "supporters". The night of 21 December brought fighting between protesters and the [[Securitate]], police and part of the army forces; more than 1100 protesters lost their lives during the fights over the next few days. On the morning of 22 December, it was announced that the army general Vasile Milea was dead by suicide.  Believing that Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over almost ''en masse'' to the budding rebellion.  A second attempt at a speech the next day quickly failed.  Soon, people were besieging the Central Committee Building, coming within a few meters of Ceaușescu himself;&lt;ref name=Revolution1989&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Securitate did nothing to help him. Ceaușescu soon fled by helicopter from the rooftop of the CC Building, only to find himself abandoned in [[Târgoviște]], where he and his wife Elena were [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Trial|finally tried]] by a [[drumhead court-martial]], convicted after an hour and a half, and executed by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] moments after the verdict and sentence were announced on 25 December.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Michael |title=The Year That Changed the World: The Untold Story Behind the Fall of the Berlin Wall |year=2009 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-4165-5845-3 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PCR dissolved soon afterward and has never been revived. Uniquely among former Eastern bloc countries, no party claiming to be its successor has ever won a seat in the revamped Parliament since the end of communism.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Controversy over the events of December 1989====
For several months after the events of December 1989, it was widely argued that [[Ion Iliescu]] and the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN) had merely taken advantage of the chaos to stage a coup. While, ultimately, a great deal did change in Romania, it is still a subject of contention among Romanians and other observers as to whether this was their intent from the outset, or merely pragmatic playing of the cards they were dealt. By December 1989 Ceaușescu's harsh and counterproductive economic and political policies had cost him the support of many government officials and even the most loyal Communist Party cadres, most of whom joined forces with the popular revolution or simply refused to support him. This loss of support from government officials ultimately set the stage for Ceaușescu's demise. The Romanian army also was a factor in the regime's fall as it suffered from severe budget cuts while vast sums were spent on the Securitate, leaving them severely discontented and unwilling to save Ceausescu.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Politics==
{{see also|Politics of Romania|Economy of the Socialist Republic of Romania}}
RSR's political framework was a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] [[One-party state|run by a single party]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. All of its legislative meetings took place in [[Bucharest]].

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Romania}}
Romania's foreign policy was aligned with all nations that were aligned with the [[Soviet Union]]. Under Ceausescu, it enjoyed strategic relations with the [[Western Bloc]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and it was the only Eastern Bloc country not to boycott the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.

Following the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Romania also maintained relations with [[China]] and [[North Korea]] as well as the Chinese-backed [[Khmer Rouge]]-ruled [[Democratic Kampuchea]].

However, Romania joined the United Nations on 14 December 1955 (see [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 109]]) as well as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] in 1972. In July 1980, Romania signed a comprehensive trade agreement with the [[European Economic Community]]; which in turn became the [[European Union]] in 1993 when Romania joined in 2007.

==Legacy==
Despite the harsh [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity measures of the 1980s in Romania]] being still in living memory, many Romanians respond in polls that they'd prefer a restoration of the [[Communist regime]] (as much as 53% in a 2012 poll), looking back nostalgically at an era of perceived stability and safety as opposed to the recent [[Economy of Romania|economic]] and [[Politics of Romania|political instability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/30/struggling-romanians-yearn-for-communism/?page=all|work=The Washington Times|title=Struggling Romanians yearn for communism|first=Vlad|last=Odobescu|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the communist regime, Romania began shifting its political and economic policies from support (albeit tepid) for Moscow to aligning itself with Brussels and Washington by joining [[NATO]] in 2004 and the [[European Union]] in 2007.

The clientelistic networks that kept incompetent cadres in power were resilient after the Romanian Communist Party collapsed in 1989, allowing them to persist and generate post-communist [[Corruption in Romania|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Kligman, Gail and Katherine Verdery, Peasants Under Siege&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2018}}

'''Su Bong''' ({{lang-ko|수봉}}; January 7, 1943—July 17, 1994) was a [[Soen Sa Nim]] in the [[Kwan Um School of Zen]], the designated heir of [[Seung Sahn]]'s lineage. Of both [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] heritage,&lt;ref name="Batchelor"&gt;Batchelor, 222&lt;/ref&gt; he was born in [[Kona, Hawaii]]. Su Bong began his practice with Seung Sahn in 1974, helping to establish many Zen groups and temples for the lineage in the years that followed. In 1981 he received [[Dharma transmission|inka]] from Seung Sahn, making him a [[Ji Do Poep Sa Nim]] (JDPSN) in the lineage and, in 1983, he was ordained a [[sunim]] and given the [[Buddhist name]] Mu Deung.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080511021132/http://www.subong.org.hk/zm_subong_e.htm] He received [[Dharma transmission]] on October 11, 1992. On July 17, 1994, Su Bong died of unknown causes at a retreat while conducting [[kong-an]] interviews in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Bon Yeon"&gt;Obituary&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Kwan Um School of Zen has a practice center in his name located in [[Hong Kong]] and named [http://www.subong.org.hk Su Bong Zen Monastery].

Retrieved 2011-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In common parlance, or when contrasted with ''[[deism]]'', the term often describes the classical conception of [[God]] that is found in [[monotheism]] (also referred to as [[classical theism]]) - or [[gods]] found in [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions—a belief in God or in gods without the rejection of [[revelation]] as is characteristic of [[deism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/theism?s=t |title= Dictionary.com Online Dictionary | accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/deism?s=t |title= Dictionary.com Online Dictionary | accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheism]] is commonly understood as rejection of theism in the broadest sense of theism, i.e. the rejection of belief in God or gods.&lt;ref&gt;

Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons (which reason is stressed depends on how God is being conceived)...}}

It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion.}}(page 175 in 1967 edition)

==Etymology==
The term ''theism'' derives from the Greek ''theos'' or ''theoi'' meaning "god". The term ''theism'' was first used by [[Ralph Cudworth]] (1617–1688).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Halsey|first=William|author2=Robert H. Blackburn |author3=Sir Frank Francis | title =Collier's Encyclopedia|editor=Louis Shores|publisher=Crowell-Collier Educational Corporation|year=1969| edition =20|volume=22|pages=266–7|editor-link=Louis Shores}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In Cudworth's definition, they are "strictly and properly called Theists, who affirm, that a perfectly conscious understanding being, or mind, existing of itself from eternity, was the cause of all other things".&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, Ralph (1678). ''The True Intellectual System of the Universe, Vol. I''. New York: Gould &amp; Newman, 1837, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of theism==

===Monotheism===
{{Main|Monotheism}}
Monotheism (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:μόνος|μόνος]]}}) is the belief in [[theology]] that only one [[deity]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;“Monotheism”, in Britannica, 15th ed. (1986), 8:266.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some modern day [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religions include [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Baha'i Faith]], [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Eckankar]] and some forms of [[Hinduism]]. There have been many proofs of Monotheism postulated by a multitude of philosophers and academics throughout history. However, many of these proofs are either unknown or have been misinterpreted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Polytheism===
{{Main|Polytheism}}
Polytheism is the belief that there is more than one god.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/polytheism AskOxford: polytheism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
In practice, polytheism is not just the belief that there are multiple gods; it usually includes belief in the existence of a specific [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of distinct deities.

Within polytheism there are ''hard'' and ''soft'' varieties{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}:
* [[Hard polytheism]] views the gods as being distinct and separate beings; an example of this would be certain schools of Hinduism as well as [[Hellenismos]].
* [[Soft polytheism]] views the gods as being subsumed into a greater whole. Some other forms of [[Hinduism]] such as [[Smartism]]/[[Advaita Vedanta]] serve as examples of soft polytheism.

Polytheism is also divided according to how the individual deities are regarded:
*[[Henotheism]]: The viewpoint/belief that there may be more than one deity, but only one of them is worshiped.
*[[Kathenotheism]]: The viewpoint/belief that there is more than one deity, but only one deity is worshiped at a time or ever, and another may be worthy of worship at another time or place.  If they are worshiped one at a time, then each is supreme in turn.
*[[Monolatrism]]: The belief that there may be more than one deity, but that only one is worthy of being worshiped. Most of the modern [[monotheistic]] religions may have begun as monolatric ones, although this is disputed.

===Pantheism and panentheism===
{{Main|Pantheism|Panentheism}}
*[[Pantheism]]: The belief that the physical universe is equivalent to god, and that there is no division between a Creator and the substance of its creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/p.htm#pant |title=Philosophical Dictionary: Pacifism-Particular}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Panentheism]]: Like Pantheism, the belief that the physical universe is joined to a god or gods. However, it also believes that the divine pervades and interpenetrates every part of the universe and also extends beyond time and space.  Examples include most forms of [[Vaishnavism]] and the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]].

Some{{who|date=August 2017}} find the distinction between these two beliefs ambiguous and unhelpful, while others see it as a significant point of division.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/religion/blrel_theism_panen.htm |title=What is Panentheism? |publisher=About.Com: Agnosticism/Atheism |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheism may be understood a type of [[Nontheism]], where the physical universe takes on some of the roles of a theistic God, and other roles of God viewed as unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Michael P.|title=Pantheism : a non-theistic concept of deity|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London u.a.|isbn=0415070643|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deism===
{{Main|Deism}}
*Classical Deism is the belief that one [[God]] exists and created the world, but that the Creator does/do not alter the original plan for the universe, but presides over it in the form of [[Divine providence|Providence]]; however, some classical Deists did believe in divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/deism AskOxford: deism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Deism typically rejects supernatural events (such as prophecies, miracles, and divine revelations) prominent in organized religion. Instead, Deism holds that religious beliefs must be founded on human reason and observed features of the natural world, and that these sources reveal the existence of a supreme being as creator.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language (G. &amp; C. Merriam, 1924) defines deism as "belief in the existence of a personal god, with disbelief in Christian teaching, or with a purely rationalistic interpretation of Scripture". Although listed as a type of theism, deism is completely different from theism. If anything, theism would be an off-shoot of deism since it takes beliefs a step further to include miracles and divine revelation, with deism being the "base" belief in God.
&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Pandeism]]: The belief that God preceded the universe and created it, but is now equivalent with it.
:*[[Polydeism]]: The belief that multiple gods exist, but do not intervene in the universe.

===Autotheism===
{{Main|Apotheosis}}
Autotheism is the viewpoint that, whether divinity is also external or not, it is inherently within 'oneself' and that one has the ability to achieve [[godhood]]. This can be in a selfless way, a way following the implications of statements attributed to ethical, philosophical, and religious leaders (such as Mahavira{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}).

Autotheism can also refer to the belief that one's self is a deity, within the context of [[subjectivism]]. [[Hindu]]s use the term, "''[[Aham Brahmasmi|aham Brahmāsmi]]''" which means, "I am [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gurumayum Ranjit Sharma |title=The Idealistic Philosophy of Swami Vivekananda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORYOsJHi53sC&amp;pg=PA180 |year=1987 |publisher=Atlantic |page=180 |id=GGKEY:PSWXE5NTFF4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value-judgment theisms===
*[[Eutheism]] is the belief that a deity is wholly benevolent.
*[[Dystheism]] is the belief that a deity is not wholly good, and is possibly evil.
*[[Misotheism]] is the belief that a deity exists, but is wholly malicious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7207">{{About|the metaphysical philosophy||Voluntarism (disambiguation)}}
'''Voluntarism''' is "any metaphysical or psychological system that assigns to the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] ([[Latin]]: ''voluntas'') a more predominant role than that attributed to the [[intellect]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/voluntarism-philosophy Voluntarism – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or, equivalently, "the doctrine that will is the basic factor, both in the universe and in human conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]] | title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] | publisher=Touchstone Books-Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York NY | year=1926 |isbn=0-671-69500-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description has been applied to various points of view, from different cultural eras, in the areas of [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]], [[political philosophy]], and [[theology]].

The term "voluntarism" was introduced by [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] into the philosophical literature and particularly used by [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Friedrich Paulsen]].

==Theological voluntarism&lt;!--'Voluntarism (theology)' and 'Theological voluntarism' redirect here--&gt;==

===Medieval theological voluntarism&lt;!--'Medieval theological voluntarism' redirects here--&gt;===
Associated with [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]] (two of the foremost medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers), '''medieval theological voluntarism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is generally taken to be the philosophical emphasis on the divine will and human freedom (''voluntas superior intellectu''). For example, Scotus held that morality comes from God's will and choice rather than his intellect or knowledge. Accordingly, God should be defined as an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] being whose actions should not and cannot be ultimately rationalized and explained through reason. As such, voluntarism is usually contrasted with [[intellectualism]], championed by the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/voluntar/ "Voluntarism"] entry in the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy&lt;!--'Theological voluntarism as an approach to natural philosophy' redirects here--&gt;===
'Theological voluntarism' also refers to theological commitments—that is, specific interpretations of doctrines of Christianity—arguably held by certain early modern natural philosophers such as [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Walter Charleton]], [[Robert Boyle]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], ''The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science'', Cambridge University Press, p. 220: "There has been considerable discussion in the secondary literature about the impact of Boyle's theological voluntatism on his approach to natural philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Barrow]], and [[Isaac Newton]].

It resulted in an empirical approach associated with early modern science.  Voluntarism therefore allows that faith or belief in God can be achieved by will as opposed to requiring a prior divine gift of faith to the individual.  This notion holds at least in so far as it has found favor among some historians and philosophers (e.g., the historian [[Francis Oakley]] and the philosopher [[Michael B. Foster]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=l4g5t8EDGe0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Was+Newton+a+Voluntarist%3F%22#PPA39,M1 "Was Newton a Voluntarist?"] (pp. 39-64), in: ''Newton and Newtonianism: New Studies'', ed. by James E. Force, Sarah Hutton. Springer, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4020-1969-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twentieth-century theologian of voluntarism was [[James Luther Adams]].

==Metaphysical voluntarism&lt;!--'Metaphysical voluntarism' and 'Voluntarism (metaphysics)' redirect here--&gt;==
A proponent of metaphysical voluntarism is 19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. In his view, the will is not reasoning, but an irrational, unconscious urge, in relation to which the intellect represents a secondary phenomenon. The will is actually the force at the core of all reality.

This putting out of the drive–intention–vital dynamics later influenced [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ([[will to power]]), [[Philipp Mainländer]] (will to die), [[Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Julius Bahnsen]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] ([[Pleasure principle (psychology)|will to pleasure]])

==Epistemological voluntarism&lt;!--'Epistemological voluntarism' and 'Voluntarism (epistemology)' redirect here--&gt;==
In [[epistemology]], voluntarism describes the view that belief is a matter of the will rather than one of simply registering one's cognitive attitude or degree of psychological certainty with respect to a stated proposition.  If one is a voluntarist with respect to beliefs, it is coherent to simultaneously feel very certain about a particular proposition, P, and assign P a very low subjective probability. This is the basis of [[Bas van Fraassen]]'s Principle of Reflection.

==Political voluntarism&lt;!--'Political voluntarism' and 'Voluntarism (politics)' redirect here--&gt;==
[[File:VoluntarismV.svg|thumb|Symbol of voluntarist capitalism.]]
Political voluntarism or [[voluntaryism]] is the view that understands political authority to be will-based. This view, which was propounded by theorists like Hobbes, Rousseau, and many members of the German idealist tradition, understands political authority as emanating from a will.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher W. Morris, [https://www.philosophy.umd.edu/sites/philosophy.umd.edu/files/Morris/Morris-PopSov-2000.PDF "The Very Idea of Popular Sovereignty: “We the People” Reconsidered"], ''Social Philosophy and Policy'' 17 (1):1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marxist]] discourse, "voluntarism" was used to designate a connection between a philosophical commitment to metaphysical voluntarism (especially [[Machism]]) and a political commitment to extreme revolutionary tactics, particularly associated with [[Alexander Bogdanov]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul LeBlanc. Lenin and the Revolutionary Party.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most self-identified voluntaryists today are [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]], especially [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]].

==Critical voluntarism&lt;!--'Critical voluntarism' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Hugo Dingler]]'s critical voluntarism in the [[philosophy of science]] is a form of [[conventionalism]], which posits that theorizing in the sciences starts with an unavoidable free decision of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Janich]], ''Protophysics of Time: Constructive Foundation and History of Time Measurement'', Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The successor school of Dingler's critical voluntarism is the  methodical [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] of the Erlangen School (cf. also the [[methodical culturalism]] of the [[Marburg School]]).
