The '''1983–84 Pittsburgh Penguins season''' was the club's 17th season of operation in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The Penguins placed sixth in their division and did not qualify for the playoffs.

{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Offseason==
[[Eddie Johnston]], who had been the interim general manager, was awarded the GM title in June. He named [[Lou Angotti]] to take over the coaching duties.&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy surrounding the end of the 1983-84 season was the apparent throwing of games by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in order to secure [[Mario Lemieux]] as a draft pick.  Angotti later admitted this, though Johnston has not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2004-03-28|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04088/292486.stm|title=Finder: Lessons can be learned from Angotti and 1984 | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''air gun''' (or '''airgun''') is any kind of [[gun]] that launches [[projectile]]s [[pneumatic]]ally with [[compressed air]] or other [[gas]]es that are pressurized ''mechanically'' without involving any [[chemical reaction]]s, in contrast to a [[firearm]], which pressurizes gases ''chemically'' via an [[exothermic]] [[oxidation]] ([[deflagration]]) of [[combustible]] [[propellant]]s which generates propulsive energy by breaking [[molecular bond]]s.  Both the [[long gun]] and [[handgun]] forms ('''air rifle''' and '''air pistol''') typically propel metallic projectiles, that are either [[diabolo]]-shaped [[Pellet (air gun)|pellets]], or spherical [[shot (pellet)|shot]]s called [[BB (ammunition)|BB]]s.  Certain types of air guns (usually rifles) may also propel [[flechette|dart]]s or [[arrow]]s.

The first air guns were developed as early as the 1500s.  They have been used in hunting, sporting and warfare.  Modern air guns use one of three types of power source depending on the design: spring-piston, pneumatic, and [[bottled gas|bottled]] compressed gas (most commonly [[carbon dioxide]]).

==History==
[[Image:KunitomoAirGun.jpg|thumb|[[Kunitomo air gun]] developed by the Japanese inventor [[Kunitomo Ikkansai]], circa 1820–1830]]
Air guns represent the oldest [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] technology.  The oldest existing mechanical air gun, a bellows air gun dating back to about 1580, is in the [[Livrustkammaren]] Museum in [[Stockholm]].  This is the time most historians recognize as the beginning of the modern air gun.

Throughout 17th to 19th century, air guns in [[caliber]]s .30–.51, were used to hunt big-game [[deer]] and wild [[boar]]. These air rifles were charged using a pump to fill an air reservoir and gave velocities from {{convert|650|to(-)|1000|ft/s}}.  They were also used in warfare, the most recognized example being the [[Girandoni air rifle]].

At that time, they had compelling advantages over the primitive firearms of the day.  For example, air guns could be discharged in wet weather and rain (unlike both [[matchlock]] and [[flintlock]] [[musket]]s), and discharged much faster than [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading guns]].&lt;ref name="Philip 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schreier|first=Philip|title=The Airgun of Meriwether Lewis|journal=American Rifleman|date=October 2006|url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/article.php?id=14049&amp;cat=3&amp;sub=0|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they were quieter than a firearm of similar caliber, had no muzzle flash, and were smokeless. Thus, they did not disclose the shooter's position or obscure the shooter's view, unlike the black powder muskets of the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the hands of skilled soldiers, they gave the military a distinct advantage. France, Austria and other nations had special [[sniper]] detachments using air rifles. The Austrian 1770 model was named ''Windbüchse'' (literally "wind rifle" in German). The gun was developed in 1768 or 1769&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoff, ''Airguns and Other Pneumatic Arms'', Arms &amp; Armour Series, London, 1972''&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[German Tyrol|Tyrolean]] watchmaker, mechanic and gunsmith Bartholomäus Girandoni (1744–1799) and is sometimes referred to as the [[Girandoni air rifle]] or Girandoni air gun in literature (the name is also spelled "Girandony," "Giradoni"&lt;ref&gt;L.Wesley, ''Air Guns and Air Pistols'', London 1955&lt;/ref&gt; or "Girardoni".&lt;ref&gt;H.L.Blackmore, ''Hunting Weapons'', London 1971&lt;/ref&gt;) The ''Windbüchse'' was about 4&amp;nbsp;ft (1.2 m) long and weighed 10 pounds (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg), about the same size and mass as a conventional [[musket]]. The air reservoir was a removable, club-shaped, [[stock (firearm)|butt]]. The ''Windbüchse'' carried twenty-two .51 [[caliber]] (13&amp;nbsp;mm) lead balls in a tubular [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]. A skilled shooter could fire off one magazine in about thirty seconds. A shot from this air gun could penetrate an inch thick wooden board at a hundred paces, an effect roughly equal to that of a modern [[9×19mm]] or [[.45 ACP]] caliber pistol.

Circa 1820, the Japanese inventor [[Kunitomo Ikkansai]] developed various manufacturing methods for guns, and also created an air gun based on the study of Western knowledge ("[[rangaku]]") acquired from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in [[Dejima]].
[[Image:KunitomoAirGunMechanism.jpg|thumb|Kunitomo air gun trigger mechanism]]

The celebrated [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804) carried a reservoir air gun. It held 22 .46 caliber round balls in a tubular magazine mounted on the side of the [[gun barrel|barrel]]. The butt served as the air reservoir and had a working pressure of {{convert|800|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. The rifle was said to be capable of 22 aimed shots per minute and had a rifled bore of {{convert|0.452|in|abbr=on}} and a groove diameter {{convert|0.462|in|abbr=on}}.

One of the first commercially successful and mass-produced air guns was manufactured by the William F. Markham's Markham Air Rifle Company in [[Plymouth, Michigan]].  Their first model air gun was the wooden ''Challenger'' and marketed in 1886.  In response, Clarence Hamilton from the neighboring Plymouth Air Rifle Company (later renamed to [[Daisy Outdoor Products|Daisy Manufacturing Company]] in 1895) marketed their all-metal Daisy BB Gun in early 1888, which prompted Markham to respond with their ''Chicago'' model in 1888 followed by the ''King'' model in 1890.  The ''Chicago'' model was sold by [[Sears, Roebuck]] for 73 cents in its catalog.  In 1928 the name of the Markham company was changed to King Air Rifle Company after the company was purchased by Daisy in 1916 after decades of intense competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laidlaw|first=Angus|title=Chicago Air Rifle Markham's Patent|journal=American Rifleman|date=January 2014|volume=162|issue=1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to manufacture the "King" model air rifle until 1935 before ceasing operation all together in the 1940s.

During the 1890s, air rifles were used in [[Birmingham]], England, for competitive [[Shooting sports|target shooting]]. Matches were held in [[public house]]s, which sponsored shooting teams. Prizes, such as a leg of [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] for the winning team, were paid for by the losing team. The sport became so popular that in 1899, the [[National Smallbore Rifle Association]] was created. During this time over 4,000 air rifle clubs and associations existed across [[Great Britain]], many of them in Birmingham. During this time, the air gun was associated with [[poaching]] because it could deliver a shot without a significant report.

In terms of power modern air guns are capable of delivering high levels of energy, the recently showcased Umarex Hammer fires a .50 caliber air bullet delivering over 700 ft lbs of energy (950 Joules).

==Use==
Air guns are used for [[hunting]], [[pest control]], recreational [[shooting]] (commonly known as [[plinking]]), and competitive sports, such as the [[Shooting at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[10 m Air Rifle]] and [[10 m Air Pistol]] events. [[Field Target]] (FT) is a competitive form of target shooting in which the targets are knock-down metal silhouettes of animals, with a 'kill zone' cut out of the steel plate. [[Hunter Field Target]] (HFT) is a variation, using identical equipment, but with differing rules. The distances FT and HFT competitions are shot at range between {{convert|7.3|and|41.1|m}} for HFT &amp; {{convert|7.3|and|50.29|m}}for FT, with varying sizes of 'reducers' being used to increase or decrease the size of the kill zone. In the UK, competition power limits are set at the legal maximum for an unlicensed air rifle, i.e. {{convert|12|ftlbf|J|abbr=on|lk=in}}.

The increasing affordability of higher-power PCP rifles has allowed large projectiles and further target distance for competition purposes. For instance, the Extreme Benchrest competition held annually in [[Green Valley, Arizona]] allows calibers up to {{convert|.35|in|mm}} and targets at {{convert|75|and|100|yd|m}}, while the Big Bore Benchrest arm of the same competition engages targets at {{convert|35|to|300|yd|m}}.

== Powerplant ==
The different methods of powering an air gun can be broadly divided into three groups: spring-piston, pneumatic, and [[compressed fluid|compressed]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  These methods are used in both air rifles and air pistols.&lt;ref name=airguntypes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airguns.net/general_airgun_types.php |title=The Three Basic Types of Airguns |author=Ben Saltzman |publisher=American Airguns |accessdate=2007-09-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015143244/http://airguns.net/general_airgun_types.php| archivedate= 15 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spring-piston ===
'''Spring-piston air guns''' (or simply "spring guns" or "springers") operate by means of a [[coil spring]]-loaded [[piston pump]] assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the [[gun barrel]].  Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly.  The cocking drives the pump piston backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the [[sear (firearm)|sear]].  The act of pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the [[elastic potential energy]] stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder.  Because the pump outlet (located to the front of the pump) is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]], once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air.  All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic heating]] to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands.  This can also cause a phenomenon referred as "dieseling", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be [[compression ignition|ignited by the compression heat]] like in a [[diesel engine]], and lead to an [[afterburner]] effect with (often unpredictable) additional thrusts, as well as combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing.  Most spring-piston guns are [[single-shot]] [[breechloader]]s by nature, but multiple-shot [[repeating rifle|repeater]]s with [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] feeders have become more common in recent years.

Spring-piston guns, especially the high-powered "magnum" guns, are able to achieve muzzle velocities near or exceeding the [[speed of sound]].  The effort required for the cocking stroke is usually related to the designed power of the gun, with higher muzzle velocities requiring a stiffer spring and hence a greater cocking effort.  Spring-piston guns have a practical upper limit of {{convert|1250|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} for .177 cal (4.5&amp;nbsp;mm) pellets, as higher velocities cause unstable pellet flight and loss of accuracy.  This is due to the extreme [[Aeroelasticity#Buffeting|buffeting]] caused when the pellet reaches and surpasses [[transonic]] speed, then slows back down and goes through [[sound barrier]] again, which is more than enough to destabilize the pellet's flight.  Shortly after leaving the barrel, the supersonic pellet falls back below the speed of sound and the shock wave overtakes the pellet, causing its flight stability to be disrupted.  Drag increases rapidly as pellets are pushed past the speed of sound, so it is generally better to increase pellet weight to keep velocities subsonic in high-powered guns.  Sonic crack from the pellet as it moves with supersonic speed also makes the shot louder sometimes making it possible to be mistaken for firearm discharge.  Many shooters have found that velocities in the {{convert|800|-|900|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} range offer an ideal balance between power and pellet stability.

Spring guns are typically cocked by one of the following mechanisms:
* Break-barrel — like a [[break action]] firearm, the barrel is hinged at the junction with the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] and can be flexed downwards to expose the [[breech (firearms)|breech]] and also serve as a cocking lever itself
* Fixed-barrel — the barrel is fixed to the receiver, and the cocking is done with an additional cocking lever
** Underlever — the cocking lever is located underneath the barrel and is flexed downwards during cocking
** Sidelever — the cocking lever is located to the side (usually the right side) of the receiver and is flexed sideways during cocking
** Overlever — the cocking lever is located above the barrel and is flexed upwards during cocking, seen in some air pistols
* Motorized cocking powered by a rechargeable battery

Spring-piston guns, especially high-powered ("magnum") models, do still [[recoil]] as a result of the forward motion of the piston.  Although the recoil is less than that of some [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] firearms, it can make the gun difficult to shoot accurately as the recoil forces are in effect whilst the pellet is still within the barrel.  Spring gun recoil also has a sharp forward component, caused by the piston hitting the front end of the pump chamber when the spring has fully decompressed.  These two rapid jerking movements are known to damage [[telescopic sight|scopes]] not rated for spring gun usage.  In addition, the spring vibrations are often unpredictable and can also cause accuracy to suffer.  These vibrations can be controlled by adding features like close-fitting spring guides or by aftermarket tuning done by "airgunsmiths" who specialize in air gun modifications, a common one being the addition of viscous [[silicone grease]] to the spring, which both lubricates it and dampens vibration.  Some shooters also often hold the gun in a very loose grip (the "artillery hold" as coined by famous American airgunner Tom Gaylord) that allows the gun to vibrate in a natural and consistent manner.  There are also newer models with a floating receiver design that allows the [[action (firearms)|action]] to slide over the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] autonomously, thus making the gun less hold-sensitive.

The better quality spring guns can have very long service lives, being simple to maintain and repair.  Because they deliver the same mechanical energy output on each shot, the external ballistic is quite consistent.  Most [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] air gun competitions through the 1970s and into the 1980s were shot with spring-piston guns, often of the opposing-piston recoil-eliminating type.  Beginning in the 1980s, guns powered by compressed/liquefied [[carbon dioxide]] began to dominate the competition.  Today, the guns used at the highest levels of competition are powered by [[compressed air]].

==== Gas spring ====
Some makes of air guns incorporate a [[gas spring]] (commonly referred to as a ''gas piston'', ''gas ram'', ''gas strut'' or ''nitro piston'') instead of a mechanical coil spring.  The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed [[piston pump]] without outlet and with pressurized air or [[inert gas]] (such as [[nitrogen]]) held tightly sealed within the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]].  When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores [[potential energy]] and acts in effect as a [[pneumatic]] [[accumulator (energy)|accumulator]].  Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked.  The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster "lock time" (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy.  Gas spring air guns are also usually less "hold-sensitive" and hence easier to achieve consistent [[shot grouping]]s.

=== Pneumatic ===

[[File:New Benelli Kite.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[Benelli Kite]] pre-charged pneumatic air pistol, as used in [[10 m Air Pistol|10 metre air pistol]] [[ISSF shooting events]]]]
Pneumatic air guns propel the projectiles by utilizing the pneumatic potential energy within [[compressed air]], which is pressurized beforehand and stored inside the gun, and then released through valves during shooting.  Single-stroke and multi-stroke pump guns utilize an on-board pump to pressurize air in an internal reservoir, while pre-charged pneumatic guns' reservoirs are filled from an external source using either a high-pressure [[hand pump]] or by decanting air from a [[diving cylinder]].  

====Pump pneumatic====
Pump pneumatic air guns, or pump guns, use a lever-operated onboard air pump to pressurize an internal reservoir, which then discharge the stored compressed air during shooting. Depend on the design, pump guns can be either single-stroke or multi-stroke.

* In ''single-stroke'' pneumatic air guns, a single motion of the cocking lever is all that is required to mechanically compress the air.  The single-pump system has always dominated the casual plinking market, and is usually found in target rifles and pistols, where the higher muzzle energy of a multi-stroke pumping system is not required.  Single-stroke pneumatic rifles dominated the national and international [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] [[ISSF shooting events|10 metre air rifle shooting events]] from the 1970s up to the 1990s.

* ''Multi-stroke'' pneumatic air guns use multiple pumpings to achieve variable power levels in order to adapt for both long or short-range shooting.  This air gun are usually single-shot, which each shot requires approximately 5 strokes.  However, up to five shots are possible, usually requiring around 10 to 20 strokes as long as the air reservoir is enough to store higher pressure.  For safety reasons, most multi-stroke guns are usually designed to have its pump lever jammed when the reservoir has reached its maximum pressure limit, which the user can no longer pump the gun until it's discharged.  The maximum pressure limit for the reservoir is approximately 20 to 30 strokes.

====Pre-charged pneumatic====
[[Image:20ozCO2Condor.JPG|thumb|Airforce Condor, one of the most powerful PCP air rifles on the market]] 
Pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air guns have their internal reservoir pre-filled from an external air source (such as a [[diving cylinder]], or by charging with a [[hand pump]]), and remains pressurized until depleted after repeated shooting.  During shooting, the hammer strikes the reservior's release valve, allowing a set volume of the pressurized air to be discharged into the chamber and propel the projectile.  Depending on the release valve design, PCP air guns can be categorized into two types — ''unregulated'' and ''regulated'' (which has either a mechanical or electronic [[pressure regulator|regulator]] valve).  Because of the need for cylinders or charging systems, PCP guns have higher initial costs but much lower operating costs when compared to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rifles, and have superior performance over ordinary pump guns.  Having no significant movement of heavy mechanical parts during the discharge cycle, PCP airgun designs produce lower [[recoil]], and can shoot as many as 100 shots per charge depending on the tank/reservoir size.

The ready supply of air has allowed the development of semi- and fully automatic air guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://air-ordnance.com/smg-22-p-938.html|title=Air Ordnance Full Auto Pellet Gun|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203213004/http://air-ordnance.com/smg-22-p-938.html|archive-date=2014-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP guns are very popular in the [[UK]] and [[Europe]] because of their accuracy and ease of use.  They are widely utilized in [[ISSF shooting events|ISSF 10 metre air pistol and rifle shooting events]], the sport of [[Field Target]] shooting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafta.org|title=American Airgun Field Target Association|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are usually fitted with [[telescopic sight]]s.

Early hand-pump designs encountered problems of fatigue (both human and mechanical), temperature warping, and condensation — none of which are beneficial to accurate shooting or the airguns' longevity.  Modern hand pumps have built-in air filtration systems and have overcome many of these problems.  Using scuba-quality air decanted from a [[Diving cylinder|scuba cylinder]] provides consistently clean, dry, high-pressure air.

During the typical PCP's discharge cycle, the hammer of the rifle is released by the sear to strike the [[bash valve]].  The hammer may move rearwards or forwards, unlike firearms where the hammer almost always moves forward.  The valve is held closed by a spring and the pressure of the air in the reservoir.  The pressure of the spring is constant, and the pressure of the air released (which is also known as the ''working pressure'') decreases with each successive shot.  As a result, when the reservoir pressure is high, the valve opens less fully and closes faster than when the reservoir pressure is lower, resulting in a similar total volume of air flowing past the valve with each shot.  This results in a degree of partial self-regulation that gives a greater consistency of velocity from shot to shot, which corresponds to the middle "plateau" phase of the gun's shot-to-shot [[muzzle velocity]] profile (also known as the ''power curve'' ).  A well-designed PCP will display good shot-to-shot consistency over longer period as the air reservoir is being depleted.

Other PCP rifles and pistols are regulated, i.e. the firing valve operates within a secondary chamber separated from the main air reservoir by the regulator body. The regulator maintains the pressure within this secondary chamber at a set pressure (lower than the main reservoir's) until the main reservoir's pressure drops to the point where it can no longer do so.  As a result, shot-to-shot consistency is maintained for longer than in an unregulated rifle, and the gun can also output more shots due to reduced waste of reservoir pressure.

=== CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ===
[[File:BB gun with CO2 and BBs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pistol and disposable Powerlet cylinders]]
Originally called ''CG guns'' ([[compressed gas]] guns),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyramydair.com/article/What_About_CO2_December_2003/6|title=CO2 is used to power many air guns|publisher=PyramydAir|author=Tom Gaylord|date=|accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; air guns utilizing prefilled removable [[gas cylinder]]s as power source have now become known as ''CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; guns'' due to the ubiquitous commercial use of [[bottled gas|bottled]] [[carbon dioxide]] gas.  Most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; guns use a disposable cylinder called a "[[Powerlet]]", that is often purchased with {{convert|12|g|oz}} of pressurized CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, although some, usually more expensive models, use larger refillable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reservoirs like those typically used with [[paintball marker]]s.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; guns, like other pneumatic guns using compressed air, offer power for repeated shots in a compact package without the need for complex cocking or filling mechanisms.  The ability to store power for repeated shots also means that repeating arms are possible. There are many replica revolvers and semi-automatic pistols on the market that use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; power.  These guns are popular for training, as the guns and ammunition are inexpensive, relatively safe to use, and no specialized facilities are needed for safety.  In addition, they can be purchased and owned in areas where firearms possession is either strictly controlled or banned outright.  Most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; powered guns are relatively inexpensive, and there are a few precision target guns available that use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Ammunition==
===Pellet===
{{Main article|Pellet (air gun)}}
[[Image:177cal.jpg|thumb|250px|A .177 (4.5mm) caliber "Wadcutter" pellet next to a stick of chewing gum]]
The most popular ammunition used in rifled air guns is the [[wasp-waist]]ed '''[[diabolo]] pellet''', which has two sections — a solid front portion called the "head", which contains the [[center of mass]] and is available in a variety of shapes and styles such as flat ([[wadcutter]]), round (domed), cone-shaped (pointed) and pitted ([[hollow point]]); and a hollowed, thin-walled rear portion called the "skirt", which expands and fully engages the bore to provide a good [[seal (mechanical)|seal]], thus allows maximal efficiency in pellet propulsion during shooting.  In flight, the skirt has greater [[air drag|drag]]-to-weight ratio than the head, and provides drag-stabilization similar to that of a [[shuttlecock]].  This shape design also means that the overall pellet will have poor [[ballistic coefficient]] and tends to be more unstable than some other projectile shapes, especially in the [[External ballistics#The transonic problem|transonic region]] (272–408&amp;nbsp;m/s ~ 893–1340&amp;nbsp;ft/s).  Diabolo pellets are traditionally made from [[lead]], but can also be manufactured from [[tin]], or a combination of materials such as [[steel]] or [[gold]] alloys with [[polymer]] tips.

==== Slug ====
Some manufacturers also have recently introduced the more [[cylindrical]]-shaped "[[slug (projectile)|slug]]" pellets for the more powerful modern PCP air rifles.  Compared to the commonly used diabolo pellets, these slug pellets resemble [[Minié ball]]s and have more contact surface with the bore and hence needs greater propelling force to overcome friction, but have better [[aerodynamics]] and longer effective ranges due to the more similar shape to firearm [[bullet]]s, however also require a fully [[rifling|rifled]] barrel for spin stabilization in flight.

The BB was once the most common airgun ammunition in the USA, thanks to the popularity of [[Daisy Outdoor Products|Daisy]]’s line of BB airguns. A BB is a small metallic ball, typically made of steel (with a copper or zinc coating) or lead, in 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm/.177" diameter.  Originally called the “round shot”, the contemporary name came from the “BB”- size lead birdshot used in shotguns, which the first BB gun invented in 1886 was designed to shoot.  Steel BBs can be acceptably accurate at short distances when fired from properly designed [[BB gun]]s with [[smoothbore]] barrels.  Lead number 3 buckshot pellets can be used in .25" caliber airguns as if they were large BBs.

Due to the hardness of the steel, they can not "take" to rifled barrels, which is why they are undersized (4.4 against 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm) to allow them to be used in .177" rifled barrels, which when used in this configuration can in effect be considered [[smoothbore]], but with a poorer gas-seal. Were they 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, they would jam in the bore. Therefore, BB's lack the spin stabilization required for long-range accuracy, and usage in any but the cheapest rifled guns is discouraged.

Typically BBs are used for indoor practice, casual outdoor plinking, training children, or for air gun enthusiasts who like to practice, but cannot afford high-powered air gun systems that use pellets. Some shotgunners use sightless BB rifles to train in [[instinctive shooting]]. Similar guns were also used briefly by the United States Army in a Vietnam-era instinctive shooting program called "[[Point shooting#Rifle Quick Kill|Quick Kill]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, Friday, July 14, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darts and arrows===
In the 18th and 19th centuries air gun darts were popular, largely because they could be reused. Although less popular now, several different types of darts are made to be used in air guns. But it is not recommended that darts be used in air guns with [[rifling|rifled]] bores or in spring-powered air guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beemans.net/airgun_projectiles.htm|title= Airgun projectiles|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air guns that shoot darts are sometimes called ''dart guns'', and ''[[tranquilizer gun]]s'' if the darts used are loaded with [[anesthetic]] ([[tranquilizer]]) compounds.

Some modern air guns are designed to discharge arrows and are called ''arrow guns'' or sometimes ''airbows''. These arrows are designed with a hollow shaft that is open in the rear where the [[nock (arrow)|nock]] would normally be. When loaded, the hollow arrow shaft is slid rearwards over a barrel whose external diameter is only fractionally smaller than the shaft's interior diameter, providing a close enough fitting that minimizes rattling and gives reasonable enveloping [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] without causing too much [[friction]]. During shooting, the trigger releases high-pressure air from the barrel to the front portion of the hollow arrow shaft, pushing the arrow forward.  Such air guns can shoot arrows at launch velocities rivalling or even exceeding high-end [[crossbow]]s, while retaining consistency of precision unaffected by [[archer's paradox]], but they are also more expensive to setup and maintain.

==Calibers==
The most common air gun [[caliber]]s are
* .177 (4.5&amp;nbsp;mm): the most common caliber. Mandated by the ISSF for use in international target shooting competition at 10m, up to Olympic level in both rifle and pistol events. It has also been adopted by most National Governing Bodies for domestic use in similar target shooting events. It has the flattest trajectory of all the calibers for a given energy level, making accuracy simpler. At suitable energy levels it can be used effectively for hunting.
* .22 (5.5&amp;nbsp;mm &amp; 5.6&amp;nbsp;mm): for hunting and general use. In recent years air rifles and pistols in .22" (and some other calibers) have been allowed for use in both domestic and international target shooting in events not controlled by the ISSF. Most notably in FT/HFT and Smallbore Benchrest competitions. These events often allow the use of any caliber air gun, up to a maximum which is often .22", rather than a fixed caliber.

Other less common traditional calibers include:
* .20 (5&amp;nbsp;mm): initially proprietary to the Sheridan multi-pump pneumatic air rifle, later more widely used. 
* .25 (6.35&amp;nbsp;mm): the largest commonly available caliber for most of the 20th century.
* .30 (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm): the current largest available for non-PCP powered airguns

Larger caliber air rifles suitable for hunting large animals are offered by major manufacturers. These are usually PCP guns. The major calibers available are:
* .357  
* .45 (11.43&amp;nbsp;mm)
* .50 (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm)
* .58 (14.5&amp;nbsp;mm)

Custom air guns are available in even larger calibers such as 20&amp;nbsp;mm (0.79") or .87 (22.1&amp;nbsp;mm).

== Legislation ==
{{Main article|Air gun laws}}
While in some countries air guns are not subject to any specific regulation, in most there are laws, which differ widely. Each jurisdiction has its own definition of an air gun; and regulations may vary for weapons of different bore, [[muzzle energy]] or [[Muzzle velocity|velocity]], or material of ammunition, with guns designed to fire [[pellet (air gun)|metal pellets]] often more tightly controlled than [[airsoft]] weapons. There may be minimum ages for possession, and sales of both air guns and ammunition may be restricted. Some areas require permits and background checks similar to those required for proper firearms.

==Safety and misuse==
While historical air guns have been made specifically for warfare, modern air guns can also be deadly.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3916775"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/3916775/Crackdown-on-killer-air-rifles |title=Crackdown on killer air rifles |date=14 July 2010 |work=[[NZPA]] |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medical literature, modern air guns have been noted as a cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Air gun--a deadly toy?: A case report. | pmid=16683474 | volume=46 | journal=Med Sci Law | pages=177–80 | last1 = Kuligod | first1 = FS | last2 = Jirli | first2 = PS | last3 = Kumar | first3 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fatal nonpowder firearm wounds: case report and review of the literature. | pmid=2104975 | volume=85 | journal=Pediatrics | pages=177–81 | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = HS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/86/4/234.full|title=Air weapon injuries: a serious and persistent problem.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been the case for guns of caliber .177 and .22 that are within the legal muzzle energy of air guns in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC500806/pdf/jclinpath00268-0037.pdf|title=Air Weapon Fatalities | pmc=500806 | pmid=9797730|volume=51|year=1998|journal=J.

'''Bahrain–Merida Pro Cycling Team''' is a [[UCI WorldTeam]] [[cycling team]] from [[Bahrain]] which was founded in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/team/Bahrain_Merida_Pro_Cycling_Team_2017 | title=Bahrain–Merida Pro Cycling Team 2017 season | work=ProCyclingStats | accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its title sponsors are the government of [[Bahrain]] and the [[Taiwan]]ese bicycle manufacturer [[Merida Bikes|Merida]].

== History ==
The idea for a Bahrain pro cycling team was started in August 2016 by Sheikh [[Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/racing/who-is-really-behind-the-bahrain-merida-team-285143|title=Who is really behind the Bahrain-Merida team? - Cycling Weekly|date=2016-09-19|newspaper=Cycling Weekly|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is financed by the government of Bahrain to promote the country worldwide.

==Doping==
On 5 September 2018, the UCI announced that an out of competition test had resulted in an adverse analytical finding of [[Erythropoietin]] in a sample collected 31 July 2018. [[Kanstantsin Sivtsov]] was provisionally suspended pending the result of any B sample test. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uci.org/inside-uci/press-releases/uci-statement-on-kanstantsin-siutsou&lt;/ref&gt; This followed his back injury sustained whilst carrying out a recon of the time trial at the Giro earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/siutsou-out-for-three-months-after-vertebrae-fracture-in-giro-ditalia-tt-recon-crash/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbados National Stadium''' is a [[Multi-purpose stadium|multi-use]] outdoor [[stadium]] in Waterford, [[Saint Michael, Barbados|St. Michael]], [[Barbados]]. It was officially opened on October 23, 1970 by HRH Prince Charles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbados.gov.bb/sports.htm |title=Sports |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=[[Government of Barbados]] |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113144547/http://www.barbados.gov.bb/sports.htm |archivedate=2009-11-13 |accessdate=28 January 2011 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Situated approximately 4.3 km northeast of Bridgetown and it is located at Stadium Road, Codrington, St. Michael (on Highway 2), the Stadium is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches.

==Structure==
The Stadium holds 15,000 seats with the five stands such as The Clarence Jemmott "A" Stand; The O'Donnell "Don" Norville "B" Stand; The VIP Stand; The Jim Wedderburn "C" Stand; and The Patricia "Patsy" Callender "D" Stand; and also there is the Randolph Fields Velodrome and the Jaycees Gate at the north side of the Stadium.

In 2006, [[FIFA]] condemned the national football stadium of Barbados though the country was hoping to demolish and rebuild the ground before its [[2010 World Cup]] qualification campaign begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Barbados: Government Still Looking At Redevelopment Of National Stadium |url=http://www.caribbeanpressreleases.com/articles/5603/1/Barbados-Government-Still-Looking-At-National-Stadium/Page1.html |publisher=Caribbean PressReleases.com |date=1 Oct 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the Barbadian government estimated the cost to re-engineer the stadiums' [[All-weather running track|running track]] at 2 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$2m hurdle |author= |first=Justin |last=Marville |authorlink= |authorlink2= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/2m-hurdle/ |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=28 January 2011 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129235121/http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/2m-hurdle/ |archivedate=2011-01-29 |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  No date has been determined when the funding could be sourced or the works could be carried out. But Barbados' past [[World Championships in Athletics]] gold-medalist [[Ryan Brathwaite]] has publicly condemned the current state of the National Stadiums' track infrastructure. In 2010 the stadium started hosting the Joseph Payne Memorial Classic, a competitive event among Barbadian secondary school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=500 entries for Classic meet |author= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/500-entries-for-classic-meet/ |newspaper=Nation News |date=28 Jan 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Stadium's five stands were closed in April 2015 because of the rusty pieces of debris from the steel which stood underneath the roofs and the whole of the Stadium would soon be demolished. It will soon be constructed into a brand new stadium with new stands, car parks and new LED stadium lights as soon as possible.

During the 1970s, [[boxing]] was characterized by dominating champions and history-making rivalries. The decade had many superstars, who also had fierce rivals. [[Alexis Argüello]], for example, who won the world Featherweight and Jr. Lightweight titles in the '70s, had to overcome [[Alfredo Escalera]] twice before the decade was over.

At least six divisions had world champions who could be considered dominant: The Bantamweights had [[Carlos Zárate Serna| Carlos Zárate]]; the Super Bantamweights, (a division created in 1976) had [[Wilfredo Gómez]] winning the title in 1977 and keeping it until he left it vacant in 1983; the Lightweights had [[Roberto Durán]], who won the title in 1972 and vacated it in 1979 to seek championships at other weights; the Jr. Welterweights had [[Antonio Cervantes]], who reigned twice; the Middleweights had [[Carlos Monzón]], sometimes referred to as ''King Carlos'' because of his seven-year reign as champion; the Light-Heavyweights had [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]].  The Heavyweights, of course, had [[Muhammad Ali]], who ruled twice between 1974 and 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank Keating |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/27/muhammad-ali-jerry-quarry-october-1970 |title=The night Muhammad Ali's legend was reborn – and the party that followed &amp;#124; Frank Keating &amp;#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bump and run coverage''' is a strategy often used by [[defensive back]]s in [[American football]] in which a defensive player lines up directly in front of a [[wide receiver]] and tries to impede him with arms, hands, or entire body and disrupt his intended route. This originated in the [[American Football League]] in the 1960s, one of whose earliest experts was [[Willie Brown (American football)|Willie Brown]] of the [[Oakland Raiders]].  [[Mel Blount]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] specialized in this coverage to such a point as to cause a rule change (see below) to make it easier for receivers to run their routes and increase scoring.  

== Technique ==
This play works well against routes that require the receiver to be in a certain spot at a certain time. The disadvantage, however, is that the receiver can get behind the [[cornerback]] for a big play. This varies from the more traditional defensive formation in which a defensive player will give the receiver a "cushion" of about 5 yards to prevent the receiver from getting behind him. In the [[National Football League|NFL]], a defensive back is allowed any sort of contact within the 5 yard bump zone except for holding the receiver, otherwise the defensive back can be called for an illegal contact [[Penalty (American football)|penalty]], costing 5 yards and an automatic first down, enforced since 1978, and known colloquially as the [[Mel Blount Rule]]. In contrast, under [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules, contact is allowed anywhere on the field as long as contact is in front of the defender and a pass is not in the air.

'''''Foxcatcher''''' is a 2014 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Sports film|sports]] [[true crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and directed by [[Bennett Miller]]. Written by [[E. Max Frye]] and [[Dan Futterman]], the film stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Channing Tatum]], and [[Mark Ruffalo]]. The film's plot is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire [[Du Pont family|E.I. du Pont family]] heir and wrestling enthusiast [[John du Pont]]'s 1986 recruitment of two [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 U.S. Olympic]] gold medalist wrestlers, [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] and his older brother [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|David,]] to help coach U.S. wrestlers for participation in national, world, and Olympic competition, and the subsequent murder of David by John du Pont in January 1996.

''Foxcatcher'' received critical acclaim for the three lead actors' performances, Miller's direction, and the film's visual style and tone. It was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] in the main competition section at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], where Miller won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]]. The film had three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Picture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-announced-updated-1201376916/|title=Golden Globe: ‘Birdman,’ ‘Boyhood’ and ‘Imitation Game’ Top Nominations|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for five Oscars at the [[87th Academy Awards|2015 Academy Awards]], including a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination for Carell, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Ruffalo and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Miller.&lt;ref name=oscar2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/01/15/2015-oscar-nominations-complete-coverage/ |title=2015 Oscar nominations: Complete list; ‘Selma’ snubbed; ‘Birdman’ and ‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ lead with nine |work=[[The Washington Post]] |author=Stephanie Merry |date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first film to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] but not [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] since 2008, when [[Julian Schnabel]] was nominated for ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', two years before the Academy extended its maximum number of Best Picture nominees to 10 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/feb/09/oscars-2015-best-director-inarritu-linklater | author = Guy Lodge | date = February 9, 2015 | work = [[The Guardian]] | title = Oscars 2015: who will win best director?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|Olympic wrestling]] champion [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] speaks at an [[elementary school]] in place of his older brother, [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave]].{{#tag:ref|The date seen in the film being written by the school clerk on the $20 check to pay Schultz for his speech is "March 14, 1987" which was almost a year after he had first been contacted by John du Pont in the early spring of 1986 and more than four months after he had already moved to Pennsylvania shortly after the [[1986 World Wrestling Championships]] had been held in late October.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Mark; Thomas, David. "Foxcatcher: The True Story of My Brother's Murder, John du Pont's Madness, and the Quest for Olympic Gold." New York: Dutton, The Penguin Group US (2014), Chapter 11 ("Just Coach") p. 165; Chapter 12 ("A Man and His Program in Disarray"), p. 177|&lt;/ref&gt; The film shows Mark and Dave working out against each other at a fictitious "Wexler University" where Dave is an assistant coach. At the time Mark was contacted by du Pont in 1986 Dave was actually an assistant coach at [[Stanford University]] where Mark had also been an assistant coach until he was fired in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher" Chapter 10 ("Erasing the Asterisk"), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Both are Olympic gold medal winners, but Mark feels overshadowed by Dave. Mark is contacted by philanthropist and wrestling enthusiast [[John Eleuthère du Pont|John E. du Pont]], an heir to the E.I. [[du Pont family]] fortune, who arranges to fly Mark to his estate in [[Pennsylvania]] where du Pont has built a private wrestling training facility. Du Pont invites Mark to join his wrestling team, Team Foxcatcher, to be paid to train for the World Championship. Mark accepts the offer, with du Pont urging him to enlist Dave as well. Dave declines for the sake of his wife and two children, who are settled where they live, so Mark moves to Pennsylvania alone.{{#tag:ref|The first time Mark Schultz ever spoke to John du Pont in the spring of 1986 was not in person at the du Pont estate as shown in the film, but by telephone while Schultz was at his then home in [[Palo Alto]], [[California]]. The purpose of du Pont's multiple calls to Schultz that spring and summer were to recruit him to take a job as an assistant coach at what would prove to be an ill-fated and short-lived wrestling program that du Pont was then establishing at nearby [[Villanova University]], located on the [[Philadelphia Main Line]] some five miles from his estate, of which du Pont would be the titular "coach." Mark's first in-person meeting with du Pont did not take place until several months later when Chuck Yarnell, then the wrestling coach at the [[Haverford School]] and soon to be the head coach at Villanova, introduced him to du Pont at his hotel in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], in late August 1986 while Mark was there competing in the 1986 World Wrestling US Team Trials. It was not until mid-September 1986 that Schultz actually first visited du Pont's sprawling 800-acre (1.25 [[square mile|sq mi]]) estate, originally called "Liseter Farm" but renamed [[William du Pont, Jr.#Foxcatcher Farm|"Foxcatcher Farm"]] by du Pont after the death of his mother in August 1988, which was located along North Newtown Street Road ([[Pennsylvania Route 252]]) beginning at Goshen Road in the [[Philadelphia]] western suburb of [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Square]] in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher" Chapter 11, pp. 166-170.&lt;/ref&gt; While the film depicts the 14,000-square-foot, $600,000 wrestling training facility called the "Foxcatcher National Training Center" that du Pont established on the estate as already existing when Mark first visited and then moved to Pennsylvania in 1986, it was not built and opened until three years later in mid-1989.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Rich and Vigoda, Ralph [http://articles.philly.com/1996-01-29/news/25653391_1_foxcatcher-national-training-center-john-e-du-facility-du "At Foxcatcher, Perks Were The Lure Many Wrestlers Put Up With Du Pont's Oddities In Exchange For Jet Trips And Full-time Training."] The Philadelphia ''Inquirer''.

"Foxcatcher" Chapter 11, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

Mark stays in a homey guest house ("The Chalet") and is greeted there later in the night by du Pont.{{#tag:ref|While the film depicts Mark being installed in "the chalet" as its sole resident when he moved to Pennsylvania in late 1986, it was du Pont who lived there at the time. Instead, Mark originally lived several miles from the du Pont estate in a "one-bedroom apartment in a middle-class, blue-collar neighborhood three miles from the Villanova University campus" that he rented at his own expense for $800 a month and which he described as like "living in a cramped utility room." He lived there until du Pont unceremoniously fired him from the Villanova program by telephone on Christmas Day 1987, while Mark was in [[Oregon]] on a recruiting trip. (The university then closed the wrestling program in spring 1988 less than two years after du Pont had established it.) At that time, du Pont lived at the mansion and, while training for the 1988 Olympics, Mark was provided a rent-free "very small bedroom" in one wing of the chalet from which he was "prepared to make a quick exit if necessary." He remained at Foxcatcher Farm until about two months after the Olympics in September, leaving in early December 1988 when he moved first to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and then, after getting married later in 1989, to Provo, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher" Chapter 12 ("A Man and His Program in Disarray"), p. 177; Chapter 13 ("At All Costs"), p. 206; Chapter 14 ("Protest at the Olympics") pp. 212-13; 218; Chapter 15 ("A New Home, a New Life"), pp. 232; 239&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Through training with his new teammates and du Pont's financial support, Mark excels with Foxcatcher, winning a Gold Medal at the [[1987 World Wrestling Championships]]. Du Pont praises him, and they develop a friendship. Du Pont introduces Mark to [[cocaine]], which he starts to use regularly. He confides in Mark, whom he now calls a true friend, telling him how his mother, [[Jean du Pont]], paid a boy to act as his friend. Jean tells her son that she believes wrestling is a "low sport" and does not like seeing him "being low". One day, Mark and his teammates in Foxcatcher take the morning off from training to watch [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) on TV. Angered by this (as well as Mark's insistence that his brother will not join Team Foxcatcher), du Pont verbally and physically rebuffs him, saying that he will enlist Dave by any means necessary while also demanding that Mark work out his differences with his brother as soon as possible.

Dave decides to move with his family to Pennsylvania so he can join Foxcatcher.{{#tag:ref|While Dave Schultz also joined du Pont's wrestling club after the 1986 World Championships as well, he did not leave his full-time job as an assistant coach at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] (where he had moved on to from Stanford&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher," Chapter 11, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;) to move to Foxcatcher as an in-residence assistant coach until after du Pont had opened the new training center there in mid-1989. Mark and Dave Schultz thus never actually lived or trained at Foxcatcher at the same time as is implied in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher," Chapter 12, p. 190; Chapter 15, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} His self-esteem damaged by du Pont, Mark decides to work and train alone, pushing away both du Pont and even Dave. As Team Foxcatcher prepares to enter the preliminaries for the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], du Pont's mother is escorted into du Pont's gym to watch him coach his team. He awkwardly demonstrates basic maneuvers for her and the other wrestlers. Jean leaves in disgust after seeing du Pont [[back mount|give his back]] to his student.

At the 1988 Olympic Trials in [[Pensacola]], [[Florida]], Mark performs poorly, losing his first match. Angered by his failure, Mark destroys his room, cries and goes on an eating binge. Dave manages to break into his room and is alarmed at his brother's condition. They work feverishly so Mark can make his [[weight class]]. As Mark exercises, Dave prevents du Pont from speaking with Mark. Mark competes well enough to win his match and make the Olympic team. Dave notices that du Pont is absent, learning that he left for Pennsylvania after being told his mother died.{{#tag:ref|While the film shows du Pont leaving the 1988 Olympic Wrestling Trials being held in Pensacola, Florida from June 15 to 18 before they were over and in order to return to Pennsylvania because of the death at the du Pont mansion of his 91-year-old mother, Jean Liseter du Pont, she did not actually die there until almost eight weeks later on August 9, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;St. George, Donna [http://articles.philly.com/1988-08-12/news/26255903_1_jean-liseter-austin-du-ponies-devon-horse-show "Jean Liseter Austin Du Pont, 91, Leading Breeder Of Welsh Ponies"]. ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', August 12, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} After returning to the estate, Mark tells Dave that "you and I both know that I can't stay" at Foxcatcher once the Olympics are over and asks Dave to leave with him. A documentary funded by du Pont about his exploits with Team Foxcatcher is made, during which Dave is asked to praise him as coach and [[mentor]]. Mark loses his matches in Seoul, after which he leaves Team Foxcatcher. While Dave continues to live at du Pont's estate and train with Foxcatcher, as a condition for his remaining he negotiates an arrangement with du Pont to continue to support Mark financially.{{#tag:ref|The ongoing joint payment arrangement for Dave and Mark had actually been insisted upon and negotiated with du Pont by Mark Schultz in 1986, not by Dave when he arrived in Pennsylvania in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher" Chapter 12, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

Later, du Pont is seen sitting alone in his mansion's trophy room watching the documentary about Team Foxcatcher, which ends with Mark complimenting du Pont at a ceremony depicted earlier.{{#tag:ref|While the film is silent on the issue, about six and a half years had passed between the time that Dave Schultz arrived at Foxcatcher in mid-1989 (and seven years since Mark Schultz left in December 1988) and when du Pont murdered Dave at about 2:45 pm on Friday, January 26, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher" Chapter 15 ("A New Home, a New Life"), pp. 232-233; 237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longman, Jere "DESPERATE STAND IN A DREAM WORLD: Fantasy Ends as an Heir Tied to Killing Holds Off Police. Police at Bay in Desperate Stand in Heir's Dream World" ''The New York Times'' January 28, 1996, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; John du Pont’s interest in wrestling had begun to wane in 1995 and that year he advised [[USA Wrestling]] that the $400,000 annual contributions he had been making to that organization since 1989 would cease in 1996. With that, Dave Schultz informed du Pont that he would be leaving Foxcatcher after the [[1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] to accept a coaching position at [[Stanford University]]. At the time of Dave's death, Mark had been coaching wrestling at [[Brigham Young University]] in Provo, Utah, for more than six years.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, M. &amp; Thomas, D. "Foxcatcher" Chapter 14 ("Protest at the Olympics") p. 215; Chapter 16 ("Trouble at Foxcatcher"), pp. 259-260&lt;/ref&gt; |group=N}} Du Pont calls his bodyguard and drives to Dave's home, where he finds him in the driveway working on his car radio. As Schultz approaches du Pont's car to greet him, du Pont rolls down his window, asks Dave "Do you have a problem with me?," and shoots him three times at close range. Dave's wife, Nancy, calls 9-1-1; and, as du Pont drives off, she runs outside to her husband, who dies in her arms. Du Pont is later arrested outside his own home, and the film ends showing Mark as he competes in a [[mixed martial arts|cage fighting]] match with the crowd's cheers ringing in his head.{{#tag:ref| After shooting Dave three times with a .44 Magnum handgun, du Pont drove back to the mansion in his [[Lincoln Town Car]], where he holed up alone and heavily armed in a windowless, steel-lined "vault" on the first floor that his mother had installed many years earlier as a bomb shelter and that du Pont used as his library and "snorting" room. Within hours of the murder, a force of some 75 police officers from ten local departments that included a 30-man SWAT team surrounded the mansion, beginning a 48-hour siege of the property. On Friday night, police shut down the mansion's central heating system, leading du Pont to leave it about 3 p.m. on Sunday afternoon to walk to the nearby garden greenhouse to restart the boilers that could be accessed from an underground service tunnel located there.

Mark Schultz's reaction to the movie has been varied due to the intensely personal subject matter. He supported the film in general throughout its creation and served as a consultant. At one point he became angry and criticized Bennett Miller after critics pointed out "homosexual undertones" in the portrayal of the relationship between Mark Schultz and du Pont. Schultz then demanded Miller address the issue "or I will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/02/mark-schultz-attacks-gay-relationship-in-wrestling-biopic-foxcatcher |author=Ben Child |date=January 2, 2015 |work=The Guardian |title=Mark Schultz attacks 'gay relationship' in wrestling biopic Foxcatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it-clarke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/foxcatcher-review-carell-makes-a-passive-aggressive-nero-of-john-du-pont-1.2059069|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109232826/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/foxcatcher-review-carell-makes-a-passive-aggressive-nero-of-john-du-pont-1.2059069|title=Foxcatcher review: Carell makes a passive aggressive Nero of John Du Pont|archivedate=January 9, 2015|work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz said that "''Foxcatcher''{{'}}s scenes are mostly straight out of my book (except a few).

Following Dave Schultz's death, his widow, Nancy, and their two children moved to [[northern California]], where they still reside.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, Jeff [http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2014/10/31/finally-free-of-john-du-pont-nancy-schultz-keeps.html "Foxcatcher Exclusive: Finally free of John du Pont, Nancy Schultz keeps her husband's legacy alive"] The Philadelphia ''Business Journal'', October 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1997, Schultz was posthumously inducted into the [[National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|U.S. National Wrestling Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19970608&amp;id=pT06AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6KYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1366,5390704 Dave Schultz inducted in wrestling hall].

A year after the shooting, du Pont, who had entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, went on trial at the Delaware County Courthouse in [[Media, Pennsylvania]]. After three weeks of testimony followed by seven days of deliberation by the six-man, six-woman jury to consider eight distinct possible verdicts, on February 25, 1997 du Pont was found guilty but mentally ill of [[third-degree murder|murder in the third degree]]. He was subsequently sentenced by [[Pennsylvania courts of common pleas|Common Pleas]] Judge Patricia Jenkins to 13 to 30 years in prison. According to then-Delaware County District Attorney (now [[Member of Congress|MC]] R-PA7) [[Pat Meehan]], du Pont was the richest American ever tried for murder in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/25/dupont.verdict/reax.html |title=Du Pont guilty but mentally ill in Olympic wrestler's murder.

''Main Line Today'', November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of further psychiatric treatment at the [[Norristown State Hospital]], du Pont was eventually transferred first to [[State Correctional Institution – Cresson|Cresson State Correctional Institution]] near [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] and later to [[Laurel Highlands State Prison]] in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania|Somerset]], where he died on December 9, 2010 at age 72.

;[[dribbling]] :The technique of moving the ball while swimming forward, propelled ahead of the player with the [[wake]] created by alternating armstrokes. Since ball contact is minimal, this creates advantage for the ball carrier advancing the ball; his defender may not make contact unless the attacker is touching the ball.
;driver :A [[#P|perimeter player]] in the [[#0-9|3-3 offense]], positioned on either side of the [[#P|point]] or [[#C|center forward]], who attempts to swim toward the goal to escape his defender, receive the ball and score.
;drop :Defenders swim back to the center of the pool to block passes and shots by advancing [[#A|attackers]], while a defender [[#P|presses]] the ball carrier to cause a hurried pass.
[[Image:waterpolodrypass.jpg|thumb|250px|Catching a '''dry pass''']]
;dry pass :A pass thrown and caught in one hand between players; the ball does not touch the water. This pass allows for optimal speed due to fluid motion between catching and throwing.
;dumping the ball :An attacking player throws the ball into a far corner, away from the defenders, before the 30 seconds of [[#D|possession]] expires for his team, to avoid a [[#F|fast break]] opportunity for the opposing team.

==E==
[[Image:Water Polo Eggbeater.jpg|thumb|250px|Goalie '''eggbeatering''' up to block a shot.]]
;egg-beater :A form of [[treading water]], named because the circular movement of the legs resembles the motion of an egg-beater. This kick allows the player to maintain a constant position to the water level, and also by kicking faster for a brief period the player can get high out of the water for a block, pass, or shot.
;ejection :See [[#F|exclusion foul]].
;entry pass :Also called '''entering the ball''', refers to the pass, most often a wet pass, into the [[#C|center forward]] or 2-meter man. Most offenses focus on entering the ball early in the shot clock, and reacting if a [[#F|foul]] or ejection is drawn.

==F==

;fouls :Very common in water polo, both as a defensive strategy or because of holding (usually underwater) and rough play.
::'''Ordinary''' or minor foul: The referee signals with one short whistle blow and points one hand to the spot of the foul and the other hand in the direction of the team who gains possession. Play continues immediately.
:::*If by a defender preventing the free movement of an opponent who is not holding the ball, the attacking team has a free throw. The player fouled has three seconds to make a free pass to another offensive player.
:::*If the attacking team delays play, allows the ball to be pushed underwater, has a player inside the two meter area without the ball or pushes a defending player to create space for a pass or shot, the opposing team is given possession of the ball and play resumes immediately.
::'''Exclusion''' or major foul: A referee signals a major foul by two short whistle bursts and indicates that the player must leave the field without impacting play and move to the penalty area for twenty seconds.
:::*Dunking (''sinking'' in FINA rules), intentional splashing, or pulling an opponent back who does not have the ball, also interfering with a free throw or attempting to block a shot with two hands.
:::*Striking another player intentionally, misconduct or disrespect will also result in exclusion for the entire game.
::'''Penalty''' foul: The referee signals by blowing his whistle and raising five fingers.
:::*Any foul is committed inside the 5-meter line and the offensive player had an opportunity to score, or a goal was prevented by the foul. A [[#P|penalty shot]] is awarded from the five meter line.

==O==
;open :When an offensive player is not guarded by a defender.
;outlet pass : During the [[#C|counterattack]], the goalkeeper looks to pass to an open teammate downfield who is [[#F|fast breaking]] to the goal or setting up the offense.
;outside water shot :The shooter holds the ball out of water before taking the shot at the goal, i.e.: [[#P|power shot]], [[#L|lob shot]] or [[#S|skip shot]]. Outside water shots require a player to stop swimming, and usually occur outside the [[#0-9|2 meter zone]].

;penalty shootout :A tie breaker if the score is tied after two overtime periods. Five players and a goalkeeper are chosen by the coaches of each team. Players shoot from the 5-meter line alternately at either end of the pool in turn until all five have taken a shot. If the score is still tied, the same players shoot alternately until one team misses and the other scores, deciding the winner.
;penalty shot :See '''penalty throw'''.
[[Image:penaltythrow.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Penalty throw''']]
;penalty throw :A shot awarded when any [[#F|foul]] is committed inside the [[#0-9|five meter line]] &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; the offensive player had an opportunity to score, or a goal was prevented by the foul. The penalty shot is attempted from five meters with play stopped. Any defenders flanking the player taking the shot must be no closer than two meters. The goalkeeper must be on the [[#G|goal line]]. The referee signals with a whistle and by lowering his arm, and the player taking the penalty shot must immediately throw the ball with an uninterrupted motion toward the goal.
;perimeter player :The five offensive positions, other than the [[#C|center forward]], i.e.: [[#W|wings]], [[#D|drivers]] and [[#P|point]]. The perimeter players interchange their positions several times during a single offensive play.
;point :Position on offense in the center of the line furthest from the goal. The point player's position provides opportunities to pass to teammates and communicate among the offense, like the [[point guard]] in basketball.
;pop shot :An [[#I|inside water shot]], executed by scooping the ball with the non-dominant hand, and "popping" the ball upward, as the player treads up out of the water to meet the ball at its highest point with his/her outstretched dominant hand and shoots at the goal. During the flight of the ball, from when it is "Popped" up until it reaches the shooting-hand, and contact from behind by a defender will result in a 5-meter penalty shot, and thus it is an effective tool when one has [[#I|inside water]].
;possession :Undisputed control of the ball. The team with the ball has 30 seconds to take a shot until possession is given to the opposing team.
;power play :See [[#M|man up]].
;power shot :An [[#O|outside water shot]] in which a player propels his body out of the water and uses his momentum to shoot the ball into the net.
;press :Defensive pressure on the attacking team by closely defending each player [[#M|man to man]]. See also [[#L|lane press]].

==Q==
;quarter :See [[#P|period]].

==R==
;rear-back: a move used by an attacking player to create space between him/herself and their defender in an attempt to become open for a pass and subsequently attempt a shot. The attacker begins to swim toward the opponents' goal and abruptly stops and slides backward, awaiting a pass from a teammate, usually the center or 2-meter man.
;[[Rebound (sports)|rebound]] :After an unsuccessful shot at the goal, the ball becomes free in the water, and can be recovered by the offense for another goal attempt or by the defense for a [[#C|counterattack]]. A rebound after a shot on goal resets the 30 second [[#P|possession]] clock.
;red :Shouted to teammates when 10 seconds remain on the [[#S|shot clock]], or in cases where a different color (usually yellow) is used to signify 10 seconds, red can be used to warn teammates of only 5 seconds remaining on the shot clock.
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Bench personnel are cautioned with a '''yellow card''', and sent off with a '''red card'''.}}
;red card :Shown by a referee to signify that a coach, substitute, or bench personnel has been excluded for misconduct, and is required to leave the pool area immediately and cannot return to the game. See also [[#Y|yellow card]].

;reentry area :Area at each end of the pool near each team bench, designated by a red line, where players may enter and exit the playing area for substitution or exclusion penalties.
;referee :The two referees control the players, game play and the playing area throughout the match. Their decisions are final including rule infractions, fouls, scoring, possession of the ball and rulings of the timekeeper and [[#G|goal judges]]. One referee stands on each side of the pool. The referee with the goal to his right when a team is on the attack is called the attacking or offensive referee. The other, the defensive referee, remains as far back as the attacking player who is furthest from the goal. When the other team regains the ball, their roles reverse as the ball moves to the other goal.&lt;ref name="wpp"/&gt;
;release :To break free from a defender to receive a pass.
;rolled : the foul regarding a misconduct or game exclusion. This is because of the referee's circular arm motions signifying the player is done for the game.

;save :Successful blocked shot by the goalkeeper. Also called a '''stop'''.
;setting a screen (or pick) :An offense player is positioned to allow his teammate to swim by, while blocking or delaying his defender.

;sink :To push an opposing player under the water, an [[#F|exclusion foul]] if the player is not holding the ball and is in a position of offensive advantage.
;skip shot :An [[#O|outside water shot]] executed by throwing the ball at an angle directly into the water. If done properly and with enough force, the ball will skip off the water into the goal, since the goalkeeper cannot easily anticipate the angle. Also called a '''bounce shot'''.
;slough :A defensive [[#P|perimeter player]] intentionally causes an [[#O|ordinary foul]] and then moves toward the goal, away from his attacker, who must take a free throw. This tactic allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the [[#H|hole set]] and possibly steal the inbound pass. Also called '''foul and in''' or '''foul and drop'''.
;spring shot :An [[#I|inside water shot]] executed by pushing the ball slightly into the water (but avoiding a [[#B|ball under]] foul) and then allowing a sudden release, and a soft tap-in to beat the goalkeeper.[[Image:Water polo swimoff.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Swimoff or sprint to begin play]]
;sprint : At the start of each period, teams line up on their own [[#G|goal line]]. At the referee's whistle, both teams swim to midpoint of the field, where the referee drops the ball. The first team to recover the ball begins their offense.
;stalling :Failing to take a shot within 30 seconds or intentional delay in advancing the ball results in a turnover.
;swim off :See sprint.
;switch :Players change defensive assignments to cover a teammate who has fallen behind an opponent, or to match up better with an offensive player in size or speed.

==T==
;tee shot :Executed by scooping the ball with the non-dominant hand, [[#L|loading the ball]] to the dominant hand, and propelling the ball forward. The off-hand sets itself up as a tee, as in golf or baseball, and the two hands also finish in the shape of a "T".
;timeout :Each team may call two 60 second timeouts in the four periods of regulation play, and one timeout if the game goes into overtime. During game play, only the team in possession of the ball may call a timeout.
;tube water polo :See [[#I|inner tube water polo]]
;turn a defender :An offensive move to get by an opponent using leverage or strength. The result is a 180 degree turn, where the defender is "wheeled" around, resulting in the attacking player possessing [[#I|inside-water]], or position towards the goal, with the defender trailing behind. This maneuver often results in the defender being forced to [[#F|foul]].
;turnover :A team loses possession of the ball, which reverts to the opponent, as a result of a [[#F|foul]] or [[#P|possession]] for more than 30 seconds without a shot on goal.

==U==
;utility player :A player skilled at several offensive or defensive roles, often coming off the bench for substitutions.
; USA Water Polo : The National Governing Body (NGB) for the sport of water polo in the United States.

[[Image:waterpolowalkin.jpg|thumb|250px|Attacker (7 white) '''walking in''' the ball]]
;walk it in :The attacker grips the ball in one hand and either [[#E|eggbeaters]] or strokes in toward the goal.
;weak side :When an offensive player has [[#P|possession]] of the ball on one side of the playing area (the '''strong side'''), the opposite side is called the weak side. Players will shout "weak" to notify a teammate with the ball that they are [[#O|open]] on the other side of the pool.
[[Image:waterpolowetpass.jpg|thumb|250px|Attacker (white cap) reaches for a '''wet pass''' while [[#B|boxing out]] her defender]]
;wet pass :A deliberate pass into the water, just out of reach of the intended teammate and their defender. The receiving player can then lunge towards the ball and out of the water to make a shot or pass.
;white ball :Shouted to teammates when white cap team has [[#P|possession]].
;wing :The position on offense on either side of the [[#C|center forward]], along the [[#0-9|2 meter line]]. Players at this position may [[#S|set screens]] for the [[#D|drivers]], recover [[#R|rebounds]], and shift laterally or toward the [[#H|half-distance line]] to spread out the defenders. More generally, the '''wing''' is a player or location to either side of the center of the playing area. To move toward the side of the pool to get [[#O|open]] for a pass is to '''wing out'''.

==Y==
;yellow card :Shown by the referee to indicate that a coach, substitute, or bench personnel has been officially cautioned for misconduct, but may continue participating in the game. If a person receives a second yellow card caution, it has the effect of receiving a [[#R|red card]], and the individual must leave the playing area for the rest of the match. Players out of the water are not show a yellow card in Water Polo.

==Z==
;zone :Defensive arrangement in which players are assigned to defend an area, rather than a specific opponent.

The '''International Baseball Federation''' ('''IBAF'''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Federación Internacional de Béisbol'', [[French language|French]]: ''Fédération internationale de baseball'') is the former worldwide governing body recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] as overseeing, deciding and executing the policy of the sport of [[baseball]]. The IBAF has since become the international baseball "Division" of the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], the officially recognized world governing body for baseball (and softball). One of its principal responsibilities under the WBSC is to organize, standardize and sanction international competitions among baseball's 124 national governing bodies through its various tournaments to determine a world champion and calculate [[IBAF World Rankings|world rankings]] for both men's and women's baseball. Prior to the establishment of the WBSC, which has since superseded its authority, the IBAF had been the lone entity that can assign the title of "world champion" to any baseball team delegated to represent a nation. Its offices are housed within the WBSC headquarters in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]—the Olympic Capital.

==History==
[[File:Baseball at the 1912 Olympics--Stockholm, Sweden.jpg|thumb|250px|Baseball at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden]]
The first-ever international baseball event was a series of exhibition games that took place during the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[United States]]. The exhibition proved so successful that it was given an encore at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

The two popular showings in St. Louis and Stockholm laid the groundwork for baseball's international surge in popularity, leading the sport to be placed onto the program as an exhibition sport at the [[1936 Summer Olympic Games]]. This exhibition was extremely well received as 92,565 spectators filled the [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium in Berlin]] to watch a game between two teams from the USA.

Following the success of Berlin, the first ever [[Baseball World Cup]] was organized in [[London]], [[England]] in August 1938.  The United States and Great Britain engaged in five games, of which the British won four.

The growth of baseball competitions involving the representation of countries, coupled with the birth of the Baseball World Cup, provided the need for an institution to help develop, organize, regulate and oversee these events, thus the International Baseball Federation was established in 1938.

Conflicts of [[World War II]] prompted the IOC to cancel the Summer Games that had been scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 1940 and in London in 1944, thereby halting baseball's tour as a demonstration sport.  Nevertheless, by 1950, the IBAF was able to expand the format of the Baseball World Cup that was contested in [[Managua, Nicaragua]] to 12 participating countries.

In 1951, the [[Pan American Games]] were established and baseball was on the official program from the onset.

In 1952, a Finnish version of baseball ([[Pesäpallo]]) was a demonstration sport at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

In April 1953, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain came together to establish what is now known as the [[Confederation of European Baseball]] and organized the first ever [[European Baseball Championship]] a year later.

The [[Baseball Federation of Asia]] (BFA) was founded in May 1954 as the second continental confederation under the umbrella of the IBAF. The BFA wasted little time in organizing its first continental tournament, as it celebrated the [[Asian Baseball Championship]] in December of that same year in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].

The exposure of baseball to an international audience continued at the [[1956 Summer Olympic Games]], which saw approximately 114,000 spectators slowly fill the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] to witness Australia vs. USA in a demonstration contest in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This crowd of 114,000 was registered as a [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest attendance for any single baseball game.  (The record lasted over 50 years before it was broken at a March 29, 2008 [[Major League Baseball]] exhibition game between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] that drew 115,300 people to the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].)

Baseball as an Olympic demonstration sport was finally able to take its act to Asia at the [[1964 Summer Olympic Games]] in Tokyo, Japan, where baseball was already exceptionally popular.

At the following [[1968 Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympic Games in 1968]], a selection of premier U.S. college players defeated the Cuban national team twice in Mexico City to win the tournament.

In 1973, the IBAF added the [[Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|Intercontinental Cup]] to its tournament program.

In 1978, the IOC awarded the hosting rights of the 1984 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles, and [[Robert Smith (baseball)|Robert Smith]] quickly went to work, in his capacity as a member of the [[United States Olympic Committee]] prior to becoming IBAF President, to reestablish baseball as part of the Olympic Programme. Smith reached out to the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner, [[Peter O'Malley]], and [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]] head baseball coach and subsequent [[College Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Rod Dedeaux]]. The group organized an IBAF congress the following year in Los Angeles in order to establish an Olympic Baseball Committee. Through these efforts, baseball was again categorized as a demonstration sport and an eight-team tournament was organized at [[Dodger Stadium]], as part of the official Summer Olympic Programme. The present IBAF President, Riccardo Fraccari, was the head umpire of the championship game.

A third branch of the IBAF continental confederations formed in 1985. The [[Pan American Baseball Confederation]] (COPABE) was finally established after it was deemed necessary due to the strong expansion and increase of the national member federations stemming from the Olympic Baseball Committee campaign.    
 
In 1986, a historic IOC vote put baseball onto the Olympic Programme as a medal sport for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].

Baseball would travel to [[Seoul]], [[South Korea|Korea]] for the [[1988 Summer Olympic Games]]. This was the final time the IBAF, in conjunction with the IOC, would organize baseball as a demonstration sport at the Olympics before it became an official medal sport in 1992.

In 1989, the [[Baseball Confederation of Oceania]] (BCO) was established as the 4th branch of the IBAF.
 
The [[African Baseball &amp; Softball Association|African Baseball and Softball Association]] (ABSA) was formed soon after the BCO in June 1990 in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]

Baseball was played up in a traditional amateur format up until the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]], USA.

In 1998, the IBAF, MLB and [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] reached an agreement to allow the participation of professional players in international competition.

Team USA used a minor league selection to beat Cuba in the gold medal game at the [[2000 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.

Cuba regained the world title, defeating Australia for the gold medal at the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].

On July 7, 2005, the IOC Session voted to remove baseball and softball from the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] program.

Baseball made its last Olympic appearance and Korea took the gold medal at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Games]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

The IBAF, under President [[Harvey Schiller]], attempted to reinstate baseball onto the Olympic Programme, but the IOC vote of August 2009 kept baseball off the 2016 program, as golf and rugby were selected.

In February 2011, Dr. Harvey Schiller was appointed as a member of the IOC's Women and Sport Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/sports_globetrotting/2011/04/us-olympic-committee-no-longer-april-fools.html|last=|first=|date=Feb 2011|agency=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2011-04-01 | work=Chicago Tribune|title=U.S. Olympic Committee no longer April fools}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On April 1, 2011, the IBAF, under first-year President [[Riccardo Fraccari]], and the [[International Softball Federation]] announced that they were studying how to prepare a joint proposal in order to revive play of both sports at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110401/ap_on_sp_ol/oly_baseball_softball_bid_1|title=Baseball, softball consider joint 2020 Olympic bid|last=|first=|date=April 1, 2011|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2011-04-05 | work=Yahoo Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of that proposal, in April 2013, the two organizations began the process of merging into a new combined federation that will govern both sports,&lt;ref name=merger1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfsoftball.org/english/communication/press_08_04_13.asp |title=World Baseball and Softball Set for Milestone in Bid for Olympic Games Program Inclusion |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2013-04-15 |publisher=[[International Softball Federation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513104655/http://isfsoftball.org/english/communication/press_08_04_13.asp |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC).&lt;ref name=merger2&gt;{{cite press release|title=New World Baseball Softball Body born at historic Tokyo Congress |url=http://www.ibaf.org/en/news/2013/04/14/new-world-baseball-softball-body-born-at-historic-/75492541-8081-452d-a203-df3523006093 |publisher=International Baseball Federation |date=2013-04-14 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International events==

The International Baseball Federation currently oversees and organizes the following world championship tournaments:
*[[WBSC Premier 12]]
*[[World Baseball Classic]]
*[[Women's Baseball World Cup|IBAF Women's Baseball World Cup]]
*[[23U Baseball World Cup|IBAF 23U Baseball World Cup]] (formerly 21U)
*[[18U Baseball World Cup|IBAF 18U Baseball World Cup]]
*[[15U Baseball World Cup|IBAF 15U Baseball World Cup]] (formerly 16U)
*[[IBAF 12U Baseball World Cup]]

The first-ever [[12U Baseball World Cup|12U Baseball World Championship]] was played in [[Taipei]] from July 8 to 17, 2011.  [[Taiwan]] won the first title.

In addition, the IBAF is the sanctioning body for the [[World Baseball Classic]], which is hosted by [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] and held every four years in the year after the Summer Olympics. The IBAF abandoned its former world championship, the [[Baseball World Cup]], after the [[2011 Baseball World Cup|2011 edition]] in favor of an expanded [[World Baseball Classic]]. It was originally intended to be the sanctioning body for the [[WBSC Premier 12|Premier 12]], a new men's international tournament -- featuring the twelve best-ranked national teams -- that began in 2015; that tournament instead has been sanctioned by the WBSC. This event is played in the year preceding the Summer Olympics.

The IBAF discontinued the [[Intercontinental Cup (baseball)|Intercontinental Cup]], which was an invitational event and last held in 2010.

The '''Kosovo Derby''' also known as '''Gjilan Derby''' or '''Anamorava Derby''' is a [[association football|football]] rivalry between fierce rivals [[FC Drita|Drita]] and [[SC Gjilani|Gjilani]]. Both of the clubs are from [[Gjilan]] one of the 7 largest cities of [[Kosovo]], the derby was started in 1995 after the split of [[FC Drita|Drita]]. Initially the Kosovo media did not give importance to this derby but since 2012 the media has changed opinion for the derby. The rivalry comes about as Gjilani split from Drita and thus a new club was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSŚ: Derby Kosowa, Helsinek i Sztokholmu|url=http://legionisci.com/news/64496_NSS_Derby_Kosowa_Helsinek_i_Sztokholmu.html|accessdate=12 February 2018|publisher=legionisci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
For the past 20 years the match had attracted tens of thousands of partisan fans, even as Kosovo remained in political and sporting limbo following its war of independence from what is now Serbia between 1997 and 1998. Gjilan derby has added importance. In May, 2015, [[Kosovo]] was recognised by [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=worldsoccer.com|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/kosovo-new-nation-fresh-problems-390837|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the last stage of the championship of the Kosovo Superleague 1994/95, the main players of the Drita were dissatisfied with the leaders of the club, respectively with the treatment they had, so they slpited from Drita and created a new club in the city of Gjilan, which was originally called Gjilan '95&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Si lindi rivaliteti i madh ndërmjet Dritës e Gjilanit?|accessdate=21 August 2018|url=http://www.sovrani.info/si-lindi-rivaliteti-madh-ndermjet-drites-e-gjilanit/|publisher=sovrani.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1999, when the [[Kosovo War]] ended, this game was difficult to develop because the Serbian government did not allow Albanians to play at the stadiums.

Fans accused each other of lying about the foundations of the clubs. [[Intelektualët]] believe that [[SC Gjilani]] was founded in 1995 only after they inherited the  '''FK Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane''' that was founded in 1945, '''Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane''' is accused by [[Intelektualët]] as a Serb nationalist club. While [[SC Gjilani|Skifterat]] accuse that [[FC Drita]] before had the name '''KF Poleti''' which was founded by Serbs and after a few years after many Albanians were in the club, for this reason the club changed its name to '''Drita'''. Both stories have been rejected by many officials from both clubs and citizen of the [[Gjilan|city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=“Intelektualët” lëshohen në fyerje të rënda |url=https://www.koha.net/sport/119397/intelektualet-leshohen-ne-fyerje-te-renda/ |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters ==
=== Intelektualët ===
Drita, in the 1997–98 championship was a great team wherever in Kosovo and in many sporting games, the meetings started but it was difficult to name the fans. The [[KF Ballkani|Ballkani]] and Drita match was a tough game because Ballkani fought for the survival and Drita for champion, so the fans traveled to [[Suva Reka]] for the last time without a name after this game, before the game against biggest rival Gjilani, the board succumbed and after many debates the name {{nowrap|{{lang|sq|Intelektualët}} (Intellectuals)}} was assigned because most of the players except they played were also writers, poets, politicians and so on.&lt;ref name=Intelektualët&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tifozat.com/viewpage.php?page_id=11|title=Intelektualët|trans-title=Intellectuals|website=Tifozat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intellectuals are the biggest [[Ultras|ultras]] group in Kosovo, with many transfers outside [[Gjilan]]. They also have the record of audience in football of Kosovo, the biggest was against Gjilani in 2011 with 13,000 fans and they traveled also in 2002 with 30,000 fans to the final of the [[Kosovar Cup]] in the [[Fadil Vokrri Stadium]].&lt;ref name=Intelektualët/&gt;

=== Skifterat ===
[[File:Skifterat, Gjilan, Fans.jpg|thumb|400px|Skifterat during Gjilan Derby]]
''Skifterat'' are the clubs [[Ultras|ultras]] group. They are formed in 1999, and are the biggest rivals of [[FC Drita|Drita]] supporters. The name means ''Falcon'' in English!

=== Incidents ===
The great rivalry among these teams has also led to hooliganism. A few days before the game is played, the tensions between the two groups increase, where there have been mass incidents between them. Even often they have conquered the pitch of stadium to face each other. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rrahja mes Intelektualëve dhe Skifterave nga këndi tjetër |url=http://www.botasot.info/sporti/444902/rrahja-mes-intelektualeve-dhe-skifterave-nga-kendi-tjeter-video/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |publisher=botasot.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rrahja ndermjet tifozeve ne derbin e Gjilanit ǀ The fight between supporters in Gjilan Derby |url=http://fax.al/news/1030940/rrahja-ndermjet-tifozeve-ne-derbin-drita-gjilani-video |accessdate=21 August 2018 |publisher=fax.al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marvel Gymnasium''' was a 3,000-seat multipurpose gymnasium in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  It was home to the [[Brown University]] Bears basketball team as well as other teams.  The gymnasium included a basketball court and seating, a second-floor running track, squash and handball courts, a wrestling room, a boxing room, and a fencing room.

The building was located at Aldrich Field, located on Elmgrove Avenue across from [[Brown Stadium]].  The land for Aldrich Field was a gift to the University from brothers Charles and Henry Aldrich, both alumni of Brown.  The façade's clock face read "A-L-D-R-I-C-H-F-I-E-L-D" instead of the regular numbers, with the "R" being in place of the 12.  The bronze statue of "Bruno," the [[Brown Bears|Brown bear mascot]], was located just to the south of the main entrance on a pedestal containing a piece of [[slate]] said to have been from the spot where Roger Williams landed in what would become Providence in 1636. After Marvel Gym was closed, the statue was moved to the College Green, where it originally stood.

On October 7, 1938, the building was rededicated to the memory of Frederick W. "Doc" Marvel, class of 1896, a longtime athletic director.  The building was in use until 1989, when the [[Pizzitola Sports Center]] opened at the Brown Athletic Conference.  It was then closed and stood dormant until 2002, when it was demolished, well past its usefulness and becoming dangerously dilapidated.  There are now practice fields on the site.

'''Minor leagues''' are professional [[sports league|sports leagues]] which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those [[sports]]. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities/markets.  This term is used in [[North America]] with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets.

The minor league concept is a manifestation of the [[professional sports league organization|franchise system]] used in North American sports, whereby the group of [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take place with the consent of the major league owners. In Europe, and many other parts of the world, the football leagues have many divisions below the ''top-flight'' as part of the [[promotion and relegation|football pyramid]]. In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual [[promotion and relegation]], meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per country in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.

== American football ==
While there are various semi-professional [[American football|football]] leagues, none have any affiliation with the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The NFL and its teams have had working relationships with several independent leagues in the past, including the [[Association of Professional Football Leagues]], the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]], and most recently, the league owned-and-operated [[NFL Europe]]. In modern times, the NFL has developed players not ready for the active roster through each team's [[practice squad]].

Many consider the [[Arena Football League]] to have been a ''de facto'' minor league, since several NFL owners had teams in it in the mid-2000s, prior to its bankruptcy and restructuring. [[Arena football]] is played under very different conditions, and the AFL had its own minor league, [[af2]], until 2009. Several other independent [[indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues that play a similar game exist.

Similarly, the [[Canadian Football League]], though it has developed ties with the NFL in recent years and has moved away from competing with the NFL for talent, plays a visibly different game than the American game, and the two sports favor different types of skills; the CFL arguably holds major league status in its home territory of [[Canada]].

Several minor or developmental leagues, independent of the NFL, have come and gone, such as the recent [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]] and the [[Fall Experimental Football League]], but none have lasted more than a few seasons.
On November 27, 2016, it was reported by [[CBS Sports]] that the NFL will present formal proposals for a developmental league or in-season academy (with Troy Vincent prepared to make recommendations) in 2017. Vincent stated "We are ready to socialize our findings to the respective committees at the Pro Bowl, Senior Bowl, and combine" he also stated "We have some viable potential options that are ready to share with the Competition Committee, the Coaches Subcommittee and with some of our active and former players", "Our goal is to create a platform that addresses the entire football community--coaches, officials, front office personnel and players--is essential to the long-term sustainability of our game."

== Association football (soccer) ==
Below [[Major League Soccer]] several lower-level leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.–Canada border as part of the [[United States soccer league system|American]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canadian]] soccer pyramids. As is standard for [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|sports in both countries]], the formal [[promotion and relegation]] system is not used, although teams have been informally "promoted" from lower leagues up to Major League Soccer. As of the current 2018 U.S.–Canada soccer season, the second level is the [[United Soccer League]] (USL), which will be rebranded as the USL Championship for 2019 and beyond. The [[North American Soccer League]] had previously been the second level, sharing that status with the USL in 2017, but major instability in the NASL led to the loss of that league's second-division status and raised serious questions as to its very survival. USL's parent organization, known as the [[United Soccer Leagues]] (note the plural), also operates [[USL League Two]] (formerly the Premier Development League, or PDL), a semi-professional league that has some age restrictions. The [[National Premier Soccer League]] operates at approximately the same level as League Two. While there was no official third-level professional league in 2018, the USL organization plans to launch [[USL League One]] at that level in 2019, and another third-level circuit, the [[National Independent Soccer Association]], also plans a 2019 launch. 

In 2013 Major League Soccer announced a partnership with the USL which began formal affiliation between some USL teams and MLS teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/690369.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014213131/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/690369.html |archivedate=2014-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership has continued to deepen; several MLS teams now field their own reserve teams in the USL, and MLS now requires all of its teams to either field a reserve team in the USL or officially affiliate with a separately owned USL team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cranford |first=Aaron |url=http://www.soccerbyives.net/2014/09/monarchs-latest-backed.html |title=RSL launch Real Monarchs, latest MLS-backed USL Pro team |publisher=Soccer By Ives |date= |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; No formal relationship exists between NASL and the other leagues; NASL's commissioner has said he believes it will "stay that way for some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris |first=Neil |url=http://www.indyweek.com/sports/archives/2014/04/08/nasl-commissioner-bill-peterson-discusses-league-expansion-playoffs-mls-paid-match-streaming-and-other-topics-in-advance-of-2014-regular-se |title=NASL Commissioner Bill Peterson discusses league expansion, playoffs, MLS, paid match streaming and other topics in advance of 2014 regular season kickoff &amp;#124; Sports |website=Indy Week |date=2014-04-08 |accessdate=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baseball ==
{{Main|Minor League Baseball}}

[[Minor League Baseball|Minor league baseball]] is almost as old as the professional game itself, and at first consisted of attempts to play baseball in smaller cities and towns independent of the [[National League]], the first true major league. Soon, [[scout (sport)|scouts]] for the National League were traveling to watch minor league teams play and attempting to sign the more talented ones away. Soon [[Major League Baseball]] began formal developmental agreements with some minor league teams, while others remained [[independent league baseball|independent]]. 

Since it was first developed in the 1920s by St. Louis Cardinals executive [[Branch Rickey]], the formal developmental affiliations have come to dominate minor league baseball, and the majority of minor leagues are part of the affiliated system. A general decline in minor league attendance occurred following the advent of television; minor league clubs only survived in many markets because their major league affiliations included financial support. The trend began to reverse in the 1990s, as new independent minor leagues began for the first time in decades and have become successful to varying levels.

== Basketball ==
The [[National Basketball Association]] has an affiliated minor league: the [[NBA G League]] (formerly called the "NBA D-League"). The now-defunct [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA) served some of the purposes of a minor league for the NBA for many years.  However, there were no direct developmental agreements between CBA and NBA teams the way that there are between Major League Baseball and National Hockey League teams and their minor league affiliates.

== Ice hockey ==
The sport with the next most extensive system of minor league teams other than baseball is [[ice hockey]].  In North America, between 1988 and 2005, 233 [[minor ice hockey]] teams played in a total of 160 cities in 13 minor professional leagues. The vast majority of these teams played in the United States, with only 21 of these teams based in Canadian cities. 123 of these minor professional teams played in the southern United States.&lt;ref name="scott2006"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|pages=vii|isbn=1-894974-21-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason given for the large number of American-based teams is that minor league franchises will frequently move from city to city, and even between leagues.&lt;ref name="scott2006"/&gt; In contrast, Canadian cities more commonly host [[junior ice hockey|major junior]] teams, which develop teenage prospects prior to their move to the professional leagues.

The [[American Hockey League]] is the most prominent of the minor hockey leagues in North America.

'''Current minor leagues'''
*[[American Hockey League]] (AHL)
*[[ECHL]] (formerly known as the ''East Coast Hockey League'')
*[[Federal Hockey League]] (FHL)
*[[Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey]] (LNAH)
*[[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL)

'''Former minor leagues'''
*[[Atlantic Coast Hockey League (2002–03)|Atlantic Coast Hockey League]] (ACHL), now part of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]]
*[[Central Hockey League]] (CHL), merged into the [[ECHL]]
*[[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL), merged into the [[American Hockey League]] 
*[[International Hockey League (2007-2010)|International Hockey League (2007)]] (IHL), formerly the ''[[United Hockey League]]'' and ''[[Colonial Hockey League]]'', merged into the [[Central Hockey League]] 
*[[South East Hockey League]] (SEHL), now part of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]]
*[[West Coast Hockey League]] (WCHL), merged into the [[ECHL]]
*[[Western Hockey League (1952–74)]] (WHL), merged into the [[Central Hockey League (1963-1984)]]
*[[Western Professional Hockey League]] (WPHL), merged into the [[Central Hockey League]]
*[[World Hockey Association 2]] (WHA2), now part of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]]

All [[National Hockey League]] teams have a [[farm team]] in the [[American Hockey League]] and often share a team in the [[ECHL]]. On "the farm" the NHL team will develop young players, occasionally rehabilitate older players who are injured or whose quality of play has slumped.  These teams, in turn, have lower-level minor leagues to draw players from and pass players down to.  Minor ice hockey leagues should not be confused with [[Junior ice hockey|Junior]] or [[Senior ice hockey|Senior]] ice hockey leagues. They are different in that minor professional hockey leagues do not have restrictions on the age or experience levels of their players, but Junior and Senior leagues do.

== Other sports ==
Other sports organizations considered to be minor leagues are golf's [[Web.com Tour]] and [[Symetra Tour]], respectively affiliated with the [[PGA Tour]] and [[LPGA]]; [[NASCAR]]'s [[Xfinity Series]], [[Camping World Truck Series]] and [[Whelen All-American Series]]; and various other affiliated satellite tours of other individual sports, including the Challengers Tour of Professional Tennis.

'''''The Rookie''''' is a 2002 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John Lee Hancock]] and produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is based on the true story of [[Jim Morris]], who had a brief, but famous [[Major League Baseball]] career in 1999–2000. The film stars [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Rachel Griffiths]], [[Jay Hernandez]], and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]].

==Plot==
[[Jim Morris]] is the son of a career Navy man, who moves the family from [[Hollywood, Florida]] to [[Big Lake, Texas]], in order to maintain job security. Jim is shown to be a very skilled pitcher, though his father disapproves of Jim's dream of making it to [[Major League Baseball]]. It is later mentioned that the town to which Jim's family moved, Big Lake, has lost its love for baseball, preferring football instead. Thus, he was unable to play baseball in high school. He later gets a chance when he is drafted by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], but he tears up his shoulder, ending his hopes of achieving his lifelong dream.

Years later in 1999, Jim, married with three children, is a high school science teacher, as well as head baseball coach. His team, the Big Lake Owls, is very unsuccessful with many of his players skilled, but unmotivated, especially with very little community support. One day after practice, the team catcher offers to play catch with Jim. There it is revealed that Jim may still have his fastball, and it is soon displayed to the rest of the team. The Owls believe that Jim could possibly pitch in the major leagues and offer him a deal: If the Owls can win district and make the state playoffs, Jim will try out again, which Jim accepts. Furthermore, the team urges him to throw his fastball in batting practice, which immensely improves their hitting.

The Owls end up winning district and after their final win, the team tells Jim that, since they kept up their end of the deal, it is now his turn to do his part.  After the Owls' season ends with a loss in the state tournament, Jim is told of a tryout nearby for the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], and Jim goes, without telling his wife, afraid that her fear of him re-injuring his shoulder would keep him from going. After his tryout, the professional scouts discover his ability to repeatedly throw a baseball at 98 miles per hour. The lead scout tells Jim that he could be signed to a minor-league deal. Jim's wife finds out after getting two phone messages from the Tampa Bay scouts and she is at first reluctant to let Jim go, citing his home responsibilities, but after seeing how Jim is inspiring their son, Hunter, she allows him to go. Jim tells his father, with whom he still has a cold relationship, of his situation, and his father once again tries to dissuade Jim from trying to achieve his dream again, telling Jim, "It's OK to think about what you ''want'' to do until it's time to start doing what you were ''meant'' to do."

He is initially assigned to the minor league Class AA [[Montgomery Biscuits|Orlando Rays]] (now the Montgomery Biscuits) but quickly moves up to the AAA [[Durham Bulls]]. Concerned for his family due to mounting bills (the pay in the minor leagues being low) Jim decides to give it up and come home. But his wife Lorri talks him out of it, not wanting Jim to give up again. Jim gets inspired again when he watches a Little League game one night, remembering the same love for baseball he had as a kid.

In September, Jim is told that the Major League club has called him up, and that they will be playing in Texas against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]]. Jim calls his family, who in turn informs the town. Advising his wife of the dress code in the majors, Jim finds his sports coat, a necktie and his [[Rita of Cascia|St. Rita]] necklace hanging in his locker. St. Rita is the saint of impossible dreams. His family, high school players and many townspeople go to the game. Jim impresses many of the coaches in warm-ups with his fastball, and late in the game, with Tampa Bay losing badly, Jim is called into the game to pitch to [[Royce Clayton]] and end the inning. Jim ends up striking out Clayton on three straight fastballs. After the game, Jim gets interviewed by the press. During the interview, Jim notices his father had also come to the game. Jim's father finally admits that he is proud of what Jim has done and also apologizes for never supporting him. Jim thanks him and gives him the ball with which he had gotten the strikeout, and the two finally repair their relationship. Jim then meets with his family and all the townspeople who had come to the game, applauding Jim on his amazing success story.

The final scene shows the Big Lake high school trophy case, which has Jim's Major League jersey prominently displayed. It is then mentioned that Jim would go on to pitch in the majors for two seasons before retiring and returning to teaching in Texas.

*Neighboring [[Thrall High School]] in [[Thrall, Texas]], was dressed for several differing scenes, including scenes of several different "away" baseball games filmed on the school's field. Thrall's then-recently completed football stadium stood in as Big Lake's. Thrall's old football field, dressing rooms and recreation pavilion were dressed as an oil refinery's outlay in a deleted scene viewable on the DVD's special features.
*A scene shot in front of a motel supposedly in Florida was actually filmed in front of what is now a Best Western in [[Taylor, Texas]].

Most of the population portrayed in this movie of Big Lake, Texas were fictional. Only the baseball team and those directly connected were based on real people.

The Bulls game was shot in [[Round Rock, Texas]] at the [[Dell Diamond]].

The tryout scenes were filmed at [[Taylor High School (Taylor, Texas)|Taylor High School]] in [[Taylor, Texas]].

'''Twickenham Cricket Club''' is an amateur [[Cricket|cricket club]] consisting of a number of teams of varying abilities, playing across various formats of cricket. The club’s pavilion is located on Twickenham Green, [[Twickenham]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|London Borough of Richmond]]. The main home ground is on Twickenham Green and is roughly triangular in shape, bordered by Staines Road (the A305) to the North, Hampton Road to the South East and First Cross Road to the West.

==Early history==

The earliest record of cricket being played in Twickenham dates back to 1735 by Lady Suffolk, in a letter to her husband, suggesting she had learned of the game at Marble Hill House and might practice that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/tour_detail.asp?TourID=81&lt;/ref&gt; Under the name of Twickenham Cricket Club, the club prides itself on being amongst the oldest sporting teams and oldest cricket teams in the world. The first recorded match played by Twickenham Cricket Club was on 29 July 1833 against Thames Ditton. The two clubs met again for a centenary match a hundred years later, the match stands unique as the only joint centenary match played by the original teams.&lt;ref name="twickenhamcc.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twickenhamcc.net/History.htm|title=History|work=twickenhamcc.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of the 1833 match can be found on display within the pavilion along with records of matches over the following 20 years, which provide a rare insight into the early form and traditions of the game. Some matches being played "For the Honour of the Game" whilst other games were played for "A New Ball". Other quirks of the early games include batsmen being "Thrown" rather than "Run Out" and "Hit Foot" rather than "LBW" or "Leg Before Wicket". What is currently termed as a victory "By and Innings" was then referred to as "Single Handed".&lt;ref name="twickenhamcc.net"/&gt;

The old score cards show comparatively low scores, with 73 being the highest individual batsman’s score for the twenty-year period (by comparison, in the 2014 season alone, 11 Twickenham batsmen scored centuries).&lt;ref name="twickenhamcc.net"/&gt;

==1st XI==

Since 2007, Twickenham’s premier side has competed in the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL), winning promotion from Division 3 in their inaugural season under the captaincy of Jon Varney.&lt;ref name="middlesexccl.com"&gt;http://www.middlesexccl.com/LeagueHistory/LeagueHistory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion from Division 2 to the MCCL Premier Division followed in 2009 thanks in part to a successful season by Ts ex Colt James Munting who took 5 wickets on 6 occasions, a standing club record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play-cricket.com/website/player_stats_widget/bowling_stats/450158?rule_type_id=179|title=Play-Cricket|work=play-cricket.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; New captain, The powerful top order batsman Carlos Nunes was also influential with the bat. In a dramatic final game of the 2009 season the Twickenham tail were guided from a seemingly impossible position by the experienced John Paul Cronje, to achieve the necessary draw against promotion rivals, Southgate CC, to pip them to promotion. The dramatic achievement was immortalised by the opposition’s light hearted, comical depiction of how Adolf Hitler may have interpreted the result, on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc_52gNxlPA|title=Southgate CC End of Season Review Meeting|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twickenham found Premier league cricket challenging, lasting just 2 seasons before they were relegated in 2011. The acquisition of Indian Left Arm spinner Parminder Singh in 2012 proved decisive as well as bringing on internal talent as he returned Twickenham CC best bowling figures of 18-8 early on in a season which saw him finish with a bowling average of just 10 runs per wicket taken.&lt;ref&gt;http://middlesexccl.play-cricket.com/subsite/player_stats_widget/bowling_stats/11683534&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was secured with just 1 defeat all season and 12 victories (2 draws and 3 abandonments due to inclement weather).&lt;ref name="middlesexccl.com"/&gt; Singh continued leading the Twickenham attack and the records continued to be broken. In the 2013 season Twickenham finished mid table in the Premiership, thanks in no small part to Singh’s record breaking June when he took 18 wickets, the most by any Twickenham bowler in one month. In 2014 Singh took a club record 52 wickets in a season which saw Twickenham finish runners up only to Teddington in the club's highest ever league position.

==Other competitive teams==

In 2008 Twickenham increased their number of Saturday sides from the long-standing 4 teams to 5 with their 2nd XI and 3rd XI both playing in the appropriate MCCL Leagues. The 4th XI and 5th XI playing in the local 1987 league. Success of the higher rated teams in the club saw demand for places exceed supply in 2014 and in order to accommodate paid up members, a 6th XI was formed playing friendly matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twickenham.play-cricket.com/website/web_pages/94676|title=Twickenham CC|work=play-cricket.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 season, captains were Matthew Bendelow (2nd XI), Stuart Amos (3rd XI), Chetan Ubale (4th XI) and Hinay Dassani (5th XI). 6th Team captaincy varies from game to game and is the only club captain not elected.

==Sunday cricket==

Twickenham have traditionally had 2 Sunday men’s sides, one playing competitive cricket in the  Thameside League, the other playing friendly games. Middlesex launched their Development League in 2012 in which youth is mixed with up to 2 senior players within a side. In order to encourage participation from the younger generation, Development Cricket is played in coloured kit (Pyjama Cricket) and with a pink ball – similar to televised one day cricket. Twickenham CC won the inaugural season of the competition.

==Ladies cricket==

Twickenham also runs a successful ladies team which competes in various forms of the game within Middlesex (League, Super 8 and T20). Twickenham ladies generally play games on Sunday’s and home games are played on The Green.

==Colts cricket==

In addition to adult cricket, Twickenham run a number of Colts teams for younger players. Training and introduction to the game of cricket is available from the age of 5 through the specially designed Kwik Cricket form of the game. From the age of 9 to 17, players are able to progress to competitive cricket against other local colts side in age groups of under 10, under 11, under 12, under 13, under 15 and under 17. The colts section is run by Colts Secretary; Tony Ward and training is available from ECB Qualified coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twickenhamcc.net/2014%20TCC%20Colts%20Section.htm|title=Twickenham CC Colts Section 2014|work=twickenhamcc.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112905/http://www.twickenhamcc.net/2014%20TCC%20Colts%20Section.htm|archivedate=28 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sides==

Twickenham Vets (Veterans) were established in 2012 and is made up of players over the age of 40. Friendly games are played regularly throughout the season, against teams of varying standards, including but not exclusively against other vets teams. Fixtures are played on Sundays and captained by James Richards.

Through the season, Twickenham compete in a number of midweek fixtures with home games played on The Green. Fixtures include competitive 20/20 games and other friendly fixtures. Twickenham’s cricket week is traditionally run the first full week of August and includes a number of friendly games – including an annual game against Thames Ditton – to commemorate the original game in 1833.

Twickenham annually runs an internal 6 a side tournament and regularly compete in the local Kew Sixes Tournament. Six-a-side tournaments are held over 1 day and tend to take a ‘World Cup’ format of group games followed by a knock out semi-final and final. Twickenham have also competed in indoor tournaments under the nickname "The Treefrogs" (due to the bright green clothing worn resembling that of the famous red-eyed tree frog immortalised by David Attenborough’s bestseller, Life on Earth).

==Twickenham Green==

Twickenham Green (or The Green) is the primary home venue for Twickenham CC First XI and Second XI (with home games being played on alternate Saturdays). The Green is also the home venue for a number of fixtures on Sunday’s including the Lady’s XI as well as various midweek fixtures hosted by Twickenham CC. The Green has also hired by local businesses to play fixtures not involving Twickenham CC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twickenhamcc.net/Ground%20Locations.htm|title=Ground Locations|work=twickenhamcc.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twickenham Green is a surviving fragment of Hounslow Heath and aside from hosting cricket matches, The Green is believed to have been the location of a Pest House in the 19th Century for those unfortunate enough to be quarantined through infectious diseases. In 1894 The Green was the location of a water pump and it has also been the home of a Salvation Army Band. Prior to becoming the home of Twickenham Cricket Club in the Mid 1850’s, The Green was occupied by allotments and land allocated to the poor, there remains a listed Cattle Trough in the North East corner of The Green. The current owners of the land are London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and managed by the Parks and Open Spaces Service. The land is registered as Common Land.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?imageField.x=11&amp;imageField.y=9&amp;q=Twickenham+green&amp;ContentID=130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://richmond.gov.uk/twick_man_plan_20.10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green is overlooked by The Holy Trinity Church of England Church to the South East and bordered by a number of shops to the North. The Southern corner is bordered by Archdeacon Cambridge's Church of England Primary School and the North East corner hosts a restaurant. There are in total 6 churches visible from The Green and when locals have spotted them all, time can be passed attempting to count as many visible London busses at any one time, due to the popular bus routes along Staines Road and Hampton Road combined with occasional heavy traffic.

Cricket is played at any time on the Western half of The Green with the remainder use for informal pursuits and picnicking by the public, particularly in good weather. On occasions The Green Hosts events including Circuses and Fairs. The Green has been bordered by Lime and Horse Chestnut Trees since 1872 which provide a home to birds, bats, invertebrates and fungi and is divided by a simple path running from Hampton Road to Staines Road.

In winter, the Green is the home venue for Thamesians Rugby Football Club and is also home to a cat called Zinzan who is rumoured to keep The Green free of vermin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twickenhamgreen.org/Pages/AboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|work=twickenhamgreen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The pavilion==

The pavilion is a white, rectangular shaped building housing changing facilities, washing facilities, storage facilities, a kitchen and a bar. The first floor is significantly smaller than the ground floor and is used for home team changing. The bulk of the ground floor is consumed by a bar and associated communal area where cricket teas are served and eaten. The building is serviced with terrestrial and satellite television as well as Wifi.

The pavilion is located in the southern corner of The Green on the apex of First Cross Road and Hampton Road. Parking for the Pavilion is available on these roads at a cost. The Pavilion is fronted by a raised veranda, is surrounded by paving and has a large clock facing the pitch in a traditional cricketing pavilion form.

The pavilion in its current state was opened by The Earl of Wessex on 19 April 2005 after the previous structure, referred to as "Jack The Stripper", was damaged by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalmirror.coraider.com/output/page3852.html|title=News &gt; Engagements &gt; Wednesday List issued 9 March 2005|work=coraider.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128131939/http://royalmirror.coraider.com/output/page3852.html|archivedate=28 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total area of the pavilion covers fractionally over 100&amp;nbsp;square metres, including the storage space for ground maintenance equipment.

==Notable players==

Twickenham CC’s honours boards are displayed within the Pavilion and note members holding important positions including non-playing positions such as Secretaries and Chairmen and playing positions such as Team Captains and Club Captains.

'''West Palm Beach Christian Convention Center''' (originally known as '''West Palm Beach Auditorium''') is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], at the intersection of North Congress Avenue and Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard. It was built in 1965 as the West Palm Beach Auditorium and was designed by famed architect [[Bertrand Goldberg]]. It was home to the [[West Palm Beach Blaze]] [[ice hockey]] team, [[Florida Bobcats]] [[arena football]] team and [[Florida Hammerheads]] [[roller hockey]] team. It hosted the twelfth [[WWE|WWF]] [[In Your House]] pay-per-view in 1996.  The [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977–1983)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] played their indoor soccer games here in the early 1980s. It was also host to innumerable concerts from different rock acts.

The facility was sold in the late 1990s to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., the main legal entity used by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The building and grounds were renovated and the name was changed to West Palm Beach Christian Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5609807_ITM Jehovah's Witnesses Center Proves a Draw in West Palm Beach, Fla, Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News, Author: Warren, Rachel, Publication Date: 27-OCT-98]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now used only for their assemblies and conventions.

'''Windmill Down''' is a rural location near the town of [[Hambledon, Hampshire|Hambledon]] in [[Hampshire]]. From 1782 to 1795, it was the home of the [[Hambledon Club]] as a noted [[cricket]] venue.

==Opening of Windmill Down==
Hambledon used [[Broadhalfpenny Down]] from at least 1753 until 1781 when it was abandoned for being "too remote". Broadhalfpenny is about two miles from the village whereas Windmill Down is adjacent. Oddly enough, Broadhalfpenny had a good pub immediately opposite (the famous [[Bat and Ball Inn]]) but Windmill Down did not! &lt;ref name=GDC&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''The Glory Days of Cricket'', Robson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On Tuesday 18 June 1782, the ''Hampshire Chronicle'' reported the first meeting on Windmill Down, referring to the ground as "a field called the New Broad Halfpenny adjoining to the Town of Hambledon".&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G B Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable but unconfirmed that the first match was played there a week later. The first definite [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] was [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] v [[Non-international England cricket teams|All-England]] in August 1782, All-England winning by 147 runs.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B/&gt;

==Last match==
Windmill Down was used regularly as the home venue for Hampshire matches until July 1795 when the last recorded match took place there.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lusitano stallion1.jpg|right|thumb|Equitação de Trabalho, Portuguese working equitation]]
'''Working equitation''' is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] discipline. The world regulatory body is the World Association for Working Equitation.

The Working Equitation discipline is intended to promote competition between traditional styles of riding used during fieldwork in various countries, and also to act as a showcase for traditional riding costumes and equipment. Working Equitation became a competitive sport in 1996 along with its first European championship being held in Italy the same year. Working Equitation is recognised as a sport in many countries, mostly in [[South America]] and [[Europe]], all countries have their own governing body of the sport. The sport tests the horse and rider's partnership and ability to manoeuvre obstacles. There are four different levels of Working Equitation: Novice, Intermediate, Junior and Advanced. At advanced level, the rider must ride with just one hand, most commonly their left hand, on the reins.{{r|we}}

Competition events may be individual or for teams, and are in three or four parts, in this order:

* [[Dressage]], in which the horse and rider perform obligatory movements in a freestyle dressage test to music within a specified time scale.
* Ease of Handling Trial, a [[gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]]-type event in which horses must overcome obstacles similar to those likely to appear in the field, such as bridges and gates. The obstacle course is designed to show the partnership between horse and rider.
* Speed, where similar obstacles must be overcome, but against time
* Cow (only for team competitions), in which the four team members separate a specific numbered cow from a group.{{r|wei}}

The Team event at the 2010 European Working Equitation Championships was won by riders from Portugal.{{r|cow}}

==World Championships==

The first Working Equitation World Championship was held from 11–13 October 2002 at [[Beja, Portugal]], with teams from Brazil, France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.{{r|wc1}} The team from Portugal won the team event, and the individual competition was won by Fabio Lombardo of Brazil on Brilho do Rimo with 100 points.{{r|wc1i}}

In the second Working Equitation World Championship in [[Lisbon]] from 26 to 29 October 2006, there were teams from France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Portuguese team won the team event for the second time in a row{{r|wc2}} and David Duarte Oliveira of Portugal won the individual event with his horse Mulato.{{r|wc2i}}

The third World Championship was held five years later, from 26–30 October 2011, in [[Lyon]], France. There were six national teams and 25 individual riders from 8 different countries.The team from Portugal again won the team event, and Pedro Torres of Portugal won the individual event on Oxidado.{{r|wc3i|wc3}}

At the fourth World Championship, held at [[Ebreichsdorf]] in Austria from 5–8 June 2014, there were 28 individual entries from 10 different countries, but only four national teams. The Portuguese team again won the team event and the four members of the team took the first four places in the individual event, which was won by Bruno Pica da Conceição and Trinco.{{r|wc4|wc4i}}
