'''{{mp|2000 EM|26}}''' is a [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth]] and [[potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous]] [[asteroid]]. It was discovered on 5 March 2000 and observed through 14 March 2000 by which time it had dimmed to [[apparent magnitude]] 20&lt;ref name="mpc"/&gt; and was 40 degrees from the moon.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2000"/&gt; By 17 March 2000 it was only 4 degrees from a 90% [[Lunar phase|waxing gibbous moon]].&lt;ref name="NEODyS2000"/&gt; It has never been listed on the [[Sentry Risk Table]] because none of the potential orbital solutions create a risk of impact in the next ~100 years. The asteroid is up to {{convert|270|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and safely passed by [[Earth]] on 17–18 February 2014.&lt;ref name="TI-20140218" /&gt; Due to the poorly determined orbit, the asteroid may have been significantly further from Earth and dozens of degrees from where the telescope was pointed during the 2014 approach.

The 2014 approach was broadcast live (YouTube archive&lt;ref name="YT-20140218" /&gt;) on the internet at 09:00pm EST (02:00 UTC), 18 February 2014, by the [[Slooh|Slooh community observatory]].&lt;ref name="HS-20140216" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PHY-20140214" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20140215" /&gt;  Slooh's [[Teide Observatory|observatory]] on [[Teide|Mount Teide]] in Spain's [[Canary Islands]] was iced over at the time, so images from the Slooh observatory in [[Dubai]] were used to attempt detection of the asteroid.  At the time of the broadcast, no obvious image of the asteroid could be seen.&lt;ref name="TI-20140218" /&gt; Some viewers complained by [[Twitter]] that it was boring when the object was never shown in the images, while others said that "boring" was a good outcome for a pass-by.&lt;ref name="USA-20140218" /&gt;

{{mp|2000 EM|26}} is an [[Aten asteroid|Aten-family asteroid]],&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB" /&gt; and as such is often near the glare of the Sun as the asteroid seldom travels outside Earth's orbit when the Earth is nearby. The orbit was poorly constrained in 2014 since the asteroid had an observation arc of only 9 days creating an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|orbital uncertainty]] of 7.&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB" /&gt; Since the asteroid had not been observed since 14 March 2000, the uncertainty region had kept increasing.&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB" /&gt; During the 2014 approach, 17 February 2014 was the first day that the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbit had a [[Elongation (astronomy)|solar elongation]] more than 90 degrees from the Sun making it easier to recover under a dark sky.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; Using the nominal orbit, the asteroid was expected to have an [[apparent magnitude]] of about 16&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; and pass {{convert|0.02|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB"/&gt; Closest approach ([[perigee]]-geocentrical) was around 00:15 UTC on 18 February plus or minus about 13 hours.&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB"/&gt; Even with an observation arc of 9 days, it was known that the minimum possible close approach distance to Earth on 18 February 2014 was {{convert|0.018|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} with a small chance that the asteroid would pass as far as {{convert|0.13|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB" /&gt; Due to the uncertainty region of the asteroid, the asteroid could have been 75 degrees from the nominal position in the sky on 18 February 2014.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt;

With an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude (H)]] of 21.7,&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB"/&gt; the asteroid is estimated as around {{convert|120 - 270|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, depending on the [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] (the amount of light it reflects).&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

{{mp|2000 EM|26}} was recovered on 24 February 2017 at magnitude 21, extending the observation arc to 17 years.&lt;ref name="MPEC2017-D78"/&gt; It is now known that {{mp|2000 EM|26}} passed {{convert|0.03665|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth on 17 February 2014.&lt;ref name="JPL-SBDB"/&gt;

'''{{mp|2016 WF|9}}''' is a dark, sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] and suspected [[extinct comet]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; 

== Description ==

{{mp|2016 WF|9}} is unusually dark for a near-Earth asteroid. It is possibly an [[extinct comet]], but without the [[comet]]-like dust and gas cloud.&lt;ref name="NASA-news"/&gt; It was first observed on 27 November 2016 by [[NEOWISE]], the asteroid-and-comet-hunting portion of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer ([[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]]) mission.&lt;ref name="NASA-news"/&gt; According to NEOWISE, this object could have [[comet]]ary origins, which illustrates the blurry boundary between asteroids and comets. It is speculated that over time, this object has lost the majority of the [[volatiles]] on its surface.&lt;ref name="UT-20161230"/&gt;

{{mp|2016 WF|9}} is about {{convert|0.5-1.0|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} across so is one of the larger [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] near-Earth object ''(also see [[Potentially hazardous object#Largest PHAs|list of largest PHAs]])''.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

=== 2017 approach ===

{{mp|2016 WF|9}} passed [[Earth]] on 25 February 2017 at a distance of {{convert|0.3407|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} and is not considered a threat for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The 2017 approach did not bring it particularly close to Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt; In December 1944 it passed about {{convert|0.19|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth and in February 2149 it will pass about {{convert|0.06|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

=== Discovery ===

'''Power''' in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In [[alternating current]] circuits, energy storage elements such as [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.

The portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the [[AC waveform]], results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as '''active power''' (more commonly called '''real power''' to avoid ambiguity especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents). The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as ''reactive power''.

=={{anchor|Active power|Reactive power|Apparent power|Complex power|Real power}}Active, reactive, and apparent power==
In a simple [[alternating current]] (AC) circuit consisting of a source and a linear load, both the current and voltage are [[sine wave|sinusoidal]]. If the load is purely [[resistive]], the two quantities reverse their polarity at the same time. At every instant the product of voltage and current is positive or zero, the result being that the direction of energy flow does not reverse. In this case, only active power is transferred. 

If the load is purely [[Electrical reactance|''reactive'']], then the voltage and current are 90&amp;nbsp;degrees out of phase. For two quarters of each cycle, the product of voltage and current is positive, but for the other two quarters, the product is negative, indicating that on average, exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows back out. There is no net energy flow over each half cycle. In this case, only reactive power flows: There is no net transfer of energy to the load; however, electrical power does flow along the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires.  The current required for this reactive power flow dissipates energy in the line resistance, even if the ideal load device consumes no energy itself. Practical loads have resistance as well as inductance, or capacitance, so both active and reactive powers will flow to normal loads.

Apparent power is the product of the [[root-mean-square|rms]] values of voltage and current. Apparent power is taken into account when designing and operating power systems, because although the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load, it still must be supplied by the power source. Conductors, transformers and generators must be sized to carry the total current, not just the current that does useful work. Failure to provide for the supply of sufficient reactive power in electrical grids can lead to lowered voltage levels and under certain operating conditions to the complete collapse of the network or [[Power outage|blackout]]. Another consequence is that adding the apparent power for two loads will not accurately give the total power unless they have the same phase difference between current and voltage (the same [[power factor]]). 

Conventionally, capacitors are treated as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' ('generated') by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90&amp;nbsp;degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90&amp;nbsp;degrees. The result of this is that capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://electricalnotes.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/importance-of-reactive-power-for-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512200158/https://electricalnotes.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/importance-of-reactive-power-for-system/ |archivedate=2015-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cmplxpower.svg|thumb|280px|'''&lt;u&gt;The Power Triangle&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;br&gt;The complex power is the vector sum of active and reactive power. The apparent power is the magnitude of the complex power.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Active power''', ''P''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Reactive power''', ''Q''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Complex power''', ''S''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Apparent power''', ''&amp;#124;S&amp;#124;''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Phase of voltage relative to current''', &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;]]

Engineers use the following terms to describe energy flow in a system (and assign each of them a different unit to differentiate between them):
* '''Active power''',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=131-11-42 Definition of Active Power in the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423120137/http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=131-11-42 |date=April 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P'', or '''real power''':&lt;ref&gt;''IEEE 100 : the authoritative dictionary of IEEE standards terms.-7th ed.'' {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}}, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[watt]] (W);
* '''Reactive power''', ''Q'': [[volt-ampere reactive]] (var);
* '''Complex power''', ''S'': [[volt-ampere]] (VA);
* '''Apparent power''', |''S''|: the [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] of complex power ''S'': volt-ampere (VA);
* '''Phase of voltage relative to current''', ''φ'': the angle of difference (in degrees) between current and voltage; &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\arg(V)-\arg(I)&lt;/math&gt;. Current lagging voltage ([[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] I vector), current leading voltage (quadrant IV vector). 

These are all denoted in the adjacent diagram (called a Power Triangle).

In the diagram, ''P'' is the active power, ''Q'' is the reactive power (in this case positive), ''S'' is the complex power and the length of ''S'' is the apparent power. Reactive power does not do any work, so it is represented as the '''imaginary axis''' of the vector diagram. Active power does do work, so it is the real axis.

The unit for all forms of power is the [[watt]] (symbol: W), but this unit is generally reserved for active power. Apparent power is conventionally expressed in [[volt-ampere]]s (VA) since it is the product of [[root mean square|rms]] [[voltage]] and rms [[electric current|current]]. The unit for reactive power is expressed as var, which stands for [[volt-ampere reactive]]. Since reactive power transfers no net energy to the load, it is sometimes called "wattless" power. It does, however, serve an important function in [[electrical grid]]s and its lack has been cited as a significant factor in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=August 14, 2003 Outage - Sequence of Events |url=http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/blackout/09-12-03-blackout-sum.pdf |publisher=[[FERC]] |date=2003-09-12 |accessdate=2008-02-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020070028/http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/blackout/09-12-03-blackout-sum.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the relationship among these three quantities lies at the heart of understanding power engineering. The mathematical relationship among them can be represented by vectors or expressed using complex numbers, ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''j&amp;nbsp;Q'' (where ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]]).

==Calculations and equations==
The formula for complex power (units: VA) in [[phasor]] form is:

&lt;math&gt;S=VI^*=|S|\angle\varphi&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''V'' denotes voltage in phasor form, with the amplitude as [[Root mean square|rms]], and ''I'' denotes current in phasor form, with the amplitude as rms. Also by convention, the [[complex conjugate]] of ''I'' is used, which is denoted &lt;math&gt;I^*&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\overline I&lt;/math&gt;), rather than ''I'' itself. This is done such that a leading current (capacitive load, negative reactance) results in negative reactive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactive Power|url=https://ctlsys.com/reactive_power/|website=Continental Control Systems, LLC|accessdate=4 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405074217/https://ctlsys.com/reactive_power/|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of complex power (units in volt-amps, VA) are derived from ''Z'', the load impedance (units in ohms, Ω).

&lt;math&gt;S=|I|^2 Z= \frac{|V|^2}{Z^*}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consequentially, with reference to the power triangle, real power (units in watts, W) is derived as:

&lt;math&gt; P=|S|\cos{\varphi}=|I|^2 R=\frac{|V|^2}{|Z|^2} \times{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a purely resistive load, real power can be simplified to:

&lt;math&gt; P = \frac{|V|^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

''R'' denotes resistance (units in ohms, Ω) of the load.

Reactive power (units in volts-amps-reactive, var) is derived as:

&lt;math&gt;Q=|S|\sin{\varphi}=|I|^2 X=\frac{|V|^2}{|Z|^2} \times{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a purely reactive load, reactive power can be simplified to:

&lt;math&gt; Q = \frac{|V|^2}{X}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''X'' denotes reactance (units in ohms, Ω) of the load.

Combining, the complex power (units in volt-amps, VA) is back-derived as

&lt;math&gt;S=P+jQ&lt;/math&gt;,

and the apparent power (units in volt-amps, VA) as

&lt;math&gt;|S|=\sqrt{P^2+Q^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

These are simplified diagrammatically by the power triangle.

==Power factor==
{{Main article|Power factor}}
The ratio of active power to apparent power in a circuit is called the [[power factor]]. For two systems transmitting the same amount of active power, the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load. These higher currents produce higher losses and reduce overall transmission efficiency.  A lower power factor circuit will have a higher apparent power and higher losses for the same amount of active power. The power factor is 1.0 when the voltage and current are in [[Phase (waves)|phase]].  It is zero when the current leads or lags the voltage by 90 degrees. When the voltage and current are 180 degrees out of phase, the power factor is negative one, and the load is feeding energy into the source (an example would be a home with solar cells on the roof that feed power into the power grid when the sun is shining). Power factors are usually stated as "leading" or "lagging" to show the sign of the phase angle of current with respect to voltage. Voltage is designated as the base to which current angle is compared, meaning that we think of current as either "leading" or "lagging" voltage. Where the waveforms are purely sinusoidal, the power factor is the cosine of the phase angle (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) between the current and voltage sinusoid waveforms. Equipment data sheets and nameplates will often abbreviate power factor as "&lt;math&gt;\cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;" for this reason.

Example: The active power is {{nowrap|700 W}} and the phase angle between voltage and current is 45.6°. The power factor is {{nowrap|cos(45.6°) &amp;#61; 0.700}}. The apparent power is then: {{nowrap|700 W / cos(45.6°) &amp;#61; 1000 VA}}.&lt;ref name="utm_my-AC_CircuitAnalysis2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electric-shocks.com/average-power-in-ac-circuit-and-pf/|title=Average Power in an AC circuit calculation|last=|first=|date=|website=Electric Shocks: The shock you need|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}The concept of power dissipation in ac circuit is explained and illustrated with the example.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, a power factor of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 percent of the total current supplied is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses, as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that cause the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacities.

==Reactive power==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
In a direct current circuit, the power flowing to the load is proportional to the product of the current through the load and the potential drop across the load.  Energy flows in one direction from the source to the load. In AC power, the voltage and current both vary approximately sinusoidally. When there is inductance or capacitance in the circuit, the voltage and current waveforms do not line up perfectly. The power flow has two components - one component flows from source to load and can perform work at the load; the other portion, known as "reactive power", is due to the delay between voltage and current, known as phase angle, and cannot do useful work at the load. It can be thought of as current that is arriving at the wrong time (too late or too early). To distinguish reactive power from active power, it is measured in units of "[[volt-amperes reactive]]", or var. These units can simplify to Watts, but are left as var to denote that they represent no actual work output.

Energy stored in capacitive or inductive elements of the network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as [[flexible AC transmission system|reactive compensation]] is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load, a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor and not have to be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice saves energy because it reduces the amount of energy that is required to be produced by the utility to do the same amount of work. Additionally, it allows for more efficient transmission line designs using smaller conductors or fewer bundled conductors and optimizing the design of transmission towers.

=== Capacitive vs. inductive loads ===
Stored energy in the magnetic or electric field of a load device, such as a motor or capacitor, causes an offset between the current and the voltage waveforms.  A capacitor is an AC device that stores energy in the form of an electric field. As current is driven through the capacitor, charge build-up causes an opposing voltage to develop across the capacitor. This voltage increases until some maximum dictated by the capacitor structure. In an AC network, the voltage across a capacitor is constantly changing. The capacitor opposes this change, causing the current to lead the voltage in phase. Capacitors are said to "source" reactive power, and thus to cause a leading power factor.

Induction machines are some of the most common types of loads in the electric power system today. These machines use [[inductors]], or large coils of wire to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a voltage is initially placed across the coil, the inductor strongly resists this change in current and magnetic field, which causes a time delay for the current to reach its maximum value. This causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase. Inductors are said to "sink" reactive power, and thus to cause a lagging power factor. [[Induction generator]]s can source or sink reactive power, and provide a measure of control to system operators over reactive power flow and thus voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~dolguin/mas961/loads.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025015726/http://web.media.mit.edu/~dolguin/mas961/loads.html |archivedate=2015-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these devices have opposite effects on the phase angle between voltage and current, they can be used to "cancel out" each other's effects. This usually takes the form of capacitor banks being used to counteract the lagging power factor caused by induction motors.

==Reactive power control==
Transmission connected generators are generally required to support reactive power flow. For example, on the United Kingdom transmission system, generators are required by the Grid Code Requirements to supply their rated power between the limits of 0.85 power factor lagging and 0.90 power factor leading at the designated terminals. The system operator will perform switching actions to maintain a secure and economical voltage profile while maintaining a reactive power balance equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Generator\ MVARs + System\ gain + Shunt\ capacitors = MVAR\ Demand + Reactive\ losses + Shunt\ reactors}&lt;/math&gt;

The ‘system gain’ is an important source of reactive power in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator use will be required. Other sources of reactive power that will also be used include shunt capacitors, shunt reactors, [[static VAR compensator]]s and voltage control circuits.

==Unbalanced polyphase systems==
While active power and reactive power are well defined in any system, the definition of apparent power for unbalanced polyphase systems is considered to be one of the most controversial topics in power engineering.  Originally, apparent power arose merely as a figure of merit.  Major delineations of the concept are attributed to [[William Stanley, Jr.|Stanley]]'s ''Phenomena of Retardation in the Induction Coil'' (1888) and [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz|Steinmetz]]'s ''Theoretical Elements of Engineering'' (1915).  However, with the development of [[three phase]] power distribution, it became clear that the definition of apparent power and the power factor could not be applied to unbalanced [[polyphase systems]].  In 1920, a "Special Joint Committee of the AIEE and the National Electric Light Association" met to resolve the issue.  They considered two definitions. 
: &lt;math&gt;S_A = |S_\mathrm{a}| + |S_\mathrm{b}| + |S_\mathrm{c}|&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pf}_A = {P_\mathrm{a} + P_\mathrm{b} + P_\mathrm{c} \over S_A}&lt;/math&gt;,

that is, the arithmetic sum of the phase apparent powers; and 
: &lt;math&gt;S_V = |P_\mathrm{a} + P_\mathrm{b} + P_\mathrm{c} + j(Q_\mathrm{a} + Q_\mathrm{b} + Q_\mathrm{c})|&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pf}_V = {P_\mathrm{a} + P_\mathrm{b} + P_\mathrm{c} \over S_V}&lt;/math&gt;,

that is, the magnitude of total three-phase complex power. 

The 1920 committee found no consensus and the topic continued to dominate discussions.  In 1930, another committee formed and once again failed to resolve the question.  The transcripts of their discussions are the lengthiest and most controversial ever published by the AIEE.&lt;ref name="Emanuel_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emanuel |first1=Alexander |title=On The Definition of Power Factor and Apparent Power in Unbalanced Polyphase Circuits with Sinusoidal Voltage and Currents |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery |date=July 1993 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=841 - 852 |doi=10.1109/61.252612 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/252612/ |accessdate=5 September 2018 |ref=Emanuel_1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further resolution of this debate did not come until the late 1990s.

A new definition based on [[Symmetrical components]] theory was proposed in 1993 by Alexander Emanuel for unbalanced linear load supplied with asymmetrical sinusoidal voltages: 
: &lt;math&gt;S = \sqrt{ \left( |V_\mathrm{a}^2| + |V_\mathrm{b}^2| + |V_\mathrm{c}^2| \right ) \left ( |I_\mathrm{a}^2| + |I_\mathrm{b}^2| + |I_\mathrm{c}^2| \right )}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pf} = {P^+ \over S}&lt;/math&gt;,

that is, the root of squared sums of line voltages multiplied by the root of squared sums of line currents. 
&lt;math&gt;P^+&lt;/math&gt; denotes the positive sequence power:
:&lt;math&gt;P^+ = 3 |V^+| |I^+| cos(arg(V^+) - arg(I^+))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V^+&lt;/math&gt; denotes the positive sequence voltage phasor, and 
&lt;math&gt;I^+&lt;/math&gt; denotes the positive sequence current phasor. &lt;ref name="Emanuel_1993" /&gt;

==Real number formulas==
A perfect resistor stores no energy; so current and voltage are in phase. Therefore, there is no reactive power and &lt;math&gt;P=S&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, for a perfect resistor
:&lt;math&gt;P = S = V_\mathrm{RMS} I_\mathrm{RMS} = I_\mathrm{RMS}^2 R = \frac{V_\mathrm{RMS}^2} {R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

For a perfect capacitor or inductor, there is no net power transfer; so all power is reactive. Therefore, for a perfect capacitor or inductor:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P &amp;= 0 \\
  Q &amp;= |S| = V_\mathrm{RMS} I_\mathrm{RMS} = I_\mathrm{RMS}^2 |X| = \frac{V_\mathrm{RMS}^2}{|X|}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

where ''X'' is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] of the capacitor or inductor.

If X is defined as being positive for an inductor and negative for a capacitor, then we can remove the [[absolute value|modulus]] signs from S and X and get
:&lt;math&gt;Q = I_\mathrm{RMS}^2 X = \frac{V_\mathrm{RMS}^2} {X}&lt;/math&gt;.

Instantaneous power is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{inst}(t) = V(t)\cdot I(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where&lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; are the time-varying voltage and current waveforms.

This definition is useful because it applies to all waveforms, whether they are sinusoidal or not. This is particularly useful in power electronics, where nonsinusoidal waveforms are common.

In general, we are interested in the active power averaged over a period of time, whether it is a low frequency line cycle or a high frequency power converter switching period. The simplest way to get that result is to take the integral of the instantaneous calculation over the desired period:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{avg} = \frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\int_{t_1}^{t_2} V(t)I(t)\,\operatorname{d}t&lt;/math&gt;.

This method of calculating the average power gives the active power regardless of [[harmonic content]] of the waveform. In practical applications, this would be done in the digital domain, where the calculation becomes trivial when compared to the use of rms and phase to determine active power:
:&lt;math&gt; P_\text{avg} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n  V[k]I[k] &lt;/math&gt;.

==Multiple frequency systems==
Since an RMS value can be calculated for any waveform, apparent power can be calculated from this. For active power it would at first appear that we would have to calculate many product terms and average all of them. However, if we look at one of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;A\cos(\omega_1t+k_1)\cos(\omega_2t + k_2) \\
  = {} &amp;\frac{A}{2}\cos\left[\left(\omega_1t + k_1\right) + \left(\omega_2t + k_2\right)\right] + \frac{A}{2}\cos\left[\left(\omega_1t + k_1\right) - \left(\omega_2t + k_2\right)\right] \\
  = {} &amp;\frac{A}{2}\cos\left[\left(\omega_1 + \omega_2\right)t + k_1 + k_2\right] + \frac{A}{2}\cos\left[\left(\omega_1 - \omega_2\right)t + k_1 - k_2\right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the time average of a function of the form cos(ω''t''+''k'') is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic currents]] are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active [[power factor correction]] circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.

The '''Balsas dry forests''' are a tropical [[ecoregion]], of the [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] [[Biome]], located in western and central [[Mexico]].

==Geography==
The Balsas dry forests occupy the basin of the [[Balsas River]]. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|62,400|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The Balsas Valley, and the Balsas dry forests, extend east and west between the ranges of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] to the north and the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the south. 

The Balsas dry forests ecoregion extends across portions of the states of:
#[[Michoacán]]
#[[Guerrero]]
#[[Mexico (state)]]
#[[Morelos]]
#[[Puebla]]
#[[Oaxaca]]

==Surrounding ecoregions==
The surrounding mountains are home to [[Mesoamerican pine-oak forests|pine-oak forests]]: the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]] to the north and northwest, the [[Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests]] to the south, and the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca pine-oak forests]] to the east. The [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric]] [[Tehuacan Valley matorral]] lies to the northeast. The Balsas dry forests meet the coastal [[Southern Pacific dry forests]] where the Balsas breaks through the Sierra Madre del Sur on its way to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

===Climate===
The climate of the Balsas dry forests is tropical and subhumid. Rainfall is less than 120 centimeters (47 inches) per year and seasonal, with a dry season that can last up to eight months.

'''Black ice''', sometimes called '''clear ice''', is a thin coating of [[glaze (ice)|glaze ice]] on a surface, especially on roads. The ice itself is not black, but visually [[transparency (optics)|transparent]], allowing the often black road below to be seen through it. The typically low levels of noticeable ice pellets, snow, or sleet surrounding black ice means that areas of the ice are often practically invisible to drivers or people stepping on it. There is, thus, a risk of skidding and subsequent accident due to the unexpected loss of traction.

== Definitions ==
The term ''black ice'' in the United States is often incorrectly used to describe any type of ice that forms on roadways, even when standing water on roads turns to ice as the temperature falls below freezing.  Correctly defined, black ice is formed on relatively dry roads, rendering it invisible to drivers.  It occurs when in the textures present in all pavements very slightly below the top of the road surface contain water or moisture, thereby presenting a dry surface to tires until that water or moisture freezes and expands; drivers then find they are riding above the road surface on a honeycombed invisible sheet of ice.

Three other definitions of black ice by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/blackice.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010739/http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/rapid_cyclo/www/english/glossary/blackice.htm |dead-url = yes |archive-date = December 3, 2013 |title = Black Ice |author = World Meteorological Organization |publisher = Eumetcal |accessdate = November 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A thin ice layer on a fresh or salt water body which appears dark in colour because of its transparency;
*A mariner's term for a dreaded form of icing sometimes sufficiently heavy to capsize a small ship;
*Another term for ice on rocks in the mountains known equally as ''verglas'' ([[glaze ice]]).

==Formation==

===On roads and pavements===
The [[American Meteorological Society]] Glossary of Meteorology includes the definition of black ice as "a thin sheet of ice, relatively dark in appearance, [that] may form when light rain or drizzle falls on a road surface that is at a temperature below {{convert|0|C|F}}."&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Black_ice |title=AMS Glossary: Black ice |publisher=Amsglossary.allenpress.com |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it represents only a thin accumulation, black ice is highly transparent and thus difficult to see as compared with [[snow]], frozen [[slush]], or thicker ice layers. In addition, it often is interleaved with wet pavement, which is nearly identical in appearance. This makes driving, cycling or walking on affected surfaces extremely dangerous. [[Deicing]] with [[salt]] ([[sodium chloride]]) is effective down to temperatures of about {{convert|-18|C|F}}.  Other compounds such as [[magnesium chloride]] or [[calcium chloride]] have been used for very cold temperatures since the [[freezing-point depression]] of their solutions is lower.

At low temperatures (below {{convert|0|F|C|order=flip|disp=sqbr}}), black ice can form on roadways when the moisture from automobile exhaust condenses on the road surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2016/is-there-really-such-a-thing-as-black-ice| title=Is there really such a thing as black ice? |accessdate=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Such conditions caused multiple accidents in [[Minnesota]] when the temperatures dipped below {{convert|-18|C|F}} for a prolonged period of time in mid-December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.kare11.com/news.jsp?key=96528&amp;rc=lo |title=Black ice causes treacherous driving conditions in metro |publisher=KARE 11 TV |accessdate=December 22, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salt's ineffectiveness at [[De-ice#Roadways|melting ice]] at these temperatures compounds the problem. Black ice may form even when the [[ambient temperature]] is several degrees above the [[Melting point|freezing]] point of [[water]] {{convert|0|C|F}}, if the air warms suddenly after a prolonged cold spell that has left the surface of the roadway well below the freezing point temperature.

On December 1, 2013, heavy post-Thanksgiving weekend traffic encountered black ice on the westbound I-290 expressway in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. A [[chain reaction]] series of crashes resulted, involving three [[tractor-trailer]]s and over 60 other vehicles. The ice formed suddenly on a long downward slope, surprising drivers coming over the crest of a hill, who could not see crashed vehicles ahead until it was too late to stop on the slick pavement.&lt;ref name=Abel&gt;{{cite news |last=Abel |first=David |title=On busy travel day, black ice led to massive pileup in Worcester |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/02/icy-roads-lead-vehicle-crash-worcester/oYuQa0J96S8qRykY1a9AyM/story.html |accessdate=December 3, 2013 |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On bridges===
[[File:Icyroadbridge.JPG|thumb|right|Warning sign for bridge on US turnpike]]
Bridges and [[overpass]]es can be especially dangerous.  Black ice forms first on bridges and overpasses because air can circulate both above and below the surface of the elevated roadway when the [[ambient temperature]] drops, causing the bridge pavement temperature to fall more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How it works: Black ice|author=Jeffrey Selingo|date=December 13, 2001|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/technology/how-it-works-black-ice-wise-bridge-repelling-the-foe-before-it-forms.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, road warning signs with the advisory "Bridge May Be Icy" indicate potentially dangerous roadways above bridge structures.

Similar road signs exists throughout [[Canada]], but warnings sometimes appear without words to comply to bilingual requirements. The Canadian sign features a vehicle with skid marks and snow flakes. The same sign's official and undisclosed description is defined as "Pavement is slippery when wet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section3.1.3.shtml |title=Driver's Handbook |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional signs may be attached with various different wording in Canadian provinces that do not have bilingual requirements:

* Bridge Ices
* Slippery When Wet
* Road Ices
* Slippery When Frosty
* Icy Bridge Deck
* Bridge Ices Before Road

====Problems on I-35W Mississippi River bridge====
{{see also|I-35W Mississippi River bridge}}
[[File:I-35W Bridge - April, 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=bridge painted green seen from the Mississippi bank|The [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] seen from below in 2006]]
The [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was well known for its black ice before it collapsed in 2007 into the Mississippi River. It had caused several [[pileup]]s during its 40-year life. On December 19, 1985, the temperature reached {{convert|-34|°C|°F}}. Cars crossing the bridge experienced black ice and there was a massive pile up of crashed vehicles on the bridge on the northbound side. In February and in December 1996, the bridge was identified as the single most treacherous cold-weather spot in the local freeway system, because of the almost frictionless thin layer of black ice that regularly formed when temperatures dropped below freezing. The bridge's proximity to [[Saint Anthony Falls]] contributed significantly to the icing problem and the site was noted for frequent spinouts and collisions.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Laurie. (February 3, 1996) [[Star Tribune]] ''[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62624323.html February deep freeze. Black ice makes I-35W bridge treacherous.]'' Section: news; Page 10A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Sternberg, Bob. (December 27, 1996) [[Star Tribune]] ''Minnesota is one big deep freeze. What is the sound of a cold record shattering? It's the sound of silence from dead motors, of crumpling metal on icy roads, of resigned grumbling. But take heart — it will warm up.'' Section News; page 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1999, Mn/DOT began testing [[magnesium chloride]] solutions and a mixture of magnesium chloride and a corn-processing byproduct to see whether either would reduce the black ice that appeared on the bridge during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Laurie. (January 21, 1999) [[Star Tribune]] ''State hopes to speed up north-metro lane project. But it clashes with Met Council over whether addition to interstate should be for car pools.'' Section news; Page 2B.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999, the state embedded temperature-activated nozzles in the bridge deck to spray the bridge with [[potassium acetate]] solution to keep the area free of winter black ice.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Laurie. (October 19, 1999) [[Star Tribune]] ''I-35W bridge getting de-icer system. Unit will target ice before it can form.'' Section news; Page 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/maintenance/Anti-icing%20evaluation.pdf |title=I-35W &amp; Mississippi River Bridge Anti-Icing Project |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005050312/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/maintenance/Anti-icing%20evaluation.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system came into operation in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Laurie. (January 13, 2000) [[Star Tribune]] ''Met Council will survey our citizens' travel habits. Study will include trip numbers and times, speed of drivers and waits at ramp meters.'' Section news; Page 2B.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Laurie. (February 3, 2000) [[Star Tribune]] ''Richfield may face traffic challenges; How will I-494 accommodate Best Buy's 5,000 commuters?'' Section news, page 2B.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On water===
{{Main article|Congelation ice}}
[[File:Black ice river.jpg|thumb|Black ice on a canal in the [[Netherlands]]]]
When the temperature is below freezing and the wind is calm, such as under a high atmospheric pressure at night in the fall, a thin layer of ice will form over open water of a lake. If the depth of the body of water is large enough, its color is black and can be seen through the ice, thus the name black ice.

Ice can also be formed by [[seawater]] spray and water vapour freezing upon contact with a vessel's [[superstructure]] when temperature is low enough. Ice formed in this manner is known as [[hard rime|''rime'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=r |title=Rime ice |author=National Weather Service |publisher=[[NOAA]] |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the formation progress, the aboveboard weight of the vessel increases and may ultimately cause [[capsizing]]. Furthermore, rime ice may impede the correct functioning of important navigational instruments on board, such as [[radar]] or radio installations. Different strategies for the removal of such ice are employed: chipping away the ice or even using fire hoses in an attempt to remove the ice.

===In mountains===
{{main article|Glaze ice}}
Black ice is a great hazard for [[Climbing|climbers]] and [[Scrambling|scramblers]]. Cold weather is common at high altitudes, and black ice quickly forms on rock surfaces. Loss of traction is as sudden and unexpected as on a pavement or road, but can be fatal if the rock is in an exposed position with a drop below. An [[ice-axe]] and [[crampons]] are essential use in such circumstances as they will help to prevent a fall, and a [[belay]] rope will help to arrest a fall.

[[File:CTD-me-details hg.jpg|thumb|CTD device, disassambled showing pressure housing, sensor cage, connectors, inside electronic with sensors for conductivity, temperature and pressure.]]
[[File:BrnBld CtdRosette.svg|thumb|Side and top views with (grey) [[Nansen bottle|Niskin bottles]] and (blue) CTD-logger]]
A '''CTD''' or '''Sonde''' is an [[oceanography]] instrument used to measure the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], [[temperature]], and [[pressure]] of [[seawater]] (the D stands for "depth," which is closely related to pressure).&lt;ref name=seabird&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seabird.com/products/profilers.htm|title=Profiling CTDs – Sea-Bird Electronics|work=seabird.com|access-date=2011-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002105349/http://www.seabird.com/products/profilers.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTD Instrument and Water Sampler|url=http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/observational_oceanography/instruments/ctd_and_water_sampler/|publisher=Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research|accessdate=19 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007021404/http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/observational_oceanography/instruments/ctd_and_water_sampler/|archivedate=7 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/tools/sonde_ctd/sondectd.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason to measure conductivity is that it can be used to determine the [[salinity]].

The CTD may be incorporated into an array of [[Nansen bottle|Niskin bottles]] referred to as a carousel or [[Rosette sampler|rosette]]. The sampling bottles close at predefined depths, triggered either manually or by a computer, and the water samples may subsequently be analyzed further for biological and chemical parameters.

The CTD may also be used for the [[calibration]] of sensors.

== Measured properties ==
The instrument is a cluster of sensors which measure conductivity, temperature, and pressure. Sensors commonly scan at a rate of 24&amp;nbsp;Hz. Depth measurements are derived from measurement of [[hydrostatic pressure]], and salinity is measured from [[electrical conductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pickard and Emery 1990, p 100&lt;/ref&gt; Sensors are arranged inside a metal or resin housing, the material used for the housing determining the depth to which the CTD can be lowered. Titanium housings allow sampling to depths in excess of {{Convert|10000|m}}.&lt;ref name=seabird /&gt; Other sensors may be added to the cluster, including some that measure chemical or biological parameters, such as [[dissolved oxygen]] and [[chlorophyll fluorescence]], the latter an indication of the concentration of microscopic photosynthetic organisms ([[phytoplankton]]) contained in the water.

== Deployment ==
[[File:CTDdeploy.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A CTD unit being deployed from a ship|Niel Brown Mk3 CTD deployment]]
Deployment of the rosette is from the deck of a research vessel. The instrument is lowered into the water in what is called the downcast to a determined depth or to a few meters above the ocean floor, generally at a rate of about 0.5 m s-1. Most of the time a conducting wire cable is attached to the CTD frame connecting the CTD to an onboard computer, and allows instantaneous uploading and real time visualization of the collected data on the computer screen. The water column profile of the downcast is often used to determine the depths at which the rosette will be stopped on its way back to the surface (the upcast) to collect the water samples using the attached bottles.

== Technological development ==
The CTD system was conceived by Neil Brown at the [[CSIRO]] Division of Marine Research. Lack of interest by the management saw Brown move to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The CTD  overcame the limitations of an earlier similar system also developed by Brown, called an STD. The improvement was made possible thanks to increased reliability and reduced cost of computer technology&lt;ref&gt;Baker 1981, pp 416-418&lt;/ref&gt;.  Prior to this, the Mechanical Bathythermograph (MBT) was the norm

== Advantages and limitations ==
The advantage of CTD casts is the acquisition of high resolution data. The limitation of CTD sampling is that only a point in space (the sampling site) can be sampled at one time, and many casts, which are costly and time-consuming, are needed to acquire a broad picture of the marine environment of interest.
From the information gathered during CTD casts, however, scientists can investigate how physical parameters are related, for example, to the observed distribution and variation of organisms that live in the ocean, thus deepening our understanding of the processes that govern ocean life.

The '''Cave of Haxhi Ali''' ({{lang-sq|Shpella e Haxhi Aliut or Shpella e Ilirëve}}) is a [[karst]] [[cave]] formed in [[limestone]] [[cliff]]s in southwestern [[Albania]], located in the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania|Karaburun Peninsula]] near the [[Cape of Gjuhëz]] in [[Vlorë County]]. The cave was named after Haxhi Aliu, a prominent Albanian warrior and sailor from [[Ulcinj]] who fled with his son in this cave. Several archaeological objects has been found, that prove that this cave was used by traders and passers during the ancient times. The cave has a length of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a width which can vary between of {{convert|10-12|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a height of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turet e Orikumit|url=http://www.al.undp.org/content/dam/albania/docs/Guida_%20orikum.pdf?|website=al.undp.org|page=1|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HAC"/&gt;

Despite its strategic location on the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania|Karaburun Peninsula]] within the [[Albanian Riviera]] it is regarded as one of the country's most beautiful caves and attracts numerous visitors. Notably it has been recognised as a [[natural monument]] of national importance by the [[Ministry of Environment (Albania)|Ministry of Environment]] and is part of the [[Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Llogora-Rreza e Kanalit-Dukat -Orikum-TragjasRadhime-Karaburun  Complex Site|url=http://vinc.s.free.fr/IMG/karaburuni_llogara_MPenglish.pdf|website=vinc.s.free.fr|page=137|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Plan for National Marine Park Karaburun-Sazan|url=http://mcpa.iwlearn.org/docs/management-plan-for-mpa-karaburun-sazani|website=mcpa.iwlearn.org|page=10|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charlestown State Park Entrance.jpg|thumb|290px|Entrance of Charlestown State Park]]
'''Charlestown State Park''' is an [[List of Indiana state parks|Indiana state park]] on {{convert|5100|acre|km2|2}} in [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark County]], [[Indiana]], in the [[United States]]. The park is on the banks of the [[Ohio River]], {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} east of [[Charlestown, Indiana|Charlestown]]. It was once part of the [[Indiana Army Ammunition Plant]] (INAAP), and was donated in separate parcels to the Indiana state government.  In 1993, the state of Indiana was given {{convert|859|acre|km2|2}}, and in 1994 was given an additional {{convert|1125|acre|km2|2}} .  When the park opened in 1996, it encompassed {{convert|2400|acre|km2|1}}.  With an additional {{convert|2600|acre|km2|1}} given by the INAAP in 2004, the park has {{convert|5100|acre|km2|1}}, making it the third largest state park in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/nov05/story16.htm |title=Old ammo plant cleaned up for new use |author=John Fleshman |accessdate=2007-04-02 |publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823213700/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/nov05/story16.htm |archivedate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park attracts 131,000 people a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908191654/http://www.news-tribune.net/archivesearch/local_story_107103248.html?start:int=30 The News and Tribune - SMALL-TOWN GROWING SPURT: Charlestown deals with growing population&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The main feature of the park is various scenic trails overlooking [[Fourteen Mile Creek]], noted for being one of the oldest unglaciated stream valleys in the state. On the peninsula the creek forms where it meets the Ohio River stands an isolated bedrock ridge called the [[Devil's Backbone (rock formation)|Devil's Backbone]].  According to legend, the Devil's Backbone forms part of the remains of an ancient stone fortress built by Welsh adventurers who traveled to the Ohio Valley in the 12th century, though the story is unsubstantiated. The park does not provide any access to this peninsula from its trails. At one time there was a footbridge across the creek used for accessing the [[Rose Island (amusement park)|Rose Island amusement park]], but only concrete pilings remain on each side of the creek.

[[Devonian]] fossils and [[karst]] [[sinkhole]]s can be found in the park, in addition to 72 species of birds, including [[bluebird]]s, black [[vulture]]s and [[bald eagle]]s.

The park is scheduled for $3 million in improvements, which were delayed in January 2006 when workers building a new boat ramp found a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cooking area dating back to 2,000 B.C.  The remains of firepits and stone slabs that would be used to crack nuts were found, as well as Laurel chert, from which stone tools were made.  Only once the archaeological surveys were done could work on the improvements, including a five-lane boat ramp and a riverfront walking trail, continue. In September, 2006 construction of the new boat ramps restarted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-tribune.net/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_256164749.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222024313/http://www.news-tribune.net/siteSearch/apstorysection/local_story_256164749.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-22 |title=Boat ramp construction begins near Charlestown |author=David Mann |accessdate=2007-04-02 |publisher=The Evening News and The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat ramps opened in June 2007.

In September 2011, the historic Portersville Bridge was relocated and reconstructed to cross the creek and connect Rose Island for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=49956 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126193314/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=49956 |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==
There are still railroad tracks and private houses on the property, and the Indiana state government is still deciding what to do with them.  Future developments confirmed by the state for the park include a swimming pool, access to Rose Island via a pedestrian bridge, more trails, improvements to the campground and cabins.&lt;ref&gt;''State leaders sure Charlestown State Park will see improvements'' {{cite web |url=http://www.news-tribune.net/local/local_story_202011721.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906060714/http://www.news-tribune.net/local/local_story_202011721.html |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:6329 - Naples - Pan and Daphne.jpg|thumb|200px|Faunus and [[Daphnis]] practising the [[Pan flute]] (Roman copy of Greek original).]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], '''Faunus''' {{IPA-la|fau̯nʊs|}} was the [[horned deity|horned god]] of the forest, plains and fields; when he made cattle fertile he was called [[Inuus]]. He came to be equated in literature with the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]].

Faunus was one of the oldest Roman deities, known as the ''[[di indigetes]]''. According to the epic poet [[Virgil]], he was a legendary king of the Latins. His shade was consulted as a goddess of prophecy under the name of Fatuus, with oracles&lt;ref&gt;For oracular Faunus, see [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' vii.81; [[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' iv.649; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' ii.6, iii.15 and ''[[De Divinatione]]'' i.101; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] v.16; [[Plutarch]], ''Numa Pompilius'' xv.3; [[Lactantius]] ''Institutiones'' i.22.9; [[Servius]] on the ''Aeneid'' viii.314.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[sacred grove]] of [[Tibur]], around the well [[Albunea]], and on the [[Aventine Hill]] in [[ancient Rome]] itself.&lt;ref name="Peck 1898"&gt;Peck 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] asserted that the oracular responses were given in [[Saturnian (poetry)|Saturnian verse]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' vii. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Faunus revealed the future in dreams and voices that were [[Incubation (ritual)|communicated to those who came to sleep]] in his precincts, lying on the fleeces of sacrificed lambs. [[William Warde Fowler|W. Warde Fowler]] suggested that Faunus is identical with [[Anemoi#West wind|Favonius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W. Warde Fowler |authorlink=William Warde Fowler |title=The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic: An Introduction to the Study of the Religion of the Romans |url=https://archive.org/details/romanfestivalsof00fowluoft |accessdate=2007-06-07 |year=1899 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=London |page=259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the Roman [[wind gods]] (compare the [[Anemoi]]). Faunus is very probably of [[Proto-Indo-European_religion|Indo-European]] origin, which he shares with the Vedic god [[Rudra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nečas Hraste|first1=Daniel|last2=Vuković|first2=Krešimir|title=Rudra-Shiva and Silvanus-Faunus: Savage and Propitious|journal=The Journal of Indo-European Studies|volume=39|issue=1/2|page=100-15|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
There are a number of theories on the origin of the name Faunus. Most scholars of historical linguistics connect Faunus with the notion of divine favour (Latin 'favere' - to be favourable, inclined).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nečas Hraste|first1=Daniel|last2=Vuković|first2=Krešimir|title=Rudra-Shiva and Silvanus-Faunus: Savage and Propitious|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|volume=39|issue=1-2|page=102|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faunus thus means favourable or propitious. 
Another theory claims that Faunus is the Latin outcome of a [[PIE]] *''dhau-no-'' meaning "the strangler" and denotes the wolf. According to D. Briquel ("Le problème des Dauniens" in ''MEFRA'' 1974) it is likely that the ''Luceres'', one of the three tribes of Rome, were [[Dauni]]ans from [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], as well as the characters of the ''Aeneis'' [[Mezentius]], [[Messapus]] and [[Metabus]], who show a Daunian origin. A. Pasqualini agrees on the presence of a Daunian connection in the towns of Latium claiming a Diomedean descent. Moreover, it would seem that there is a sizable presence of Daunians in Latium and Campania (Liternum, Nola). [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] 106 L records a king Lucerus who helped Romulus against [[Titus Tatius]]. Moreover, Oscan epithet Leucesius (present also in the ''Carmen Saliare'') and Lucetius (Servius Aen. IX 570 "a luce") should be interpreted as related to the Luceres. He also lists the Leucaria mother of Romos (Dionysius of Halicarnassus I 72), Jupiter Lucetius, toponyms Leucasia /Leucaria (Pliny III 8 (13) 85; Dion. Hal. I 53) near [[Paestum]], the ethnonym [[Lucanians|Lucani]]. Though Briquel is apparently unaware that the etymology of both "Luceres", Lucera, Leucaria, Lucani and Dauni is from a word meaning ''wolf'' and therefore different from that of Leucesius/ Lucetius, i.e. from IE from *''luq'' (wolf), not from *''leuk'' light: compare also ''[[Hirpini]]'' and ''Dauni''. Daunos according to Walde Hoffmann &lt;ref&gt;LEW third ed. I p. 468, as cited by G. Alessio "Genti e Favelle dell'antica Apulia" In ''Archivio Storico Pugliese'' 1949 p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; is from IE root *''dhau'' to strangle, meaning the strangler, epithet of the wolf: cfr. Greek ''thaunos, thērion'' Hes., Phrygian ''dáos, lykos'' Hes., Latin ''F(f)aunus''. According to Alessio Latins and Umbrians both did not name the wolf because of a religious taboo, thence their use of loanwords such as ''lupus'' in Latin (which is Sabine, instead of the expected *''luquos'') and the Umbrians ''hirpos'' (cfr. Hirpini) originally male goat instead of expected ''*lupos'', whence also ''herpex'' for ''hirpex'' tool in the shape of wolf teeth.

==Consorts and family==
[[File:Pan_goat_MAN_Napoli_Inv27709_n01.jpg|thumb|200px|Faunus copulating with a goat (found in Herculaneum, Italy.)]]

In fable Faunus appears as an old king of Latium, grandson of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]], son of [[Picus]], and father of [[Latinus]] by the nymph [[Marica (mythology)|Marica]] (who was also sometimes Faunus' mother). After his death he is raised to the position of a tutelary deity of the land, for his many services to agriculture and cattle-breeding.

A goddess of like attributes, called '''[[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]]''' and '''Fatua''', was associated in his worship. She was regarded as his daughter, wife, or sister.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peck 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The female deity [[Bona Dea]] was often equated with Fauna.

As Pan was accompanied by the ''Paniskoi'', or little Pans, so the existence of many [[Faun]]i was assumed besides the chief Faunus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Faun]]s are place-spirits (''genii'') of untamed woodland. Educated, Hellenizing Romans connected their fauns with the Greek [[satyr]]s, who were wild and orgiastic drunken followers of [[Dionysus]], with a distinct origin.

==Equivalence with Pan==
With the increasing [[Hellenization]] of literate upper-class Roman culture in the 3rd and 2nd&amp;ndash;centuries BC, the Romans tried to equate their own deities with Greek ones, applying in reverse the Greeks' own ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''. Faunus was naturally equated with the [[Pan (god)|god Pan]], who was a pastoral god of shepherds who was said to reside in [[Arcadia]]. Pan had always been [[horned deity|depicted with horns]] and as such many depictions of Faunus also began to display this trait. However, the two deities were also considered separate by many, for instance, the epic poet [[Virgil]], in his ''[[Aeneid]]'', made mention of both Faunus and Pan independently.

==Festivals==
In [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s epitome, Faunus is identified with ''Lupercus'' ("he who wards off the wolf"), otherwise a priest of Faunus. [[Livy]] named Inuus as the god originally worshiped at the [[Lupercalia]], February 15, when his priests (''Luperci'') wore goat-skins and hit passers-by with goatskin whips.

Two festivals, called '''Faunalia''', were celebrated in his honour—one on February 13, in the temple of Faunus on the [[Tiber Island|island in the Tiber]], the other on 5 December, when the peasants brought him rustic offerings and amused themselves with dancing.&lt;ref name="Peck 1898"/&gt;

A [[euhemerism|euhemeristic]] account made Faunus a [[Latium|Latin]] king, son of [[Picus]] and [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]]. He was then revered as the god [[Fatuus]] after his death, worshipped in a sacred forest outside what is now [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], but had been known since Etruscan times as Tibur, the seat of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]]. His [[Numen|numinous presence]] was recognized by wolf skins, with wreaths and goblets.

In [[Nonnus|Nonnos]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', Faunus/Phaunos accompanied Dionysus when the god campaigned in India.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Later worship==
Faunus was worshipped across the [[Roman Empire]] for many centuries. An example of this was a set of thirty-two 4th-century spoons found near [[Thetford]] in England in 1979. They had been engraved with the name "Faunus", and each had a different epithet after the god's name. The spoons also bore Christian symbols, and it has been suggested that these were initially Christian but later taken and devoted to Faunus by pagans. The 4th century was a time of large scale [[Christianisation]], and the discovery provides evidence that even during the decline of [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], the god Faunus was still worshipped.&lt;ref name="The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles"&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, Ronald]]. ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles''. (1991) Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-17288-2}}. Page 260-261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Thetford Treasure"&gt;Ronald Hutton (1988) Antiquaries Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gaul]], Faunus was identified with the Celtic [[Dusios]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Papias (lexicographer)|Papias]], ''Elementarium'': ''Dusios nominant quos romani Faunos ficarios vocant'', as quoted by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] in his 1678 ''Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis'' (Niort: Favre, 1883–1887), vol. 3, [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/DUSII online]; Katherine Nell MacFarlane, "Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (''Origines'' VIII. 11)," ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 70 (1980), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fisheries Act 1985''' ({{lang-ms|Akta Perikanan 1985}}) is a [[Malaysia]]n federal act relating to the administration and management of [[fisheries]], including the conservation and development of maritime and estuarine fishing and fisheries in Malaysia waters, protection to [[aquatic mammal]]s and [[turtle]]s and riverine fishing in Malaysia and to matters connected to establishment of [[marine park]]s and marine reserves.

The Director-General of Fisheries is the management authority and has absolute powers in making conditions for permits related to fishery resources.

Even though the Director-General has official authority, much of the local fishing industry are under the control of aquaculture gangs, and the act itself has sparked gang violence in many areas regarding the gang's control of fishing "turf".

'''Flooded grasslands and savannas''' is a terrestrial [[biome]] of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] biogeographical system . Its component [[ecoregion]]s are generally located at [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] [[latitude]]s, which are [[flood]]ed seasonally or year-round. A common term is [[Swamps of the Blue Mountains|swamp]].

==Characteristics==
Flooded grasslands and savanna [[habitat]]s, [[plant community|plant communities]], [[ecosystem]]s, [[ecozone]]s, and ecoregions are characterized by: 
*very wet to saturated [[soil]] moisture content in nutrient-rich soils
*in temperate to tropical climates

They are found as [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, and [[wetland]]s.

===Examples===

;Some types and examples include:

* [[Coniferous swamp]]
* [[Dambo]]
* [[Fen]]
* [[Flood-meadow]]
* [[Freshwater swamp forest]]
* [[Mangrove]]s

The '''Furongian ''' is the fourth and final series of the [[Cambrian]]. It lasted from {{Period start|Furongian}} to {{Period start|Ordovician}} million years ago. It succeeds the [[Miaolingian|Miaolingian]] series of the Cambrian and precedes the [[Lower Ordovician]] [[Tremadocian]] stage. It is subdivided into three stages: the [[Paibian]], [[Jiangshanian]] and the unnamed [[Cambrian Stage 10|10th stage of the Cambrian]].&lt;ref name="GSSP Paleozoic"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP Table - Paleozoic Era|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/index.php?parentid=77|publisher=Geologic Timescale Foundation|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
The Furongian was also known as the "Series 4" of the Cambrian and replaced the older term "Upper Cambrian" and equivalent to the local term "Hunanian". The name "Furongian" was ratified by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] in 2003. Furong (芙蓉) means "[[lotus (genus)|lotus]]" in Mandarin and refers to [[Hunan]] which is known as the "lotus state".&lt;ref name="Peng 2004"/&gt;

==Definition==
The lower boundary is defined in the same way as the [[GSSP]] of the [[Paibian]] stage. Both begin with the [[First appearance datum|first appearance]] of the [[trilobite]] ''[[Glyptagnostus reticulatus]]'' around {{Period start|Paibian}} million years ago.&lt;ref name="GSSP for the Paibian"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP for the Paibian|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/paibian.htm|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper boundary is the lower boundary and GSSP of the [[Tremadocian]] stage which is the first appearance of the [[conodont]] ''[[Iapetognathus fluctivagus]]'' around {{Period start|Tremadocian}} million years ago.&lt;ref name="GSSP for the Cambrian - Ordovician Boundary"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP for the Cambrian - Ordovician Boundary|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/camord.htm|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The following table shows the subdivisions of the Furongian series/epoch:&lt;ref name="GSSP Paleozoic" /&gt;

==Biostratigraphy==
The base of two of three stages of the Furongian are defined as the first appearance of a [[trilobite]]. The base of the [[Paibian]] is the first appearance of ''[[Glyptagnostus reticulatus]]'' and the base of the [[Jiangshanian]] is the first appearance of ''[[Agnostotes orientalis]]''.&lt;ref name="Peng 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peng|first=Shanchi|author2=Babcock, Loren|author3= Robison, Richard|author4= Lin, Huanling|author5= Rees, Margaret|author6= Saltzman, Matthew|title=Global Standard Stratotype-section and Point &amp;#x00028;GSSP&amp;#x00029; of the Furongian Series and Paibian Stage &amp;#x00028;Cambrian&amp;#x00029;|journal=Lethaia|date=30 November 2004|volume=37|issue=4|pages=365–379|doi=10.1080/00241160410002081|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/file43.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSSP Jiangshanian"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP for Jiangshanian|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/detail.php?periodid=145&amp;top_parentid=0|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The still unnamed [[Cambrian Stage 10]] might be defined as the first appearance of ''[[Lotagnostus americanus]]'' or the [[conodont]] ''[[Eoconodontus notchpeakensis]]''.&lt;ref name="Landing 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landing|first=E.|author2=Westrop, S.R.|author3=Adrain, J.M.|title=The Lawsonian Stage - the Eoconodontus notchpeakensis FAD and HERB carbon isotope excursion define a globally correlatable terminal Cambrian stage|journal=Bulletin of Geosciences|date=19 September 2011|pages=621–640|doi=10.3140/bull.geosci.1251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2117">Count '''Grigory Kirillovich [[Razumovsky]]''' (November 10, 1759 &amp;ndash; June 3, 1837) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] nobleman, political philosopher, botanist, zoologist and [[geologist]].

==Career==

Razumovsky is known from his writings in the West as Gregor or Grégoire, who lost his Russian citizenship for openly criticizing the czarist system under emperor Alexander I, which he saw as pandering to the desires of a corrupt oligarchy of nobles. Gregor emigrated to western Europe, where was subsequently incorporated into the Bohemian nobility (Inkolat im Herrenstande) in 1811 and accorded the rank of count of the Austrian Empire. As a natural scientist, Gregor was the first to describe and classify [[Palmate Newt|''Lissotrion helveticus'']]. He was the fifth son of the last hetman of Ukraine, [[Kirill Grigorievich Razumovsky]] and brother of prince [[Andreas Razumovsky]], he is also the ancestor of all living members of the family as such, the Russian lines having gone extinct.

In the field of geology, Razumovsky has been described as an "non-actualistic [[Catastrophism|catastrophist]]". He was also an advocate of [[Neptunism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooykaas, R. (1970). [http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00009834.pdf ''Catastrophism in Geology, its scientific character in relation to actualism and uniformitarianism'']. Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Loefenschappen, afd. Letterkunde, Med. (n.r.), 33 (7): 271-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1788, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

He was the author of ''Anecdotes et pensées philosophiques sur la Russie'' (?) and of ''Observations Minéralogiques sur les environs de Vienne'' (1822).

[[File:Göreme town and valley 2015.JPG|thumb|upright=1.75|Göreme town and valley]]
'''Göreme''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈɟøɾeme|pron}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: ''Κόραμα'', '''Kòrama'''), located among the "[[fairy chimney]]" [[rock formation]]s, is a town in [[Cappadocia]], a historical region of [[Turkey]]. It is in the [[Nevşehir Province]] in Central [[Anatolia]] and has a population of around 2,000 people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Commercial Homes in Tourism: An International Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ad9AgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2009-06-02|isbn = 978-1-134-03028-6|language = en|first = Paul|last = Lynch|first2 = Alison J.|last2 = McIntosh|first3 = Hazel|last3 = Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former names of the town have been Korama, Matiana, Maccan or Machan, and Avcilar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Goreme.org – Goreme|url = http://goreme.org/goreme/index.htm|website = goreme.org|accessdate = 2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Göreme Valley nearby was designated an important tourist destination, a "center" for all tourism in Cappadocia, the name of the town was changed to Göreme for practical reasons.

Among Göreme's historically important sites are Ortahane, Durmus Kadir, Yusuf Koc and Bezirhane churches, in addition to the richly decorated [[Tokali Kilise]], the Apple Church, and a number of homes and pigeon houses carved straight into the rock formations in the town.

==History==
The time that the Göreme was first settled is unclear, but it could date back as the [[Hittites|Hittite era]], between 1800 and 1200 B.C. The location was central between rival empires for many centuries, such as the [[Hurri]]-[[Mitanni]], [[Hittite Empire]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] and  the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]] etc, leading the natives to tunnel into the rock to escape the political turmoil. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]], the area became home to [[Christianity|Christians]] retreating from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cappadocia -- World Heritage Site -- National Geographic|url = http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/cappadocia/|accessdate = 2015-08-30|first = National Geographic|last = Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity prevailed as the primary religion in the region, which is evident from many rock churches that can still be seen today.

'''Hawaiian religion''' encompasses the [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religious]] beliefs and practices of the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It is [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and [[animism|animistic]], with a belief in many deities and spirits, including the belief that spirits are found in non-human beings and objects such as animals, the waves, and the sky.

Hawaiian religion originated among the [[Tahiti]]ans and other [[Pacific Islands|Pacific islanders]] who landed in [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] between 500 and 1300 AD.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Bret|title=The Routledge historical atlas of religion in America|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|pages=18–19|isbn=0-415-92131-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Hawaiian religious practices are protected by the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cornell.edu|title=AIRFA act 1978.|work= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1996-|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Hawaiian religion is unrelated to the modern [[New Age]] practice known as "[[Huna (New Age)|Huna]]."&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;Rothstein, Mikael, in Lewis, James R. and Daren Kemp.

==Beliefs==

===Deities===
{{see also|List of figures in the Hawaiian religion}}

[[File:Arago – Iles Sandwich - Vue du Morai du Roi a Kayakakoua.jpg|thumb|230px|Kailua-Kona, Island of Hawaii]] 
Hawaiian religion is [[polytheism|polytheistic]], with four deities most prominent: [[Kāne]], [[Kū]], [[Lono]] and [[Kanaloa]].&lt;ref name="YamamotoGregg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Luci Yamamoto|author2=Amanda C. Gregg|title=Lonely Planet Kauai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTNLx2gHMxIC&amp;pg=PA239|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-136-1|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable deities include [[Laka]], [[Kihawahine]], [[Haumea (mythology)|Haumea]], [[Papahānaumoku]], and, most famously, [[Pele (deity)|Pele]].&lt;ref name="YamamotoGregg2009"/&gt; In addition, each family is considered to have one or more guardian spirits known as [[Aumakua|ʻaumakua]] that protected family.&lt;ref name="YamamotoGregg2009"/&gt;

One breakdown of the Hawaiian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutmanis|first=June|title=Na Pule Kahiko: Ancient Hawaiian Prayers|publisher=Editions Limited|year=1983|pages=4–14|isbn=0-9607938-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the following groups:
* the four gods (''ka hā) – Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa
* the forty male gods or aspects of Kāne (''ke kanahā'')
* the four hundred gods and goddesses (''ka lau'')
* the great multitude of gods and goddesses (''ke kini akua'')
* the spirits (''na {{okina}}unihipili'')
* the guardians (''na {{okina}}aumākua'')

Another breakdown&lt;ref&gt;Kauka, Jay. ''Religious Beliefs and Practices.''&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three major groups:
* the four gods, or ''akua'': Kū, Kāne, Lono, Kanaloa
* many lesser gods, or ''kupua'', each associated with certain professions
* guardian spirits, ''{{okina}}aumakua'', associated with particular families

===Creation===
One Hawaiian [[creation myth]] is embodied in the ''[[Kumulipo]]'', an epic [[chant]] linking the [[Ali'i|''ali{{okina}}i'']], or Hawaiian royalty, to the gods.  The ''Kumulipo'' is divided into two sections: night, or ''pō'', and day, or ''ao'', with the former corresponding to divinity and the latter corresponding to [[Human|mankind]].  After the birth of ''La{{okina}}ila{{okina}}i'', the woman, and ''Ki{{okina}}i'', the man, the man succeeds at seducing and reproducing with the woman before the god ''Kāne'' has a chance, thereby making the divine lineage of the gods younger than and thus subservient to the lineage of man.  This, in turn, illustrates the transition of mankind from being symbols for the gods (the literal meaning of ''ki{{okina}}i'') into the keeper of these symbols in the form of idols and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valeri|first=Valerio|others=Translated by Paula Wissing|title=Kingship and Sacrifice: Ritual and Society in Ancient Hawaii|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=4–8|isbn=0-226-84560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kumulipo was recited during the time of Makahiki, to honor the god of fertility, Lono.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Martha Warren.

===''Kahuna'' and ''Kapu''===
{{main|Kahuna|Kapu}}

The ''kahuna'' were well respected, educated individuals that made up a social hierarchy class that served the King and the Courtiers and assisted the Maka'ainana (Common People). Selected to serve many practical and governmental purposes, ''Kahuna'' often were healers, navigators, builders, prophets/temple workers, and philosophers.

[[File:Kamehamehaii.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Kamehameha II|King Kamehameha II]] ]]
They also talked with the [[spirit]]s. Kahuna Kūpa{{okina}}iulu of Maui in 1867 described a counter-[[Witchcraft|sorcery]] ritual to heal someone ill due to ''ho{{okina}}opi{{okina}}opi{{okina}}o'', another’s evil thoughts.  He said a ''kapa'' (cloth) was shaken.  Prayers were said.  
Then, "If the evil spirit suddenly appears (''puoho'') and [[Demonic possession|possesses]] the patient, then he or she can be immediately saved by the conversation between the practitioner and that spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Must We Wait in Despair|last=Chun|first=Malcolm Naea |author2=ʻAhahui Lāʻau Lapaʻau |publisher=First People's Productions|year=1994|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pukui and others believed kahuna did not have mystical [[transcendentalism|transcendent]] experiences as described in other religions. Although a person who was possessed (''noho'') would go into a [[trance]]-like state, it was not an ecstatic experience but simply a communion with the known spirits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

''Kapu'' refers to a system of [[taboo]]s designed to separate the spiritually pure from the potentially unclean.  Thought to have arrived with Pā{{okina}}ao, a priest or chief from Tahiti who arrived in Hawai{{okina}}i sometime around 1200 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Nana i ke Kumu: Look to the Source, Vol. II, 1972, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; the ''kapu'' imposed a series of restrictions on daily life.  Prohibitions included:
* The separation of men and women during mealtimes (a restriction known as ''{{okina}}aikapu'')
* Restrictions on the gathering and preparation of food
* Women separated from the community during their menses
* Restrictions on looking at, touching, or being in close proximity with chiefs and individuals of known spiritual power
* Restrictions on [[overfishing]]

Hawaiian tradition shows that {{okina}}Aikapu was an idea led by the kahuna in order for Wākea, the sky father, to get alone with his daughter, Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani without his wahine, or wife, Papa, the earth mother, noticing. The spiritually pure or la{{okina}}a, meaning "sacred" and unclean or haumia were to be separated. {{okina}}Aikapu included:
* The use of a different ovens to cook the food of male and female
* Different eating places
* Women were forbidden to eat pig, coconut, banana, and certain red foods because of their male symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Lilikalā Kame{{okina}}eleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires: Pehea Lā E Pono Ai?

Second Edition. (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other Kapus included Mālama {{okina}}Āina, meaning "caring of the land" and Ni{{okina}}aupi{{okina}}o. Tradition says that mālama {{okina}}āina originated from the first child of Wākea and Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani being deformed so they buried him in the ground and what sprouted became the first kalo, also known as taro. The Hawaiian islands are all children of Papa, Wākea and Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani so basically meaning that they are older siblings of the Hawaiian chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Lilikalā Kame{{okina}}eleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires: Pehea Lā E Pono Ai? (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1992.),24&lt;/ref&gt; Second child of Wākea and Ho{{okina}}ohokukalani became the first Ali{{okina}}i Nui, or "Grand Chief". This came to be called Ni{{okina}}aupi{{okina}}o, the chiefly incest to create the "godly child".&lt;ref&gt;Lilikalā Kame{{okina}}eleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires: Pehea Lā E Pono Ai? (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1992.),25&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishments for breaking the ''kapu'' could include death, although if one could escape to a [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park|''pu{{okina}}uhonua'']], a city of refuge, one could be saved.&lt;ref name="hawaiiguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii-guide.info/past.and.present/religion/|title=Got Religion?|publisher=Hawaii-guide.info|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kāhuna nui mandated long periods when the entire village must have absolute silence. No baby could cry, dog howl, or [[rooster]] crow, on pain of death.

Human sacrifice was not unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Valeri, Valerio | title=Kingship and Sacrifice: Ritual and Society in Ancient Hawaii | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1985 | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Kingship_and_Sacrifice.html?id=R6u6YGrzku0C | page=231}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book | author=Akana, Alan Robert | title=The Volcano Is Our Home: Nine Generations of a Hawaiian Family on Kilauea Volcano | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt84AwAAQBAJ | publisher=Balboa Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4525-8753-0 | page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kapu'' system remained in place until 1819 (see below).

===Prayer and ''heiau''===
{{Main|Heiau}}
[[File:Pu'ukohola Heiau temple2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|One side of [[Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site|Pu{{okina}}ukohola Heiau]], a [[heiau|Hawaiian temple]] used as a place of worship and sacrifice.]]
Prayer was an essential part of Hawaiian life, employed when building a house, making a canoe, and giving [[lomilomi massage]].  Hawaiians addressed prayers to various gods depending on the situation.  When healers picked herbs for medicine, they usually prayed to Kū and Hina, male and female, right and left, upright and supine. The people worshiped [[Lono]] during ''Makahiki'' season and [[Kū]] during times of war.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Histories from the 19th century describe prayer throughout the day, with specific prayers associated with mundane activities such as sleeping, eating, drinking, and traveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamakau|first=Samuel Manaiakalani|author2=Mary Kawena Pukui |author3=Dorothy B.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it has been suggested that the activity of prayer differed from the subservient styles of prayer often seen in the Western world:

{{quote|...the usual posture for prayer – sitting upright, head high and eyes open – suggests a relationship marked by respect and self-respect. The gods might be awesome, but the ''{{okina}}aumākua'' bridged the gap between gods and man. The gods possessed great ''[[mana]]''; but man, too, has some ''mana''. None of this may have been true in the time of ''Pā{{okina}}ao'', but otherwise, the Hawaiian did not seem prostrate before his gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nana i ke Kumu: Look to the Source |last=Pukui |first=Mary Kawena |authorlink=Mary Kawena Pukui |author2=E. W. Haertig |author3=Catherine A. Lee  |volume=2 |year=1972 |publisher=Hui Hanai |location=Honolulu |isbn=978-0-9616738-2-6 |pages=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Heiau'', served as focal points for prayer in Hawai{{okina}}i.  Offerings, [[sacrifice]]s, and prayers were offered at these temples, the thousands of ''ko{{okina}}a'' ([[shrine]]s), a multitude of ''wahi pana'' (sacred places), and at small ''kuahu'' (altars) in individual homes.

==History==

===Origins===
{{See also|Ancient Hawaii}}

Although it is unclear when settlers first came to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], there is significant evidence that the islands were settled no later than 800 AD and immigration continued to about 1300 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirch|first=Patrick|author2=Roger Curtis Green|title=Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia: An Essay in Historical Anthropology|year=2001|pages=80|isbn=0-521-78879-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settlers came from the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Easter Island]], and greater [[Polynesia]]. At some point, a significant influx of [[Tahiti]]an settlers landed on the Hawaiian islands, bringing with them their [[Polynesian mythology|religious beliefs]].

Early Hawaiian religion resembled other Polynesian religions in that it was largely focused on natural forces such as the [[tide]]s, the sky, and [[volcano|volcanic activity]] as well as man's dependence on nature for subsistence.  The major early gods reflected these characteristics, as the early Hawaiians worshiped [[Kāne Milohai|Kāne]] (the god of the sky and creation), [[Kū]] (the god of war and male pursuits), [[Lono]] (the god of peace, rain, and fertility) and [[Kanaloa]] (the god of the ocean).

===Early Hawaiian religion===
As an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous culture]], spread among eight islands, with waves of immigration over hundreds of years from various parts of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]], religious practices evolved over time and from place to place in different ways.

Hawaiian scholar [[Mary Kawena Pukui]], who was raised in [[Kaʻū, Hawaii]], maintained that the early Hawaiian gods were benign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nana i ke Kumu: Look to the Source |last=Pukui |first=Mary Kawena |authorlink=Mary Kawena Pukui |author2=E. W. Haertig |author3=Catherine A. Lee  |volume=2 |year=1972 |publisher=Hui Hanai |location=Honolulu |isbn=978-0-9616738-2-6 |pages=122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]] tradition follows this line of thought.  Author and researcher Pali Jae Lee writes: "During these ancient times, the only 'religion' was one of family and oneness with all things. The people were in tune with nature, plants, trees, animals, the ‘āina, and each other. They respected all things and took care of all things. All was ''[[pono]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Pali Jae|title=Hoʻopono|publisher=Lightning Source Inc|year=2007|pages=28|isbn=0-9677253-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the dominant current of Western thought there is a fundamental separation between humanity and divinity. ... In many other cultures, however, such differences between human and divine do not exist.  Some peoples have no concept of a ‘Supreme Being’ or ‘Creator God’ who is by nature ‘other than’ his creation.  They do, however, claim to experience a spirit world in which beings more powerful than they are concerned for them and can be called upon for help." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dudley|first=Michael Kioni|author2=Keoni Kealoha Agard|others=Illustrated by Daniel K San Miguel|title=A Hawaiian Nation: Man, Gods and Nature|publisher=Nā Kāne O Ka Malo Press|year=1990|pages=32|isbn=1-878751-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
"Along with ancestors and gods, spirits are part of the family of Hawaiians. "There are many kinds of spirits that help for good and many that aid in evil.  Some lie and deceive, and some are truthful ... It is a wonderful thing how the spirits (''ʻuhane'') of the dead and the ‘angels’ (''anela'') of the ''ʻaumākua'' can possess living persons.  Nothing is impossible to god-spirits, ''akua''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamakau|first=Samuel Manaiakalani |author2=Mary Kawena Pukui |author3=Dorothy B.

===Contemporary===
[[File:US Navy hula 031112-N-3228G-001.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Hula]] being performed during a ceremony at [[ʻIolani Palace]] where the Navy returned control of [[Kahoolawe|Kahoʻolawe]] to the State of Hawai{{okina}}i.]]
[[Kamehameha the Great]] died in 1819. In the aftermath, two of his wives, [[Kaʻahumanu]] and [[Keōpūolani]], then the two most powerful people in the kingdom, conferred with the ''kahuna nui'', [[Hewahewa]]. They convinced young Liholiho, [[Kamehameha II]], to [['Ai Noa|overthrow]] the ''kapu'' system. They [[Keaoua Kekuaokalani|ordered]] the people to burn the wooden statues and tear down the rock temples.

Without the hierarchical system of religion in place, some abandoned the old gods, and others continued with cultural traditions of worshipping them, especially their family ''ʻaumākua''.

[[Missionary|Missionaries]] arrived in 1820, and most of the ''ali{{okina}}i'' converted to [[Christianity]], including Ka{{okina}}ahumanu and Keōpūolani, but it took 11 years for Ka{{okina}}ahumanu to proclaim laws against ancient religious practices. "Worshipping of idols such as sticks, stones, sharks, dead bones, ancient gods and all untrue gods is prohibited. There is one God alone, Jehovah. He is the God to worship. The hula is forbidden, the chant (olioli), the song of pleasure (mele), foul speech, and bathing by women in public places. The planting of [[kava|ʻawa]] is prohibited. Neither chiefs nor commoners are to drink ʻawa." (Kamakau, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;298-301)

[[File:Heiau-Ulupo-altar.JPG|thumb|right|Offerings presented by Hawai{{okina}}ian religious practitioners at [[Ulupo Heiau]], 2009]]
Although traditional Hawaiian religion was outlawed, a number of traditions typically associated with it survived by integration, practicing in hiding, or practicing in rural communities in the islands. Surviving traditions include the worship of family ancestral gods or ''{{okina}}aumākua'', veneration of ''iwi'' or bones, and preservation of sacred places or ''wahi pana''. [[Hula]] was outlawed at one time as a religious practice but today is performed in both spiritual and secular contexts.

Traditional beliefs have also played a role in the [[politics]] of post-Contact Hawai{{okina}}i. In the 1970s the Hawaiian religion experienced a resurgence during the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]]. In 1976, the members of a group "Protect ''Kaho{{okina}}olawe {{okina}}Ohana''" filed suit in federal court over the use of [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]] by the [[United States Navy]] for [[target practice]]. Charging that the practice disturbed important cultural and religious sites ''Aluli et al. v. Brown'' forced the Navy to survey and protect important sites, perform conservation activities, and allow limited access to the island for religious purposes.&lt;ref name="pko"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kahoolawe.org/home/?page_id=6|title=Protect Kahoʻolawe ʻOhana &gt;&gt; History|publisher=Protect Kahoʻolawe ʻOhana|accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, outrage over the unearthing of 1,000 graves dating back to 850 AD during the construction of a [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel on [[Maui]] in 1988 resulted in the redesign and relocation of the hotel inland as well as the appointment of the site as a state historic place.&lt;ref name="highbeam"&gt;{{Closed access}}{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7443624.html|title=Booming development in Hawaii disturbs the dead|last=Song|first=Jaymes|date=2007-05-27|publisher=[[Oakland Tribune]] |location=Oakland, CA, USA|accessdate=2012-06-30}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the surviving traditions, some Hawaiians practice [[Syncretism|Christianized versions]] of old traditions.  Others practice it as a [[Religious pluralism|co-religion]].

In the 1930s, non-[[Native Hawaiian|Hawaiian]] author [[Max Freedom Long]] created a philosophy and practice he called "[[Huna (New Age)|Huna]]."&lt;ref name=Long&gt;[[Max Freedom Long|Long, Max Freedom]] (2009) [1954].

"Hawaiians, rather than feeling a kind of fusion with a deity, were more apt to receive messages. Veiled in mysticism, transported via dream or sign or vision, conveyed in allegory though they might be, the message was very often practical advice from those approachable, interested gods, the ‘aumākua."&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Vol II, 1972, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiians of old always made decisions with guidance from the spirits and gods. Kamakau wrote, "The foundation of the knowledge and skill of the kahuna lapa‘au [medical priest] was the god.  It was he who knew without error the treatment; it was he who pointed out the nature of the ailment and the things pertaining to this or that disease of man."&lt;ref&gt;Kamakau, 1991a, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

John Papa ‘I‘i noted, "The medical kahunas whom we described did thus:  The matter was presented to the gods in the evening, and the next day the method of treatment was studied.  If the case was a good one, the god was consulted to find out whether the treatment would be successful."&lt;ref&gt;‘I‘i, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

"For the worshipers of the gods of old Hawaii who see manifestations of the gods wherever they look, prayer may be as frequent as conversations between two close friends.  Overwhelming in number, the gods are not kept at a distance by their perfection, but are direct ancestors of the chiefs who in turn are the progenitors of the maka‘āinana, or common people.  The power of the gods comes from generations of accumulated mana. ...

"the gods of Hawaii are approached with just requests for help as members of the family.  They may be ordered, bargained with, or threatened.  If a particular god does not produce the desired results, the dissatisfied supplicant can denounce the failure, scold the unresponsive god, and seek help elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Gutmanis, 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

"The haka [medium] was chosen by the spirit, or spirits, to serve as "speaking mouth."  The spirit, be it ‘uhane, ‘aumakua, or akua, was, in family seances, always one to whose lineage the haka belonged:  that is to say, the spirit was a relative.  It is said that in the old days there was no lineage, or ‘ohana, which did not have someone who served as a channel of communication."&lt;ref&gt;Handy, 1998, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hemiboreal''' means halfway between the temperate and subarctic (or [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]]) zones. The term is most frequently used in the context of [[ecosystem]]s.

==Botany==
A hemiboreal forest has some characteristics of a boreal forest, and also shares features with temperate-zone forests to the south.  [[Coniferous]] trees predominate in the hemiboreal zone, but a significant number of [[deciduous]] species, such as [[aspen]]s, [[oak]]s, [[maple]]s, [[ash tree]]s, [[birch]]es, [[beech]]es, [[hazel]]s, and [[hornbeam]]s, also occur.

==Climate==
The term sometimes denotes the form of [[climate]] characteristic of the zone of hemiboreal forests&amp;mdash;specifically, the climates designated ''Dfb'', ''Dwb'' and ''Dsb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]] scheme.  On occasion, it is applied to all areas that have long, cold winters and warm (but not hot) summers&amp;mdash;including areas that are [[semiarid]] and [[arid]] based on average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].

==Examples==
Examples of locations with hemiboreal climates or ecosystems include: 
*Much of southern [[Canada]] (all of southeastern Canada except for parts of southern Ontario as well as the central Prairie Provinces outside the grasslands)
*Within the [[United States]]: most parts of  [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Minnesota]], along with eastern [[North Dakota]]
*The [[Southern Siberian rainforest]] in Russia includes hemiboreal forests.&lt;ref&gt;Chytry, Milan, et al. "Diversity of Forest Vegetation Across a Strong Gradient of Climatic Continentality: Western Sayan Mountains, South Siberia." Plant Ecology (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Eld''' (June 2, 1814—March 12, 1850) was a United States Navy officer, geographer, and Antarctic explorer.

==Biography==
Eld was born in [[Cedar Hill (New Haven)|Cedar Hill]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], on June 2, 1814,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.lib.uconn.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fcho&amp;CISOPTR=16457&amp;DMSCALE=100.00000&amp;DMWIDTH=750&amp;DMHEIGHT=807.121771218&amp;DMMODE=viewer&amp;DMFULL=0&amp;DMOLDSCALE=2.05733&amp;DMX=0&amp;DMY=0&amp;DMTEXT=%2520new%2520haven%2520map&amp;DMTHUMB=1&amp;REC=9&amp;DMROTATE=0&amp;x=104&amp;y=43 Map of where Henry Eld's house was in Cedar Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; and lived in the area now known as View Street, but when it started becoming more populated he removed his house and relocated.

[[Image:Msc-he1.jpg|thumb|right|''Encampment After the "Peacock's" Wreck, at Mouth of Columbia, 1841'' by Lieut. Eld]]
Eld served as a [[geographer]] on the ship ''Peacock'', on the ship ''Vincennes'' at [[Fiji]], and joined [[George F. Emmons|Lieutenant George Emmons's]] overland journey through [[Oregon]] and California (while in California he was involved in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]]). He produced 43 maps and 42 pencil sketches of the land between the Columbia River and the Sacramento Valley.

Passed Midshipman Eld was one of the officers of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under Capt. [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1838 and 1842 in search of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]], which Eld first descried and called out land from the crosstree of the sloop ''Peacock'' on January 16, 1840. From this the United States dates the first discovery of the Antarctic continent, and Capt. Wilkes named the highest mountain peak [[Eld Peak]] (which is part of what was later named the [[Lazarev Mountains, Antarctica|Lazarev Mountains]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnew00newha#page/14/mode/2up/search/henry+eld Collections of the New Haven Colony Historical Society], New Haven, Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt; They proved that the Antarctic was a continent (Eld was the first to see the Antarctic mountains at a crucial stage of their survey of the ice fields).  On January 10, 1840 Eld was part of a two-man landing party to investigate [[Macquarie Island]], one of the first men to do so.  Splitting with his quarter-master, he explored a [[penguin]] rookery alone, and was surprised by resistance the birds gave him.&lt;ref name="WIL1845"&gt;Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition”, Wilkes, Charles, vol 2, p.288-9. 1845&lt;/ref&gt; Eld kept journals and sketch books of the [[Wilkes Expedition]], accompanied by letters, reports and orders, documenting his personal and professional life.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Eld, ''Journal, Statistics, &amp;c., in Oregon and California'', MSS, in [[Yale University Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Specimens where collected during the expedition - fifty thousand plants, and over 7 thousand mineral specimens, 3 thousand insects, innumerable shells, fish, reptiles, mammals, and hundreds of tribal artifacts- all these became scientific treasure.

Also, [[Eld Inlet]] of [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington state]] was named after Eld by Capt. Wilkes during the United States Exploring Expedition, to honor him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3 |pages= 19, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.co.thurston.wa.us/permitting/historic/docs/Place-Names.pdf | title=Thurston County Place Names: A Heritage Guide | publisher=Thurston County Historical Commission | date=1992 | accessdate=28 March 2018 | pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Eld died at sea on board U. S. ship of war ''Ohio'' on March 12, 1850, bound home from [[Rio de Janeiro]] after a three and a half years' cruise.

==Tributes==
A Sailor's Poem written in memory of Henry Eld's passing in 1854:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/oceanmelodiessea54stow#page/162/mode/2up/search/eld ''Ocean melodies, and seamen's companion: a collection of hymns and music: for the use of Bethels, chaplains of the Navy, and private devotion of mariners''] (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

"...''thrice had weary sickness laid him low''&lt;br /&gt;
''Upon the troubled couch of feverish pain —''&lt;br /&gt;
''And days and nights of anguish measured slow''&lt;br /&gt;
''Their length upon the prostrate sufferer's chain;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Yet oft bright visions to his heart would come''..."

'''Hexagonite''' is the red to pink, lilac to purple ''[[manganese|manganoan]]'' variety of [[tremolite]].  A rare [[amphibole]], it can be [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], [[translucent]], and rarely [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]].

==Properties==
Hexagonite is [[pleochroic]], potentially displaying varying shades of blue, violet, purple, or red.&lt;ref name="info"/&gt; It is also known as "''mangan-tremolite''", since the [[manganese]] imparts the mineral's unique colors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Pink, lilac, and purple are the most common colors.&lt;ref name="info"&gt;[http://www.gemdat.org/gem-11106.html ''Hexagonite Gemstone Information'']; Gem Data website; accessed August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Hexagonite has been successfully faceted.&lt;ref name="info"/&gt;

==Chemical formulae and history==
Tremolite was discovered in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-4011.html Tremolite on Mindat.org ]&lt;/ref&gt; Hexagonite, a varietal form of tremolite, has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.0-6.0.&lt;ref name=Mindat2/&gt;  Like tremolite, it is a [[calcium]] [[magnesium]] [[silicate]] [[hydroxide]] with the formula: [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Magnesium|Mg]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Silicon|Si]]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[[O]]&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;) ([[Hydroxyl|OH]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mindat2&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-11106.html Hexagonite on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mineral was given the name, ''hexagonite,'' because its [[crystal structure]] was believed at one time to be [[hexagonal]].  Since then, however, it has been found to be [[monoclinic]].&lt;ref name=Mindat2/&gt;

==Occurrence==
The mineral is found primarily in the Balmat-Edwards zinc district of [[Edwards, New York|Edwards]], [[St. Lawrence County, New York]], United States.&lt;ref name="Balmat"&gt;[http://fredmhaynes.com/2015/07/27/balmat-hexagonite/ ''Balmat Hexagonite'']; article; July 27, 2015; Fred Haynes blog; "WCGMC Activity;" accessed Aug 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found in the Czech Republic in the Chýnov caves.&lt;ref&gt;Litochleb J, Sejkora J (2007) Occurrence of tremolite-hexagonite in dolomite marbles in the Chýnov cave (southern Bohemia). Minerál 15: 124-126 (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13573">The '''Joint War Organisation''' (JWO) is a combined operation of the [[British Red Cross Society]] and the [[Order of St John of Jerusalem]] and was controlled by the non-government Joint War Committee (JWC). The Joint War Finance Committee was created to raise donations and funding.

==World War I==

In August 1914, just after the outbreak of war in Europe, the British Red Cross and the Order of St John proposed to form the Joint War Committee with the intention of working with joint aims, reducing duplication of effort and providing St John personnel with the protection of the Red Cross.&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt; An agreement to the merger was concluded on 24 October 1914.&lt;ref name=WSTMS/&gt; The [[St Andrew's Ambulance Association]] in Scotland also joined the organisation.

Fundraising activities and resources were pooled and everyone worked together under the protective emblem of the Red Cross. The JWO became the main contact with the Royal Army Medical Services as regards patient services when casualties swamped the Army medical capability.&lt;ref name=WSTMS/&gt;

The Joint War Committee organised volunteers alongside technical and professional staff. It also supplied the machinery and mechanisms to provide services in Britain and in the conflict areas of Europe, the Middle East, Russia and East Africa. In the UK, each region created their local JWO with a chairman and committee.

=== Voluntary Aid Detachments ===
{{main|Voluntary Aid Detachment}}

Five years earlier in 1909, a scheme had been devised to organise volunteers into Voluntary Aid Detachments (VAD).&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;{{rp|2}} The idea was to provide supplementary aid for the Territorial Medical Services.&lt;ref name="WSTMS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0729247314Z.00000000050 |title=Neutral Caregivers or Military Support? The British Red Cross, the Friends' Ambulance Unit, and the Problems of Voluntary Medical Aid in Wartime |publisher=War Society |volume =34 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the British Red Cross and the Order of St John were organised into VAD's. Each VAD had either male or female VAD's.&lt;ref name="RCVol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/Who%20we%20are/History%20and%20archives/Volunteering%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War.pdf |title=Volunteering during the First World War |publisher=British Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914 there were 2,000 VAD's with 70,000 volunteers,
Within four years this had grown to 4,000 VAD's and 125,000 volunteers.&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;

Volunteers were trained in a number of skills, with classes and examinations arranged by a local VAD.&lt;ref name=RCVol/&gt;

VAD nurses were introduced into [[RAMC]] hospitals in England and France. VAD's also replaced males in hospitals so they could be sent to the field. VAD's worked overseas in transport and hospitals.&lt;ref name=RCVol/&gt;

Auxiliary hospitals were established in suitable buildings where VAD's could serve including part-time VAD's, looking after recuperating patients. By the end of the war there were 1,786 such hospitals. Many were called '''V.A.D. Hospitals'''.&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;{{rp|7}}

[[Katharine Furse]] was head of the VAD from 1915 to 1917, being made a Dame when awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|G.B.E.]] for her services in 1917.

The Red Cross war medal was awarded to members of the Red Cross or its VAD volunteers who served in the UK between 4 August 1914 and 31 December 1919 and had served over 1,000 hours. 41,000 members received the medal.

Over 1,400 received military commendations or awards for bravery and over 250 died during the war such as Edith Munro a nurse who died in East London in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/remembering-first-world-war-nurse-edith-munro|title=First World War nurse Edith Munro has been recognised for her bravery at a special commemoration service in East London. |publisher=RCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing and provisions and their distribution===

"Working parties" operated in most towns to collect clothing, make bandages, splints etc. A series of "'Central Work Rooms"' were created in 1915 to organise these working parties and standardise the items being created which were gathered at "Work Depots".&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;{{rp|5}}

===Other activities===
Other activities of VAD's included:
{{col-start}}
{{col-2}}
* Rest stations at railway stations
* Fundraising – over £21 million was raised&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* Missing and wounded service&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* Air raid duty&lt;ref name=RCVol/&gt;{{rp|7}}
{{col-2}}
* Libraries&lt;ref name=RCJWC/&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Transport of patients&lt;ref name=RCVol/&gt;{{rp|8}}
* Providing grants such as to [[Hammersmith hospital]] to help rehabilitation 
{{col-end}}

To promote [[flag day]] events, the red cross had Canadian women living in London selling tinted maple leaves. Australian sellers sold special Australian flags and leather kangaroos. Women from New Zealand sold kiwi badges.

Red Cross collecting boxes moved from National to Regional VAD control, with local VAD's keeping 20% of the funds collected, 80% going for National use.&lt;ref name="RCJWC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/Who%20we%20are/History%20and%20archives/Fundraising%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War.pdf |title=General overview of Joint War Committee activities during the First World War |publisher=British Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally [[PoW]]'s would receive food packages from governments, however this was soon blocked and with other charitable organisations, the JWO under the banner of the [[International Red Cross]] stepped in to send a parcel every two weeks to each prisoner. The total cost of parcels in World War 1 was £5,145,458-16s-9d.

===The British Prisoner of War===

The Central Prisoner of War Committee of the Red Cross and Order of St John published a monthly journal, ''The British Prisoner of War'' beginning in January 1918, for the benefit of the families and friends of British and Commonwealth prisoners of war.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/steuer/steuer.ch08f.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JWO was disbanded after World War 1, in 1919.

===Personnel===

[[Mary Harmsworth, Viscountess Northcliffe]] member of the Joint Committee, received a GBE in the [[1918 New Year Honours]], as did Robert Arundell Hudson, Treasurer and Financial Director of the Joint Committee.

[[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom]], a member of the Council of the [[British Red Cross Society]] and of the Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross Society and the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of Saint John]] in England, was awarded a GBE in the [[1918 Birthday Honours]], as were [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth]] Sub-Prior of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in England; Member of the Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John of Jerusalem in England and William Edmund Garstin member of the Council of the British Red Cross Society and of the Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John of Jerusalem in England; Member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment Advisory Committee and of the Voluntary Aid Detachment Selection Board.

Adeline Marie, Duchess of Bedford, Member of Joint War Committee received a GBE in the [[1919 New Year Honours]]

In the [[1922 New Year Honours]] the Right Honourable Evelyn Cecil, MP, Secretary-General of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in England, 1915–21, Vice-Chairman Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St John of Jerusalem received a GBE.

During the First World War relief services for affected soldiers in India was provided by a branch of the JWC. On 3 March 1920 a bill was introduced to the Indian Legislative Council by Sir Claude Hill (a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council who was also Chairman of the Joint War Committee in India) to constitute the [[Indian Red Cross Society]], independent of the British Red Cross.

==World War II==

Reactivated after the declaration of war in 1939, the British Red Cross and St John reformed the Joint War Organisation, which again afforded the St John volunteers protection under the Red Cross emblem.

The system developed in World War I was adopted again with the organisation working in hospitals, care homes, nurseries, ambulance units, rest stations and elsewhere with much of the funding coming from the [[Duke of Gloucester]]'s Red Cross and St John appeal, which raised over £54&amp;nbsp;million by 1946.

Communications between the British government [[War Office]] and the ICRC did not always go through the JWC, causing possible risks to the ICRC as an independent party.&lt;ref name="WNBwd"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wylie |first=Neville |title=Barbed Wire Diplomacy: Britain, Germany, and the Politics of Prisoners of War 1939-1945 |publisher=OUP Oxford |date=2010 |ISBN=978-0199547593}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}

===Parcels===
[[File:Red Cross Parcel.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''British Red Cross &amp; Order of St John War Organisation'' food parcel]]

The JWO was made the lead organization for POW parcels, issued as a ''British Red Cross &amp; Order of St John War Organisation'' parcels but colloquially known as [[Red Cross parcel]]s which were organized for prisoners of war,&lt;ref name=WNBwd/&gt;{{rp|103}} now operating under the provisions of the third Geneva convention of 1929, which laid out strict rules for the treatment of PoWs. The JWO sent standard food parcels, invalid food parcels, medical supplies, educational books and recreational materials worldwide. During this conflict, over 20 million standard food parcels were sent out using the [[International Red Cross]] distribution system.

With the bulk of Europe occupied by Axis forces early in the war, finding a route to deliver parcels was a problem, for which the JWO and the War Office received criticism until it was solved in spring 1941 when [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) ships received permission to transport parcels from Lisbon to the South of France, for onward transport to [[Geneva]] and subsequent distribution to POW's.&lt;ref name=WNBwd/&gt;{{rp|104}}

The only part of the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|British Isles occupied by Germany]], the [[Channel Islands]], were helped in the winter of 1944/5 and avoided starvation with [[Red Cross parcel|food parcels]], flour, grain and coal brought by the ICRC ship [[SS Vega (1913)|SS Vega]] to the local JWO's who had operated throughout the war in occupied [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]].

===Personnel===
Sir [[Arthur Stanley (politician)|Arthur Stanley]] had been Chairman of the Joint War Committee in 1939.

===Post War===
The work of the JWO continued after 1945 with work concentrated on helping the wounded, returning soldiers and displaced persons.

Following the liberation of Europe in 1945, [[Doris Zinkeisen]]  was commissioned by the War Artists Advisory Committee as a war artist for the North West Europe Commission of the JWO.

The JWC and JWO were disbanded in 1947. The JWC records for 1939-47 have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/user/54/u2560654.shtml |title=Museum and Archives |publisher=BBC |date=22 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lacus Aestatis''' ([[Latin]] for "Summer Lake") consists of two relatively small areas of [[lunar mare]] located near the western limb of the [[Moon]]. The selenographic [[coordinate]]s of this feature are 15.0° S, 69.0° W, and it lies within a diameter of 90&amp;nbsp;km. The lake has a combined surface area in the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The northwestern part of this feature is located to the east-southeast of the crater [[Rocca (crater)|Rocca]], and is contained within the rim of the satellite crater Rocca&amp;nbsp;A. The other part lies to the southeast of the first, and forms an elongated, irregular patch that extends generally in a north-south direction. The southern tip lies about one crater diameter to the northwest of the flooded crater [[Crüger (crater)|Crüger]].

'''Lacustrine deposits''' are sedimentary rock formations which formed in the bottom of [[ancient lake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prothero|title=sedimentary geology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common characteristic of lacustrine deposits is that a river or stream channel has carried sediment into the basin.  Lacustrine deposits form in all lake types including rift [[graben]] lakes, [[oxbow lake]]s, glacial lakes, and [[crater lake]]s.  Lacustrine environments, like seas, are large bodies of water.  They share similar sedimentary deposits which are mainly composed of low-energy particle sizes.  Lacustrine deposits are typically very well sorted with highly laminated beds of silts, clays, and occasionally carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/205/B04.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In regards to geologic time, lakes are temporary and once they no longer receive water, they dry up and leave a formation.

==Lake types==

Lacustrine deposits can form in every variety of basins found in nature.  How each basin originates is where the distinction between lacustrine deposit types stem.  Rift graben lakes are formed from crustal stretching also known as rifting.  Sediment influx is typically dominated by precipitation runoff and discharge through channels migrating towards the depression.  [[Oxbow lakes]] form lacustrine deposits from seasonal overbank flooding as well as precipitation runoff which refills these isolated basins with fresh water and new sediments.  [[Glacial lakes]] form when terminal moraines block water from escaping the newly carved valley from glacial erosion.  As the glacier melts, the valley fills with melt water that creates a glacial lake.  Crater lakes can be meteoritic or of the caldera variety.  Crater lakes sediments are provided from precipitation runoff descending their steep slopes.

==Resource value==

Lacustrine deposits have gained more attention recently due to containing valuable source rocks of oil, coal, and uranium.  Lacustrine deposits generally provide productive mining conditions but can prove challenging when underground mines are attempted due to the poor shear strength of clays and silts as well as the amount of moisture often locked in the layers due to a low permeability characteristic of lacustrine deposits.  Ephemeral lakes have recently been found to be especially valuable due to their seasonal wetting and drying out characteristic. Between the wet and the dry seasons, there is a time period when organic matter has the perfect opportunity to generate, only to be submerged by the influx of water during the wet season.  This action creates a prime combination of organic matter, silts and clays to create oil shales or coal deposits.

'''Limnology''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|m|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} {{respell|lim|NOL|ə-jee}}; from Greek λίμνη, ''limne'', "lake" and λόγος, ''logos'', "knowledge"), is the study of inland [[aquatic ecosystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=JIw76nEh0aoC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=limnology%20definition&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=limnology%20definition&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Limnology|last=Kumar|first=Arvind|date=2005|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176489195|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limnology is closely related to [[aquatic ecology]] and [[hydrobiology]], which study aquatic organisms and their interactions with the abiotic (non-living) environment. While limnology has substantial overlap with freshwater-focused disciplines (e.g., [[freshwater biology]]), it also includes the study of inland salt lakes.

==History==
The term limnology was coined by [[François-Alphonse Forel]] (1841–1912) who established the field with his studies of [[Lake Geneva]]. Interest in the discipline rapidly expanded, and in 1922 [[August Thienemann]] (a German zoologist) and [[Einar Naumann]] (a Swedish botanist) co-founded the [[International Society of Limnology]] (SIL, from [[Societas Internationalis Limnologiae]]).  Forel's original definition of limnology, "the [[oceanography]] of lakes", was expanded to encompass the study of all inland waters,&lt;ref name="Wetzel"/&gt; and influenced [[Benedykt Dybowski]]'s work on [[Lake Baikal]].

Prominent early American limnologists included [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Ed Deevey]], [[Edward Ashael Birge|E. A. Birge]], and [[Chancey Juday|C. Juday]].&lt;ref&gt;Frey, D.G. (ed.), 1963. Limnology in North America. University of Wisconsin Press, Madison&lt;/ref&gt;

==General limnology==

===Physical properties===
Physical properties of aquatic ecosystems are determined by a combination of heat, currents, waves and other seasonal distributions of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="limnology book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander J|last2=Goldman|first2=Charles R|title=Limnology|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=0-07-023673-9|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Morphometrics|morphometry]] of a body of water depends on the type of feature (such as a lake, river, stream, wetland, estuary etc.) and the structure of the earth surrounding the body of water. [[Lake#Limnology|Lakes]], for instance, are classified by their formation, and zones of lakes are defined by water depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welch|first1=P.S.|title=Limnology (Zoological Science Publications)|date=1935|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=0-07-069179-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[River]] and [[stream]] system morphometry is driven by underlying geology of the area as well as the general velocity of the water.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; Another type of aquatic system which falls within the study of limnology is estuaries. [[Estuary|Estuaries]] are bodies of water classified by the interaction of a river and the ocean or sea.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; [[Wetland]]s vary in size, shape, and pattern however the most common types, marshes, bogs and swamps, often fluctuate between containing shallow, freshwater and being dry depending on the time of year.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt;

====Light interactions====
Light zonation is the concept of how the amount of sunlight penetration into water influences the structure of a body of water.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; These zones define various levels of productivity within an aquatic ecosystems such as a lake. For instance, the depth of the water column which sunlight is able to penetrate and where most plant life is able to grow is known as the [[Photic zone|photic or euphotic]] zone. The rest of the water column which is deeper and does not receive sufficient amounts of sunlight for plant growth is known as the aphotic zone.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt;

====Thermal stratification====
Similar to light zonation, thermal stratification or thermal zonation is a way of grouping parts of the water body within an aquatic system based on the temperature of different lake layers. The less [[Turbidity|turbid]] the water, the more light is able to penetrate, and thus heat is conveyed deeper in the water.&lt;ref name="water quality book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Water Quality: An Introduction|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-17445-7|edition=Second|location=Switzerland|last1=Boyd|first1=Claude E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heating declines exponentially with depth in the water column, so the water will be warmest near the surface but progressively cooler as moving downwards. There are three main sections that define thermal stratification in a lake. The [[epilimnion]] is closest to the water surface and absorbs long- and shortwave radiation to warm the water surface. During cooler months, wind shear can contribute to cooling of the water surface. The [[thermocline]] is an area within the water column where water temperatures rapidly decrease.&lt;ref name="water quality book" /&gt; The bottom layer is the [[hypolimnion]], which tends to have the coldest water because its depth restricts sunlight from reaching it.&lt;ref name="water quality book" /&gt;  In temperate lakes, fall-season cooling of surface water results in turnover of the water column, where the thermocline is disrupted, and the lake temperature profile becomes more uniform.

===Chemical properties===
The chemical composition of water in aquatic ecosystems is influenced by natural characteristics and processes including precipitation, underlying soil and bedrock in the watershed, erosion, evaporation, and sedimentation.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; All bodies of water have a certain composition of both organic and inorganic elements and compounds. Biological reactions also affect the chemical properties of water. In addition to natural processes, human activities strongly influence the chemical composition of aquatic systems and their water quality.&lt;ref name="water quality book" /&gt;

=====Oxygen and carbon dioxide=====
Dissolved oxygen and dissolved carbon dioxide are often discussed together due their coupled role in respiration and photosynthesis. Dissolved oxygen concentrations can be altered by physical, chemical, and biological processes and reaction. Physical processes including wind mixing can increase dissolved oxygen concentrations, particularly in surface waters of aquatic ecosystems. Because dissolved oxygen solubility is linked to water temperatures, changes in temperature affect dissolved oxygen concentrations; warmer water has a lower capacity to "hold" oxygen as colder water&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/784140625|title=Freshwater ecology : concepts and environmental applications of limnology|last=1958-|first=Dodds, Walter K. (Walter Kennedy),|date=2010|publisher=Academic Press|others=Whiles, Matt R.|isbn=9780123747242|edition=2nd ed|location=Burlington, MA|oclc=784140625}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Biologically, both photosynthesis and aerobic respiration affect dissolved oxygen concentrations.&lt;ref name="water quality book"/&gt; Photosynthesis by autotrophic organisms, such as phytoplankton and aquatic algae, increases dissolved oxygen concentrations while simultaneously reducing carbon dioxide concentrations, since carbon dioxide is taken up during photosynthesis&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. All aerobic organisms in the aquatic environment take up dissolved oxygen during aerobic respiration, while carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct of this reaction. Because photosynthesis is light-limited, both photosynthesis and respiration occur during the daylight hours, while only respiration occurs during dark hours or in dark portions of an ecosystem. The balance between dissolved oxygen production and consumption is calculated as the aquatic metabolism rate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Jonathan J.|last2=Cole|first2=Jonathan J.|last3=Caraco|first3=Nina F.|last4=Caraco|first4=Nina F.|date=2001|title=Carbon in catchments: connecting terrestrial carbon losses with aquatic metabolism|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF00084|journal=Marine and Freshwater Research|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=101–110|doi=10.1071/mf00084|issn=1448-6059}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Vertical changes in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen are affected by both wind mixing of surface waters and the balance between photosynthesis and respiration of organic matter. These vertical changes, known as profiles, are based on similar principles as thermal stratification and light penetration. As light availability decreases deeper in the water column, photosynthesis rates also decrease, and less dissolved oxygen is produced. This means that dissolved oxygen concentrations generally decrease as you move deeper into the body of water because of photosynthesis is not replenishing dissolved oxygen that is being taken up through respiration.&lt;ref name="water quality book" /&gt; During periods of thermal stratification, water density gradients prevent oxygen-rich surface waters from mixing with deeper waters. Prolonged periods of stratification can result in the depletion of bottom-water dissolved oxygen; when dissolved oxygen concentrations are below 2 milligrams per liter, waters are considered hypoxic&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. When dissolved oxygen concentrations are approximately 0 milligrams per liter, conditions are anoxic. Both hypoxic and anoxic waters reduce available habitat for organisms that respire oxygen, and contribute to changes in other chemical reactions in the water&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=====Nitrogen and phosphorus=====
Nitrogen and phosphorus are ecologically significant nutrients in aquatic systems. Nitrogen is generally present as a gas in aquatic ecosystems however most water quality studies tend to focus on nitrate, nitrite and ammonia levels.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; Most of these dissolved nitrogen compounds follow a seasonal pattern with greater concentrations in the fall and winter months compared to the spring and summer.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; Phosphorus has a different role in aquatic ecosystems as it is a limiting factor in the growth of phytoplankton because of generally low concentrations in the water.&lt;ref name="limnology book"/&gt; Dissolved phosphorus is also crucial to all living things, is often very limiting to primary productivity in freshwater, and has its own distinctive ecosystem [[Phosphorus cycle|cycling]].&lt;ref name="water quality book"/&gt;

===Biological properties===

====Lake trophic classification====
[[File:Lake George from village beach.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, an [[oligotrophic lake]]]]
Limnology classifies lakes (or other bodies of water) according to the [[trophic state index]].&lt;ref name="Wetzel"/&gt; An oligotrophic lake is characterised by relatively low levels of [[primary production]] and low levels of nutrients. A eutrophic lake has high levels of primary productivity due to very high nutrient levels. [[Eutrophication]] of a lake can lead to [[algal blooms]]. Dystrophic lakes have high levels of [[humic matter]] and typically have yellow-brown, tea-coloured waters.&lt;ref name="Wetzel"/&gt;  These categories do not have rigid specifications; the classification system can be seen as more of a spectrum encompassing the various levels of aquatic productivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9933">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Rhode Island''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of November 29, 2010, there were 12 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  One site has been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

The '''Metallicity distribution function''' is an important concept in [[stellar evolution|stellar]] and [[galactic evolution]]. It is a curve of what proportion of stars have a particular [[metallicity]] ([Fe/H], the relative abundance of iron and hydrogen) of a population of stars such as in a cluster or galaxy.

'''Mohammed Yusuf''' (29 January 1970 – 30 July 2009), also known as '''Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf''', was a [[Nigeria]]n [[Muslim]] sect leader and founder of the militant [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Boko Haram]] in 2002. He was its spiritual leader until he was killed in the [[2009 Boko Haram Uprising|2009 Boko Haram uprising]].&lt;ref name="ADL"&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120109052545/http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/boko_haram.htm?Multi_page_sections%3DsHeading_2 Boko Haram: The Emerging Jihadist Threat in West Africa – Background], Anti-Defamation League, December 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's official name is ''Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad,'' which in Arabic means "People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13809501 | work=BBC News | title=Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamists? | date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Girgir village, in Jakusko, present-day [[Yobe State]], [[Nigeria]], Yusuf received a local education.&lt;ref&gt;"West African Militancy and Violence", page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Later he studied more of Islam and became a [[Salafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Christianity, Islam, and Liberal Democracy: Lessons from Sub-Saharan Africa|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v7C6BwAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 2015-07-01|isbn = 9780190225216|language = en|first = Robert A.|last = Dowd|page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and beliefs==

According to scholar Paul Lubeck of the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]], as a young man Yusuf was instructed in [[Salafism]] and was strongly influenced by the teachings of [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;ref name="cfrBackgrounder"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739 | title=Backgrounder – Boko Haram | publisher=Council of Foreign Relations | work=www.cfr.org | date=2011-12-27 | accessdate=March 12, 2012 | author=Johnson, Toni}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the equivalent of a graduate education, according to Nigerian academic Hussain Zakaria. Yusuf was reported as speaking proficient English.&lt;ref name=bbc20090728/&gt;
"Yusuf, who studied theology at the University of Medina in Saudi Arabia, was inspired by the intolerant sermons of the Egyptian Shukri Mustafa, based on excommunication and exile [[Takfir wal-Hijra]], and violently criticised the  federal government in Abuja. He believed in strict application of Islamic law, which represented his ideal of justice according  to the teachings of the Prophet." Shukri Mustafa had founded the Salafist Takfir wal-Hijra movement in Egypt in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Boko Haram hitmen would murder members of other Muslim  sects like the Salafist Izala and the Sufi Tidjaniyya and Qadiriya fraternities.&lt;ref&gt;Aux origines de la secte Boko Haram, by Alain Vicky, Le Monde diplomatique, avril 2012, pages 8–9   http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2012/04/VICKY/47604&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2009 BBC interview, Yusuf stated his belief that the concept of a spherical Earth is contrary to [[Islamic]] teaching and should be [[Flat Earth|rejected]]. He also rejected [[Evolution|Darwinian evolution]], and the concept of the condensation cycle that produces rain.&lt;ref name=bbc20090728&gt;{{cite news |title=Nigeria's 'Taliban' enigma |work=BBC News |date=28 July 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/8172270.stm |accessdate=2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are prominent Islamic preachers who have seen and understood that the present Western-style [[education]] is mixed with issues that run contrary to our beliefs in Islam," he said.

"Like [[rain]]. We believe it is a [[Miracle#Islam|creation]] of God rather than an [[water cycle|evaporation caused by the sun that condenses]] and becomes rain.

"Like saying the [[spherical Earth|world is a sphere]]. If it runs contrary to the teachings of Allah, we reject it. We also reject the theory of Darwinism." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Personal life ==
Yusuf had four wives and 12 children,&lt;ref name="bbc20090731"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8177451.stm | title=Nigeria sect head dies in custody | work=BBC News | date=2009-07-31 | agency=BBC | accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of them being [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]], who has claimed since 2016 to be the rightful leader of Boko Haram, opposing [[Abubakar Shekau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.360nobs.com/2016/08/shekau-resurfaces-accuses-new-boko-haram-leader-al-barnawi-of-attempted-coup/ |title=Shekau Resurfaces, Accuses New Boko Haram Leader al-Barnawi Of Attempted Coup |author= |work=360nobs |date=4 August 2016 |accessdate=16 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was reported as living a lavish lifestyle, which included ownership and driving of a [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name=bbc20090728/&gt;

==Death==
Following the [[2009 Boko Haram uprising|July 2009 Boko Haram uprising]], the Nigerian military captured Yusuf at his parents-in-law's house. They transferred him to the custody of the Nigerian police force.&lt;ref name="BBC Row over killing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigeria row over militant killing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8178820.stm|accessdate=27 June 2015|agency=BBC News|date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police summarily executed Yusuf in public view outside the police headquarters in [[Maiduguri]].&lt;ref name="nytimes abduction"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/africa/abduction-of-girls-an-act-not-even-al-qaeda-can-condone.html?_r=0 | title=Abduction of Girls an Act Not Even Al Qaeda Can Condone | work=The New York Times | date=May 7, 2014 | accessdate=2014-05-08 | author=Adam Nossiter |author2=David D.

A '''porous medium''' or a '''porous material''' is a material containing [[porosity|pores]] (voids).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9783527639588|title=Hierarchically Structured Porous Materials: From Nanoscience to Catalysis, Separation, Optics, Energy, and Life Science - Wiley Online Library|language=en|doi=10.1002/9783527639588}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeletal portion of the material is often called the "matrix" or "frame". The pores are typically filled with a [[fluid]] ([[liquid]] or [[gas]]). The skeletal material is usually a [[solid]], but structures like [[foam]]s are often also usefully analyzed using concept of porous media.

A porous medium is most often characterised by its [[porosity]]. Other properties of the medium (e.g. [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], [[tensile strength]], [[electrical conductivity]], [[tortuosity]]) can sometimes be derived from the respective properties of its constituents (solid matrix and fluid) and the media porosity and pores structure, but such a derivation is usually complex. Even the concept of porosity is only straightforward for a poroelastic medium.

Often both the solid matrix and the pore network (also known as the pore space) are continuous, so as to form two interpenetrating continua such as in a [[sponge]]. However, there is also a concept of closed porosity and [[effective porosity]], i.e. the pore space accessible to flow.

Many natural substances such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[soil]] (e.g. [[aquifer]]s, [[petroleum reservoir]]s), [[zeolite]]s, [[biological tissue]]s (e.g. bones, wood, [[cork (material)|cork]]), and man made materials such as [[cement]]s and [[ceramic]]s can be considered as porous media. Many of their important properties can only be rationalized by considering them to be porous media.

The concept of porous media is used in many areas of applied science and engineering: [[filtration]], [[mechanics]] ([[acoustics]], [[geomechanics]], [[soil mechanics]], [[rock mechanics]]), [[engineering]] ([[petroleum engineering]], [[bioremediation]], [[construction engineering]]), [[geosciences]] ([[hydrogeology]], [[petroleum geology]], [[geophysics]]), biology and [[biophysics]], [[material science]].

==Fluid flow through porous media==
{{main|Fluid flow through porous media}}
Fluid flow through porous media is a subject of common interest and has emerged a separate field of study. The study of more general behaviour of porous media involving deformation of the solid frame is called [[poromechanics]].

The theory of porous flows has applications in inkjet printing&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Hoath, "Fundamentals of Inkjet Printing - The Science of Inkjet and Droplets", Wiley VCH 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear waste disposal&lt;ref&gt;Martinez M.J., McTigue D.F. (1996) Modeling in Nuclear Waste Isolation: Approximate Solutions for Flow in Unsaturated Porous Media. In: Wheeler M.F. (eds) Environmental Studies. The IMA Volumes in Mathematics and its Applications, vol 79. Springer, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; technologies, among others.

== Pore structure models ==
There are many idealized models of pore structures. They can be broadly divided into three categories:
* networks of [[capillary|capillaries]]

== Laws for porous materials ==
One of the Laws for porous materials is [[Murray's law|the generalized Murray's law]]. The generalized Murray’s law is based on optimizing mass transfer by minimizing transport resistance in pores with a given volume, and can be applicable for optimizing mass transfer involving mass variations and chemical reactions involving flow proceses, molecule or ion diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Xianfeng|last2=Shen|first2=Guofang|last3=Wang|first3=Chao|last4=Li|first4=Yu|last5=Dunphy|first5=Darren|last6=Hasan|first6=Tawfique|last7=Brinker|first7=C.

For connecting a parent pipe with radius of '''''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' to many children pipes with radius of '''''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' , the formula of generalized Murray's law is: &lt;math&gt;r_o^a={1 \over 1-X}\sum_{i=1}^Nr_i^a&lt;/math&gt;, where the '''''X''''' is the ratio of mass variation during mass transfer in the parent pore, the exponent '''''α''''' is dependent on the type of the transfer. For laminar flow ''α'' =3; for turbulent flow ''α'' =7/3; for molecule or ionic diffusion ''α'' =2; etc.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2018}}}}
Human '''prehistory''' is the period between the use of the first [[stone tools]] {{circa}} 3.3 million years ago by [[hominin]]s and the invention of [[Writing system|writing systems]]. The earliest writing systems appeared {{circa}} 5,300 years ago, but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until present. The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places, and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently.

[[Sumer]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus valley civilization]] and [[ancient Egypt]] were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts, and to keep historical records; this took place already during the early [[Bronze Age]]. Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow. Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the [[Iron Age]].  The [[three-age system]] of division of prehistory into the [[Stone Age]], followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age, remains in use for much of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]], but is not generally used in those parts of the world where [[metalworking|the working of hard metals]] arrived abruptly with contact with [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian cultures]], such as [[the Americas]], [[Oceania]], [[Australasia]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  These areas also, with some exceptions in [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian civilizations]] in the Americas, did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians, and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the [[prehistory of Australia]].     

The period when a culture is written about by others, but has not developed its own writing is often known as the [[protohistory]] of the culture.  By definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary Entry|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prehistory|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no written records from human prehistory, so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial. Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graslund, Bo. 1987. ''The birth of prehistoric chronology.'' Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is concerned with human prehistory, the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history. Earlier periods are also called "prehistoric"; there are separate articles for the overall [[history of the Earth]] and the [[history of life]] before humans.

;Beginning: The term "prehistory" can refer to the vast span of time since the [[big bang|beginning]] of the [[Universe]] or the Earth, but more often it refers to the period since [[life]] appeared on Earth, or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.&lt;ref name="fagan07"&gt;Fagan, Brian. 2007. ''World Prehistory: A brief introduction'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Seventh Edition, Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renfrew"&gt;Renfrew, Colin. 2008. ''Prehistory: The Making of the Human Mind.'' New York: Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;
;End:The date marking the end of prehistory in a particular culture or region, that is, the date when relevant [[List of languages by first written accounts|written historical]] records become a useful academic resource, varies enormously from region to region. For example, in [[Egypt]] it is generally accepted that prehistory ended around 3200 BCE, whereas in [[New Guinea]] the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently, at around 1900 [[Common Era|common era]]. In Europe the relatively well-documented classical cultures of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] had neighbouring cultures, including the [[Celts]] and to a lesser extent the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], with little or no writing, and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of these "prehistoric" cultures in Greek and Roman literature.
;Time periods: In dividing up human prehistory in Eurasia, historians typically use the [[three-age system]], whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the [[chronostratigraphy|well-defined]] [[geologic record]] and its internationally defined [[stratum]] base within the [[era (geology)|geologic time scale]]. The three-age system is the [[periodization]] of human prehistory into three consecutive [[time period]]s, named for their respective predominant tool-making technologies:
:*[[Stone Age]]
:*[[Bronze Age]]
:*[[Iron Age]]&lt;ref name="Minds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy (Ed.) |title=Prehistoric Minds: Human Origins as a Cultural Artefact |date=2011 |publisher=Royal Society of London |url=https://www.academia.edu/3088568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term===
The notion of "prehistory" began to surface during the Enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word 'primitive' to describe societies that existed before written records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Matthew Daniel |title=The Line of Reason: Hugh Blair, Spatiality and the Progressive Structure of Language |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |year=2011 |volume=65 |pages=9–24 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112084 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word prehistory in English, however, occurred in the ''Foreign [[Quarterly Review]]'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Prehistoric Mind as a Historical Artefact|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|year=2011|volume=65|pages=1–8|url=https://www.academia.edu/1130650|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the geologic time scale for pre-human time periods, and of the three-age system for human prehistory, is a system that emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of British, German and Scandinavian [[Archaeology|archeologists]], [[Antiquarian|antiquarians]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name="Minds"/&gt;

==Means of research==
The main source for prehistory is [[archaeology]], but some scholars are beginning to make more use of evidence from the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="Iberia"&gt;The Prehistory of Iberia: Debating Early Social Stratification and the State edited by María Cruz Berrocal, Leonardo García Sanjuán, Antonio Gilman. Pg 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;Historical Archaeology: Back from the Edge. Edited by Pedro Paulo A. Funari, Martin Hall, Sian Jones. Pg 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal"&gt;Through the Ages in Palestinian Archaeology: An Introductory Handbook. By Walter E. Ras. Pg 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been articulated by advocates of [[deep history]].

The primary researchers into human prehistory are archaeologists and physical [[anthropologists]] who use excavation, geologic and geographic surveys, and other scientific analysis to reveal and interpret the nature and behavior of pre-literate and non-literate peoples.&lt;ref name="fagan07"/&gt; Human population [[geneticists]] and [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] are also providing valuable insight for these questions.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Cultural anthropologists help provide context for societal interactions, by which objects of human origin pass among people, allowing an analysis of any article that arises in a human prehistoric context.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Therefore, data about prehistory is provided by a wide variety of natural and social sciences, such as [[paleontology]], [[biology]], [[archaeology]], [[palynology]], [[geology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], [[comparative linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[molecular genetics]] and many others.

Human prehistory differs from history not only in terms of its [[chronology]] but in the way it deals with the activities of [[archaeological culture]]s rather than named [[nation]]s or [[individual]]s. Restricted to material processes, remains and artifacts rather than written records, prehistory is anonymous. Because of this, reference terms that prehistorians use, such as [[Neanderthal]] or [[Iron Age]] are modern labels with definitions sometimes subject to debate.

== Stone Age ==
The concept of a "Stone Age" is found useful in the archaeology of most of the world, though in the [[archaeology of the Americas]] it is called by different names and begins with a [[Lithic stage]], or sometimes [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]].  The sub-divisions described below are used for Eurasia, and not consistently across the whole area. 

=== Palaeolithic ===
{{main|Paleolithic}}
[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Map of early human &lt;!--don't link to hum. mig. article, only covers modern--&gt;migrations, according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]]. Numbers are [[millennia]] before the present (accuracy disputed).]]

"Palaeolithic" means "Old Stone Age", and begins with the first use of [[stone tool]]s. The Paleolithic is the earliest period of the [[Stone Age]].

The early part of the Palaeolithic is called the [[Lower Palaeolithic]], which predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', beginning with ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (and related species) and with the earliest stone tools, dated to around 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;The Essence of Anthropology 3rd ed. By William A. Haviland, Harald E. L. Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBrid. Pg 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[control of fire]] by early humans during the Lower Palaeolithic Era is uncertain and has at best limited scholarly support. The most widely accepted claim is that ''H. erectus'' or ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'' made fires between 790,000 and 690,000&amp;nbsp;BP (before the present period) in a site at [[Bnot Ya'akov Bridge]], [[Israel]]. The use of fire enabled early humans to cook food, provide warmth, and have a light source at night.

[[Early Homo sapiens|Early ''Homo sapiens'']] originated some 200,000 years ago, ushering in the [[Middle Palaeolithic]]. Anatomic changes indicating modern language capacity also arise during the Middle Palaeolithic.&lt;ref&gt;Race and Human Evolution. By Milford H. Wolpoff. Pg 348.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Palaeolithic Era, there is the first definitive evidence of human use of fire. Sites in Zambia have charred bone and wood that have been dated to 61,000 B.P. The systematic [[Paleolithic religion|burial of the dead]], [[origin of music|music]], [[prehistoric art|early art]], and the use of increasingly sophisticated multi-part tools are highlights of the Middle Paleolithic.

Throughout the Palaeolithic, humans generally lived as [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s. [[Hunter-gatherer#Social structure|Hunter-gatherer societies]] tended to be very small and egalitarian,&lt;ref&gt;Vanishing Voices : The Extinction of the World's Languages. By Daniel Nettle, Suzanne Romaine Merton Professor of English Language University of Oxford. pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; though hunter-gatherer societies with abundant resources or advanced food-storage techniques sometimes developed sedentary lifestyles with complex social structures such as chiefdoms{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, and [[social stratification]]. Long-distance contacts may have been established, as in the case of [[Indigenous Australian]] "highways" known as [[songlines]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Mesolithic ===
{{Main|Mesolithic}}
[[File:Dugout boats Kierikki Centre Oulu 20130526.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Dugout canoe]]]]
The "Mesolithic", or "Middle Stone Age" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "''mesos''", "middle", and "''lithos''", "stone") was a period in the development of human [[technology]] between the Palaeolithic and [[Neolithic]] periods of the Stone Age.

The Mesolithic period began at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, some 10,000 BP, and ended with [[Agriculture#History|the introduction of agriculture]], the date of which varied by geographic region. In some areas, such as the [[Near East]], agriculture was already underway by the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and there the Mesolithic is short and poorly defined. In areas with limited [[glacial]] impact, the term "[[Epipalaeolithic]]" is sometimes preferred.

Regions that experienced greater environmental effects as the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era, lasting millennia. In [[Northern Europe]], societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the [[marsh]]lands fostered by the warmer climate. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours that are preserved in the material record, such as the [[Maglemosian]] and [[Azilian]] cultures. These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BCE (6,000 [[Before Present|BP]]) in northern Europe.

Remains from this period are few and far between, often limited to [[midden]]s. In forested areas, the first signs of [[deforestation]] have been found, although this would only begin in earnest during the Neolithic, when more space was needed for [[agriculture]].

The Mesolithic is characterized in most areas by small composite [[flint]] tools — [[microlith]]s and [[microburin]]s. [[Fishing tackle]], stone [[adze]]s and wooden objects, e.g. [[canoe]]s and [[bow (weapon)|bows]], have been found at some sites. These technologies first occur in Africa, associated with the Azilian cultures, before spreading to Europe through the [[Ibero-Maurusian]] culture of Northern Africa and the [[Kebaran]] culture of the [[Levant]]. Independent discovery is not always ruled out.

Early Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants, both wild and domesticated, which included [[einkorn wheat]], [[millet]] and [[spelt]], and the keeping of [[origin of the domestic dog|dogs]], [[sheep]] and [[goat#History|goats]]. By about 6,900–6,400 BCE, it included domesticated [[cattle]] and [[domesticated pig|pigs]], the establishment of permanently or seasonally inhabited settlements, and the use of [[pottery]]. The Neolithic period saw the development of early [[village]]s, [[agriculture]], animal [[domestication]], [[tool]]s and the onset of the earliest recorded incidents of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perfectirishgifts.com/blog/2008/06/prehistoric_massacres_the_twin.html The Perfect Gift: Prehistoric Massacres.

It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the [[chalcolithic|Copper Age]] or [[Bronze Age]]; or, in some geographical regions, in the [[Iron Age]]).The term ''Neolithic'' is commonly used in the [[Old World]], as its application to cultures in the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] that did not fully develop metal-working technology raises problems.

Settlements became more permanent with some having circular houses with single rooms made of [[mudbrick]]. Settlements might have a surrounding stone wall to keep domesticated animals in and protect the inhabitants from other tribes. Later settlements have rectangular mud-brick houses where the family lived together in single or multiple rooms. Burial findings suggest an [[ancestor cult]] where people [[Plastered human skulls|preserved skulls]] of the dead.

===Chalcolithic===
{{Main|Chalcolithic}}
[[File:Los Millares recreacion cuadro.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Copper Age walled city, [[Los Millares]], [[Iberia]]]]
In Old World archaeology, the "Chalcolithic", "Eneolithic" or "Copper Age" refers to a transitional period where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the widespread use of stone tools. During this period, some weapons and tools were made of copper. This period was still largely Neolithic in character. It is a phase of the [[Bronze Age]] before it was discovered that adding [[tin]] to [[copper]] formed the harder [[bronze]]. The Copper Age was originally defined as a transition between the [[Neolithic]] and the Bronze Age. However, because it is characterized by the use of metals, the Copper Age is considered a part of the Bronze Age rather than the Stone Age.
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]]]]
An archaeological site in [[Serbia]] contains the oldest securely dated evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 7,500 years ago. The find in June 2010 extends the known record of copper smelting by about 800 years, and suggests that copper smelting may have been invented in separate parts of Asia and Europe at that time rather than spreading from a single source.&lt;ref name="archaeology.ws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers|author=|date=July 17, 2010|work=ScienceNews|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60563/description/Serbian_site_may_have_hosted_first_copper_makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[metallurgy]] may have occurred first in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where it gave rise to the Bronze Age in the [[4th millennium BCE]] (the traditional view), though finds from the [[Vinča culture]] in Europe have now been securely dated to slightly earlier than those of the Fertile Crescent. [[Timna Valley]] contains evidence of copper mining 9,000 to 7,000 years ago. The process of transition from [[Neolithic]] to Chalcolithic in the Middle East is characterized in archaeological stone tool assemblages by a decline in high quality raw material procurement and use. North Africa and the Nile Valley imported its iron technology from the [[Near East]] and followed the Near Eastern course of Bronze Age and [[Iron Age]] development. However the [[Iron Age]] and Bronze Age occurred simultaneously in much of Africa.

== Bronze Age ==
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ox]]-drawn [[plow]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], c. 1200 BCE.]]

The Bronze Age is the earliest period in which some civilizations have reached the end of prehistory, by introducing written records. The Bronze Age or parts thereof are thus considered to be part of prehistory only for the regions and civilizations who adopted or developed a system of keeping written records during later periods.  The [[History of writing|invention of writing]] coincides in some areas with the early beginnings of the Bronze Age. Soon after the appearance of writing, people started creating texts including written accounts of events and records of administrative matters.

The term Bronze Age refers to a period in human cultural development when the most advanced [[metalworking]] (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of ores, and then combining them to cast [[bronze]]. These naturally occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before 3000 BCE. The Bronze Age forms part of the [[three-age system]] for prehistoric societies. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic]] in some areas of the world.

While copper is a common ore, deposits of tin are rare in the [[Old World]], and often had to be traded or carried considerable distances from the few mines, stimulating the creation of extensive trading routes.  In many areas as far apart as China and England, the valuable new material was used for weapons but for a long time apparently not available for agricultural tools.  Much of it seems to have been hoarded by social elites, and sometimes deposited in extravagant quantities, from [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s and [[Copper Hoard Culture|Indian copper hoards]] to European [[hoard]]s of unused axe-heads.

By the end of the Bronze Age large states, which are often called empires, had arisen in Egypt, China, [[Anatolia]] (the [[Hittites]]) and [[History of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], all of them literate.

== Iron Age ==
{{Main|Iron Age|Classical antiquity}}

The Iron Age is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. Most remaining civilizations did so during the Iron Age, often through conquest by the empires, which continued to expand during this period.  For example, in most of Europe conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] means that the term Iron Age is replaced by "Roman", "[[Gallo-Roman]]" and similar terms after the conquest.

In archaeology, the Iron Age refers to the advent of [[ferrous metallurgy]]. The adoption of [[iron]] coincided with other changes in some past cultures, often including more sophisticated agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, which makes the archaeological Iron Age coincide with the "[[Axial Age]]" in the history of philosophy.  Although iron ore is common, the metalworking techniques necessary to use iron are very different from those needed for the metal used earlier, and iron was slow-spreading and for long mainly used for weapons, while bronze remained typical for tools, as well as art.

A '''pressure–volume diagram''' (or '''PV diagram''', or '''volume–pressure loop''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch5/s3ch5_16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe corresponding changes in [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] and [[pressure]] in a system.  They are commonly used in [[thermodynamics]], [[cardiovascular physiology]], and [[respiratory physiology]].

PV diagrams, originally called '''indicator diagrams''', were developed in the 18th century as tools for understanding the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s.

==Description==
A PV diagram plots the change in pressure ''P'' with respect to volume ''V'' for some [[thermodynamic process|process]] or processes.  Typically in thermodynamics, the set of processes forms a [[thermodynamic cycle|cycle]], so that upon completion of the cycle there has been no net change in [[thermodynamic state|state]] of the system; i.e. the device returns to the starting pressure and volume.

The figure shows the features of a typical PV diagram.  A series of numbered states (1 through 4) are noted.  The path between each state consists of some process (A through D) which alters the pressure or volume of the system (or both).
[[File:P-v diagram of a simple cycle.svg|none|230px|Generalized PV diagram]]
A key feature of the diagram is that the amount of energy expended or received by the system as [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] can be estimated as the area under the curve on the chart.  For a cyclic diagram, the net work is that ''enclosed'' by the curve.  In the example given in the figure, the processes 1-2-3 produce a work output, but processes from 3-4-1 require a smaller energy input to return to the starting position / state;  thus the net work is the difference between the two.

Note that this figure is highly idealized, and a diagram showing the processes in a real device would tend to depict a more complex shape of the PV curve.  (See section Applications, below).

==History==
[[Image:Indicator diagram.png|thumb|right|Watt's indicator diagram]]
[[Image:Steam indicator (Steam and the Steam Engine - Land and Marine, 1875).jpg|thumb|right|Richard's indicator instrument of 1875]]
The PV diagram, then called an indicator diagram, was developed by [[James Watt]] and his employee [[John Southern (engineer)|John Southern]] (1758–1815) to improve the [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] of engines.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Hunt (2010) ''Pursuing Power and Light'', page 13, [[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8018-9359-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, Southern developed the simple, but critical, technique to generate the diagram by fixing a board so as to move with the piston, thereby tracing the "volume" axis, while a [[pencil]], attached to a [[pressure gauge]], moved at right angles to the piston, tracing "pressure".

The gauge enabled Watt to calculate the work done by the steam while ensuring that its pressure had dropped to zero by the end of the stroke, thereby ensuring that all useful [[energy]] had been extracted. The total work could be calculated from the area between the "volume" axis and the traced line. The latter fact had been realised by [[Davies Gilbert]] as early as 1792 and used by [[Jonathan Hornblower]] in [[litigation]] against Watt over [[patent]]s on various designs. [[Daniel Bernoulli]] had also had the insight about how to calculate work.

Watt used the diagram to make radical improvements to steam engine performance and long kept it a trade secret. Though it was made public in a letter to the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;(Anonymous), "Account of a steam-engine indicator," ''Quarterly Journal of Science'', vol. 13, page 95 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; it remained somewhat obscure. [[John Farey, Jr.]] only learned of it on seeing it used, probably by Watt's men, when he visited Russia in 1826.

In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] used a diagram of pressure against volume to illustrate and elucidate the [[Carnot cycle]], elevating it to a central position in the study of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapeyron, E. (1834) "Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur" (Memoir on the motive power of heat), ''Journal de l'École Royale Polytechnique'', vol. 14, no. 23, pages 153–190, 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later instruments (''illus.'') used paper wrapped around a cylindrical barrel with a pressure piston inside it, the rotation of the barrel coupled to the piston crosshead by a weight- or spring-tensioned wire.

In 1869 the British marine engineer [[Nicholas Procter Burgh]] wrote a full book on the indicator diagram explaining the device step by step. He had noticed that "a very large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession look at an indicator diagram as a mysterious production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Procter Burgh]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qSdWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 The Indicator Diagram Practically Considered].'' E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 1869. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Thermodynamics===
PV diagrams can be used to estimate the net work performed by a [[thermodynamic cycle]].  The net work is the area enclosed by the PV curve in the diagram.  This usage derived from the development of indicator diagrams which were used to estimate the performance of a [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the diagram records the [[pressure]] of steam versus the volume of steam in a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], throughout a [[piston]]'s cycle of motion in a steam engine.  The diagram enables calculation of the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] performed and thus can provide a measure of the power produced by the engine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hills and A. J. Pacey (January 1972) "The measurement of power in early steam-driven textile mills," ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 13, no. 1, pages 25–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indicator diagram steam admission.svg|none|450px||Indicator diagram for steam locomotive]]

To exactly calculate the work done by the system it is necessary to calculate the integral of the pressure with respect to volume.  One can often quickly calculate this using the PV diagram as it is simply the area enclosed by the cycle.

Note that in some cases [[specific volume]] will be plotted on the x-axis instead of volume, in which case the area under the curve represents work per unit mass of the working fluid (i.e. J/kg).

===Medicine===
{{main|Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology}}
In [[cardiovascular physiology]], the diagram is often applied to the [[left ventricle]], and it can be mapped to specific events of the [[cardiac cycle]]. [[Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology|PV loop studies]] are widely used in basic research and [[Biomedical research|preclinical testing]], to [[Pressure-Volume Loop Analysis in Cardiology|characterize the intact heart's performance under various situations]] (effect of drugs, disease, characterization of mouse [[Strain (biology)|strains]]),

The sequence of events occurring in every heart cycle is as follows. The left figure shows a PV loop from a real experiment; letters refer to points.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''A''' is the end-[[Diastole|diastolic]] point; this is the point where contraction begins. Pressure starts to increase, becomes rapidly higher than the atrial pressure, and the mitral valve closes. Since pressure is also lower than the aortic pressure, the aortic valve is closed as well.
* Segment '''AB''' is the contraction phase. Since both the mitral and aortic valves are closed, volume is constant. For this reason, this phase is called isovolumic contraction.
* At point '''B''', pressure becomes higher than the aortic pressure and the aortic valve opens, initiating ejection.
* '''BC''' is the ejection phase, volume decreases. At the end of this phase, pressure lowers again and falls below aortic pressure. The aortic valve closes.
* Point '''C''' is the end-[[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] point.
* Segment '''CD''' is the isovolumic relaxation. During this phase, pressure continues to fall. The mitral valve and aortic valve are both closed again so volume is constant.
* At point '''D''' pressure falls below the atrial pressure and the mitral valve opens, initiating ventricular filling.
* '''DA''' is the [[Diastole|diastolic]] filling period. Blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Atrial contraction completes ventricular filling.

As it can be seen, the PV loop forms a roughly rectangular shape and each loop is formed in an anti-clockwise direction.

A '''radio atmospheric signal''' or '''sferic''' (sometimes also spelled "spheric") is a [[broadband]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] impulse that occurs as a result of natural atmospheric [[lightning]] discharges. Sferics may propagate from their lightning source without major [[attenuation]] in the [[Earth–ionosphere waveguide]], and can be received thousands of kilometres from their source. On a time-domain plot, a sferic may appear as a single high-amplitude spike in the time-domain data. On a [[spectrogram]], a sferic appears as a vertical stripe (reflecting its broadband and impulsive nature) that may extend from a few [[Hertz|kHz]] to several tens of kHz, depending on atmospheric conditions.

Sferics received from about {{nowrap|2,000 kilometres'}} distance or greater have their frequencies slightly offset in time, producing ''tweeks''.

When the electromagnetic energy from a sferic escapes the Earth-ionosphere [[waveguide]] and enters the [[magnetosphere]], it becomes [[dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] by the near-Earth [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], forming a [[Whistler (radio)|whistler]] signal. Because the source of the whistler is an impulse (i.e., the sferic), a whistler may be interpreted as the [[impulse response]] of the magnetosphere (for the conditions at that particular instant).

==Introduction==
A [[lightning]] channel with all its branches and its electric currents behaves like a huge antenna system from which electromagnetic waves of all frequencies are radiated. Beyond a distance where luminosity is visible and thunder can be heard (typically about 10&amp;nbsp;km), these electromagnetic impulses are the only sources of direct information about thunderstorm activity on the ground. Transients electric currents during return strokes (R strokes) or intracloud strokes (K strokes) are the main sources for the generation of impulse-type electromagnetic radiation known as sferics (sometimes called atmospherics).&lt;ref name="Uman"&gt;{{Citation |last=Uman |first=M. A. |title=The Lightning Discharge |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=New York |date=1980 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this impulsive radiation dominates at frequencies less than about 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, (loosely called long waves), a continuous noise component becomes increasingly important at higher frequencies.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=E. A. |chapter=High frequency radio noise |pages=251&amp;ndash;288 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=CRC Handbook of Atmospherics |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1982 |volume=I |isbn=9780849332265 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=D.

[[Whistler (radio)|Whistler]]s generated by lightning strokes can propagate into the [[magnetosphere]] along the [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] lines of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hayakawa |first=M. |chapter=Whistlers |pages=155&amp;ndash;193 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1995 |volume=II |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Park |first=C.

==Source properties==
===Basic stroke parameters===
In a typical cloud-to-ground stroke (R stroke), negative electric charge (electrons) of the order of Q = 1 C stored within the lightning channel is lowered to the ground within a typical impulse time interval of τ = 100 μs. This corresponds to an average current flowing within the channel of the order of J = Q/τ = 10 kA. Maximum spectral energy is generated near frequencies of f = 1/τ = 10&amp;nbsp;kHz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Serhan |first=G. L. |title=The RF spectra of first and subsequent lightning return strokes in the 1 = 100 km range |journal=Radio Science |volume=15 |issue=108 |page= |date=1980 |doi= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at wavelengths of λ = c/f = 30&amp;nbsp;km (c is the speed of light). In typical intracloud K strokes, positive electric charge of the order of C = 10&amp;nbsp;mC in the upper part of the channel and an equivalent amount of negative charge in its lower part neutralize within a typical time interval of τ = 25&amp;nbsp;μs. The corresponding values for average electric current, frequency and wavelength are J = 400&amp;nbsp;A, f = 40&amp;nbsp;kHz, and λ = 7.5&amp;nbsp;km. The energy of K strokes is in general two orders of magnitude weaker than the energy of R strokes.&lt;ref name="VollandHB"&gt;{{Citation |last=Volland |first=H. |chapter=Longwave sferics propagation within the atmospheric waveguide |pages=65&amp;ndash;93 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1995 |volume=II |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical length of lightning channels can be estimated to be of the order of L = λ/4 = 8&amp;nbsp;km for R strokes and L= λ/2 = 4&amp;nbsp;km for K strokes. Often, a continuing current component flows between successive R strokes.&lt;ref name="Uman"/&gt; Its "pulse" time typically varies between about 10 to 150 ms, its electric current is of the order of J = 100 A, corresponding to the numbers of Q = 1 to 20 C, f = 7 to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz and λ = 3 to 40 Mm. Both R strokes as well as K strokes produce sferics seen as a coherent impulse waveform within a broadband receiver tuned to 1–100&amp;nbsp;kHz. The electric field strength of the impulse increases to a maximum value within a few microseconds and then declines like a damped oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lin |first= Y.

The visible part of a lightning channel has a typical length of about 5&amp;nbsp;km. Another part of comparable length may be hidden in the cloud and may have a significant horizontal branch. Evidently, the dominant wavelength of the electromagnetic waves of R- and K-strokes is much larger than their channel lengths. The physics of electromagnetic wave propagation within the channel must thus be derived from full wave theory, because the ray concept breaks down.

===Electric channel current===
The channel of a R stroke can be considered as a thin isolated wire of length L and diameter d in which negative electric charge has been stored. In terms of [[Electrical network|electric circuit]] theory, one can adopt a simple [[transmission line]] model with a [[capacitor]], where the charge is stored, a [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] of the channel, and an [[inductance]] simulating the electric properties of the channel.&lt;ref name="VollandAE"&gt;{{Citation |last=Volland |first=H. |title=Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |date=1984 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment of contact with the perfectly conducting Earth surface, the charge is lowered to the ground. In order to fulfill the boundary conditions at the top of the wire (zero electric current) and at the ground (zero electric voltage), only standing resonant waves modes can exit. The fundamental mode which transports electric charge to the ground most effectively, has thus a wavelength λ four times the channel length L. In the case of the K stroke, the lower boundary is the same as the upper boundary.&lt;ref name="VollandHB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VollandAE"/&gt; Of course, this picture is valid only for wave mode 1 (λ/4 antenna)
and perhaps for mode 2 (λ/2 antenna), because these modes do not yet "feel" the contorted configuration of the real lightning channel. The higher order modes contribute to the incoherent noisy signals in the higher frequency range (&gt; 100&amp;nbsp;kHz).

== Transfer function of Earth–ionosphere waveguide ==
Sferics can be simulated approximately by the electromagnetic radiation field of a vertical [[Hertz]]ian [[dipole antenna]]. The maximum spectral amplitude of the sferic typically is near 5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Beyond this maximum, the spectral amplitude decreases as 1/f if the Earth's surface were perfectly conducting. The effect of the real ground is to attenuate the higher frequencies more strongly than the lower frequencies ([[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]'s ground wave).

R strokes emit most of their energy within the ELF/VLF range ([[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] = extremely low frequencies, &lt; 3&amp;nbsp;kHz; [[VLF]] = very low frequencies, 3&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;kHz). These waves are reflected and attenuated on the ground as well as within the ionospheric D layer, near 70&amp;nbsp;km altitude during day time conditions, and near 90&amp;nbsp;km height during the night. Reflection and attenuation on the ground depends on frequency, distance, and [[orography]]. In the case of the ionospheric D-layer, it depends, in addition, on time of day, season, latitude, and the [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic field]] in a complicated manner. VLF propagation within the [[Earth–ionosphere waveguide]] can be described by ray theory and by wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wait |first=J. R. |title=Wave Propagation Theory |publisher=[[Pergamon Press]] |location=New York |date=1982 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harth |first=W. |chapter=Theory of low frequency wave propagation |pages=133&amp;ndash;202 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=CRC Handbook of Atmospherics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1982 |volume=II |isbn=0849332273 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When distances are less than about 500&amp;nbsp;km (depending on frequency), then ray theory is appropriate. The ground wave and the first hop (or sky) wave reflected at the ionospheric D layer interfere with each other.

At distances greater than about 500&amp;nbsp;km, sky waves reflected several times at the ionosphere must be added. Therefore, mode theory is here more appropriate. The first mode is least attenuated within the Earth–ionosphere waveguide, and thus dominates at distances greater than about 1000&amp;nbsp;km.

The [[Earth–ionosphere waveguide]] is dispersive. Its propagation characteristics are described by a [[transfer function]] T(ρ, f) depending mainly on distance ρ and frequency f. In the VLF range, only mode one is important at distances larger than about 1000&amp;nbsp;km. Least attenuation of this mode occurs at about 15&amp;nbsp;kHz. Therefore, the Earth–ionosphere waveguide behaves like a bandpass filter, selecting this band out of a broadband signal. The 15&amp;nbsp;kHz signal dominates at distances greater than about 5000&amp;nbsp;km. For ELF waves (&lt; 3&amp;nbsp;kHz), ray theory becomes invalid, and only mode theory is appropriate. Here, the zeroth mode begins to dominate and is responsible for the second window at greater distances.

Resonant waves of this zeroth mode can be excited in the Earth–ionosphere waveguide cavity, mainly by the continuing current components of lightning flowing between two return strokes. Their wavelengths are integral fractions of the Earth's circumference, and their resonance frequencies can thus be approximately determined by ''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;''mc''/(2π''a'')&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;7.5&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;Hz (with ''m'' = 1, 2, ...; ''a'' the Earth's radius and ''c'' the speed of light). These resonant modes with their fundamental frequency of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;7.5&amp;nbsp;Hz are known as [[Schumann resonances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polk |first=C. |chapter=Schumann resonances |pages=111&amp;ndash;178 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=CRC Handbook of Atmospherics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1982 |volume=I |isbn=9780849332265 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentman"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sentman |first=D. D. |chapter=Schumann resonances |pages=267&amp;ndash;295 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1995 |volume=I |isbn=9780849386473 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring thunderstorm activity with sferics==
About 100 lightning strokes per second are generated all over the world excited by [[thunderstorm]]s located mainly in the continental areas at low and middle latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vonnegut |first=B. |chapter=The physics of thundercloudes |pages=1&amp;ndash;22 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H |title=CRC Handbook of Atmospherics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1982 |volume=I |isbn=9780849332265 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=E. R. |chapter=Meteorological aspects of thunderstorms |pages=27&amp;ndash;60 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1995 |volume=I |isbn=9780849386473 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to monitor the thunderstorm activity, sferics are the appropriate means.

Measurements of [[Schumann resonances]] at only a few stations around the world can monitor the global lightning activity fairly well.&lt;ref name="Sentman"/&gt; One can apply the dispersive property of the [[Earth–ionosphere waveguide]] by measuring the [[group velocity]] of a sferic signal at different frequencies together with its direction of arrival. The group time delay difference of neighbouring frequencies in the lower VLF band is directly proportional to the distance of the source. Since the attenuation of VLF waves is smaller for west to east propagation and during the night, thunderstorm activity up to distances of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km can be observed for signals arriving from the west during night time conditions. Otherwise, the transmission range is of the order of 5,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grandt |first=C. |title=Thunderstorm monitoring in South Africa and Europe by means of VLF sferics |journal=J. Geophys. Res. |volume=97 |issue= |page=18215 |date=1992 |doi= 10.1029/92JD01623|bibcode = 1992JGR....9718215G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the regional range (&lt; 1,000&amp;nbsp;km), the usual way is magnetic direction finding as well as time of arrival measurements of a sferic signal observed simultaneously at several stations.&lt;ref name="Orville"&gt;{{Citation |last=Orville |first=R. E. |chapter=Lightning detection from ground and space |pages=137&amp;ndash;149 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1995 |volume=I |isbn=9780849386473 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumption of such measurements is the concentration on one individual impulse. If one measures simultaneously several pulses, interference takes place with a beat frequency equal to the inversal average sequence time of the pulses.

==Atmospheric noise==
The [[signal-to-noise ratio]] determines the [sensitivity|sensibility] of [[telecommunication]] systems (e.g., radio receivers). An [[analog signal]] must clearly exceed the noise amplitude in order to become detectable. [[Atmospheric noise]] is one of the most important sources for the limitation of the detection of radio signals.

The steady electric discharging currents in a lightning channel cause a series of incoherent impulses in the whole frequency range, the amplitudes of which decreases approximately with the inverse frequency. In the ELF-range, technical noise from 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, natural noise from the [[magnetosphere]], etc. dominates. In the VLF-range, there are the coherent impulses from R- and K-strokes, appearing out of the background noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fraser-Smith |first=A. C. |chapter=Low-frequency radio noise |pages=297&amp;ndash;310 |editor-last=Volland |editor-first=H. |title=Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |date=1995 |volume=I |isbn=9780849386473 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond about 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, the noise amplitude becomes more and more incoherent. In addition, technical noise from electric motors, ignition systems of motor cars, etc., are superimposed. Finally, beyond the high frequency band (3–30&amp;nbsp;MHz) extraterrestrial noise (noise of galactic origin, solar noise) dominates.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Proctor"/&gt;

The atmospheric noise depends on frequency, location and time of day and year. Worldwide measurements of that noise are documented in CCIR-reports (CCIR = "Comité Consultatif International des Radiocommunications").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spaulding |first=A.

== Appearance, origin and mass loss ==
Supernova impostors appear as remarkably faint supernovae of spectral type IIn—which have hydrogen in their spectrum and narrow spectral lines that indicate relatively low gas speeds. These impostors exceed their pre-outburst states by several magnitudes, with typical peak absolute visual magnitudes of −11 to −14, making these outbursts as bright as the [[List of most luminous stars|most luminous stars]]. The trigger mechanism of these outbursts remains unexplained, though it is thought to be caused by violating the classical [[Eddington luminosity]] limit, initiating severe mass loss. If the ratio of radiated energy to kinetic energy is near unity, as in [[Eta Carinae]], then we might expect an ejected mass of about 0.16 solar masses.

== Examples ==
Possible examples of supernova impostors include the [[Eta Carinae#Great Eruption|Great Eruption]] of [[Eta Carinae]], [[P Cygni]], [[SN 1961V]],&lt;ref name=Kochanek2010&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Swiss Family Robinson''''' (German: ''Der Schweizerische Robinson'') is a [[novel]] by [[Johann David Wyss]], first published in 1812, about a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] family shipwrecked in the [[East Indies]] en route to [[Port Jackson]], [[Australia]].

==History==
Written by Swiss pastor [[Johann David Wyss]], edited by his son [[Johann Rudolf Wyss]] and illustrated by another son, Johann Emmanuel Wyss, the novel was intended to teach his four sons about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. Wyss' attitude toward education is in line with the teachings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and many chapters involve Christian-oriented moral lessons such as [[frugality]], [[husbandry]], [[acceptance]] and [[cooperation]].&lt;ref name=moody&gt;[http://www.jimandellen.org/montolieu/robinsonsuisse.html "A Note on Wyss's Swiss Family Robinson, Montolieu's Le Robinson suisse, and Kingston's 1879 text"] by Ellan Moody.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wyss presents adventures as lessons in [[natural history]] and [[physical science]]. This resembles other educational books for young ones published about the same time. These include [[Charlotte Turner Smith]]'s ''Rural Walks: in Dialogues intended for the use of Young Persons'' (1795), ''Rambles Farther: A continuation of Rural Walks'' (1796), ''A Natural History of Birds, intended chiefly for young persons'' (1807). But Wyss' novel is also modeled after [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', an adventure story about a shipwrecked sailor first published in 1719 and the source of the "Robinson" in the title "Swiss Family Robinson".&lt;ref name=moody/&gt;

The book presents a geographically impossible array of large [[mammal]]s and [[plant]]s that probably could never have existed together on a single island, for the children's education, nourishment, clothing and convenience.

Over the years there have been many versions of the story with episodes added, changed, or deleted. Perhaps the best-known English version is by [[William H. G. Kingston]], first published in 1879.&lt;ref name=moody/&gt; It is based on [[Isabelle de Montolieu]]'s 1813 French adaptation and 1824 continuation (from chapter 37) ''Le Robinson suisse, ou, Journal d'un père de famille, naufragé avec ses enfants'' in which were added further adventures of Fritz, Franz, Ernest, and Jack.&lt;ref name=moody/&gt; Other English editions that claim to include the whole of the Wyss-Montolieu narrative are by W. H. Davenport Adams (1869–1910) and Mrs H. B. Paull (1879). As Carpenter and Prichard write in ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford, 1995), "with all the expansions and contractions over the past two centuries (this includes a long history of abridgments, condensations, Christianizing, and Disney products), Wyss's original narrative has long since been obscured."&lt;ref name=moody/&gt; The closest English translation to the original is [[William Godwin]]'s 1816 translation, reprinted by Penguin Classics.&lt;ref&gt;John Seelye, ed. ''The Swiss Family Robinson''. Penguin Classics. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-14-310499-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although movie and television adaptations typically name the family "Robinson", it is not a Swiss name. The German title translates as ''The Swiss Robinson'' which identifies the novel as part of the [[Robinsonade]] genre, rather than a story about a family named Robinson.

==Plot==

{{more plot|date=January 2012}}
The novel opens with the family in the hold of a sailing ship, weathering a great storm. The ship's passengers evacuate without them, and William and Elizabeth and their four children (Fritz, Ernest, Jack and Francis) are left to survive alone. As the ship tosses about, the father – William – prays that [[God]] will spare them. 

The ship survives the night and the family finds themselves within sight of a tropical [[desert island]]. The next morning, they decide to get to the island they can see beyond the reef. With much effort, they construct a vessel out of tubs. After they fill the tubs with food and [[ammunition]] and all other articles of value they can safely carry, they row toward the island. Two [[dog]]s from the ship named Turk and Juno swim beside them. The ship's cargo of [[livestock]] (including a [[cow]], a [[donkey]], two [[goat]]s, six [[sheep]], a ram, a [[pig]], [[chicken]]s, [[domestic duck]]s, [[Domestic goose|domestic geese]], and [[domestic pigeon]]s), guns &amp; powder, carpentry tools, books, a disassembled [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]], and provisions have survived.

Upon reaching the island, the family set up a makeshift camp. The father knows that they must prepare for a long time on the island and his thoughts are as much on provisions for [[the future]] as for their immediate wants. William and his oldest son Fritz spend the next day exploring the island.

The family spends the next few days securing themselves against hunger. William and Fritz make several trips to the ship in their efforts to bring ashore everything useful from the vessel. The [[domesticated animals]] on the ship are towed back to the island. There is also a great store of [[firearms]] and ammunition, [[hammocks]] for [[sleeping]], [[Carpentry|carpenter’s]] tools, lumber, [[cooking utensils]], [[Household silver|silverware]], and dishes. Initially they construct a treehouse, but as time passes (and after Elizabeth is injured climbing the stairs down from it), they settle in a more permanent dwelling in part of a cave. Fritz rescues a young Englishwoman (Jenny Montrose) shipwrecked elsewhere on their island. 

The book covers more than ten years. The father and older boys explore various environments and develop homes and gardens in various sites about the island. At the end, the father wonders if they will ever again see the rest of [[Human|humanity]]. Eventually a [[Great Britain|British]] ship that is in search of Jenny Montrose anchors near the island and is discovered by the family. The captain is given the journal containing the story of their life on the island which is eventually published. Several members of the family choose to continue to live tranquilly on their island while several of them return to [[Europe]] with the British.

==Characters==
* '''William''' – The father. He is the narrator of the story and leads the family. He knows an enormous amount of information on almost everything the family comes across, demonstrating bravery and self-reliance.
* '''Elizabeth''' – The mother. She is intelligent and resourceful, arming herself even before leaving the ship with a "magic bag" filled with supplies, including sewing materials and seeds for food crops. She is also a remarkably versatile cook, taking on anything from porcupine soup to roast penguin.
* '''Fritz''' – The oldest of the four boys, he is 15. Fritz is intelligent but impetuous. He is the strongest and accompanies his father on many quests.
* '''Ernest''' – The second oldest of the boys, he is 13. Ernest is the most intelligent, but a less physically active boy, often described by his father as "indolent". Like Fritz however, he comes to be an excellent shot.
* '''Jack''' – The third oldest of the boys, 11 years old. He is thoughtless, bold, vivacious, and the quickest of the group.
* '''Franz''' (sometimes translated as '''Francis''') – The youngest of the boys, he is 8 years old when the story opens. He usually stays home with his mother.
* '''Turk''' – The family's English dog.
* '''Juno''' – The family's Danish dog.
* '''Emily Montrose''' (called '''Jenny''' in Montolieu's version) – An English girl found on Smoking Rock near the end of the novel. She is shy but is soon adopted into the family. Not a character in the original German, Emily was invented by Isabelle de Montolieu.
* '''Nip''' (also called '''Knips''' or '''Nips''' in some editions) – An orphan monkey adopted by the family after their dogs Turk and Juno have killed his mother. The family use him to test for poisonous fruits.
* '''Fangs''' – A [[jackal]] that was tamed by the family.

==Other adaptations==
The novels in one form or another have also been adapted numerous times, sometimes changing location and/or time period:

* ''Willis the Pilot: a sequel to The Swiss family Robinson; or, Adventures of an emigrant family wrecked on an unknown coast of the Pacific Ocean'' (1858) has been attributed to [[Johann Wyss]] or to [[Johanna Spyri]], author of ''[[Heidi]]''.
* ''[[The Castaways of the Flag|Second Fatherland]]'' (''Seconde Patrie'', 1900), by [[Jules Verne]] takes up the story at the point where Wyss's tale left off. It has also been published in two volumes, ''Their Island Home'' and ''Castaways of the Flag''.
*  ''Return to Robinson Island'' (2015), by [[T. J. Hoisington]], based on the original 1812 Swiss Family Robinson novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TJ Hoisington Pens the First Swiss Family Robinson Sequel in Over 100 Years|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwbooks/article/TJ-Hoisington-Pens-the-First-Swiss-Family-Robinson-Sequel-in-Over-100-Years-20150924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time and Eternity - An Essay on the Philosophy of Religion''''' (1st imp. [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[New Jersey]] 1952, [[Princeton University Press]], 169 pp) is a philosophy book written by [[Walter Terence Stace]]. At the time of writing, Stace was a professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where he had worked since 1932 after a 22-year career in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]]. ''Time and Eternity'' was one of his first books about the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[mysticism]], after writing throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s that was influenced by [[Phenomenalism|phenomenalist]] philosophy.

In his introduction Stace writes that ''Time and Eternity'' is an attempt to set out the fundamental nature of religion, and to deal with the conflict between religion and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He explains that the basic idea set out in the book is that all religious thought is symbolic, and that his influences include [[Rudolf Otto]], especially his ''Mysticism East and West'', and [[Immanuel Kant]]. He says he was motivated to write the book in an attempt to add to the "other half of the truth which I now think naturalism [as espoused in his 1947 essay ''Man Against Darkness''] misses".

The book begins by looking at religion, specifically God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He goes on to say that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.

==Synopsis==

The first chapter asks what religion is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, is rooted in [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]], and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the [[Apophatic theology|negative divine]] - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, it is only the theories about it that differ.&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1952) ''Time and Eternity''.  [[Princeton University Press]]. P. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is not that the mystic has an experience, even a direct vision, of God. For in that case God would be the object for the soul as subject. The distinction between God and the soul, as object and subject respectively, is wholly done away with. The soul passes into the being of God, becomes God, is God."

|}

Stace then goes on to explain that all religions say that religious revelation is [[ineffability|ineffable]], because no words or concepts can be applied to God who is without qualities or predicates. Thus, God cannot be comprehended by the intellect, but is apprehended by intuition. "... it is of the very nature of intellect to involve the subject-object opposition. But in the mystic experience this opposition is transcended. Therefore the intellect is incapable of understanding it. Therefore it is incomprehensible, ineffable."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace then looks at the [[Cataphatic theology|positive divine]]; he asks how concepts can be applied to that which is above all concepts and finds that all propositions about God are symbolical. He defines religious and non-religious symbolism as differing in two respects. Firstly, religious symbols cannot be translated into logical propositions because they refer to an (ineffable) experience rather than a proposition. Secondly, the relationship between the religious symbol and what is symbolised is one of evocation rather than "meaning", as meaning is a concept, which is absent in the mystical experience. "Yet in some way this symbolic language evokes in us some glimpse, some hint, seen dimly through the mists and fogs which envelop us, of that being who stands above all human thought and conception."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to write that some of these symbols feel more appropriate than others (e.g. God is love not hate).

[[File:Plotinos.jpg|thumb|200px|"Thus when Plotinus speaks of "the flight of the alone to the Alone,"… [this] evoke[s] in us a measure of the same experience which the author of them had."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 91&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Next Stace explains that there are two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and the [[noumenon]], although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at symbolism in religion, Stace states that there are two types of predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a [[hierarchy of being]], and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the [[numinous|numen]] and qualities found in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace next looks at religion’s claims to truth. He draws an analogy between mystical illumination and aesthetic truth, as the truths of both rest on revelation rather than reason. "Either you directly perceive beauty, or you do not. And either you directly perceive God in intuition, or you do not."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he maintains the arguments of both mystics and naturalists in denying each other’s positions are invalid, as they concern different realities.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "What is the meaning of the metaphor of intersection? This intersection means precisely what the eternal moment is experienced to be. It is one and the same human consciousness which experiences both the temporal or natural world and that eternal and infinite order which is disclosed in mystical illumination."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These separate spheres lead Stace to reflect on both [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|proofs for God]] and [[acosmism]]. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, is a direct result of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "The pure religious consciousness lies in a region which is forever beyond all proof or disproof. This is a necessary consequence of the "utterly other" character of God from the world, and of the "utterly other" character of the world from God. The eternal order is not the natural order, and the natural order is not the eternal order. The two orders intersect, but in the intersection each remains what it is. Each is wholly self-contained. Therefore, it is impossible to pass, by any logical inference, from one to the other. This at once precludes as impossible any talk either of the proof or disproof of religion."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In the final chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns to the idea that theology and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of [[Vedanta]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]]) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.

[[File:Ikone Athanasius von Alexandria.jpg|thumb|200px|“[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|The Upanishad]] says flatly that Brahman "is incomprehensible, for it cannot be comprehended". [[Creed of St. Athanasius|The creed of St. Athanasius]] agrees with the Upanishad: 
'The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, 
the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. . . . 
Yet not three incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 37&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Critical response==

[[Virgil Aldrich|Virgil C Aldrich]] reviewed the book alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind'' and ''The Gate of Silence'', also by Stace and published in 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a [[David Hume|Hume]] or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because it is difficult to determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil Aldrich|Aldrich, Virgil C.]] (Jan. 21, 1954). "Book Reviews", ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', 51(2), 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Seelye Bixler|Julius Seelye Bixler]] reviewed the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review he wrote that he believed Stace was trying to have his cake and eat it with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Oct., 1952). "Book Reviews", ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion|The Journal of Bible and Religion]]'', 20(4), 272-274, OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he reviewed ''Time and Eternity'' alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind''. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Jul 1953). "Reviews of Books", ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 62(3), 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace was praised for his clarity and ambitious aims in ''Time and Eternity'' by [[Abraham Kaplan]] who believed the book was one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of [[Samuel Alexander]]. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kaplan|Kaplan, Abraham]] (Oct 1953). "Book Reviews", ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'', 3(3), 1953, 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noting the unachievable ambition of solving the conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost if one were to approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|''Tractatus'']]: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.)&lt;ref&gt;Greenman, Martin A. (Mar. 1953). "Reviews", ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'',13(3), 416-417.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy M. Emmet]] found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmet, Dorothy, M.]] (Jan 1954). "New Books", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', 29(108), 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Maurice Friedman writes about the book in the context of the various attempts to find a universal essence - or [[perennial philosophy]] - within religion. He finds that ''Time and Eternity'' is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by [[Aldous Huxley]] or [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Maurice. (2012) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hnWXeuZN2MoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99 A Heart of Wisdom: Religion and Human Wholeness]'' [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 98-100. {{ISBN|9781438403366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received more positive support however. [[Robert Cummings Neville|Robert C Neville]] called ''Time and Eternity'' “the most sophisticated treatment of eternity and time in our century so far”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cummings Neville|Neville, Robert Cummings]]. (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUYCRhDooAC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236 Eternity and Time's Flow]'', [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 236-237. {{ISBN|9780791415993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Thought: [[A Very Short Introduction]]'', Tim Bayne says the book contains a “classic” discussion of ineffability.&lt;ref&gt;Bayne, Tim. (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIo9QLwjh4C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 Thought: A Very Short Introduction]'' Oxford University Press. p. 121. {{ISBN|9780199601721}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writer Arthur Goldwag has said that the phrase "that than which there is no other" that he encountered in ''Time and Eternity'' was one of a number of factors that contributed to him giving up praying.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwag, Arthur (October 9, 2009) [http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/ ''Confession: Why I Don't Pray'']. Killing the Buddha magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trett''' (or '''tret''') was an allowance made up until the early 19th century, for waste, dust, and other impurity in items in commerce, generally amounting to 4 pounds in each 104 pounds (3.85%).  It fell into disuse because merchants preferred to  simply adjust the price, rather than make a calculation for trett.

==Usage==
Trett was most commonly used in calculating the true weight for imported commodities to Great Britain which would be sold by the pound [[avoirdupois]].  From the gross weight, [[tare weight]] would be deducted, to account for the weight of any container that the commodity was enclosed in.  The remainder was known as the ''suttle''.  Trett was deducted from the suttle at the rate of four pounds for every 104&amp;nbsp;pounds of commodity, to take account of any dust, sand, and other impurity included in the suttle.  The remainder, after trett was deducted, became known as the "neat weight" or "nett weight", a term used in common for commodities in which no trett was to be deducted, but from which tare had been deducted.&lt;ref name = "math"&gt;{{Citation

   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ireland==
Trett varied considerably from the British usage, for goods in Ireland.  For most goods there, trett was deducted at the rate of 1 pound per 112 pounds (0.89%).  However, in Cork, trett was deducted after tare for wool at the rate of 8 pounds per 20 stone (2.86%), and in Dublin 8 pounds per 21 stone (2.72%).  Additionally in Dublin, trett was deducted at the rate of {{convert|2|lb}} per large cask of butter, {{convert|4|lb}} per raw hide, and {{convert|8|lb}} per beef carcasse.&lt;ref name = "math"/&gt;

'''Vrindavan''' ({{audio|Vrindavan.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a town in the [[Mathura district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. It is one of the main locations in the [[Braj|Braj Bhoomi]] region, and is also where, according to [[Hinduism]], [[Lord Krishna]] spent his childhood days. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UP gets first officially designated ‘teerth sthals’ in Vrindavan and Barsana|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-gets-first-officially-designated-teerth-sthals-in-vrindavan-and-barsana/articleshow/61277272.cms|date=27 October 2017|publisher=[[Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town is about 11&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], Krishna's birthplace on the [[Agra]]-[[Delhi]] highway ([[National Highway 2 (India)|NH 2]]).&lt;ref name=route/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keene|first=Henry George|authorlink=Henry George Keene (1826–1915)|title=A Handbook for Visitors to Agra and Its Neighbourhood|url=https://archive.org/stream/ahandbookforvis00keengoog#page/n113/mode/1up|chapter=Bindrabun|date=1899|publisher=Thacker, Spink &amp; Co.|pages=98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town hosts many temples dedicated to the worship of [[Radha]] and Krishna and is considered [[sacred]] by [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 176|editor=K.S.

Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place for [[Vaisnavism]] tradition of [[Hinduism]]. It is a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]] and [[Gokul]] that are associated with Krishna. Millions of devotees of [[Radha Krishna]] visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals.&lt;ref name = kk2007&gt;{{cite book

Vijaypal Baghel, known as GreenMan is promoting, planting and farming Tulsi in mass around the Vrindavan.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu culture and history, and is an important Hindu pilgrimage site since long. 

Of the contemporary times, [[Vallabha|Vallabhacharya]], aged eleven visited Vrindavan. Later on, he performed three pilgrimages of [[India]], barefoot giving discourses on [[Bhagavad Gita]] at 84 places. These 84 places are known as [[Pushtimarg_Baithak|Chaurāsi Baithak]] and since then are the places of pilgrimage. Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan for four months each year. Vrindavan thus heavily influenced his formation of [[Pushtimarg]] 

The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavana, with the purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Lord Sri Krishna's transcendental pastimes. Chaitanya wandered through the different sacred forests of Vrindavan in a spiritual trance of divine love. It was believed that by His divine spiritual power, He was able to locate all the important places of Krishna's pastimes in and around Vrindavan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvtindia.com/history/discovery.htm|title=Discovery of Vrindavan by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mira Bai]] left the kingdom of Mewar and went on pilgrimages. In her last 14 years, Meera lived in a temple called Pracheen Meerabai in Vrindavan. Meera Bai is the most famous female Hindu spiritual poet, whose compositions are still popular throughout North India.

In the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanization, first by local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including [[peacock]]s, [[cattle|cows]], [[monkey]]s and a variety of bird species has been virtually eliminated. A few peacocks are left in the city but monkeys and cows can be seen almost everywhere.

The '''Western Interior Seaway''' (also called the '''Cretaceous Seaway''', the '''Niobraran Sea''', the '''North American Inland Sea''', and the '''Western Interior Sea''') was a large [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] that existed during the mid- to late [[Cretaceous]] period as well as the very early [[Paleogene]], splitting the continent of [[North America]] into two landmasses, [[Laramidia]] to the west and [[Appalachia (Mesozoic)|Appalachia]] to the east. The ancient sea stretched from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and through the middle of the modern-day countries of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], meeting with the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. At its largest, it was {{convert|2500|ft|m}} deep, {{convert|600|mi|km}} wide and over {{convert|2000|mi|km}} long.

==Origin and geology==
[[Image:BrokenConcretion22.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A broken concretion with [[fossils]] inside; late [[Cretaceous]] [[Pierre Shale]] near Ekalaka, [[Montana]].]]

The Seaway was created as the [[Farallon Plate|Farallon]] [[tectonic plate]] subducted under the [[North American Plate]] during the [[Cretaceous]]. As plate convergence proceeded, the younger and more buoyant lithosphere of the Farallon Plate [[Subduction|subducted]] at a shallow angle, in what is known as a "[[flat-slab subduction|flat slab]]". This shallowly subducting slab exerted traction on the base of the [[lithosphere]], pulling it down and producing [[dynamic topography]] at the surface that caused the opening of the Western Interior Seaway.&lt;ref name=Mitrovica1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitrovica|first1=J. X. |last2=Beaumont |first2=C. |last3=Jarvis |first3=G. T. |title=Tilting of continental interiors by the dynamical effects of subduction |journal=Tectonics |volume=8 |pages=1079 |year=1989 |doi=10.1029/TC008i005p01079 |bibcode = 1989Tecto...8.1079M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This depression and the high [[eustatic sea level]]s existing during the Cretaceous allowed waters from the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in the south to meet and flood the central lowlands, forming a sea that [[marine transgression|transgressed]] (grew) and regressed (receded) over the course of the Cretaceous.

The earliest phase of the Seaway began in the mid-Cretaceous when an arm of the Arctic Ocean transgressed south over western North America; this formed the Mowry Sea, so named for the [[Mowry or Thermopolis Shale|Mowry Shale]], an organic-rich rock [[Geologic formation|formation]].&lt;ref name=stanley/&gt; In the south, the Gulf of Mexico was an extension of the [[Tethys Sea]], which met with the Mowry Sea in the late Cretaceous, forming the "complete" Seaway.&lt;ref name=stanley/&gt; 

At its largest, the Western Interior Seaway stretched from the Rockies east to the [[Appalachians]], some {{Convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} wide. At its deepest, it may have been only {{Convert|800|or|900|m}} deep, shallow in terms of seas. Two great continental watersheds drained into it from east and west, diluting its waters and bringing resources in eroded [[silt]] that formed shifting delta systems along its low-lying coasts. There was little [[sediment]]ation on the eastern shores of the Seaway; the western boundary, however, consisted of a thick [[clastic wedge]] eroded eastward from the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier orogenic belt]].&lt;ref name=stanley/&gt;&lt;ref name=monroe&gt;{{cite book|last=Monroe |first=James S. |title=The Changing Earth: Exploring Geology and Evolution |year=2009 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |isbn=0495554804 |page=605 |edition=5th |author2=Wicander, Reed }}&lt;/ref&gt; The western shore was thus highly variable, depending on variations in [[sea level]] and sediment supply.&lt;ref name=stanley/&gt;

[[File:Monument rocks view.jpg|thumb| left| Monument Rocks, located 25 miles south of [[Oakley, Kansas]].]] Widespread [[carbonate]] deposition suggests that the Seaway was warm and tropical, with abundant calcareous [[algae]].&lt;ref name="oceansofkansas1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oceans of Kansas Paleontology |publisher=Mike Everhart |url=http://www.oceansofkansas.com/index2.html |accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of these deposits are found throughout the state of Kansas. One prominent example is [[Monument Rocks (Kansas)|Monument Rocks]], an exposed chalk formation towering {{Convert|70|ft}} over the surrounding range land. It is designated a [[National Natural Landmark]] and one of the Eight Wonders of Kansas. It is located {{Convert|25|mi}} south of Oakley, Kansas. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansastravel.org/monumentrocks.htm|title=Monument Rocks, the Chalk Pyramids - Kansas|first=Keith|last=Stokes|date=|website=www.kansastravel.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a few times during the late Cretaceous the Western Interior Seaway went through periods of [[Western Interior Seaway anoxia|anoxia]], where the bottom water was devoid of oxygen and the water column was stratified.

At the end of the Cretaceous, a continuing uplift in a mountain-building episode called the [[Laramide orogeny]] hoisted the sandbanks (sandstone) and muddy brackish lagoons (shale) – the thick sequences of silt and sandstone still seen today as the [[Laramie Formation]] – while low-lying basins between them gradually subsided. The Western Interior Seaway divided across the Dakotas and retreated south towards the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  This shrunken, regressive phase of the Western Interior Seaway is sometimes called the '''Pierre Seaway'''.&lt;ref name=stanley&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanley |first=Steven M. |title=Earth System History |location=New York |publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company |year=1999 |isbn=0-7167-2882-6 |pages=487–489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early [[Paleocene]], parts of the Western Interior Seaway (marine waters) still occupied areas of the [[Mississippi Embayment]], submerging the site of present-day [[Memphis, TN|Memphis]]. Later transgression, however, was associated with the Cenozoic [[Tejas sequence]], rather than with the previous event responsible for the Seaway.

The Western Interior Seaway was a shallow sea, filled with abundant marine life. Interior Seaway denizens included predatory marine [[reptile]]s such as [[plesiosaurs]], and [[mosasaur]]s that grew up to {{Convert|18|m}} long.  Other marine life included [[shark]]s such as ''[[Squalicorax]]'' and the giant shellfish-eating ''[[Ptychodus mortoni]]'' (believed to be {{Convert|10|m}}&amp;nbsp;long);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker |first=Matt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8530000/8530995.stm |title=Giant predatory shark fossil unearthed in Kansas |newspaper=BBC Earth News |date=24 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advanced bony fish including ''[[Pachyrhizodus]]'', ''[[Enchodus]]'', and also the massive {{Convert|5|m|adj=on}} long ''[[Xiphactinus]]'' – a fish larger than any modern bony fish. Other sea life included [[invertebrate]]s such as [[mollusks]], [[ammonites]], squid-like [[Belemnitida|belemnites]], and [[plankton]] including [[coccolithophore]]s that secreted the chalky platelets that give the Cretaceous its name, [[foraminifera]]ns and [[radiolarian]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Western Interior Seaway was home to early [[Aves|birds]] also, including the flightless ''[[Hesperornis]]'' which had stout legs for swimming through water and tiny wings used for marine steering rather than flight; and the [[tern]]-like ''[[Ichthyornis]]'', an early avian with a toothy beak. ''Icthyornis'' shared the sky with large [[pterosaur]]s such as ''[[Nyctosaurus]]'' and ''[[Pteranodon]]''. ''Pteranodon'' fossils are very common and it was probably a major component of the surface ecosystem, though it was found in only the southern reaches of the Seaway.&lt;ref name=bennett1994niobrara&gt;Benton, S.C. (1994). "The Pterosaurs of the Niobrara Chalk." ''The Earth Scientist'', '''11'''(1): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the bottom, the giant clam ''[[Inoceramus]]'' left common fossilized shells in the [[Pierre Shale]]. This clam had a thick shell paved with "prisms" of calcite deposited perpendicular to the surface, giving it a pearly luster in life.  Paleontologists suggest that its giant size was an adaptation for life in the murky bottom waters, where a correspondingly large gill area would have allowed the animal to cope with oxygen-depleted waters.
