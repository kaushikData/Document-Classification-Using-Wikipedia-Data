The '''[[1972–73 NHL season|1972–73]] [[California Golden Seals]] season''' was the California Golden Seals' sixth [[Season (sports)|season]] in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

The '''1983 Israel Super Cup''' was the 13th [[Israel Super Cup]] (18th, including unofficial matches, as the competition wasn't played within the [[Israel Football Association]] in its first 5 editions, until 1969), an annual Israel football match played between the winners of the previous season's [[Liga Leumit|Top Division]] and [[Israel State Cup]].

The match was played between [[Maccabi Netanya F.C.|Maccabi Netanya]], champions of the [[1982–83 Liga Leumit]] and [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]], winners of the [[1982–83 Israel State Cup]].

This was Maccabi Netanya's 5th Israel Super Cup appearance and Hapoel Tel Aviv's 6th (including unofficial matches). At the match, played at [[Ramat Gan Stadium]], Maccabi Netanya won 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/israsupcuphist.html Israel - List of 'Champions of Champions' (Super Cup) Finals] Yaniv Bleicher, 3 July 2008, RSSSF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhpress.nli.org.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TAUHe&amp;BaseHref=DAV/1983/06/15&amp;PageLabelPrint=4&amp;EntityId=Ar00410&amp;ViewMode=HTML Benny Lam Awarded Netanya the Champion of Champions Cup]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Moshe Cohen, Davar, 15 June 1983, Historical Jewish Press {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''61*''''' is a 2001 American [[sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written by [[Hank Steinberg]] and directed by [[Billy Crystal]]. It stars [[Barry Pepper]] as [[Roger Maris]] and [[Thomas Jane]] as [[Mickey Mantle]] on their quest to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s 1927 [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record|single-season home run record]] of 60 during the [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961 season]] of the [[1961 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. The film first aired on [[HBO]] on April 28, 2001.

==Plot==
In 1998, the family of the late Roger Maris goes to [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] to witness [[Mark McGwire]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] break their father's record with a 62nd home run. Maris' widow, Pat, is hospitalized due to complications from arrhythmia and watches the game on television from a hospital bed.

Decades earlier in 1961, Maris is presented with the Most Valuable Player award for the 1960 baseball season, but Mickey Mantle remains the [[New York Yankees]]' superstar. Mantle starts off hot while Maris struggles. Maris suspects he may be traded, but new manager [[Ralph Houk]] has Mantle and Maris switch places in the Yankees' batting order to see if it helps. It does, and Maris begins to hit home runs at a record pace. Mantle keeps pace and it becomes clear that both "[[M&amp;M Boys]]" will make a run at [[Babe Ruth]]'s record of 60 homers in one season.

Mickey's life off the field is taking a toll on his playing. He drinks, enjoys the Manhattan nightlife and arrives at the ballpark hung over. More than once, pitcher [[Whitey Ford]] has to bail him out or sober him up. To keep Mantle out of trouble, Maris and teammate/roommate [[Bob Cerv]] invite him to move in with them in a modest home in Queens, with one condition: no women.

New York's fans and media pull for the popular and personable Mantle, a long-time Yankee. The quieter Maris is viewed as an outsider, aloof and unworthy. As the two men close in on the record, [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|MLB Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]], who was Babe Ruth's ghostwriter, makes a decision: unless the record is broken in 154 games (the same number Ruth played in 1927), the new record would be listed separately from Ruth's record, because MLB has just begun using a new 162-game season.

It appears Mantle is not going to make it; his health deteriorates and he plays in constant pain. Maris, meanwhile, is unaccustomed to such a high level of public scrutiny and is uncomfortable interacting with the media, who dissect and distort everything he says or does. The fans heckle Maris and even throw objects at him on the field. Soon he begins receiving hate mail and death threats. His wife lives far from New York, usually available only by phone. The stress becomes so intense that Maris' hair begins to fall out in clumps. The Yankees owner also tries to favor Mantle by asking Houk to switch Mantle and Maris in the batting order, but Houk refuses, because the redesigned lineup has been winning a higher percentage of games.

Chronic injury and alcohol abuse catch up with Mantle, and an ill-advised injection by a doctor infects his hip and lands him in a hospital bed. With Mantle gone from the lineup, the stage becomes set for Maris. He fails to break the record in the 154th game of the season, but he does finally hit the record-breaking 61st home run during the final game of the season.

==Filming locations==
Most of the baseball action scenes, including those set at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], were actually filmed at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. A combination of strategic photographing and post-production effects were used to enhance the illusion of the "classic" layout of Yankee Stadium. Tiger Stadium was credited as "playing" Yankee Stadium in the closing credits. Tiger Stadium also "played itself" as the home of the Tigers when the Yankees played them in Detroit.

The shots depicting [[Fenway Park]] and [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore's Memorial Stadium]] were shot at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 80% out of 15 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/61/ 61*] - [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Flixter]]. Retrieved June 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Richard Roeper]] named ''61*'' one of his top five all-time favorite baseball movies{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. In 2002, actor Barry Pepper was a Golden Globe nominee for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250934/awards|title=61*|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors==
In the beginning of the film, [[Bob Cerv]] was seen with the Yankees on Opening Day. In reality, Cerv was a member of the [[Los Angeles Angels]] until May and then was traded to the Yankees.

Also on opening day, the broadcast announcer refers to the opposing [[Minnesota Twins]] pitcher as [[Camilo Pascual]].  In fact, the Twins' pitcher that day was [[Pedro Ramos]], who would later distinguish himself as a reliever for the Yankees.  As the Twins are warming up, two players, wearing numbers 2 ([[Zoilo Versalles]]) and 7 ([[Lenny Green]]) are seen.  In the film, number 7 for the Twins throws right-handed and appears to be Caucasian.  In fact, Green, who started in center field opening day for the Twins, is an African-American who batted and threw left-handed.

In his 2013 memoir, ''Still Foolin' 'Em'', Billy Crystal recounts how before it aired on HBO, the film was shown at the [[White House]] for a small audience that included President [[George W. Bush]], who once owned baseball's [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. A home run in the film, depicted as being hit off pitcher [[Frank Lary]], was actually hit off left-hander [[Hank Aguirre]], which the President pointed out to Crystal. Lary gave up Maris' 52nd and 57th homers of that 1961 season, but the one in question (his 53rd) did indeed come against Aguirre.

'''AFL Dream Team''' is an online [[Australian rules football]] based [[Fantasy football (Australian rules football)|fantasy football]] game that was created in 2001 by [[Vapormedia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/small-business/growing/fantasy-sports-enjoy-very-real-growth-20120327-1vvvd.html|title=Fantasy sports enjoy very real growth|date=27 March 2012|first=Adam|last=Cooper|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) and [[Toyota]].  Participants assemble an imaginary team of real life players, limited by a [[salary cap]], and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance on the field of play throughout the AFL home-and-away season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the second most popular Australian rules football fantasy game behind [[News Corporation]]'s [[AFL SuperCoach|Supercoach]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/clash-over-fantasy-football/story-e6frg996-1225697028039|title=Rivals scramble for fantasy football dollars |first=Simon |last=Canning |work=The Australian |date=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is similar to an offline based game of the same name that was run in the 1990s by [[The Age]] newspaper in Melbourne.

==Point scoring==
Points are gained or deducted depending on the performances of your 22 players for each round. Up to four emergencies can replace players in your starting 22, who didn't play that specific round. If you have a 0 scoring player in a certain position and don't have an emergency selected in that position, you'll not score any points for that player. You can choose who on the reserves list you'll use as an emergency. Meanwhile, the remaining five substitutes on your reserves list don't score, but can increase in value.  Each week up to two trades can be made but if there are bye rounds that happen in generally round 10-14, you are given 3 trades a week.

Points are awarded for the following achievements.

* '''Kick''' = 3 Points
* '''Handball''' = 2 Points
* '''Mark''' = 3 Points
* '''Tackle''' = 4 Points
* '''Free Kick For''' = 1 Point
* '''Free Kick Against''' = -3 Points
* '''Hitout''' = 1 Point
* '''Goal''' = 6 Points
* '''Behind''' = 1 Point

==2016 Season Points Leaders==

In 2016 the point leaders were again dominated by midfielders like they are in most years.

'''Allison "Al" Danzig''' (27 February 1898 – 27 January 1987) was an American [[sportswriter]] who specialized in writing about [[tennis]], but also covered [[college football]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], many [[Olympic Games]], and [[sport rowing|rowing]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news| last = Flint| first = Peter B.| title = Allison Danzig, 88, Times Writer, Dies| pages = 26, Sec. D| publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = 1987-01-28 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/28/obituaries/allison-danzig-88-times-writer-dies.html | accessdate = 2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danzig was the only American sportswriter to extensively cover [[real tennis]], the precursor to modern [[lawn tennis]].&lt;ref name=Fame&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Famers – Allison Danzig|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/allison-danzig|website=www.tennisfame.com|publisher=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danzig covered every tournament in the Grand Slam - the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], the [[Australian Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], and the [[French Open]] - as well as many others. In 1968, Danzig was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] -  becoming the first [[journalist]] in the Hall.&lt;ref name=Fame/&gt; In an interview shortly before his death, he named [[Bill Tilden]] as the greatest player he had covered.

==Biography==
Danzig was born in 1898 in [[Waco, Texas]], but grew up in [[Albany, New York]]. Talent ran in the family. His sister, [[Evelyn Danzig]], wrote the music for the hit song [[Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)|"Scarlet Ribbons"]] in 1949.

He graduated in 1921 from [[Cornell University]], where he was co-editor of ''The Daily Sun'' with [[E.B. White]]. Danzig also briefly played football at Cornell while weighing just 125-pounds.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He joined ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1923, after a stint at the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'', and remained there until his retirement in 1968.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Before becoming a sportswriter, Danzig wrote [[obituaries]], and was originally planning for a career as a [[foreign correspondent]].

Danzig wrote several books, including: ''The Racquet Game'' ([[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] 1930), a history of racquet sports; ''The Fireside Book of Tennis'' ([[Simon &amp; Schuster]] 1972); and ''Oh, How They Played The Game'' (Macmillan 1971), about the early days of [[American football]]. A critic at ''The New York Times'' called his book ''History of American Football: Its Great Teams, Players and Coaches'' (1956) "without doubt, the most ambitious and best book ever published on the subject of college football."&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His last book, ''The Winning Gallery'', was a collection of articles and essays about real tennis, which was published by the [[United States Court Tennis Association]] (USCTA).&lt;ref&gt;Allison Danzig, ''The Winning Gallery'' (USCTA 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited with coining the term "Grand Slam" as well as the term "ace" to describe a serve in which the opposing player fails to get their racket on the ball.{{Fact|date=October 2018}}

He lived most of his adult life in [[Roslyn, New York]], with his wife, two daughters, and one son. 
He retired to [[New Jersey]], where he died on 27 January 1987.

==Legacy==
While it was reported in 2008 that almost all of the Olympic venues utilized for the 2004 games, including certain facilities in the Sports Complex such as the velodrome and tennis center, have fallen into varying states of dereliction or disrepair, all of the facilities in the Athens Olympic Sports Complex are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Malone |first=Andrew |title=Abandoned, derelict, covered in graffiti and rubbish: what is left of Athens' £9billion Olympic 'glory' |publisher=The Daily Mail |date=2008-07-18 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1036373/Abandoned-derelict-covered-graffiti-rubbish-What-left-Athens-9billion-Olympic-glory.html |accessdate=2008-08-25| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101122073944/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article%2D1036373/Abandoned%2Dderelict%2Dcovered%2Dgraffiti%2Drubbish%2DWhat%2Dleft%2DAthens%2D9billion%2DOlympic%2Dglory.html| archivedate= 22 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/features/after-the-party-what-happens-when-the-olympics-leave-town-901629.html |title=After The Party: What happens when the Olympics leave town |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date= 2008-08-19|accessdate=2009-05-16 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906182231/http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/features/after-the-party-what-happens-when-the-olympics-leave-town-901629.html| archivedate=September 6, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
Prestatyn moved to their present site in 1969 when their previous ground at the rear of  the Central Beach Club (the large [[public house]] that can be seen directly opposite the ground) was sold off for development.
For many years the new ground was relatively undeveloped with the only building being the dressing room block which for its time was modern and well-equipped with spacious dressing rooms, a tea bar and storage rooms - but the rest of the ground fell some way short.
The pitch was just roped off and access was from Bastion Gardens as it is to this day. No other spectator facilities were available and low crowds reflected the spartan surroundings in the dead of winter but early and late season games in the warmer weather often saw gates top the 100 mark.

Plans to build a 250-seated stand over the dressing room block were drawn up but the scheme was costly and never came to fruition. A lean-to cover was added to the building in the late 1970s to afford spectators some shelter from the [[Weather|elements]]. In the mid-1980s another set of plans were drawn up to build a covered enclosure but again, this never came to fruition.
Thus the scene remained virtually unchanged until the 1992/3 close season when, after being elected to the Welsh Alliance League as runners-up to St Asaph City, a post and rail was erected around the pitch along with brick built dugouts.

This work was initiated by club stalwart Henry Porter and then chairman Glyn Breeze Jones and part of the labour was carried out by [[community service]] [[Crime|offenders]].
In the mid-1990s old bus shelters were acquired from Prestatyn Town Council after the main bus station in the town centre was modernised and these were put up on the cricket field side of the ground which although something of an [[eyesore]], offered adequate protection from the rain and gave the ground a more `enclosed` feel.
In 1995 the committee decided that in-house bar facilities were needed and with the help of a  loan from Prestatyn Town Council, the building was extended towards the cricket field and a small bar installed and gave the club its first proper base for meetings.

It was officially opened for a match against a [[Manchester United]] XI in July 1995 which the Red Devils won 5-0 in front of a record attendance for a Prestatyn game of 3,200.
When incoming chairman Steve Jones took over the helm in 2004/5, he took the project to new heights and added on the new bar area as well as demolishing the bus shelters and replacing them with a new more modern stand which provided seating for 200 and covered standing for another 150.
At the same time the entrance was fenced off and a [[turnstile]] built with hard standing laid all around the pitch. The dressing rooms and kitchen area were also redeveloped and extensive landscaping work carried out.
But the biggest changes came in the summer of 2008 when, having clinched promotion to the Welsh Premier League, the committee and volunteers were left with just eight days to bring the ground up to the required criteria.

The club's original application was due to be heard in March but was deferred until 23 April. The deadline to meet the criteria was 1 May.
At the meeting of Denbighshire County Council at Ruthin on the 23rd, the application was heard at 10am and passed through 'on the nod' in record time, by five past ten chairman Tony Thackeray had phoned the good news to the ground and by ten past the workmen were hard at it, digging footings for lights and laying concrete bases for the new seats.
In just eight days the floodlights were put up and working, a turnstile block was built, 200 extra seats were installed, a press box went up, the referee's changing accommodation was revamped and the whole ground was tidied up and painted. The then Welsh Premier League Secretary John Deakin came to inspect the work and passed the ground as fit for promotion.

In order to meet the new higher criteria when the Welsh Premier League's format changed to the Super 12 in 2010/11, Prestatyn were required to build further spectator accommodation, improve car parking facilities, provide more hard standing, enlarge the dressing rooms and create more turnstile entrances. The Seasiders carried out ongoing work throughout their inaugural WPL season, paying for it as and when funds allowed.
At Christmas 2008, the open seats were covered and in March 2009 a further 60 seats were added and covered which meant Bastion Gardens had the requisite 500 seating capacity to comply with the FAW Domestic Licence. For the big Bank Holiday derby on Easter Monday 2009, the old pay hut which had stood at the clubhouse end was given a makeover and installed at the top of the ground where a new walkway and railing were also added.

In early 2009 plans were submitted to Denbighshire Council for another 500 seat stand behind the top goal and a brick built facility to house the boardroom, club shop, tea bar, a toilet and stores. In spring 2009 the club were awarded a grant of £8,500 towards the cost of installing a concrete panel fence along the whole of the Bastion Gardens side and across the top end of the ever-improving stadium.
On 29 July 2009, Denbighshire's planning committee unanimously approved submissions for the new stand - which would also contain a refreshment bar, additional toilets and disabled seating - behind the 'top' goal as well as a combined TV gantry and interview area plus a police control room on the Bastion Gardens side.
Coming on the back of earlier approval for the utility building and an extension to the dressing rooms and covered terracing/seating at the Clubhouse end, the Seasiders now had the requisite permission to build all the facilities they needed to meet the Domestic Licence and also the UEFA Licence in due course.

The latter half of 2009 saw the club striving to attain Super 12 status and while manager Neil Gibson made improvements to his squad in order to compete on the pitch, off the field the committee began planning the necessary grant applications that would enable them to upgrade the facilities.

In January 2010 after a two-month delay, the Welsh Grounds Improvements Trust awarded them just short of £32,000 to build a new medical room, extend the dressing rooms to meet the new criteria, lay down concrete over the grassed areas in front of the clubhouse and build a new TV gantry and police control room. In addition a spacious disabled area was also built which provided covered accommodation for six spectators and their carers if needed, all sited within easy reach of the club's facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seasidersattic.co.uk/our-ground.php  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530095630/http://www.seasidersattic.co.uk/our-ground.php |date=30 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beanibazar Sporting Club''' is a Bangladeshi [[football]] club from [[Beanibazar]], [[Sylhet]].

==History==

Beanibazar Sporting Club was formed in 2009 as a professional football club to take part in the [[Bangladesh League|Bangladesh Premier League]]. In 2009–10 season, however, it relegated along with [[Sukhtara Jubo Sangsad|Sukhtara Sangsad]], a sport club from [[Narayanganj]]. Later it joined [[Bangladesh Championship League]], the 2nd tier league in Bangladesh. It is one of the powerful football club in Sylhet.

==The club's name==
There is much confusion with the club's name in the Bangladeshi media. Various channels and websites mention various names of the club's name, e.g. Beanibazar, Biyanibazar, Biyanibazar FC, Biyanibazar Sporting Club. Although the club's website names it "Beanibazar Sporting Club" &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title =Club's Official website | url =http://www.beanibazarsc.ewebsite.com | access-date =2018-11-04 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110710210621/http://www.beanibazarsc.ewebsite.com/ | archive-date =2011-07-10 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides no information on it.

[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a bodyline ball]]

'''Bodyline''', also known as '''fast leg theory bowling''', was a [[cricket]]ing tactic devised by the [[English cricket team]] for their [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932–33|1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia]], specifically to combat the extraordinary [[batting (cricket)|batting]] skill of Australia's [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]]. A bodyline delivery was one where the [[cricket ball]] was [[Bowling (cricket)|bowled]] at the body of the [[batsman]], in the hope that when he defended himself with his [[cricket bat|bat]], a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several [[fielding (cricket)|fielders]] standing close by.

The tactic was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, to the point of being unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umpires.tv/courses/courses_umpiring_descriptions.html Unit 2&amp;nbsp;– Managing the Match: Management issues and umpiring]. International Institute of Cricket Umpiring and Scoring. Retrieved 2 September 2018. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154646/http://www.umpires.tv/courses/courses_umpiring_descriptions.html |date=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England's use of a tactic perceived by some as overly aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries before the situation was calmed.

Although no serious injuries arose from any [[Bouncer (cricket)|short-pitched deliveries]] while a [[leg theory]] field was actually set, the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling between the two teams, particularly when Australian batsmen suffered actual injuries in separate incidents, which inflamed the watching crowds. The controversy eventually spilled into the diplomatic arena.

Short-pitched bowling continues to be permitted in cricket, even when aimed at the batsman. However, over time, several of the [[Laws of Cricket]] were changed to render the bodyline tactic less effective.

==Definition and origin of the term==
Bodyline was a tactic devised for and primarily used in the [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series between [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932–33|England and Australia in 1932—33]]. The tactic involved bowling at [[Stump (cricket)|leg stump]] or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at the body of a batsman standing in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the [[leg side]] would catch any defensive deflections from the bat.&lt;ref name=D103/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Greig|title=Bodyline: 80 years of cricket's greatest controversy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-21013615|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|pull and hook shots]] could be caught on the edge of the field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.&lt;ref name=pi130/&gt;&lt;ref name=h70/&gt;&lt;ref name=c171/&gt;

Bodyline bowling was intimidatory,&lt;ref name=D103&gt;Douglas, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely designed as an attempt to curb the prolific scoring of [[Donald Bradman]],&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 86, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; although other prolific Australian batsmen such as [[Bill Woodfull]], [[Bill Ponsford]] and [[Alan Kippax]] were also targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different terms were used to describe this style of bowling before the name "bodyline" was used. Among the first to use it was the writer and former Australian Test cricketer [[Jack Worrall]]; in the match between the English team and an Australian XI, when bodyline was first used in full, he referred to "half-pitched slingers on the body line" and first used it in print after the first Test.  Other writers used a similar phrase around this time, but the first use of "bodyline" in print seems to have been by the journalist [[Hugh Buggy]] in the Melbourne [[The Herald (Melbourne)|''Herald'']], in his report on the first day's play of the first Test.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==
===Leg theory bowling===
In the 19th century, most cricketers considered it unsportsmanlike to bowl the ball at the leg stump or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by the early years of the 20th century, some bowlers, usually [[Spin bowling|slow]] or [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|medium-paced]], used [[leg theory]] as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke.&lt;ref name=F22-23/&gt; Two English left-arm bowlers, [[George Hirst]] in 1903—04 and [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia;&lt;ref name="Frith, pp. 18–19"&gt;Frith, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warwick Armstrong]] used it regularly for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in [[county cricket]].&lt;ref name=F22-23&gt;Frith, p. 22—23.&lt;/ref&gt;

When cricket resumed after the war, few bowlers maintained the tactic, which was unpopular with spectators owing to its negativity. [[Fred Root]], the [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] bowler, used it regularly and with considerable success in county cricket. Root later defended the use of leg theory—and Bodyline—observing that when bowlers bowled outside off stump, the batsmen were able to let the ball pass them without playing a shot.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fast bowlers experimented with leg theory prior to 1932, sometimes accompanying the tactic with [[Bouncer (cricket)|short-pitched bowling]]. In 1925, Australian [[John Scott (Australian cricketer, born 1888)|Jack Scott]] first bowled a form of what would later have been called bodyline in a state match for New South Wales; his captain [[Herbie Collins]] disliked it and would not let him use it again. Other Australian captains were less particular, including [[Vic Richardson]] who let Scott use those tactics when he moved to South Australia. He repeated them against the MCC in 1928–29.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fr29&gt;Frith, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1927 English cricket season|1927]], in a Test trial match, [[Edward Clark (cricketer)|"Nobby" Clark]] bowled short to a leg-trap (a cluster of fielders placed close on the leg side). He was representing England in a side captained by [[Douglas Jardine]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928–29, [[Harry Alexander (cricketer)|Harry Alexander]] bowled fast leg theory at an England team,&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harold Larwood]] briefly used a similar tactic on that same tour in two Test matches.&lt;ref name=Fr29/&gt; [[Freddie Calthorpe]], the England captain, criticised [[Learie Constantine]]'s use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field in a Test match in 1930;&lt;ref&gt;Howat (1976), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; one such ball struck [[Andy Sandham]], but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a complaint from the England team.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Bradman===
The [[Australian cricket team]] toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-[[Test cricket|Test]] series 2–1,&lt;ref name="auslist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru—Australia—Tests—Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Bradman]] scored 974 [[run (cricket)|runs]] at a [[batting average]] of 139.14, an aggregate record that still stands in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records: Test matches: Batting records: Most runs in a series|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/wi/content/records/282849.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p133"&gt;Perry, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman's average hovered around 100, approximately twice that of all other world-class batsmen.&lt;ref name=brad&gt;Cashman, pp. 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pi130&gt;Piesse, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The English cricket authorities felt that new tactics would be required to prevent Bradman being even more successful on Australian pitches;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; some critics believed that Bradman could be dismissed by [[Leg spin|leg-spin]] as [[Walter Robins]] and [[Ian Peebles]] had supposedly caused him problems; two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, the idea developed that Bradman was vulnerable to pace bowling. In the final Test of the 1930 Ashes series, while he was batting, the pitch became briefly difficult following rain. Bradman was seen to be uncomfortable facing deliveries which bounced higher than usual at a faster pace, being seen to step back out of the line of the ball. Former England player and Surrey captain [[Percy Fender]] was one who noticed, and the incident was much discussed by cricketers. Given that Bradman scored 232, it was not initially thought that a way to curb his prodigious scoring had been found.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Do111&gt;Douglas, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; When Douglas Jardine later saw film footage of the Oval incident and noticed Bradman's discomfort, according to his daughter he shouted, "I've got it! He's yellow!"&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Bradman's vulnerability developed when Fender received correspondence from Australia in 1932, describing how Australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off side to play the ball on the on side. Fender showed these letters to Jardine when it became clear that he was to captain the English team in Australia during the 1932–33 tour, and he also discussed Bradman's discomfort at the Oval.&lt;ref name=Do111/&gt; It was also known in England that Bradman was dismissed for a four-ball [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] by fast bowler [[Eddie Gilbert (cricketer)|Eddie Gilbert]], and looked very uncomfortable. Bradman had also appeared uncomfortable against the pace of [[Sandy Bell]] in his innings of 299 not out at the [[Adelaide Oval]] in [[South African cricket team in Australia in 1931–32|South Africa's tour of Australia]] earlier in 1932, when the desperate bowler decided to bowl short to him, and fellow South African [[Herbie Taylor]], according to [[Jack Fingleton]], may have mentioned this to English cricketers in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 39–40; p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fender felt Bradman might be vulnerable to fast, short-pitched deliveries on the line of leg stump.&lt;ref name="p135"&gt;Perry, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p244"&gt;Pollard, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine felt that Bradman was afraid to stand his ground against intimidatory bowling, citing instances in 1930 when he shuffled about, contrary to orthodox batting technique.&lt;ref name=pi130/&gt;&lt;ref name=h70&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Douglas Jardine===
[[File:Douglas Jardine Cigarette Card.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Douglas Jardine]] was England's captain during the 1932–33 series.| alt=A head shot of a man.]]
Jardine's first experience against Australia came when he scored an unbeaten 96 to secure a draw against the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1921|1921 Australian touring side]] for [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]]. The tourists were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred,&lt;ref name=fingo81&gt;Fingleton (1981), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; but had tried to help him with some easy bowling. There has been speculation that this incident helped develop Jardine's antipathy towards Australians, although Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas denies this.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine's attitude towards Australia hardened after [[English cricket team in Australia in 1928-29|he toured the country in 1928–29]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; When he scored three consecutive hundreds in the early games, he was frequently jeered by the crowd for slow play; the Australian spectators took an increasing dislike to him, mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear—a Harlequin cap that was given to successful Oxford cricketers.&lt;ref name=F71/&gt; Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators; his general demeanour drew one comment of "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?"&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton (1981), pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage Jardine had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century at the start of the tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to [[Hunter Hendry]] that "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob".&lt;ref name=F71&gt;Frith, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; After the innings, when teammate [[Patsy Hendren]] remarked that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied "It's fucking mutual".&lt;ref name=F71/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour, Jardine fielded next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked for his awkward fielding, particularly when chasing the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.&lt;ref name=F71/&gt;

Jardine was appointed captain of England for the 1931 season, replacing [[Percy Chapman]] who had led the team in 1930. He defeated [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] in his first series, but opinion was divided as to how effective he had been.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, he led England again and was appointed to lead the team to tour Australia for the 1932–33 Ashes series.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting was arranged between Jardine, [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] captain [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]] and his two [[fast bowling|fast bowler]]s [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]] at London's [[Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel|Piccadilly Hotel]] to discuss a plan to combat Bradman.&lt;ref name="p134"&gt;Perry, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl on leg stump and make the ball rise into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed they could, and that it might prove effective.&lt;ref name="p135"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p242"&gt;Pollard, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine also visited Frank Foster to discuss his field-placing in Australia in 1911–12.&lt;ref name="Frith, pp. 18–19"/&gt;

Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the [[1932 English cricket season|1932 season]] with varying but increasing success and several injuries to batsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 113–117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Farnes]] experimented with short-pitched, leg-theory bowling but was not selected for the tour. [[Bill Bowes]] also used short-pitched bowling, notably against [[Jack Hobbs]].&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early development on tour===
The England team which toured Australia in 1932–33 contained four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers; such a heavy concentration on pace was unusual at the time, and drew comment from the Australian press and players, including Bradman.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; On the journey, Jardine instructed his team on how to approach the tour and discussed tactics with several players, including Larwood;&lt;ref name="journey"/&gt; at this stage, he seems to have settled on [[leg theory]], if not full bodyline, as his main tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some players later reported that he told them to hate the Australians in order to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as "the little bastard."&lt;ref name="journey"&gt;Frith, pp. 61, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, Jardine quickly alienated the press and crowds through his manner and approach.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 69, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=D126&gt;Douglas, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early matches, although there were instances of the English bowlers pitching the ball short and causing problems with their pace, full bodyline tactics were not used.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 79–94.&lt;/ref&gt; There had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine.&lt;ref name=D126/&gt; The English tactics changed in a game against an Australian XI team at Melbourne in mid-November, when full bodyline tactics were deployed for the first time.&lt;ref name=ha344&gt;Harte, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p249"&gt;Pollard, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine had left himself out of the English side, which was led instead by [[Bob Wyatt]] who later wrote that the team experimented with a diluted form of bodyline bowling. He reported to Jardine that Bradman, who was playing for the opposition, seemed uncomfortable against the bowling tactics of Larwood, Voce and Bowes. The crowd, press and Australian players were shocked by what they experienced and believed that the bowlers were targeting the batsmen's heads. Bradman adopted unorthodox tactics—ducking, weaving and moving around the [[Crease (cricket)|crease]]—which did not meet with universal approval from Australians and he scored just 36 and 13 in the match.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 94–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tactic continued to be used in the next game by Voce (Larwood and Bowes did not play in this game), against [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]], for whom [[Jack Fingleton]] made a century and received several blows in the process. Bradman again failed twice, and had scored just 103 runs in six innings against the touring team; many Australian fans were now worried by Bradman's form.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 99–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Jardine wrote to tell Fender that his information about the Australian batting technique was correct and that it meant he was having to move more and more fielders onto the leg side: "if this goes on I shall have to move the whole bloody lot to the leg side."&lt;ref name="Frith, p. 105"&gt;Frith, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were ethically wrong. But at this stage, not everyone was opposed,&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over bodyline as the tour progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner hated bodyline but would not speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side,&lt;ref&gt;Growden, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly after expressing sentiments at the start of the tour that cricket "has become a synonym for all that is true and honest. To say 'that is not cricket' implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm."&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First two Test matches===

Cables briefly describing each day's play were sent by reporters to England, where they were turned into scripts for broadcast.| alt=Photograph shows telegrams describing the events of the first day of the second test.]]

Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain [[Monty Noble]] praised the English bowling.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least by members of his own side such as [[Vic Richardson]], or to include pace bowlers such as [[Eddie Gilbert (cricketer)|Eddie Gilbert]] or [[Laurie Nash]] to match the aggression of the opposition.&lt;ref name=w132/&gt;&lt;ref name=w132&gt;Whitington and Hele, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; But Woodfull refused to consider doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Haigh | first = Gideon | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/316110.html| title = Gideon Haigh on Bodyline: A tactic of its time| date = 22 October 2007 |publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate = 1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colman, pp. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; He had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ha346&gt;Harte, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Test match===
{{Main|Adelaide leak}}
The controversy reached its peak during the [[Third Test, 1932–33 Ashes series|Third Test]] at Adelaide. On the second day, a Saturday, before a crowd of 50,962 spectators,&lt;ref name=ha346/&gt;&lt;ref name="h73"&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia bowled out England who had batted through the first day. In the third over of the Australian innings, Larwood bowled to Woodfull. The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head and the final ball, delivered short on the line of [[Stump (cricket)#Part of the wicket|middle stump]], struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest, bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: "Well bowled, Harold!" Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, who was also batting at the time, Woodfull was appalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Play resumed after a brief delay, once it was certain the Australian captain was fit to carry on, and since Larwood's over had ended, Woodfull did not have to face the bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into Bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had done so.&lt;ref name=F180/&gt; Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the angry spectators became extremely volatile.&lt;ref name=F181&gt;Frith, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have [[Substitute (cricket)#Retired hurt (or not out)|retired hurt]] if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment.&lt;ref name=F180&gt;Frith, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The fury of the crowd was such that a riot may have occurred had another incident taken place and several writers suggested that the anger of the spectators was the culmination of feelings built up over the two months that bodyline had developed.&lt;ref name="F181"/&gt;

During the over, another rising Larwood delivery knocked the bat out of Woodfull's hands. He batted for 89 minutes, being hit a few more times before Allen bowled him for 22.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, Pelham Warner, one of the England managers, visited the Australian dressing room. He expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not."&lt;ref name=F185&gt;Frith, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it."&lt;ref name=fingo&gt;Fingleton (1947), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present.&lt;ref name=F185/&gt;&lt;ref name=fingo17&gt;Fingleton (1947), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no play on the following day, Sunday being a rest day, but on Monday morning, the exchange between Warner and Woodfull was reported in several Australian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The players and officials were horrified that a sensitive private exchange had been reported to the press. [[News leak|Leaks]] to the press were practically unknown in 1933. David Frith notes that discretion and respect were highly prized and such a leak was "regarded as a moral offence of the first order."&lt;ref name=F187&gt;Frith, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodfull made it clear that he severely disapproved of the leak, and later wrote that he "always expected cricketers to do the right thing by their team-mates."&lt;ref name=F188&gt;Frith, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Growden, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; As the only full-time journalist in the Australian team, suspicion immediately fell on Fingleton, although as soon as the story was published, he told Woodfull he was not responsible. Warner offered Larwood a reward of one pound if he could dismiss Fingleton in the second innings; Larwood obliged by bowling him for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]].&lt;ref name=F188/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, p. 157"&gt;Hamilton, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton later claimed that Sydney Sun reporter [[Claude Corbett]] had received the information from Bradman;&lt;ref name="Fingleton"&gt;Fingleton (1981), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; for the rest of their lives, Fingleton and Bradman made claim and counter-claim that the other man was responsible for the leak.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 187–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bodyline 3rd Test Oldfield 02.jpg|left|thumb|Bert Oldfield staggers away with his skull fractured.]]
The following day, as Australia faced a large deficit on the first innings, [[Bert Oldfield]] played a long innings in support of [[Bill Ponsford]], who scored 85. In the course of the innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several [[Boundary (cricket)|fours]] from Larwood to move to 41.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 194–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but lost sight of the ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and fell to his knees and play stopped as Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field.&lt;ref name=Oldfield&gt;Frith, pp. 196–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued.&lt;ref name=Oldfield/&gt;{{refn|As a result of the injuries in this game, the costs of insurance cover for players doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Frith and Haigh, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes|}} Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.&lt;ref name="Frith, p. 201"&gt;Frith, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cable exchange===
At the end of the fourth day's play of the third Test match, the Australian Board of Control sent a [[Electrical telegraph|cable]] to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), cricket's ruling body and the club that selected the England team, in London:

{{quote|Australian Board of Control to MCC, January 18, 1933: &lt;br&gt;
Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players, as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations between Australia and England.&lt;ref name="f218"&gt;Frith, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not all Australians, including the press and players, believed that the cable should have been sent, particularly immediately following a heavy defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion of unsportsmanlike behaviour was deeply resented by the MCC, and was one of the worst accusations that could have been levelled at the team at the time. Additionally, members of the MCC believed that the Australians had over-reacted to the English bowling.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; The MCC took some time to draft a reply:

{{quote|MCC to Australian Board of Control, January 23, 1933: &lt;br&gt;
We, Marylebone Cricket Club, deplore your cable. We deprecate your opinion that there has been unsportsmanlike play. We have fullest confidence in captain, team and managers, and are convinced they would do nothing to infringe either the Laws of Cricket or the spirit of the game. We have no evidence that our confidence is misplaced. Much as we regret accidents to Woodfull and Oldfield, we understand that in neither case was the bowler to blame. If the Australian Board of Control wish to propose a new law or rule it shall receive our careful consideration in due course. We hope the situation is not now as serious as your cable would seem to indicate, but if it is such as to jeopardise the good relations between English and Australian cricketers, and you would consider it desirable to cancel remainder of programme, we would consent with great reluctance.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 218–22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At this point, the remainder of the series was under threat.&lt;ref name="p259"&gt;Pollard, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi]],&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics.&lt;ref name="Frith, pp. 214–15"&gt;Frith, pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas, p. 146"&gt;Douglas, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Board met to draft a reply cable, which was sent on 30 January, indicating that they wished the series to continue and offering to postpone consideration of the fairness of bodyline bowling until after the series. The MCC's reply, on 2 February, suggested that continuing the series would be impossible unless the accusation of unsporting behaviour was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 226–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation escalated into a diplomatic incident. Figures high up in both the British and Australian government saw bodyline as potentially fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 241–59.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Governors of South Australia|Governor]] of [[South Australia]], [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] [[James Henry Thomas]] that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 242–248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p2601"/&gt; The standoff was settled when [[Prime Minister of Australia|the Australian prime minister]], [[Joseph Lyons]], met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Following considerable discussion and debate in the English and Australian press, the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which, while maintaining its opposition to bodyline bowling, stated "We do not regard the sportsmanship of your team as being in question".&lt;ref name="p2601"&gt;Pollard, pp. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 255–259.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, correspondence between the Australian Board and the MCC continued for almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 145–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of the series===
Voce missed the fourth Test of the series, being replaced by a [[leg spinner]], [[Tommy Mitchell]]. Larwood continued to use bodyline, but he was the only bowler in the team using the tactic; even so, he used it less frequently than usual and seemed less effective in high temperatures and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 274, 277, 293.&lt;/ref&gt; England won the game by eight wickets, thanks in part to an innings of 83 by [[Eddie Paynter]] who had been admitted to hospital with tonsillitis but left in order to bat when England were struggling in their innings.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151782.html| title = England v Australia 1932–33 (Fourth Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1934 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London |accessdate = 28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voce returned for the final Test, but neither he nor Allen were fully fit,&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the use of bodyline tactics, Australia scored 435 at a rapid pace, aided by several dropped catches.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia included a fast bowler for this final game, [[Harry Alexander (cricketer)|Harry Alexander]] who bowled some short deliveries but was not allowed to use many fielders on the leg side by his captain, Woodfull.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 315–18.&lt;/ref&gt; England built a lead of 19 but their tactics in Australia's second innings were disrupted when Larwood left the field with an injured foot; [[Hedley Verity]], a spinner, claimed five wickets to bowl Australia out;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 324–25.&lt;/ref&gt; England won by eight wickets and won the series by four Tests to one.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 328, 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In England==
Bodyline continued to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team.&lt;ref name="p141"&gt;Perry, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the English crowds their first chance to see what all the fuss was about. [[Ken Farnes]], the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] fast bowler, also bowled it in the [[The University Match (cricket)|University Match]], hitting a few [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]] batsmen.

Jardine himself had to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The [[West Indian cricket team]] toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]], [[Jackie Grant]], their captain, decided to try bodyline. He had a couple of fast bowlers, [[Manny Martindale]] and [[Learie Constantine]].&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt; Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4,&lt;ref name=wi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howstat.com.au/cricket/Statistics/Matches/MatchScorecard.asp?MatchCode=0228 |title=HowSTAT!

Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine.&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt; Jardine never flinched. With Les Ames finding himself in difficulties, Jardine said, "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense."&lt;ref name=Douglas166&gt;Douglas, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; He played right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and played them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control.&lt;ref name=Douglas166/&gt; While the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55.&lt;ref name=wi/&gt; Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century.&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt; In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. The match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning English opinion against bodyline. ''The Times'' used the word bodyline, without using inverted commas or using the qualification ''so-called'', for the first time.&lt;ref name=Douglas168&gt;Douglas, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' also said that "most of those watching it for the first time must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice."&lt;ref name=Douglas168/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Cricinfo'' for the [http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1930S/1933/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T2_22-25JUL1933.html scorecard] of the second Test between England and West Indies in 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Bill Woodfull]] led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England's new captain, [[Bob Wyatt]], agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used.&lt;ref name=h84/&gt;&lt;ref name=ha354&gt;Harte, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r164&gt;Robinson, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.&lt;ref name=h84&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a match between the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, one of the bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed the strategy with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66.&lt;ref name=r164/&gt;&lt;ref name=h85/&gt; In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]]. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height.&lt;ref name=h85/&gt; Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg-side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would not return to the country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury.&lt;ref name=r164/&gt;&lt;ref name=h85&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p28-30"&gt;Perry, pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harte, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day.&lt;ref name=r164/&gt; Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.&lt;ref name=h85/&gt;

==Changes to the laws of cricket==
As a direct consequence of the 1932–33 tour,&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=A brief history ... Bodyline|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bodyline/content/story/148537.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MCC introduced a new rule to the [[laws of cricket]] for the 1935 English cricket season.&lt;ref name=F408&gt;Frith, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the MCC hoped that captains would ensure that the game was played in the correct spirit, and passed a resolution that bodyline bowling would breach this spirit.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; When this proved to be insufficient,&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; the MCC passed a law that "direct attack" bowling was unfair and became the responsibility of the umpires to identify and stop.&lt;ref name=F408/&gt; In 1957, the laws were altered to prevent more than two fielders standing behind square on the leg side; the intention was to prevent negative bowling tactics whereby off spinners and slow inswing bowlers aimed at the leg stump of batsmen with fielders concentrated on the leg side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last1 = Chalke  |first1 = Stephen  |last2 = Hodgson  |first2 = Derek  |title = No Coward Soul.

Later law changes, under the heading of "Intimidatory Short Pitched Bowling", also restricted the number of "[[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]s" which may be bowled in an [[over (cricket)|over]]. Nevertheless, the tactic of intimidating the batsman is still used to an extent that would have been shocking in 1933, although it is less dangerous now because today's players wear helmets and generally far more protective gear.&lt;ref name="begin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/bodyline/content/story/316343.html |title=A dummy's guide to Bodyline |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 10–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies teams]] of the 1980s, who regularly fielded a bowling attack comprising some of the best fast bowlers in cricket history, were perhaps the most feared exponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52345.html |title=Cricinfo Player Profile, Clive Lloyd |accessdate=1 December 2006 |last=Dellor |first=Ralph |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The English players and management were consistent in referring to their tactic as ''fast leg theory'' considering it to be a variant of the established and unobjectionable [[leg theory]] tactic. The inflammatory term "bodyline" was coined and perpetuated by the Australian press ([[#Origin of the term|see below]]). English writers used the term ''fast leg theory''. The terminology reflected differences in understanding, as neither the English public nor the Board of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC)—the governing body of English cricket—could understand why the Australians were complaining about what they perceived as a commonly used tactic. Some concluded that the Australian cricket authorities and public were sore losers.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 142, 222, 231–238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p258"&gt;Pollard, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the four fast bowlers in the tour party, [[Gubby Allen]] was a voice of dissent in the English camp, refusing to bowl short on the leg side,&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt; and writing several letters home to England critical of Jardine, although he did not express this in public in Australia.&lt;ref name="Frith, p. 116"&gt;Frith, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other players, while maintaining a united front in public, also deplored bodyline in private. The amateurs [[Bob Wyatt]] (the vice-captain), [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] and the [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi|Nawab of Pataudi]] opposed it,&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt; as did [[Wally Hammond]] and [[Les Ames]] among the professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. W. Swanton]]. ''Sort of a Cricket Person'', William Collins &amp; Sons, 1972, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the season, Woodfull's physical courage, stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He flatly refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit.&lt;ref name=c171/&gt;&lt;ref name="az"&gt;Cashman, pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jardine however insisted his tactic was not designed to cause injury and that he was leading his team in a sportsmanlike and gentlemanly manner, arguing that it was up to the Australian batsmen to play their way out of trouble.&lt;ref name="Frith, p. 201"/&gt;

It was subsequently revealed that several of the players had private reservations, but they did not express them publicly at the time.&lt;ref name="Frith, pp. 214–15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas, p. 146"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, including many of the players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many argued that it was a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 378–397.&lt;/ref&gt; The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history,&lt;ref name=c171&gt;Colman, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh and Frith, foreword.&lt;/ref&gt; The MCC asked [[Harold Larwood]] to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 399–401.&lt;/ref&gt; Larwood refused, never played for England again,&lt;ref name="p141"/&gt; and became vilified in his own country.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 437–441.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, ''In Quest of the Ashes'', described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 410–17.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 418–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the sport, there were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country avoided goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the ''[[North China Daily News]]'' published a pro-bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] were lost by Australians because of local reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; English immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934–35 a statue of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] in Sydney was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word "BODYLINE" painted on it.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; Both before and after World War II, numerous satirical cartoons and comedy skits were written, mostly in Australia, based on events of the bodyline tour. Generally, they poked fun at the English.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 381, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Australia's [[Network Ten]] produced a television mini-series titled ''[[Bodyline (miniseries)|Bodyline]]'', dramatising the events of the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred [[Gary Sweet]] as Don Bradman, [[Hugo Weaving]] as Douglas Jardine, [[Jim Holt (actor)|Jim Holt]] as Harold Larwood, [[Rhys McConnochie]] as Pelham Warner, and [[Frank Thring]] as Jardine's mentor [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]].&lt;ref name="f386"/&gt; The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a [[Flag of the United Kingdom|British flag]] at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an event which was never documented.&lt;ref name="f386"&gt;Frith, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired.&lt;ref name="f387"&gt;Frith, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism.&lt;ref name="f387"/&gt;

To this day, the bodyline tour remains one of the most significant events in the [[history of cricket]], and strong in the consciousness of many cricket followers. In a poll of cricket journalists, commentators, and players in 2004, the bodyline tour was ranked the most important event in cricket history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/07/1075854114533.html |title=It just wasn't cricket |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald|The Sun-Herald]] |accessdate=4 December 2006 |date=8 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlisle Racecourse''' is a [[thoroughbred horse racing]] venue located in the village of [[Blackwell, Cumbria|Blackwell]] near [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. The course has been on its present site since 1904, when it moved there from another location nearer to Carlisle. The course is 1 mile and 4 furlongs (2.41 km) in circumference, right-handed, and hosts [[flat racing]] in the summer and [[National Hunt racing]] over the winter months. The last half mile is up a steep incline. The going can get very heavy in the winter.

History was made on 2 July 1929 when the newly formed [[The Tote|Totalisator Board]] operated their pool betting system for the first time on a British racecourse at Carlisle.

Carlisle is home to the [[Carlisle Bell]], one of the oldest horse races in existence. Carlisle also had a King's Plate – a race for 5-year-old horses in 3-mile heats – instigated by [[George III]] in 1763.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44323">'''Cheating in chess''' refers to a deliberate violation of the [[rules of chess]] or other unethical behaviour that is intended to give an unfair advantage to a player or team. Cheating can occur in many forms&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/sports/othersports/08chess.html?ex=1312689600&amp;en=5292ff7841b05021&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Cheating Accusations in Mental Sports, Too|accessdate=2007-01-01 | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can take place before, during, or after a game. Commonly cited instances of cheating include: collusion with spectators or other players, use of chess engines, rating manipulation, and violations of the [[touch-move rule]]. Many suspiciously motivated practices are not comprehensively covered by the rules of [[chess]]. On ethical or moral grounds only, such practices may be judged by some as acceptable, and by others as cheating.

Even if an arguably unethical action is not covered explicitly by the rules, article 11.1 of the [[FIDE]] laws of chess states: "The players shall take no action that will bring the game of chess into disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&amp;view=article|title=Laws of Chess|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while deliberately sneaking a captured piece back onto the board may be construed as an illegal move that is sanctioned by a time bonus to the opponent and a reinstatement of the last legal position, the rule forbidding actions that bring chess into disrepute may also be invoked to hand down a more severe sanction such as the loss of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/geurt58.pdf|title=Unusual Events or Are There Still Normal Games?|last=Gijssen|first=Geurt|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=30 July 2012}} (see answer to question by J. Roberts on p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
Cheating at chess is almost as old as the game itself, and may even have caused chess-related deaths. According to one legend, a dispute over cheating at chess led King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] to murder a Danish nobleman.&lt;ref name="CP1-4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA136&amp;lpg=RA3-PA136&amp;dq=canute+ulf+chess&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ne27GJsMFQ&amp;sig=oJo7D-d16b2hnb8Fnk-yR497clU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=byFETruHLY3UiAKqrc3KAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=canute%20ulf%20chess&amp;f=false|title=Chess Player, Volumes 1-4|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most anthologized chess stories is ''Slippery Elm'' (1929) by [[Percival Wilde]], which involves a ruse to allow a weak player to beat a much stronger one, using messages passed on [[Ulmus rubra#Medicinal|slippery-elm]] throat lozenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-12-19/cheating-at-chess-and-other-pastimes|title=Cheating at Chess and Other Pastimes|date=19 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television shows have engaged the plot of cheating in chess, including episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0649205|title="Mission: Impossible" A Game of Chess (TV Episode 1968)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539781|title="Cheers" Indoor Fun with Sammy and Robby (TV Episode 1990)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In televised shows based on humourist [[Tenali Rama]] (a real-life personality who lived under king [[Krishnadeva Raya]], ruler of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijaynagar]] during its most prosperous period), a loud-mouthed chess "unbeatable champion" (who mostly depends on winning by cheating) takes advantage of the emperor's sleep due to boredom and starts shouting along with followers (who have accompanied him from an opponent kingdom), successfully convincing the assembly that he has won.

In [[Satyajit Ray]]'s [[Shatranj ke Khiladi]] (one of only two Hindi films he made – both based on short-stories by [[Premchand]]), Mirja Sajjad Ali, fed-up by his opponent's childish playing habits, has to make rules that only the piece intended to be played should be touched, and taking more than five minutes to move  should simply mean defeat. (As [[chess clock]]s are ''still'' practically unknown  even in modern India, it was out of question during the middle of 19th century — the period in which the film is set.){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Automaton hoaxes===
In contrast to the modern methods of cheating by playing moves calculated by machines, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the public were hoaxed by the opposite deception in which machines played moves of hidden humans. The first and most famous of the chess automaton hoaxes was [[The Turk]] (1770), followed by [[Ajeeb]] (1868), and [[Mephisto (automaton)|Mephisto]] (1886).

==Collusion==
Over the years, there have been many accusations of collusion, either of players deliberately losing (often to help a friend or teammate get a [[Chess title|title norm]]), or of players [[draw by agreement|agreeing to draws]] to help both players in a [[chess tournament|tournament]]. One of the earliest evidences is with the Fifth American Chess Congress in 1880, when [[Preston Ware]] accused James Grundy of reneging on a deal to draw the game, with Grundy instead trying to play for a win.&lt;ref name="spinrad1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad08.pdf|title=The Scandal of 1880, Part One|date=28 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228235045/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad08.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spinrad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad09.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=28 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228235045/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad09.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article contemporary to the event stated, "Ware’s avowal of his right to sell a game in a tourney was a novelty in chess ethics ... Ware’s veracity has not been questioned, only his obliquity of moral vision ..."&lt;ref name="spinrad1" /&gt; Six prior allegations of similar collusion and bribery, including another against Ware, were listed from 1876 to 1880 in that article on the Ware-Grundy affair, which was published in the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' on February 8, 1880.&lt;ref name="spinrad1" /&gt; More recently, researchers at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] have claimed, based on their analysis of statistical tests of match records against economic models, that Soviet chess masters may have colluded in world chess championships held from 1940 to 1964.&lt;ref name="wusl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-info.wustl.edu/tips/page/normal/7935.html|title=Cheating in world chess championships is nothing new, study suggests|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoulNye"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=905612|title=Did the Soviets Collude? A Statistical Analysis of Championship Chess 1940–64|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington University study argues from the researchers' statistical findings that Soviet players may have agreed to draws between themselves to improve their standings.

Opinions differ over how effective collusion may be. For example, if a leading player draws his game, it may allow his rivals to gain ground on him by winning their games.  The most infamous alleged instance, the 1962 [[Candidates' Tournament]], is discussed further at the ''[[World Chess Championship 1963]]'' article.

In 2011, IM [[Greg Shahade]] wrote that "prearrangement of results is extremely commonplace, even at the highest levels of chess.  This especially holds true for draws... There is a bit of a code of silence at the top levels of chess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uschess.org/content/view/11247/632|title=The United States Chess Federation - Greg on Chess: the Trouble with Round-Robins|first=Jennifer|last=Shahade|website=www.uschess.org|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject had been partially broached (in the USA context) by [[Alex Yermolinsky]] a few years earlier, saying "It's no secret how people act when facing a last-round situation when a draw gives no prize ...  People will just dump games, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2004/08/reality-check.htm|title=Reality Check - The Daily Dirt Chess News Blog|website=www.chessninja.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning an incident involving 2006 US Championship qualification, Shahade blamed the [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system]] for creating perverse incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2006/01/cheating-heart-attack.htm|title=Cheating Heart Attack - The Daily Dirt Chess News Blog|website=www.chessninja.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederic Friedel reported that the PCA had considered running a series of open tournaments in 1990s, but for similar reasons given by [[John Nunn]] ultimately declined, saying that deliberately losing games was "very real in the many open tournaments that are staged all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-bilbao-draw-feedback-from-our-readers|title=The Bilbao Draw – feedback from our readers|date=6 November 2007|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch-move rule==
{{see also|Touch-move rule}}
In chess, the "touch-move" rule states that if a player (whose turn it is to move) touches one of his [[chess piece|pieces]], it must be moved if it has a legal move. In addition, if a piece is picked up and released on another square, the move must stand if it is a legal move. If an opponent's piece is touched, it must be captured if it is legal to do so. These rules are often difficult to enforce because the only witnesses are the two players themselves. Nevertheless, violations of these rules are considered to be cheating.&lt;ref&gt;"When the man in the street hears of someone cheating at chess...usually involve a violation of article 7 of the Laws of Chess, usually called the 'touch-move' rule.", Lombardy &amp; Daniels, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"He stuttered, ''J'adoube'', and moved another piece instead, which is commonly known as cheating.", Evans, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

In one famous instance, [[Garry Kasparov]] changed his move against [[Judit Polgár]] in 1994 after momentarily letting go of a piece. Kasparov went on to win the game. The tournament officials had video records proving that his hand left the piece, but refused to release the evidence. A factor counting against Polgár was that she waited a whole day before complaining, and such claims must be made during the game. The videotape revealed that Kasparov did let go of the piece for one-quarter of a second. Cognitive psychologist Robert Solso stated that it is too short a time to make a conscious decision.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, pp. 284–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous incident occurred in a game between [[Milan Matulović]] and [[István Bilek]] at the [[World Chess Championship 1969|Sousse Interzonal]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1027634|title=Milan Matulovic vs Istvan Bilek (1967)|website=www.chessgames.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matulović played a losing move but then took it back after saying "J'adoube" ("I adjust"—which should be announced ''before'' adjusting pieces on their square). His opponent complained to the [[list of chess terms#Arbiter|arbiter]] but the modified move was allowed to stand. This incident earned Matulović the nickname "J'adoubović".&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 252, says "...he played in the Sousse Interzonal in which, after a little cheating (see j'adoube), he came ninth."  p. 185 (the "j'adoube" entry) says: "...withdrew a losing move saying "Ich spreche j'doube"; this ruse went unpunished...."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 European Championship saw a "[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1263244 takeback game]" between [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] and [[Vladimir Malakhov (chess player)|Vladimir Malakhov]], who eventually finished first and second in the event. To quote the book ''Smart Chip'' by [[Genna Sosonko]]:&lt;ref&gt;Smart Chip From St Petersburg (and other tales from a bygone chess area), published by New in Chess, June 2014, {{ISBN|9789056914875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both grandmasters were fighting for the lead, and the encounter had huge sporting significance. In an ending that was favourable to him, Azmai[parashvili] picked up the bishop, intending to make a move with it instead of first exchanging rooks. Malakhov recalled: "Seeing that the rooks were still on the board, he said something like, "Oh, first the exchange, of course." put his bishop back, took my rook, and the game continued. I don't know what should have been done differently in this situation—in Azmai's place, some might have resigned immediately, and in my place, some would have demanded that he make a move with his bishop but I didn't want to ruin the logical development of the duel, so I didn't object when Azmai made a different move: the mistake was obviously nothing to do with chess! When we signed the score sheets, Azmai suggested to me that we consider the game a draw. After the game I was left with an unpleasant aftertaste, but that was due mainly to my own play."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cheating with technology==
Technology has been used by chess cheats in several ways. Perhaps the most common way is to use a chess program while playing chess remotely, e.g., on the Internet. Another type of cheating, with the aim of boosting one's rating on an Internet chess site, is to sign on with a different [[IP address]] and user name (a form of [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppetry]]) to play and lose against themselves. Electronic communication with an accomplice during face-to-face competitive chess is another reported type of cheating. Games can be analyzed after the fact to give a probabilistic determination on whether a player received surreptitious help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Catch A Chess Cheater|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/21/324222845/how-to-catch-a-chess-cheater|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents===
Due to the great multiplication of technological cheating incidents, the following examples concentrate only on those that are either at a high level, or are of historical significance.

====High-profile====
* In the [[39th Chess Olympiad|2010 FIDE Olympiad Tournament]] at [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], three French players were caught in a scheme to use a computer program to decide moves. Their plan involved one player, Cyril Marzolo, following the tournament at home and using the computer program to decide the best moves. He would send the moves by SMS to the team coach, Arnaud Hauchard, who would then stand or sit at various tables as a signal to the player, [[Sébastien Feller]], to make a certain move. Sébastien Feller was given a two-year and nine months suspension, Cyril Marzolo was given a one-year and six-month suspension, and Arnaud Hauchard was given a three-year suspension by the FIDE Ethics Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europe-echecs.com/actualites/sanctions-confirmees-par-la-fide-4411.html|title=Sanctions confirmées par la FIDE|publisher=[[Europe Échecs]]|date=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other cases, each player involved was a legitimate Grandmaster or International Master. None of the other players on the team knew of this or were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= FIDE Ethics Commission suspends Hauchard, Feller and Marzolo | url=http://www.chessdom.com/fide-ethics-commission-suspends-hauchard-feller-and-marzolo|accessdate=22 November 2014 |publisher=chessdom |date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cheating chess champ banned | publisher=connexionfrance |url=http://connexionfrance.com/Chess-cheat-Feller-banned-world-champion-grand-master-SMS-text-12600-view-article.html |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scandals of [[Borislav Ivanov]] were a cause celebre in the chess world in 2012 and 2013, with first cheating being alleged at the Zadar Open, and then Kyustendil. He was banned for four months by the Bulgarian Chess Federation, though this ban was overturned due to procedural defects, and was not based upon the cheating allegations, but rather Ivanov's rude behavior toward his accusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btv.bg/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/video/615096686-bTV_Reporterite_Borislav_Ivanov__vinoven_do_dokazvane_na_protivnoto.html|title=bTV Репортерите: Борислав Иванов - виновен до доказване на противното|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009132856/http://www.btv.bg/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/video/615096686-bTV_Reporterite_Borislav_Ivanov__vinoven_do_dokazvane_na_protivnoto.html#|archive-date=9 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-79.com/news-64768.html|title=Съдът оневини благоевградския шахматист Борислав Иванов|first=Developed by Motion Limited|last=(http://www.motion.bg)|website=www.e-79.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After various interludes, he was banned permanently by the Bulgarian Chess Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/sport/2013/12/24/2209570_seriiniiat_izmamnik_borislav_ivanov_e_izkljuchen_ot|title="Серийният измамник" Борислав Иванов е изключен от българския шахмат|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents were significant as they were one of the first times that statistical methods were used to analyze move-matching with computer programs, even though in the end such evidence was never used in a formal legal procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessprofessionals.org/content/open-letter-kenneth-w-regan-cheating-chess|title=Open Letter from Kenneth W.

* At the 2014 Iasi Open 2014, Wesley Vermeulen was caught cheating by consulting a mobile phone in the toilet, admitted his offense, and was eventually banned for one year by both the Dutch chess federation and FIDE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schaaksite.nl/page.php?al=verklaring-international-chess-festival-iasi-open-2014 Iasi Open 2014] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084006/http://schaaksite.nl/page.php?al=verklaring-international-chess-festival-iasi-open-2014 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schaakbond.nl/nieuws/bestuursbesluit-schorsing-wesley-vermeulen|title=Nieuwsoverzicht - Schaakbond|website=www.schaakbond.nl|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2015/FIDE_News/2015_EB_Agenda__Annexes/Annex_52.pdf FIDE Ethics Commission Decision 6/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2015, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Gaioz Nigalidze]] was banned from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament after officials discovered him consulting a [[smartphone]] with [[chess software]] in the [[washroom]] during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/sport/chess-championship-cheating-in-bathroom/index.html|title=Chess grandmaster cheats ... from the bathroom|first=Holly Yan|last=CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/15-chess-news/8675-dubai-bans-georgian-chess-champion-caught-cheating-at-dubai-open-chess-tournament.html FIDE: Dubai bans Georgian Chess Champion Caught Cheating at Dubai Open Chess Tournament], 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was later stripped of his grandmaster title and banned from competition for three years, though he was allowed to keep his [[International Master]] title.&lt;ref&gt;FIDE Ethics commission, [http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2015/FIDE_News/Ethics_case_7_2015_Decision.pdf Case n. 7/2015: ''Allegations of Cheating against GM Nigalidze in Dubai Open, 2015''], 4 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2016, Sergey Aslanov was expelled from the Moscow Open, for a smartphone in the toilet, hidden under a loose tile behind a drainpipe. He declared himself to be guilty of error but not a crime, and was only suspended for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess-international.de/Archive/51075|title=Sergej betrügt mit Smartphone auf der Toilette (German)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310014013/http://www.chess-international.de/Archive/51075|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/21050|title=Уличённый в читерстве на Moscow Open Сергей Асланов отделался мягким наказанием - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/21135|title=Виновен в ошибках, но не в преступлении - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical====
* One of the earliest known cases of using technology to cheat occurred in the 1993 [[World Open chess tournament|World Open]]. An unrated newcomer wearing headphones used the name "John von Neumann" (matching the name of a [[John von Neumann|famous computer science pioneer]]), and scored 4½/9 in the Open Section, including a draw with a [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] and a win over a 2350-[[ELO rating system|rated]] player. This player seemed to have a suspicious bulge in one of his pockets, which appeared to make a soft humming or buzzing sound at important points in the game. When he was quizzed by the tournament director, he was unable to demonstrate even a rudimentary knowledge of some simple chess concepts, and he was disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3605|title=Minutes of the Chess Cheating conference in New York|date=2007-01-11|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1998 Böblinger Open saw Clemens Allwermann latterly accused of cheating using [[Pocket Fritz|Fritz]], and after an investigation by the district attorney was inconclusive as to the evidence, the Bavarian Chess Federation barred him from participating in future tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/a-history-of-cheating-in-che-3-|title=A history of cheating in chess (3)|date=18 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Lampertheim Open Tournament 2002 the arbiter announced the disqualification of a player before round seven. Markus Keller explained what had happened:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/scandal-in-lampertsheim-cheating-in-the-loo|title=Scandal in Lampertsheim – cheating in the loo|date=7 January 2003|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;In the sixth round a player came to me and said he suspected his opponent, W.S. from L., was using illicit aids during the game. He often left the board for protracted periods of time to go to the toilet, even when (especially when) it was his turn to play. He had done this in earlier rounds against other players as well. I watched W.S. and noticed that he played a number of moves very rapidly and then disappeared in the toilet. I followed him and could hear no sound coming from the stall. I looked under the door and saw that his feet were pointing sideways, so that he could not have been using the toilet. So I entered the neighbouring stall, stood on the toilet bowl and looked over the dividing wall. I saw W.S. standing there with a handheld PC which displayed a running chess program. He was using a stylus to operate it. I immediately disqualified the player. When confronted he claimed that he was only checking his emails, so I asked him to show me the computer, which he refused to do. There are witnesses for my investigation in the toilet, and we will ask the chess federation of our state to ban the player from playing in other tournaments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In the HB Global Chess Challenge 2005 (in Minneapolis, Minnesota), a player in the Under-2000 section exited the event under suspicion of cheating, while his final-round game was under way. According to tournament officials, he was caught repeatedly talking on his cell phone during his game—which the published rules for that event expressly prohibited. Directors suspected that he was receiving moves over the phone from an accomplice elsewhere in the building. His results were expunged from the tournament and an ethics complaint lodged. Six weeks later, the same player entered the World Open and tied for first through third place in the Under-2200 section, pocketing $5,833. An attempt was made to eject him midway through that event, when the organizers belatedly learned about the earlier incident in Minnesota. But, lacking any specific allegation that he was cheating in the World Open, they backtracked and re-admitted him after he threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorchess.zoomshare.com/3.html |title=Blockade Chess Cheaters  USCF Petition |publisher=SeniorChess |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160021/http://www.seniorchess.zoomshare.com/3.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Subroto Mukerjee memorial international rating chess tournament 2006, an Indian chess player was banned from playing competitive chess for ten years due to cheating.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061212/asp/jamshedpur/story_7127264.asp|title=Verdict on chess cheating this week|accessdate=2014-01-21 | location=Calcutta, India|work=The Telegraph|date=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tournament at Subroto Park, [[Umakant Sharma]] was caught receiving instructions from an accomplice using a [[chess computer]] via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled device which had been sewn into his cap.&lt;ref name="the hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/06/stories/2006120612002200.htm|title=Player expelled for technology misuse|accessdate=2006-12-28 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-122706"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/27/chess.cheater.reut/index.html |title=Chess player caught cheating with wireless device |accessdate=2006-12-28 |work=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101060744/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/27/chess.cheater.reut/index.html |archivedate=1 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His accomplices were outside the building, and were relaying moves from a computer simulation. Officials became suspicious after Sharma had made unusually large gains in rating points during the previous 18 months, even qualifying for the national championship.&lt;ref name="cnn-122706"/&gt; Umakant began the year with an average rating of 1933, and in 64 games gained over 500 points to attain a rating of 2484. Officials received multiple written complaints alleging that Umakant's moves were in exactly the same sequence suggested by the chess computer.&lt;ref name="the hindu"/&gt;  Eventually, in the seventh round of the tournament, [[Indian Air Force]] officials searched the players on the top eight boards with a metal detector and found that Umakant was the only player who was cheating. Umakant's ten-year ban was imposed by the All India Chess Federation (AICF) after reviewing evidence presented by Umakant himself and the electronic devices seized by the tournament organizers.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;  The penalty was considered harsh, especially considering that those in other sports who have been found to be [[Doping (sport)|doping]] and [[match fixing]] did not receive such lengthy suspensions.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200612271550.htm |title=Umakant Shama banned for 10 years |accessdate=2006-12-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103191122/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200612271550.htm |archivedate=3 January 2007 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When officials were asked about the suspension they stated, "We wanted to be frank and send a stern message to all players. It is like cheating on exams."&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;
* In the Philadelphia World Open 2006, Steve Rosenberg, who was playing in a lower section, was leading before the final round. A victory would have been worth about $18,000. He was confronted by a tournament director and found to be using a wireless transmitter and receiver called a "Phonito". He was disqualified from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3280|title=Cheating Accusations at the World Open|date=2006-08-10|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a Dutch League 2C 2007 match between Bergen op Zoom and AAS, the arbiter caught the team captain of AAS (who was playing on board 6) using a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]. The player was outside the playing hall, with permission, to get some fresh air. The arbiter had followed him and caught him using [[Pocket Fritz]]. On the screen, the actual position of the game was shown. The arbiter declared the game lost and informed the Dutch Federation about the incident. The competition manager communicated a heavy penalty: the player was banned from playing in the Dutch League and Cup matches, not only for that season, but also for the next two seasons. The competition manager applied article 20.3 of the Federation's competition regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/dutch-chess-player-banned-after-using-pocketfritz/|title=Dutch chess player banned after using PocketFritz|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2007-11-09|publisher=ChessVibes.com|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Dubai]] Open 2008, M. Sadatnajafi, an untitled Iranian player (rated 2288 at the time), was disqualified from the tournament after he was caught receiving suggested moves by [[text message]] on his [[mobile phone]] while playing Grandmaster [[Li Chao (chess player)|Li Chao]].&lt;ref name="Dubai2008"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wesley So wins Dubai Open, player disqualified for cheating | publisher=[[ChessBase]] | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4570 |  accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was being relayed live over the Internet and it was alleged that his friends were following it and guiding him using a computer.&lt;ref name="Dubai2008"/&gt;
* In the Norths Chess Club Centenary Year Under 1600 Tournament a 14-year-old boy was caught using what the arbiter called a "hand-held machine" in the toilets. The game was declared lost and the boy was expelled from the tournament. He was using the program [[Chessmaster]] on a [[PlayStation Portable]], and that was probably the reason why the moves were not particularly strong. It was the first example of a chess player getting caught while using an electronic device in Australia, and so it quickly became a big story in the relatively small Australian chess community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/is-cheating-always-newsworthy/|title=Is cheating always newsworthy|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2009-01-08|publisher=ChessVibes|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[German Chess Championship]] 2011, FM Christoph Natsidis used a chess program on his [[smartphone]] during his last-round game against GM [[Sebastian Siebrecht]].

* At the 2012 Virginia Scholastic and Collegiate Championships, a player was caught using a chess engine running on a PDA.  The player was disqualified from the tournament, had his membership to the Virginia Chess Federation suspended, and had an ethics complaint filed to the USCF.  Unlike other incidents, the player was using the chess engine disguised as using eNotate, which is one of two electronic chess notation programs permitted to be used at USCF tournaments. While the player only admitted to using the chess engine in that one match, his results suggested he had been using the program for several tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The evolution of cheating in chess |url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8362701/the-evolution-cheating-chess | author=Dave McKenna| publisher=Grantland.com (ESPN) | date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the 2013 Cork Congress Chess Open, a 16-year-old player was found to be using a chess program on a smartphone when his opponent, Gabriel Mirza, confronted him in the toilets, kicking down the cubicle door and physically hauling him out.

* In January 2016, the blind Norwegian player Stein Bjørnsen was accused of cheating after playing games that showed a very high correlation with computer analysis. Due to his disability, Bjørnsen had been allowed to keep a record of his moves with a recorder coupled to an ear plug. The ear plug was later found to be incompatible with the recorder, but capable of receiving messages by [[Bluetooth]]. In April 2016 he received a two-year ban on domestic competition from the Central Board of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/sport/sjakk/blind-sjakkspiller-utestengt-for-juks/a/23667458/|title=Blind sjakkspiller utestengt for juks|last1=Aaserud|first1=Mikal|last2=Christiansen|first2=Anders K.|date=25 April 2016|work=Verdens Gang|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnsen's appeal to the federation's rules committee was turned down in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/blind-sjakkspiller-utestenges-i-to-ar/62442079|title=Blind sjakkspiller utestenges i to år|last=Bryne|first=Lars|date=9 September 2016|publisher=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnson returned in 2018 after serving the ban. In March that year he was caught with a Bluetooth earpiece taped to his hand during a club tournament in [[Horten]]. The federation expelled Bjørnsen in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sb.no/sjakk/sandefjord/sport/jukset-mot-niaring-na-er-han-ekskludert-fra-sjakkforbundet/s/5-73-708255|title=Jukset mot niåring – nå er han ekskludert fra sjakkforbundet|last=Andreassen|first=Erik|date=24 May 2018|publisher=Sandefjords blad|language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating manipulation==

Since the introduction of [[Elo ratings]] in the 1960s, a number of attempts have been made to manipulate the rating system, either to deliberately inflate one's rating or to disguise one's strength by deliberately losing rating points.

===Sandbagging===
Sandbagging involves deliberately losing rated games in order to lower one's rating so that one is eligible to enter the lower rated section of a tournament with substantial prize money. This is most common in the United States, where the prize money for large open tournaments can be over $10,000, even in the lower rated sections. Sandbagging is very difficult to detect and prove, so [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] has included minimum ratings based on previous ratings or money winnings to minimize the effect.

===Small pools of players===
A limited pool of players who rarely or never play against players from outside of that pool can cause distortions in the Elo rating system, especially if one or more of the players is significantly stronger than the others, or if the results are deliberately manipulated.

[[Claude Bloodgood]] was accused of manipulating the [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] rating system in this way; at his peak in 1996 his USCF rating was in excess of 2700, the second highest in the country at the time. As a long-term prison inmate, he was necessarily restricted in the range of opponents available to him. The USCF suspected that he had deliberately inflated the ratings of his opponents; Bloodgood denied this, attributing his inflated rating to a quirk in the rating system resulting from his regularly playing against a limited pool of much weaker players.

There was widespread reporting of anomalous Burmese (Myanmar) rating movements in the late 1990s, with Milan Novkovic giving an analysis of manipulation in ''Schach'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweekinchess.com/html/twic226.html This Week in Chess 226, section 4 (originally in ''Schach'' magazine 3/99)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===False tournament reports===
The most notable international example of ratings manipulation involves Romanian [[Alexandru Crisan]], who allegedly falsified tournament reports to gain a Grandmaster title and was ranked 33rd in the world on the April 2001 [[FIDE]] rating list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ratings.fide.com/toparc.phtml?cod=13|title=Top 100 Players April 2001 FIDE Top players archive|first=|last=Administrator|website=ratings.fide.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee overseeing the matter recommended his rating be erased and his Grandmaster title revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/fidecrisan.html |title=FIDE Ruling on Alexandru Crisan (web archive) |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2007-06-14 |work=The Week in Chess Magazine |publisher=London Chess Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030317071540/http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/fidecrisan.html |archivedate=17 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Romanian Chess Federation initially favored action against Crisan, eventually he himself became the RCF president and changed the policy, creating such a situation that FIDE intervened to broker a resolution regarding many problems in the RCF, including Crisan's rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/minutes/annex_19.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=22 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040522221850/http://www.fide.com/minutes/annex_19.pdf|archivedate=22 May 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crisan then was arrested and imprisoned on fraud charges relating to his management of the company Urex Rovinari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitorulexpres.ro/?mod=ultima_ora&amp;p=ultora_local&amp;s_id=106394|title=Alexandru Crişan, condamnat la patru ani de închisoare|first=|last=User|website=www.monitorulexpres.ro|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disappeared from chess,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/anatoly-karpov-speaks-his-mind|title=Anatoly Karpov speaks his mind|date=6 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus failing to fulfill the conditions of the resolution and so activating the above recommendations regarding title revocation. FIDE did not fully update its online information until August 2015, when all his titles were removed and his rating adjusted downwards to 2132.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml ''FIDE rating list archive''], download and compare Crisan's rating between the July 2015 and August 2015 (FIDE ID 1201271)&lt;/ref&gt; When writing about the Crisan case, Ian Rogers alleges that Andrei Makarov (at the time a FIDE vice-president and Russian chess federation president) had arranged an IM title for himself through nonexistent tournaments in 1994.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

Rumors of rigged tournaments are not unheard of in the chess world. For instance, in 2005, FIDE refused to ratify norms from the Alushta (Ukraine) tournaments, claiming that the games did not meet ethical expectations. A number of players involved protested over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/dear-kirsan-nikolayevich-alushta-is-for-real-/708|title=Dear Kirsan Nikolayevich, Alushta is for real!|date=24 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A different Ukrainian tournament in 2005 was found to be completely fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-fake-heroes-of-chernobyl|title=The fake Heroes of Chernobyl|date=3 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nigel_short"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-fake-heroes-of-chernobyl-revisited|title=The fake Heroes of Chernobyl revisited|date=23 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the strongest players are not involved in these, as they are more for careerist players to gain title norms or small rating gains, but [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] was alleged to have rigged the results of the Strumica tournament of 1995 to allow him to reach the chess elite.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auschess.org.au/columns/ct/ct160901.htm|title=Chess Column|website=www.auschess.org.au|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nigel_short"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/19535|title=Evgeny Sveshnikov: "Only fools learn from their mistakes. It seems I am one of them..." - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strumica 1995, Azmai's Answer ''New in Chess'' 1996/3, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Sveshnikov referred to these high-profile Crisan and Azmaiparashvili incidents as "open secrets", at a time when both purported culprits were heavily involved in FIDE politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmsquare.com/sveshnikovFIDE.html|title=GrandMaster Square &gt;&gt;&gt; Letter from GM Sveshnikov|website=www.gmsquare.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simultaneous games==
A player with no knowledge of chess can achieve a 50% score in [[simultaneous chess]] by replicating the moves made by one of his white opponents in a match against a black opponent, and vice versa; the opponents in effect play each other rather than the giver of the simul. This may be considered cheating in some events such as [[Basque chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/che-magazine-basque-che-does-it-work-for-you-|title=CHESS Magazine: Basque Chess – does it work for you?!|date=29 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used against any even number of opponents.  [[Stage magician]] [[Derren Brown]] used the trick against eight leading British chess players in his television show.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sir Clive Ronald Woodward''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 6 January 1956) is an English former [[rugby union]] player and [[coach (sport)|coach]]. He was coach of the {{Nrut|England}} team from 1997 to 2004, managing them to victory in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. He also coached the [[2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand]], losing the test series 3-0 . He is currently a pundit for [[ITV Sport]], working on their coverage of the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] and [[Rugby World Cup]].

==Early life==
Woodward was born in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire]], the son of an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot. He started school at Corstorphine in Edinburgh and was later sent to the [[school ship]] [[HMS Conway (school ship)|HMS ''Conway'']], as his father disapproved of his ambition to play professional football. At ''Conway'', he played rugby union at centre alongside fly-half [[Iain Duncan Smith]], who would later become leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. According to Woodward, he was not selected to play for the Welsh Schoolboys side because he was English, but he was good enough to play rugby union for a Welsh school.&lt;ref name="Woodward 2004 479"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0-340-83630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his autobiography, he applied to do a law degree at [[Durham University]], but was turned down even though he was good enough&lt;ref name="Woodward 2004 479"/&gt; and instead, he found a job at a London bank (NatWest).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
[[File:Knights Bachelor Insignia.png|thumb|left|upright|Insignia of '''Knight Bachelor''']]

== Playing career ==
His first club was [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] but he left to go to [[Loughborough University]] where he gained a Bachelor of Science [[academic degree|degree]] in [[sports science]] followed by a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE). He then played as a centre for [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] from 1979 to 1985. He made his [[England Rugby|England]] debut against {{Nrut|Ireland}} on 19 January 1980, as a replacement. England won the Grand Slam in that season, winning all their games. He went on to gain 21 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for his country, playing his last game on 17 March 1984 against Wales. He was a player on the British Lions' [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|1980 tour to South Africa]] and [[1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1983 tour to New Zealand]].&lt;ref name = "loins_tours"&gt;{{cite news  | url= http://www.lions-tour.com/the-lions/the-management-2/2005-management-team/|title= 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions Management | publisher= British &amp; Irish Lions  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was most noted for his centre partnership with fellow Tiger [[Paul Dodge]]. Playing for the Barbarians, he also won the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] in 1981.

== Rugby coaching career ==

He returned to the UK in 1990 to start his own IT leasing company and he became coach of the then obscure Henley, who were promoted to the national leagues. After a short but successful spell of coaching at [[London Irish]], he was unable to handle the politics of the club and was forced out. He became assistant coach at Leicester's arch rivals [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] under [[Andy Robinson]], and when [[Jack Rowell]] retired as coach of the England team in 1997, Woodward acquired the job.&lt;ref name="Woodward 2004 479"/&gt;

He had the job of transforming the England side from the amateur era into the professional one. Having been quoted as requesting that the press judge him on England's performance at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]], when they were beaten by South Africa, his job was questioned. Thereafter England steadily improved under Woodward. England were [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] champions in [[2000 Six Nations Championship|2000]] and [[2001 Six Nations Championship|2001]], and completed the Grand Slam in [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]] with an emphatic 42–6 victory over Ireland in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/2892271.stm Awesome England clinch Grand Slam]&lt;/ref&gt; England followed up by defeating the [[All Blacks]] in New Zealand for the first time since 1973, holding out for a 15–13 win despite being reduced to 13 men in the second half with two forwards in the [[sin bin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/2982490.stm England down All Blacks]&lt;/ref&gt; A week later reigning world champions Australia were beaten 25–14 in Melbourne, England's first ever win on Australian soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/3009150.stm England clinch historic victory]&lt;/ref&gt;

England entered the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] as betting favourites and the number one ranked team in the world. Victories over {{Nrut|Georgia}}, {{Nrut|South Africa}}, {{Nrut|Samoa}}, {{Nrut|Uruguay}}, {{Nrut|Wales}} and {{Nrut|France}} took England to the final, where they faced the hosts and reigning champions {{Nrut|Australia}}. England won 20–17 thanks to a [[Jonny Wilkinson]] [[drop goal]] in the final seconds of extra time. Woodward was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 2004 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Modern honours|New Year's honours]]. As of 2016, England are still the only team from the Northern Hemisphere to win the World Cup. From 2000 to 2003, Woodward's England compiled a record of 41 wins from 46 matches, which included a perfect record of 20 wins and no losses at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] and 12 successive wins against the [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri Nations]].

The England squad had to be re-built after the World Cup success, as a number of senior players retired, including captain [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]], [[Lawrence Dallaglio]] and [[Neil Back]]. Meanwhile, talismanic fly-half Jonny Wilkinson was sidelined with long-term injuries which would prevent him playing for England again for almost 4 years. England came third in the [[2004 Six Nations Championship|2004]] [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]], losing to Grand Slam winners France and Triple Crown winners Ireland. His last tour as England coach came shortly afterwards, with an ill-fated tour of New Zealand and Australia. England were beaten by New Zealand in two tests, without scoring a single try, going down 36-3 in the first and 36-12 in the second. The team then went to Australia, where they were beaten 51-15.

In February 2004 he was appointed Head Coach for the [[2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand]]. The Lions lost the test series 3-0. Woodward's management was criticised by many commentators and players for his initial squad selection, his coaching methods, his handling of the players and the media, his selections on tour - particularly for keeping faith with the England players he knew well - and for not allowing the test team any time to play together before the test series began. He returned from New Zealand with his reputation within rugby severely tarnished.

On 24 October 2011, Woodward was inducted into the [[IRB Hall of Fame]], alongside all other Rugby World Cup-winning head coaches and captains from the tournament's inception in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted [[John Eales]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2060049.html#rwc+legends+inducted+into+irb+hall+fame |title=RWC legends inducted into IRB Hall of Fame |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=26 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027230745/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid%3D2060049.html#rwc+legends+inducted+into+irb+hall+fame |archivedate=27 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resignation and football coaching ==
Woodward's contract with England was due to run until 2007. Following the retirement of key players like [[Lawrence Dallaglio]] and [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]], and finishing third in the 6 Nations after the World Cup success, he found the politics of English rugby difficult to deal with, particularly the Premiership clubs' relations with the England management. Woodward was linked with a switch to [[soccer|football]] and, although he had denied these rumours, on 1 September 2004, Woodward announced that he would be quitting as England coach.

Initially, a move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton Football Club]] seemed likely, as Woodward was a friend of chairman [[Rupert Lowe]]. Lowe discussed this possibility with the club's board on 2 September 2004. However, in his resignation press conference, Woodward said that his intention was to take [[the Football Association]]'s Grade Two coaching badges after the 2005 [[British and Irish Lions]] tour to New Zealand:

:''I'm interested in , I intend to do the awards but I may end up coaching Maidenhead under-nines. You have to start at the bottom and I intend to do that.''

However, Woodward continued his move into the [[Football League]] in 2005 by becoming Performance Director at [[Southampton Football Club]], without undertaking any coaching at non-league clubs. With no experience of professional football, he again had problems with the politics of the situation, and was widely believed to have had a difficult relationship with the club's then-manager [[Harry Redknapp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/4294196.stm |title=Redknapp and Woodward deny rift |publisher=BBC News |date=29 September 2005 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, his appointee as head of sports science, [[Simon Clifford]], left the club in November 2005, after only two months, amid resentment from the club's existing staff.

Following the departure of Redknapp in December 2005, Woodward was suggested as a possible candidate for the manager's position at the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club, despite his lack of experience in the game. He was subsequently appointed [[Director of Football]] to work alongside newly appointed Head Coach, [[George Burley]]. On 31 August 2006 it was confirmed by Southampton that he was no longer working at the club.

== British Olympic Association ==

On 6 September 2006 it was announced that Woodward would be returning to sport as the new director of elite performance for the [[British Olympic Association]]. This is a role similar to that for which he was believed to be a candidate at his former employers the [[Rugby Football Union]] ([[Rob Andrew]] was eventually appointed to the position).

In 2007, he was appointed to the board of directors of [[Leicester Tigers]] as a [[non-executive director]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rugby Union |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/2324113/Clive-Woodward,-Rory-Underwood-back-at-Leicester-Tigers.html |title=Clive Woodward, Rory Underwood back at Leicester Tigers |publisher=Telegraph |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2008, he had the privilege to run with the Olympic torch while going through Russell Square, London.

'''Converse''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|v|ər|s}} is an American shoe company that primarily produces  [[skating shoes]] and [[lifestyle brand]] [[footwear]] and [[apparel]]. Founded in 1908, it has been a [[subsidiary]] of [[Nike, Inc.]] since 2003.&lt;ref name=nike03&gt;{{cite news |last=Wayne |first=Leslie |title=For $305 million, Nike buys Converse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/business/10NIKE.html |newspaper=the New York Times |accessdate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the company shifted its manufacturing from the public, and instead made footwear for the military. It was one of the few producers of athletic shoes and for over a half century the company dominated the American court shoe market. From the 1970s, the company lost its dominant position after other companies presented their own styles.

Converse shoes are distinguished by a number of features, including the company's star insignia, the All Star's rubber sole, smooth rounded toe, and wrap-around strip.

Converse manufactures its products under the Cons, [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars|Chuck Taylor All-Star]], [[John Varvatos]], and [[Jack Purcell]] trade names. In addition to apparel and footwear, the company sells other items through retailers in over 160 countries and through approximately 75 company-owned [[retail stores]] across the [[United States]],&lt;nowiki/&gt; and employed 2,658 in the U.S. in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Converse Inc Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Converse Inc|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Converse_Inc.aspx|website =www.encyclopedia.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:Black Converse sneakers.JPG|thumb|Black Converse Sneakers]]
At age 47, Marquis Mills Converse, who was previously a manager at a footwear manufacturing firm, opened the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in February 1908 in [[Malden, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=VaxzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA231&amp;dq=converse+history+timeline&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij_aG-q6rYAhXLWRQKHZQyDVoQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=converse%20history%20timeline&amp;f=false|title=The Impact of Globalization on the United States [3 volumes]|last=Bertho|first=Michelle|last2=Crawford|first2=Beverly|last3=Fogarty|first3=Edward A.|date=2008-09-30|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313083198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was a rubber shoe manufacturer, providing winterized rubber soled footwear for men, women, and children. By 1910, Converse was producing shoes daily, but it was not until 1915 that the company began manufacturing athletic shoes.

The company's catalyst came in 1917 when the [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars|Converse All-Star]] [[basketball]] shoe was introduced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then in 1923, a basketball player named [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Charles H. "Chuck" Taylor]] walked into Converse complaining of sore feet. Converse gave him a job: he worked as a salesman and ambassador, promoting the shoes around the U.S., and in 1932 Taylor's signature was added to the All-Star patch on the classic, high-topped sneakers. He continued this work until shortly before his death in 1969.&lt;ref name=knewthc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Fv4rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M20FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1717%2C8232748 |newspaper=Kentucky New Era |location=Hopkinsville |agency=Associated Press |title=Who the heck was Chuck Taylor anyway? |date=March 28, 2001 |page=A7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Converse also customized shoes for the [[New York Renaissance]] (the "Rens"), the first all–[[African American]] professional basketball team. In [[1961–62 NBA season|1962]], center [[Wilt Chamberlain]] of the [[1961–62 Philadelphia Warriors season|Philadelphia Warriors]] scored 100 points in an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game while wearing a pair of Chucks, taking a 169–147 victory over the [[1961–62 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]] on March 2.&lt;ref name=rewghan&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0BMrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SZwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2432%2C576737 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |location=Pennsylvania |agency=Associated Press |title=Wilt Breaks NBA Record; Gets 100 Against Knicks |date=March 3, 1962 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1941–2001: War, rise, bankruptcy, and new management ==
When the U.S. entered [[World War II]] in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. The company resumed production of athletic footwear after the war's end. Popular during the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted an American image with its Converse Basketball Yearbook. Artist [[Charles Kerins]] created cover art that celebrated Converse's role in the lives of high school and college athletes.

[[File:Jack Purcell shoes.jpg|thumb|right|Converse [[Jack Purcell]]s]] 
In the 1970s, Converse purchased the [[trademark|trademark rights]] to [[Jack Purcell]] sneakers from [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Perrin|first = Charles |title = Old Sneakers (since 1935) - Goodrich (now Converse) Jack Purcell | url=http://sneakers.pair.com/m-jack.htm| accessdate =2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse lost their monopoly from the 1970s onward, with new competitors, including [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Adidas]], then [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], then a decade later [[Reebok]], who introduced new designs to the sports market. Converse found themselves no longer the official shoe of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), a title they had relished for many years.

The chevron and star insignia—a logo that remains on a large portion of Converse footwear other than the All Star—was created by Jim Labadini, an employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2012/12/the-25-best-logos-in-sneaker-history/ |title=The 25 Best Logos in Sneaker History |publisher=Complex |date=December 6, 2012 |website=Complex |access-date=February 17, 2018 |quote=Jim Labadini helped cook up the Converse 2.0 logo during a time when sneaker brands where getting extremely competitive. The Converse Chevron logo marked the move forward into what would become an exciting time for the brand, thanks to some guys with nicknames like Dr. J, Magic and Legend.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canvas-rubber shoes regained popularity in the 1980s as casual footwear, but Converse eventually became over-dependent on the "All Stars" brand, whose market collapsed by 1989–1990. By the year 2000, Converse was slipping repeatedly into receivership as debt piled up yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/gen/news/2000/1017/823135.html |title=Converse Nears Corporate Extinction |last=Rovell |first=Darren |publisher=ESPN |date=October 18, 2000 |website=ESPN |access-date=February 17, 2018 |quote=Industry sources have confirmed that Converse has racked up $180 million in debt, and the announcement of the company's death is merely a formality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse filed for [[bankruptcy]] on January 22, 2001. Not too long after, on March 30, its last manufacturing plants in the U.S., closed down, as production fully moved overseas.&lt;ref&gt;?{{cite web |url=http://billingsgazette.com/business/converse-closes-chuck-taylor-plant/article_aa78045e-5e0e-5bd4-bf02-ef7033bc27c5.html |title=Converse closes Chuck Taylor plant |publisher=Associated Press |date=October 18, 2000 |website=Billings Gazette |access-date=March 30, 2001 |quote=The Lumberton plant that has churned out 8 million to 10 million pairs of Chuck Taylors a year has sent its 475 employees home, and the factory officially closes Saturday. Plants in Mission, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, are also being closed by the 93-year-old company.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Marsden Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David Maddocks to lead the turnaround of America's Original Sports Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/16/business/fi-22900 |title=Getting Sneaker Maker Converse Back on Its Feet |publisher=Associated Press |last=Pope |first=Justin |date=July 16, 2001 |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=February 17, 2018 |quote=Investors Marsden Cason and William Simon, through their company Footwear Acquisition, saw an opportunity in the Converse name.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nike==
In July 2003, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] paid [[United States dollar|$]]309 million to acquire Converse.&lt;ref name=nike03/&gt; Nike approached the 1980s revival around 2010 to relaunch the footwear. Nike also expanded the Converse brand to other businesses apart from shoes, much akin to its other brands.
 	
By November 2012, Converse had disappeared completely from the NBA, as the last dozen players wearing the brand either left the NBA or switched shoes over a period of a year and a half.  [[Carlos Arroyo]] went overseas in late 2011, and [[Maurice Evans (basketball)|Maurice Evans]] last played for the [[2011–12 Washington Wizards season|Washington Wizards]] in April [[2011–12 NBA season|2012]].  Nine switched to Nike: [[Acie Law]] (who went overseas) in late 2011; [[JJ Barea]] and [[Kirk Hinrich]] during the [[2011–12 NBA season|2011–12]] season; [[Luke Harangody]] and [[Larry Sanders (basketball)|Larry Sanders]] after the season; [[Elton Brand]], [[Lou Williams|Louis Williams]], and [[Kyle Korver]] for the [[2012–13 NBA season|2012–13]] season; and [[Chris Andersen]] during the season.  [[Udonis Haslem]], the last NBA player wearing Converse on the court, followed [[2012–13 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] teammate [[Dwyane Wade]] to switch to [[Li Ning Company Limited|Li-Ning]] in late November 2012.

Celebrities who have worn Converse include [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Kristen Stewart]] and [[Rihanna]]. The growth of Converse as a casual fashion accessory contributed to $1.7 billion in revenue in 2014 and $2 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NIKE, INC.

=== New headquarters ===
[[File:Converse Headquarters building.jpg|thumb|210px|Converse world headquarters building on [[Boston]]'s Lovejoy Wharf]]
In January 2013, Converse announced plans for a new headquarters building, and moved in April 2015. It was constructed near [[North Station]] in downtown Boston, on the [[Lovejoy Wharf]], overlooking the Charles River as part of a major site overhaul and restoration of public waterfront access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130108006830/en/Converse-Announces-Global-Headquarters-City-Boston|title=Converse Announces New Global Headquarters in the City of Boston|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-story {{convert|214,000|sqft|adj=on}} office building includes a permanent music recording studio for the new "Converse Rubber Tracks" project, {{convert|5000|sqft|adj=on}} gym with a separate yoga studio designed in partnership with Nike, and a new {{convert|3500|sqft|adj=on}} retail Flagship Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CONVERSE OFFICIALLY OPENS WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN BOSTON AND DEBUTS NEW FLAGSHIP STORE|url = http://media.converse.com/news/converse-officially-opens-world-headquartesr-in-boston-and-debuts-new-flagship-store#/inline/33242|website = Converse Media|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chuck Taylor All Star II ===
An improved model of the [[Chuck Taylor All-Star]], the ''Chuck Taylor II'', was announced by company management in July, 2015.&lt;ref name="CTII"&gt;Converse's new Chuck Taylors get a comfort boost, ''Boston Globe'', July 22, 2015;  [https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/07/21/after-years-converse-set-unveil-chuck-taylor/RdAdxoiLOs8dva8tHtVxLN/story.html?p1=Article_Trending_Most_Viewed Minimalist sneaker launched in 1917 receives upgrade with Nike tech]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chuck Taylor II's were released on July 28, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CONVERSE USHERS IN NEW ERA WITH GROUND-BREAKING CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STAR II|url = http://media.converse.com/news/converse-ushers-in-new-era-with-ground-breaking-chuck-taylor-all-star-ii|website = Converse Media|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating Nike technology, it retains the most of outward appearance of the original while employing a modern lightweight lunarlon insole.&lt;ref name="CTII" /&gt; The notable changes made to the new sneakers are the removal of the wrap around strip, premium canvas with higher quality stitching, and a no slip tongue.

===Skateboarding market===
Under the "CONS" name, Converse launched its skateboarding program in 2009 with a team of "ambassadors": Kenny Anderson, Anthony Pappalardo, Nick Trapasso, Sammy Baca, Ethan Fowler, Raymond Molinar, and [[Rune Glifberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cons Comes Back: A Look at Converse Skateboarding|url=http://push.ca/blogs/andrewsk/archive/2009/05/13/cons-comes-back-a-look-at-converse-skateboarding.aspx|work=Push.ca|publisher=Bell Canada|accessdate=9 September 2012|author=asayer|date=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the company added [[Jason Jessee]] and Mike Anderson to its ambassadors team.&lt;ref name="Cons"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambassadors|url=http://www.converse.com/content/landing/index.aspx?command=N:3066-100060|work=Converse.com|publisher=Converse Inc|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Converse sponsored a skate event at [[Huntington Beach]], [[California]], US. Trapasso, Tom Remillard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nick Trapasso, Tom Remillard &amp; Robbie Russo at Coastal Carnage! Weeke ... |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-ChrtyTyQ|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=20 January 2013|author=RIDE Channel |author2=Rob Brink |author3=Erica Yary|format=Video upload|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Homoki]], Greyson Fletcher, Ben Raemers, Ben Hatchell, Robbie Russo, and Ben Raybourn participated in the competition that was held.  Raybourn eventually won the US$20,000 grand prize and Homoki won the US$3,000 Best Trick contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAYBOURN CRUISES THROUGH CARNAGE|url=http://xgames.espn.go.com/skateboarding/article/8238185/ben-raybourn-wins-converse-coastal-carnage|work=ESPN Action Sports|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=20 January 2013|author=Lance Dawes|author2=Cory Williams|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, the CONS skateboard team consisted of original members Anderson, Trapasso, Baca, and Glifberg, while Jessee, Anderson, Julian Davidson, Remillard, Zered Basset, Ben Raemers, Jake Johnson, Eli Reed, Louis Lopez, Sage Elsesser, and Sean Pablo were subsequently added.&lt;ref name="Cons" /&gt;  Bassett filmed a new advertisement that was broadcast online during July 2014, in which he skateboarded through [[New York City]] in a newly launched skate shoe version of the Converse Weapon model, the "CONS Weapon Skate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Brian Farmer|title=Converse Launches the CONS Weapon Skate Shoe with Short Film featuring Zered Bassett|url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2014/07/20/converse-cons-weapon-skate/|website=High Snobiety|publisher=Titel Media|accessdate=26 July 2014|date=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit ===
Starting in July 2008, Converse sent around 180 cease-and-desist letters to over 30 other companies who they claimed were violating the alleged Chuck Taylor All Star trademark and selling so-called look-alike sneakers.

In October 2014, Converse filed a lawsuit against 30 companies for allegedly infringing on its generic sneaker style's bumper toe, striped midsole and toe cap. The brand argued that companies were violating an alleged common-law trademark by importing sneakers with similar elements. A number of companies settled with Converse and they were dropped from the list.&lt;ref&gt;Schiavenza, Matt, "Why Converse is Fighting to Keep All Stars Cool," The Atlantic, 15 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler-Young, Sheena, "Iconix and Fila Settle in Converse Lawsuit Saga," Footwear News, 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Charles Bullock, chief administrative judge at the International Trade Commission, preliminarily ruled that several brands Converse filed against were violating Converse's outsole design trademarks, i.e. the pattern on the bottom of the sole of the shoe. Judge Bullock further ruled that while [[Skechers]] "Twinkle Toes" brands did share similarities to Converse, "Twinkle Toes" were different enough and marketed in a way for it not to be mistaken for [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Converse Trademark Lawsuit: Skechers Declares Victory, Mixed Ruling Expected Overall|url = http://footwearnews.com/2015/business/uncategorized/converse-trademark-lawsuit-ruling-skechers-twinkle-toes-bobs-171481/|website = Footwear News|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US|first = Margaret|last = Sutherlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Bullock also ruled that most of the shoes sold by Highline United under the Ash brand did not infringe and that Converse did not have a valid common law mark for its midsole.

On June 23, 2016, the anniversary of the death of Chuck Taylor, the International Trade Commission ruled that Converse's alleged trade dress for the midsole design of a combined toe cap, toe bumper, and stripe was not entitled to trademark protection under the common law and found invalid Converse's federal trademark registration.  This case is currently on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. An oral hearing in that appeal was conducted on February 8, 2018.  The decision in that appeal is pending.

== Shoes ==

=== The Weapon ===
[[File:Converse Weapons.JPG|thumb|right|The Weapon, manufactured in many different color schemes]]
In 1986, Converse released "The Weapon" basketball shoe. Manufactured in two color schemes to match the kit colors of basketball teams, it has been available in both high-top and low cut varieties. The unique{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} aspect of this shoe is the leather construction throughout, including the inside heel which is also heavily padded for comfort.  Converse re-released "The Weapon" classic (which [[Kobe Bryant]] wore at least three times in 2002 and [[Andre Miller]] wore in 2002 from mid August to early September) several times from 1999 to 2003 and after, "The Loaded Weapon" in 2003, "The Weapon 86" in 2008 (and the Poorman version in 2009, and the [[John Varvatos]] version in 2012), "The Weapon EVO" in 2009, and its successor "The Star Player EVO" (sometimes reduced to "The Star Plyr EVO" or "The Star Ply EVO") in 2010.

The first endorsers of "The Weapon" were [[Larry Bird]] and [[Magic Johnson]], who were prominently featured in a Converse commercial set in Bird's hometown of [[French Lick, Indiana]] in 1985. They were also worn by [[Axl Rose]] in the [[Guns N' Roses]] music video "[[Estranged (single)|Estranged]]".

=== Special editions ===

==Causes==
A special collection called "1Hund (RED)", whereby fifteen percent of the profits are used to support [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, was released by the brand. One hundred artists from around the world were chosen to create designs for the collection as part of the (RED) campaign. Professional skateboarder, Anthony Pappalardo, who, at the time, was also associated with another (RED) participant, Girl skateboards—Pappalardo was sponsored by Chocolate skateboards, a brand distributed by the [[Girl Distribution Company|Crailtap]], the distribution company that owns both Girl and Chocolate—released a (RED) edition of his high-selling&lt;ref name="Blocks"&gt;{{cite web|title = Anthony Pappalardo|url = http://site.48blocks.com/anthony-pappalardo|work = 48 Blocks|publisher = 48 Blocks|accessdate = 20 January 2013|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signature skate shoe model.&lt;ref name="Trans"&gt;{{cite web|title = ANTHONY PAPPALARDO'S PROJECT RED CONS PRO MODEL|url = http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000096243/gear/shoes/anthony-pappalardos-project-red-cons-pro-model/|work = Transworld Skateboarding|publisher = Bonnier Corporation|accessdate = 20 January 2013|author = Blair Alley|date = 2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short video piece was published on the internet&lt;ref name="Pops"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthony Pappalardo and (RED)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkTUwB26Zo |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=20 January 2013|author=Aaron Meza|author2=crailtap|format=Video upload|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pappalardo explains in it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I got into woodworking about two years ago, through a buddy of mine who I used to skate with every day—he turned into a woodworker. So he gave me this scrap box of wood, and, basically, I just wanted to do something with it ... make something with it. It just definitely started consuming me like skating did. I wanted to read about it, you know? Go on the internet and watch videos about it, and just learn anything and everything I could about woodworking. The first thing I ever made was a bench, and that's, kinda, what I've been making ever since. the cool thing about working with Product (RED) is just by doing the two things that I love, I'm also able to help people.&lt;ref name="Pops" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pappalardo's first signature shoe with Converse was released in February 2010 and it was produced in the (RED) colorway.&lt;ref name="Trans" /&gt;

In 2012, Converse is listed as a partner in the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as [[Nike Inc.]], Girl, and Bugaboo. The campaign's mission is to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to child by 2015 (the campaign's byline is "Fighting For An AIDS Free Generation").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=(RED) |url=http://www.joinred.com/aboutred/red-partners/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528191704/http://www.joinred.com/aboutred/red-partners/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 May 2012 |work=(RED) Partners |publisher=(RED), a division of The ONE Campaign |accessdate=13 October 2012 |year=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In winter of 2018, Converse teamed up with a number of influential figures and taste-makers from the Los Angeles area to create an exclusive collection paying to those who help move the culture forward in the city. Among those selected by the Boston-based footwear brand for this L.A.-themed collection is [[Vince Staples]], Dr. Woo, Rocket, BornXRaised, and Clot

[[File:John O'Brien has a drink (2006).jpg|thumb|Rehydrating after exercise
|318x318px]]'''Cooling down''' (also known as limbering  down) is an easy exercise, done after a more intense activity, to allow the body to gradually transition to a resting or near-resting state.  Depending on the intensity of the exercise, cooling down can involve a slow jog or walk.  With lower intensities stretching can be used. Cooling down allows the heart rate to return to its resting rate.  Anecdotally cooling down may reduce dizziness for professional or serious athletes and vocal performers after strenuous workouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.2478/v10078-012-0079-4 | volume=35 | title=The Effect of Warm-Up and Cool-Down Exercise on Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness in the Quadriceps Muscle: a Randomized Controlled Trial | journal=Journal of Human Kinetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are currently inconclusive as to whether the process actually reduces [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|delayed-onset muscle soreness]]&lt;ref&gt;Law RYW and Herbert RD(2007) Warm-up reduces delayed-onset muscle soreness but cool-down does not: a randomised controlled trial.

==Procedure==
Cool downs should involve the following important steps to ensure an effective cool down. After exercise, a gradual yet continuous decrease in exercise intensity (i.e. from a hard run to an easy jog to a brisk walk) should be the first step in cooling down the body. Duration can vary for different people, but 3–10 minutes is considered adequate. Stretching, especially static stretching allows the muscles to be elongated and lengthened.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is the next step athletes should take to cool down. Rehydration is an essential part of the procedure and should be done either during stretching and light intensity or after these steps. Refuelling the body with  water and sports drinks will keep the body hydrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Coso, J.D. |author2=Estevez, E. |author3=Baquero, R. |author4= Mora-Rodriguez, R. |last-author-amp=yes |date=2008|title=Anaerobic performance when rehydrating with water or commercially available sports drink during prolonged exercise  in heat.|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Anaerobic+performance+when+rehydrating+with+water+or+commercially+available+sports+drinks+during+prolonged+exercise+in+the+heat&amp;rft.jtitle=Applied+Physiology%2C+Nutrition%2C+and+Metabolism&amp;rft.au=Juan+Del+Coso&amp;rft.au=Emma+Estevez&amp;rft.au=Raúl+Antonio+Baquero&amp;rft.au=Ricardo+Mora-Rodriguez&amp;rft.date=2008-04-01&amp;rft.pub=Canadian+Science+Publishing+NRC+Research+Press&amp;rft.issn=1715-5312&amp;rft.volume=33&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=290&amp;rft.externalDocID=1459079771&amp;paramdict=en-AU|journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition &amp; Metabolism|doi=10.1139/H07-188|pmid=18347684|access-date=May 2016 |volume=33 |pages=290–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Stretching-muscles-579122 640.jpg|thumb|310x310px|Static stretching]]

== Stretching ==
[[Stretching]] is a very important factor in the procedure of cooling down. Stretching allows the bodies muscles to build elasticity and repair from aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

Static stretching is the appropriate form of stretching to aid in the cooling down procedure. It aids in decreasing the body’s temperature, removing lactic acid from the muscles and increasing flexibility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stretchcoach.com/articles/cool-down/|title=Cool Down Exercises - 3 parts to an effective cool down|website=stretchcoach.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each stretch should be held for a minimum of 10–20 seconds and stretched to the point of mild discomfort but not pain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/participating/resources/coaches/tools/the_training_session/Warmup-Cooldown|title=The warm up and cool down|last=Australian Institute of Sport|first=|website=www.ausport.gov.au|publisher=Australian Sports Commission|language=English|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each muscle used in mid-high intensity exercise should then be stretched during the cool down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Half-time cooling down ==
This is a popular process for elite sporting clubs and athletes.  It involves using either ice vests, cooling products or manually cooling down the body through gentle light intensity exercise to cool down the body during half-time or breaks in an activity or sport. Half- time cooling down has proven to decrease body temperature and increase aerobic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Hornery D.J |author2=Papalia S |author3=Mujika I |author4=Hahn A |date=March 2005|title=Physiological and performance benefits of halftime cooling|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/science/article/pii/S1440244005800209|journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|doi=10.1016/S1440-2440(05)80020-9|pmid=|access-date=May 2016 |volume=8 |pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sporting groups use cooling down jackets during half-time. Australian elite sporting teams such as those in the AFL, Olympic teams, military and elite athletes across all sporting fields use cooling down vests to increase performance and gain a competitive advantage over their competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arcticheat.com.au/sporting/|title=Sporting|last=Arctic Heat|date=|website=Arctic Heat - High Tech Cooling Vests|publisher=Arctic Heat|access-date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiovascular Issues, Health, and Heart rate==
[[File:Xx0896 - Cycling Atlanta Paralympics - 3b - Scan (173).jpg|thumb|Paralympian using an ice vest]]
During aerobic exercise, peripheral veins, particularly those within a muscle, dilate to accommodate the increased blood flow through exercising muscle. The [[skeletal-muscle pump]] assists in returning blood to the heart and maintaining cardiac output. A sudden cessation of strenuous exercise may cause blood to pool in peripheral dilated veins which may  cause [[varicose veins]].  A cool-down period allows a more gradual return to [[Vein#Venous tone|venous tone]]. The heart  will also need to beat faster to adequately oxygenate the body and maintain [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://doc.med.yale.edu/heartbk/12.pdf|title=High Blood pressure|last=Moser|first=Marvin|date=May 2016|website=Yale University School of Medicine: Heart book|publisher=Yale University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is theorised that individuals predisposed to, suffering from, or at risk for cardiovascular disease may be at risk for potential negative cardiovascular outcomes if a cool down is not completed following exercise bouts due to a rapid decrease in blood reaching areas of the heart (with narrowed blood vessels due to present cardiovascular disease).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This, however, is only a theory, and clinical evidence for this is currently lacking.

Muscular and skeletal injuries have also been found to increase when the cool down procedure is neglected. Ankle injuries are one of the most common injuries athletes and participants are at risk of obtaining when the cool down is performed ineffectively or not at all.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goossens, L.

The '''Donington Grand Prix Collection''', sometime known as the ''Donington Grand Prix Exhibition'', was a museum of [[motor racing]] cars, based at the [[Donington Park]] motor racing circuit in [[Leicestershire]], England.  The museum closed permanently on 5 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autosport.com/historics/news/139307/donington-collection-museum-to-close|title=Donington Collection museum to close next month|first=Paul|last=Lawrence|website=autosport.com|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
With five halls and over 130 exhibits, the Donington Grand Prix Collection comprises the largest exhibition of [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] cars in the world.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The collection contains vehicles from many forms of open-wheel, single-seater racing, but is primarily focussed on Grand Prix and [[Formula One]] machinery. The museum was formed by the late [[Tom Wheatcroft]] in March 1973 and is based on Wheatcroft's personal collection of vehicles. These include some that Wheatcroft's own motor racing team ran for drivers such as [[Roger Williamson]] and [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]], although many cars exhibited are on loan from other owners. Various external collections of [[automobilia]] and motor racing [[ephemera]] have been donated to the museum over the years.

Specific attractions include the world's only complete collection of [[Vanwall]] cars, a near-complete collection of [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] Formula One cars from the team's inception to the early 2000s, and extensive collections of [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] and [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] cars (including examples of both notorious BRM [[V16 engine|V16]]-powered machines as well as the [[H16 engine|H16]]-powered BRM P83). The collection also has examples of four different [[four-wheel drive]] Formula One cars, including an unraced [[Cosworth]] car. Another star exhibit is the [[Lotus 18]] with which [[Stirling Moss]] won the [[1961 Monaco Grand Prix]], along with [[Jim Clark]]'s World Championship-winning [[Lotus 25]]. Noticeable, however, is the distinct lack of Ferrari vehicles, 3 in all, but fine examples nonetheless. First being a [[Ferrari 312]] driven by Chris Amon, second a [[312B]] and thirdly, a [[Ferrari F2000]] (The particular chassis driven to victory in the [[2000 Canadian Grand Prix]], one of nine victories for [[Michael Schumacher]] in his maiden championship winning series with Ferrari), conversely, the establishment houses the [[Jordan 191]] in which he made his formula 1 debut in 1991. The 1998 [[Jordan 198]], the most successful in Jordan's history, (the chassis being the one Damon Hill drove to victory in a 1-2 with team mate [[Ralf Schumacher]] at the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Spa Francorchamps]]) also figures.  Another interesting exhibit is an Auto Union, built from pre-war plans following the factory's destruction by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing during [[World War II]]. Wheatcroft has also supplemented the racing car collection with some additional notable cars, including a replica of the personal [[Bugatti Royale]] of [[Ettore Bugatti]].

Augmenting the car collections are the world's largest collection of motor racing helmets; [[Fangio]], [[Graham Hill]],&lt;!-- Hill's name in full to clarify that it's Graham, not Damon --&gt; [[Nigel Mansell|Mansell]], [[James Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Fernando Alonso|Alonso]] amongst others, a small collection of racing [[motorcycles]], including a [[Daijiro Kato]] Honda and a [[Barry Sheene]] Heron Texaco [[Suzuki]] and a number of collections of trophies and awards gained by a selection of British drivers and riders. In addition to exhibits, the Donington Grand Prix Collection museum also incorporates a conference suite and gift shop.

The Donington Grand Prix Collection was closed briefly in late 2009 in the wake of the death of Tom Wheatcroft and Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd. entering administration. It reopened in January 2010, along with the cafe and race control offices.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Beer, [http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80753 Wheatcrofts vow to reopen Donington], ''[[Autosport]]'', 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum sold the Jim Clark Lotus 25 c.2008 to an unknown private collector.  Although it is no longer on public display, it has given the car the chance to be raced on track by Damon Hill and David Coulthard.  Several other Formula 1 cars have also disappeared from the museum including Jackie Stewart's 1973 championship winning Tyrrell, Lotus 72 and Ferrari F2000.  These cars may have been sold in order to solve Donington's financial problems when it enlarged the circuit and attempted to host the 2012 British Grand Prix.

==The McLaren Hall==

The Donington Collection is home to the largest exhibition (being almost comprehensive of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s) of McLaren vehicles. Highlights of the collection include the #1 [[McLaren M23]] driven by Formula 1 World Champion [[James Hunt]] in 1977, the [[McLaren MP4/14]] chassis number 4, untouched after crossing the line and affirming [[Mika Häkkinen]] as {{F1|1999}} Formula 1 World Champion, also, the 1993 [[McLaren MP4/8|MP4/8]] driven to victory by [[Ayrton Senna]] on location at the [[1993 European Grand Prix]]. An [[McLaren MP4/4|MP4/4]], designed by [[Gordon Murray]] carrying chassis number 3 and being the only example of said model to not win a Grand Prix stands in exhibition of the all conquering McLaren of the [[1988 Formula One season]]. Conversely, its lacklustre predecessor, the [[Steve Nichols]] designed [[McLaren MP4/3|MP4/3]] [[Techniques d'Avant Garde|TAG]] [[Porsche]] twin-turbo stands alongside it in a diachronic exhibition of Mclaren creations. In addition, rarities such as a Häkkinen's [[McLaren MP4/13|MP4/13]] in test livery (prior to the unveiling of their new sponsorship ahead of the [[1998 Formula One season|1998 season]]), an [[McLaren M14A|M14A]] driven by [[Denny Hulme]] and an [[McLaren MP4/2|MP4/2]], the car that took [[Alain Prost]] to his first World Drivers' Championship in [[1985 Formula One season|1985]]. Alongside these lie helmets of great drivers who drove for the Woking based outfit over the years such as Senna, Prost, [[Niki Lauda|Lauda]], Häkkinen, [[Gerhard Berger|Berger]] and [[David Coulthard|Coulthard]].

The '''Düsseldorf Open''' (formerly known as the '''Power Horse Cup''') was a professional men's [[tennis]] tournament played on outdoor [[Clay court|Clay]] in [[Düsseldorf]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. The event was affiliated with the [[ATP World Tour 250 series|ATP 250]] series, on the [[ATP Tour]].  The initial event took place on 18–25 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://power-horse-cup.com/www/start/ Tournament homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Düsseldorf to host ATP World Tour 250 tournament|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2012/10/Features/Dusseldorf-To-Host-ATP-World-Tour-250.aspx|publisher=ATP|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monaco hits from to win inaugural Dusseldorf title|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2013/05/21/Dusseldorf-Saturday-Monaco-Nieminen.aspx|publisher=ATP|date=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 edition of the tournament took place without a title sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rainer Wallasch|title=Düsseldorf Open: Kohlschreiber triumphiert|url=http://www.wz-newsline.de/lokales/duesseldorf/sport/duesseldorf-open-kohlschreiber-triumphiert-1.1646171|work=Westdeutsche Zeitung|date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the event was cancelled before the [[2015 ATP World Tour]], due a lack of sponsorship, and the tournament's spot in the schedule was awarded to the [[Geneva Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATP Dusseldorf Open dropped due to lack of sponsorship|url=http://www1.skysports.com/tennis/news/12040/9542622/atp-dusseldorf-open-dropped-due-to-lack-of-sponsorship|work=SkySports|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2254">The '''Elcho Shield''' is an annual [[Match Rifle]] competition between national teams of eight from [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Wales]]. The trophy holder is able to choose the venue of the competition, however, since the NRA's move to Surrey from Wimbledon in the 19th century, the competition has been held at Bisley Ranges, [[Surrey]], England.  Each shooter fires fifteen shots at {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1100|yd|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1200|yd|abbr=on}} with, unusually for a shooting discipline, no "sighting" or practice shots.  The shooters may be coached which allows other team members to judge and make necessary adjustments to the shooter's sights.  The rules allow each team two hours at each range to fire all their shots.  The match is most regularly held following the national championships in July each year.

The first match, on Wednesday July 9th 1862, was held over {{convert|800|yd|abbr=on}}, {{convert|900|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1000|yd|abbr=on}} solely between Scotland and England. In the event England won by 166 marks.  Scotland won the trophy for the first time in 1864 and Ireland joined the fray in 1865.

The trophy is large and distinctive, known as the Elcho Shield, and is made from a sheet of [[iron]] decorated with repousse scenes to a design by the artist [[George Frederic Watts|G. F. Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=M.S.|year=1912|title=George Frederic Watts|location=London|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|volume=1|pages=197-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LneiSQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was presented to the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom]] by its founder and president, [[Francis Richard Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss|Lord Elcho]] (Francis Richard Charteris, 10th [[Earl of Wemyss]] and 6th [[Earl of March]], b. 1818, d. 1914).

The current holder of the trophy is England (2017).

The '''National Stadium Sports Complex''' ({{lang-pt|Complexo Desportivo do Estádio Nacional/Complexo Desportivo do Jamor}}), also known as ''Jamor Sports Complex'', is a [[List of national stadiums|national football ground]] used by the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]] and, as of 2018, by [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] [[Sociedade Anónima Desportiva|SAD]]. It is located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of [[Algés, Linda-a-Velha e Cruz Quebrada-Dafundo]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Oeiras, Portugal|Oeiras]], in the western part of [[Lisbon District]].

The stadium entered UEFA history as host of the first ever game played in UEFA club competitions. The game was played on 4 September 1955 between [[1954–55 Primeira Divisão|Primeira Divisão]]'s third-placed team, [[Sporting CP]], and Yugoslav champions, Serbian side [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]. It ended as a 3–3 draw and was the first game to be played of the [[1955–56 European Cup|first edition]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2274124.html|title = When Sporting and Partizan broke new ground|date = 4 September 2015|accessdate = 22 December 2015|website = www.uefa.com|publisher = José Nuno Pimentel|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1933, the decision was made to construct the national stadium alongside the Jamor ravine.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=22419 |title=Complexo Desportivo do Estádio Nacional/Complexo Desportivo do Jamor (IPA.00022419/PT031110080066) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Patrícia |last=Costa |first2=Margarida |last2=Elias |editor=Centro de Investigação em Arquitectura, Urbanismo e Design (CIAUD-FA/UTL) |year=2014 |accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original design was authored by [[Francisco Caldeira Cabral]] and Konrad Weisner &lt;ref&gt;Do Estádio Nacional ao Jardim Gulbenkian, Francisco Caldeira Cabral e a Primeira Geração de Arquitectos Paisagistas, de Teresa Andresen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proffranciscocaldeiracabral.portaldojardim.com/projectos/o-estadio-nacional-e-a-polemica-que-envolveu-este-projecto/|title=Centenário Francisco Caldeira Cabral   » O Estádio Nacional e a polémica que envolveu este projecto.|author=|date=|website=proffranciscocaldeiracabral.portaldojardim.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacobetty Rosa]], with working beginning in 1939.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

It was inaugurated on 10 June 1944 ([[Portugal Day]]) by the [[Prime-minister|Council president]] [[António Oliveira Salazar]].

Work was complete in the Quinta da Graça (in 1953), to install the ''Comissão Administrativa do Estádio Nacional'' (''National Stadium Administrative Commission'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1961, construction on the hippodrome began, in addition to the first phase of work on the shooting range, by the ''Serviços de Construção e de Conservação'' (''Construction and Conservation Services'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

The ''Plano de Ordenamento do Complexo Desportivo da Jamor'' (''Jamor Sports Complex Development Plan'') was issued on July 1982, ordered by the DGEMN ''Direção-Geral de Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais'' (''Directorate-General for Buildings and National Monuments''), authored by the architects Vasco Croft (coordinator), Nuno Bártolo and Joaquim Cadima, and by the landscape firm Professor Caldeira Cabral, Associados, Estudos e Projectos, Ld. (under the direction of landscape architects Francisco Caldeira Cabral and agronomist engineer João Caldeira Cabral.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; During this phase, diagnostic studies were performed to reformulate and re-evaluate the strategic importance of the complex.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In May 1985, the study ''Estabelecimento de zona de protecção'' (to establish a protection zone) was ordered by the DGEMN, by architects Vasco Croft and Nuno Bártolo, to limit the sports complex zone, providing a buffer for military access, a ''non aedificandi'' zone and urban growth, in addition to spansion for greenspaces and support areas for nautical sports.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1993, a project to construct a sporting pavilion in Jamor was issued.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In September 2012, the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] announced that the stadium would undergo renovation in which work would begin in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=350939 |title=Jamor vai acolher a "Cidade do Futebol": obras começam em 2014 |trans-title=Jamor will host the "Soccer City": works begin in 2014 |work=[[A Bola]] |language=Portuguese |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=26 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030224643/http://www.abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=350939 |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced by the Rugby governing body [[European Rugby Cup|ERC]] on 2 September that the Portuguese team would hold their home games at the Estádio Nacional.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/news/22029.php#.UiS1Kza-2So {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905092645/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/news/22029.php |date=2013-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all their home games were played at the [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portuguese national rugby teams]] home stadium of [[Estádio Universitário de Lisboa]].

On 6 February 2015, a tender was issued to cover the western edge of the audience seating for the rugby field.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
Architecturally the stadium is noteworthy for its open east side, unusual for a stadium otherwise featuring a typical oval configuration. Its current capacity is 39,000 and it is the venue for the Portuguese football cup final.

==Sport==
===Football===
The stadium has traditionally hosted the final of the [[Cup of Portugal|Portuguese Cup]] (since 1946); in only five times was this game played in other venues and in total, 52 Cup finals have been played on the grounds. Portuguese football fans have bemoaned the historic stadium, owing to a lack of amenities; following the Euro 2004, there was a movement to move the event to one of the grounds built for the Euro football championships. 

The most prestigious international game ever staged at the ''Estádio Nacional'' was the [[European Cup 1966-67|1967 European Cup]] [[1967 European Cup Final|final]], played between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] with the former winning 2-1 (becoming the first [[United Kingdom|British]] European champion team, nicknamed the ''[[Lisbon Lions]]'').

In addition to hosting the [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese national team]] since in 1945, the site has held 49 international events for Portugal.

==National teams==
The national team have qualified for the final tournament of the  [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] once in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] which was held in [[Mexico]]. Success in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]] has been more widespread, winning the tournament in [[2007 AFC Asian Cup|2007]] and finishing fourth in [[1976 AFC Asian Cup|1976]] and [[2015 AFC Asian Cup|2015]]. As of 2015 the [[Iraq women's national football team|women's national team]] have not entered either of these competitions.

The [[Iraq national under-23 football team|under-23 side]] has had success at the [[Asian Games]] winning silver at the [[Football at the 2006 Asian Games|2006 edition]] in [[Qatar]] and bronze in [[Football at the 2014 Asian Games|2014]], [[South Korea]]. Their best placing in [[Olympic football]] has been fourth at [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]] in 2004.

As for 29 June 2015 the men's team were [[FIFA World Rankings|ranked]] 86th in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html |title=FIFA rankings |publisher=fifa.com |date=2015-06-29 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the women's team joint 138th (and last) due to being inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/women/index.html |title=FIFA rankings |publisher=fifa.com |date=2015-06-29 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club tournaments==
[[Al-Shorta SC]] reached the final of the [[1971 Asian Champion Club Tournament|1971 AFC Champions League]], the biggest tournament in Asian football, but withdrew from the final due to it being against an Israeli team; Israel were subsequently expelled from the AFC and the Arab media considers Al-Shorta to be the tournament's winners that year. [[Al-Rasheed SC]] also reached the final in [[1988–89 Asian Club Championship|1989]] but lost on away goals. Those same two clubs are the only Iraqi teams to have won the [[Arab Club Champions Cup]]; Al-Shorta won the first ever edition in [[1980–82 Arab Club Champions Cup|1982]] with Al-Rasheed winning that competition three times in a row (1985, 1986, 1987). In terms of second-tier continental cups, [[Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya]] won the [[AFC Cup]] in both [[2016 AFC Cup|2016]] and [[2017 AFC Cup|2017]].

The '''Hazza bin Zayed Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|استاد هزاع بن زايد}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]], located in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]], City of [[Al Ain]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is the home stadium of [[Al Ain FC]] of the [[UAE Pro-League]]. The stadium holds 22,717 spectators and opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uae.agleague.ae/en/club/al-ain.html|title=Al Ain - Clubs - UAE Pro League Committee|first=XS|last=Studios|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Ain's Hazza bin Zayed Stadium nears completion"&gt;{{cite news |title=Al Ain's Hazza bin Zayed Stadium nears completion|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/in-pictures-al-ain-s-hazza-bin-zayed-stadium-nears-completion|newspaper=The National|date=|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was named after the chairman of the club, Sheikh [[Hazza bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]].

The 45,000sqm Hazza bin Zayed stadium is split over seven levels, and is one of the most modern sporting venues in the [[Middle East]]. It is one of the most sophisticated sports venues in the region.

The stadium was broke ground in April 2012 and was completed in December 2014. It was planned that [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]] faced [[Manchester City]] in the inaugural ceremony of the stadium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/manchester-city-to-play-al-ain-at-opening-of-hazza-bin-zayed-stadium|title=Manchester City to play Al Ain at opening of Hazza bin Zayed Stadium|newspaper=The National (United Arab Emirates)|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but City drew 1–1 with [[Blackburn Rovers]] in an [[2013–14 FA Cup#Third round proper|English FA Cup]] match on 4 January and a replay with Rovers scheduled on 15 January prevented the English [[Premier League]] champions from a trip to the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/manchester-city-will-not-play-in-al-ain|newspaper=The National (United Arab Emirates)|title=Manchester City will not play in Al Ain|date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the friendly was instead played after the Premier League season was over and Manchester City beat Al Ain 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2629147/Al-Ain-vs-Manchester-City-live-Follow-post-season-friendly-UAE-happens.html|title=Al Ain 0-3 Manchester City: Samir Nasri on form|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium will also host the [[2017 FIFA Club World Cup|2017]] and [[2018 FIFA Club World Cup|2018]] [[FIFA Club World Cup]]s and the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]].

==Location and design==
[[File:Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium night.jpg|thumb|left|Night illumination of the stadium [[façade]] during stadium's opening]]
The 25,000 seat stadium is located in [[Al Ain]], approximately 150 kilometres east of [[Abu Dhabi]], close to the borders of [[Oman]]. It was designed and built under a contract for a multi-functional stadium in the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baminternational.com/projects/hazza-bin-zayed-stadium-abu-dhabi|title=Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium - Abu Dhabi - BAM International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Client was represented by AAFAQ Holdings. The project was realised in close cooperation with sister companies [[Royal BAM Group|BAM Sports]], specialised in stadium construction, and BAM Contractors from [[Ireland]]. The scope of work included the construction of a multi-functional stadium with a gross floor area of 45,000 square metres. In addition BAM built a six-storey office building, a sports hall and external works comprising roads, car parking, playing fields and landscaping. The stadium architects were London based Pattern Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pattern-architects.com/project/hazza-bin-zayed-stadium|title=Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium - Pattern|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most characteristic elements of the stadium is the external facade which consists of fabric elements resembling the trunk of a palm tree that also can be lighted by [[LED]] lights in 15 different content modes. On the top of the stadium roof, 200 floodlights are fixed to provide the illumination of after-dark soccer games. Due to the extreme temperatures during the hot summer months, the palm bowl shape of the roof also provides pleasant conditions for both the players and the fans. It is one of the stadium's unique features, which is designed in a way that matches can take place in the shadow after 5pm. On the inside, it reveals the complex geometry of its cantilevered steel trusses, which was achieved by using robotic cutting and welding technology. The stadium is the first stadium in the world to featuring a unique parasol roof designed specifically to fully shade all fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baminternational.com/sites/default/files/domain-61/documents/002456_-_235_hazza_bin_zayed_stadium_and_mixed_use_development_al_ain_abu_dhabi_uae-61-13935765141872114764.pdf Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium and mixed use development, Al Ain, UAE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium was voted Stadium of the Year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/competitions/stadium_of_the_year_2014#jury|title=Stadium of the Year 2014 – StadiumDB.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The stadium has been completed after a 16-month ultra-fast track construction project after being started on 1 June 2012. Built to [[FIFA]] standards, the stadium covers an area of 45,000 square metres with a capacity of 25,000 seats. The scope of the project further included a sports hall, commercial buildings and extensive exterior landscaping. The stadium is part of another further development that covers 500,000 square metres and includes 700 apartments, green spaces, two office buildings, 50 restaurants, shops and a 170-room hotel.

The project is the first component of this broader development that will have its effect first on the city of [[Al Ain]], but also on the wider region including the neighboring countries of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. It was a design and build contract. BAM introduced a lot of value engineering proposals which had to be integrated into the design and therefore new building permits were required within the 18 months. BAM International started the project in mid-2012 and remained right on schedule with all aspects of the construction, making use of 10.5 million man hours. At peak there were 400 men staff up to the supervisor level and 4500 labourers on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/604755/hazza-bin-zayed-stadium-pattern-design/|title=Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium / Pattern Design|date=4 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a first-class, full-service facility, offering 12 lighted hard courts with a clubhouse and pro shop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.troytrojans.com/sports/2010/6/14/LunsfordTennisComplex.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the home ground of the [[Club Brugge K.V.]] until the "Olympia Park" (''current [[Jan Breydel Stadium]] named in 2000'') opened in 1975. The stadium held 25,000 spectators. It was named after [[Albert Dyserynck]], who was president from 1919 to 1931 and had donated the property to the Club.

In the popular language, this stadion keeps the name of "Klokke" after a so-called pub in front of the main entrance. "Klokke" in Flemish dialect is "a clock".

'''Merefield Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1855, when the Heally Club played a United England Eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/711_misc.html Other matches played on Merefield Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, the ground held its only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when the [[North of England cricket team|North]] played the [[South of England cricket team|South]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/711_f.html First-Class Matches played on Merefield Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match on the ground came in 1888 when [[Rochdale Cricket Club|Rochdale]] played the [[Parsees cricket team|Parsees]] during [[Parsee cricket team in England in 1888|their tour of England]].  The ground was later required for building and built over.  The exact location of the ground is unknown.

'''Muscle memory''' has been used to describe the observation that various [[muscle]]-related tasks seem to be easier to perform after previous practice, even if the task has not been performed for a while. It is as if the muscles “remember”. The term could relate to tasks as disparate as playing the [[clarinet]]&lt;ref&gt;Fritz C &amp; Wolfe J. (2005). How do clarinet players adjust the resonances of their vocal tracts for different playing effects? J Acoust Soc Am 118, 3306-3315.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Weight training|weight-lifting]], i.e., the observation that strength trained athletes experience a rapid return of [[muscle mass]] and strength even after long periods of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Staron RS, Leonardi MJ, Karapondo DL, Malicky ES, Falkel JE, Hagerman FC &amp; Hikida RS. (1991). Strength and skeletal muscle adaptations in heavy-resistance-trained women after detraining and retraining. J Appl Physiol 70, 631-640.&lt;/ref&gt;


Until recently such effects were attributed solely to [[motor learning]] occurring in the central nervous system. Long-term effects of previous training on the muscle fibers themselves, however, have recently also been observed related to [[strength training]].&lt;ref name="Bruusgaard"&gt;Bruusgaard JC, Johansen IB, Egner IM, Rana ZA &amp; Gundersen K. (2010). Myonuclei acquired by overload exercise precede hypertrophy and are not lost on detraining. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107, 15111-15116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently it was generally assumed that the effects of exercise on muscle was reversible, and that after a long period of de-training the muscle fibers returned to their previous state. For strength training this view was recently challenged by using [[in vivo]] [[Medical imaging|imaging]] techniques revealing specific long lasting structural changes in muscle fibers after a strength-training episode.&lt;ref name="Bruusgaard" /&gt; The notion of a memory mechanism residing in the [[muscle fiber]]s might have implications for health related exercise advice, and for exclusion times after [[Doping (sport)|doping offences]]. Muscle memory is probably related to the [[Cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] residing inside the muscle fibers, as is described below.

The [[muscle cell]]s are the largest cells in the body with a volume thousands of times larger than most other body cells.&lt;ref&gt;Bruusgaard JC, Liestol K, Ekmark M, Kollstad K &amp; Gundersen K. (2003). Number and spatial distribution of nuclei in the muscle fibres of normal mice studied in vivo. J Physiol 551, 467-478.&lt;/ref&gt; To support this large volume, the muscle cells are one of the very few in the mammalian body that contain several cell nuclei. Such multinucleated cells are called [[Syncytium|syncytia]]. Strength-training increases muscle mass and force mainly by changing the caliber of each fiber rather than increasing the number of fibers. During such fiber enlargement muscle [[stem cell]]s in the muscle tissue multiply and fuse with pre-existing fibers as to support the larger cellular volume. It has often been assumed that each nucleus can support a certain volume of [[cytoplasm]], and hence that there is a constant volume domain served by each nucleus, although recent evidence suggests that this is an oversimplification. Until recently it was believed that during muscle wasting ([[atrophy]]) muscle cells lost nuclei by a nuclear self-destruct mechanism called [[apoptosis]], but recent observations using time laps in vivo imaging in mice do not support this model. Direct observation indicated that no nuclei are lost under such conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Bruusgaard JC &amp; Gundersen K. (2008). In vivo time-lapse microscopy reveals no loss of murine myonuclei during weeks of muscle atrophy. J Clin Invest 118, 1450-1457.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[apoptosis]] observed in the muscle tissue were demonstrated to occur only in other cell nuclei in the tissue, e.g. [[connective tissue]] and muscle stem cells called [[satellite cells]]. Since in vivo imaging has confirmed that cell nuclei are added during strength training  and not lost upon subsequent detraining,&lt;ref name="Bruusgaard" /&gt; the nuclei might provide a mechanism for muscle memory. Thus, upon retraining the extra nuclei are already there and can rapidly start synthesizing new [[protein]] to build muscle mass and strength.

The extra muscle nuclei obtained by a strength training episode, seems to be very long lasting, perhaps permanent, even in muscles that are inactive for a long time.&lt;ref name="Bruusgaard" /&gt; The ability to recruit new nuclei is impaired in the elderly,&lt;ref&gt;(Schultz &amp; Lipton, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; so it might be beneficial to strength train before [[senescence]].

Doping with [[anabolic steroid]]s also seem to act partly by recruiting new nuclei,.&lt;ref&gt;Kadi F, Eriksson A, Holmner S &amp; Thornell LE. (1999). Effects of anabolic steroids on the muscle cells of strength-trained athletes. Med Sci Sports Exerc 31, 1528-1534.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha-Hikim I, Artaza J, Woodhouse L, Gonzalez-Cadavid N, Singh AB, Lee MI, Storer TW, Casaburi R, Shen R &amp; Bhasin S. (2002). Testosterone-induced increase in muscle size in healthy young men is associated with muscle fiber hypertrophy. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 283, E154-164.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently shown in mice,&lt;ref&gt;Egner, I.M. Bruusgaard, J.C., Eftestøl, E., Gundersen, K. (2013). A cellular memory mechanism aids overload hypertrophy in muscle long after an episodic exposure to anabolic steroids. J Physiol 591:6221-6230.&lt;/ref&gt; that a brief exposure to anabolic steroids recruited new muscle nuclei. When the steroids were withdrawn, the muscle rapidly shrank to normal size, but the extra nuclei remained. After a waiting period of 3 months (about 15% of the mouse lifespan), overload exercise led to a muscle growth of 36% within 6 days in the steroid-exposed group, while control muscles that had never been exposed to steroids grew only insignificantly. Since nuclei are long lasting structures in muscle, this suggests that anabolic steroids might have long lasting if not permanent effects on the ability to grow muscle mass.

The mechanisms implied for the muscle memory suggest that it mainly related to strength training, and a 2016 study conducted at [[Karolinska Institutet]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], failed to find a memory effect of endurance training. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Muscle Memory' may not Really Exist |author=Tia Ghose |url=http://www.livescience.com/56218-muscles-have-no-strength-memory.html |website=[[Live Science]] |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Maléne E Lindholm |author2=Stefania Giacomello |author3=Beata Werne Solnestam |author4=Helene Fischer |author5=Mikael Huss |author6=Sanela Kjellqvist |author7=Carl Johan Sundberg |title=The Impact of Endurance Training on Human Skeletal Muscle Memory, Global Isoform Expression and Novel Transcripts |journal=[[PLOS Genetics]] |date=September 22, 2016 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006294 |accessdate=September 23, 2016 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing''' ('''NASCAR''') makes and enforces numerous rules and regulations that transcend all racing series.

[[NASCAR]] issues a different rule book for each racing series; however, rule books are published exclusively for NASCAR members and are not made available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/guides/customer_service/nascar_contact.html NASCAR.com] FAQ/Customer service Retrieved 1/29/07&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the rules, such as the scoring system, have been widely publicized both by NASCAR and the media.

==Car livery==
Each car is required to display its number on each door of the car and on its roof. The front of the car and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car is required to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These [[Contingency sponsorship|contingency decals]] represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs.&lt;ref name="ESPN-Contingency-20083"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/icons/news/story?id=3315850|title=Contingency stickers fill front fenders and help with bottom line|last1=Borden|first1=Brett|date=April 11, 2008|website=[[ESPN|espn.go.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-20154"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|title=NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series &amp; Whelen Modified Tour Rulebook|date=2015|website=[[Waterford Speedbowl|speedbowlct.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623101256/http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series sponsor's logo is displayed on top of the windshield, called the windshield header or windshield banner.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-Xfinity-Trucks-20153"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/10/22/nascar-xfinity-camping-world-truck-series-2015-rules-enhancements-qualifying-logos.html|title=ENHANCEMENTS UNVEILED FOR XFINITY, TRUCK SERIES|author1=Staff report|date=October 22, 2014|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-20154" /&gt;

Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, coinciding with the change to the [[Car of Tomorrow#Gen 6 era|Generation 6]] model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the windshield prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial in the case of siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Martin Truex, Jr.]]) placed in the center of the windshield header. Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and sponsor logos were barred from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added to the rear of the roof adjacent to the number.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-NewLook-Gen6-13"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Official Release|title=NEW LOOK READY FOR 2013 SPRINT CUP CAR|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/11/17/nascar-reveals-2013-sprint-cup-car.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the [[NASCAR Chase for the Championship]], requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background of the windshield header would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-ChaseScheme-2014"&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASCAR Official Release|title=NASCAR TO USE SPECIAL PAINT SCHEME FOR CHASE CONTENDERS|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/7/15/nascar-special-paint-scheme-chase-for-nascar-sprint-cup-contenders.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]|date=July 15, 2014|authorlink1=NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2015, the liveries of the [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]] would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-Xfinity-Trucks-2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Staff report|title=ENHANCEMENTS UNVEILED FOR XFINITY, TRUCK SERIES|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/10/22/nascar-xfinity-camping-world-truck-series-2015-rules-enhancements-qualifying-logos.html|website=[[NASCAR|nascar.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017, the Monster Energy logo is now on the front windshield with the driver name moving to the rear windshield in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]].

Outside of these requirements, teams may design the car and place sponsor logos in NASCAR-approved locations, and must submit all paint and graphics schemes and all sponsor identity to NASCAR in advance for approval.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"/&gt; One paint scheme requirement for example is that both the driver and passenger side of the car must share the same color pattern, though the front and rear may be different colors. This safety rule, to avoid confusion for spotters, NASCAR officials, and other drivers, was brought into light in October 2014 at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], when [[Terry Labonte]]'s [[Go FAS Racing]] team painted his {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 32 car in two different color schemes as a tribute to the two-time champion, but prior to NASCAR approval. NASCAR allowed the team to retain the scheme for knock-out qualifying, but forced them to match the two sides for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pockrass|first1=Bob|title=NASCAR won't OK tribute paint scheme for Terry Labonte|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-10-18/nascar-wont-ok-tribute-paint-scheme-for-terry-labonte|website=[[Sporting News]]|publisher=[[Sporting News]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Talladega, Alabama]]|date=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2016, it seems that NASCAR has either quietly removed this rule or allowed teams to race with a split-side scheme as long as they got the permission to do so, as seen with [[John Hunter Nemechek]]'s {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 8 truck in the [[2016 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2016]] [[American Ethanol E15 225]] and both the {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 3 and {{Abbreviation|No.|Number}} 31 cars of RDV Compétition during the [[2016 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series]].

Teams apply to NASCAR for the use of a car number, and pay for the rights to the number's likeness. NASCAR legally owns and controls all rights to car numbers.&lt;ref name=NASCAR-RCRDillon3Cup-Dec2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series &amp; Whelen Modified Tour Rulebook|url=http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|website=[[Waterford Speedbowl|speedbowlct.com]]|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623101256/http://speedbowlct.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/2015-NWMT-RULEBOOK.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When drivers change teams, the team owner usually retains the number. Unlike in other series, such as the [[International Race of Champions|former IROC Series]], there is no provision for the defending series champion or the points leader to adopt car number 1; it is available to any team. Only one number, No. 61, in the [[Whelen Modified Tour]], has been retired, in memory of nine-time series champion [[Richie Evans]], who was killed at [[Martinsville Speedway]] practicing for the final race of the 1985 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Albert|first1=Zach|title=RETIRING THE NO. 24?

The number 3 for example, used by [[Dale Earnhardt]] and his car owner [[Richard Childress]], has been unofficially retired for all teams and drivers except for an Earnhardt or Childress family member, with Childress paying a licensing fee while the number was out of circulation from 2001 to 2013.&lt;ref name=NASCAR-RCRDillon3Cup-Dec2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Kenny|title=DILLON TO DRIVE NO. 3 SPRINT CUP CAR FOR RCR|url=http://www.nascar.com/content/nascar/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/12/11/austin-dillon-driving-number-3-car-dale-earnhardt-sprint-cup-series.html|website=[[NASCAR]].com|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014|location=[[Concord, North Carolina]]|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coble|first1=Don|title=NASCAR's numbers game: Names taking a backseat in big business of branding|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/racing/2013-02-11/story/nascars-numbers-game#|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=February 11, 2013|location=[[Daytona Beach, Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, a number has been relinquished due to a sponsor leaving a team. After the 2002 season, [[Robert Yates Racing]] switched from their longtime number 28 to 38 after sponsor [[Texaco]]-[[Havoline]] ceased their sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[Knight Ridder]]|title=The late Davey Allison made the No. 28 car famous.|url=http://billingsgazette.com/sports/the-late-davey-allison-made-the-no-car-famous/article_cc0b8d0b-8c59-5123-8e13-20a78ed9b896.html|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=[[Billings Gazette]]|date=January 18, 2003|location=[[Mooresville, North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rudd, Sadler, put the "silly" into silly season|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/rudd-sadler-put-the-silly-into-silly-season/|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|date=August 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams can run numbers from 0 to 99 (as well as 00 to 09), but no two cars can display the same number during a race.&lt;ref name="NASCAR-K&amp;N-WMT-Rules-2015"/&gt; Teams that run 00 to 09 are listed as 100 to 109 for NASCAR's scoring purposes. Except for those numbers (which have been used for full-time teams), part-time teams may be assigned a three-digit number for scoring purposes only (such as Nos. 141 and 241). If two such teams arrive with the same two digit number, the team higher in championship points prevails, and the other team will be forced to change their number for the race.

==Sponsorship==

===Tobacco===
Although NASCAR has a long history of tobacco sponsorship, following the [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003 season]], longtime NASCAR partner [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]] declined to renew their [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] sponsorship of the Cup Series, replaced by Nextel Corporation.&lt;ref name=TobaccoFreeKids-NASCAR-03&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Matthew L.|title=NASCAR Choice of Non-Tobacco Sponsor Is A Victory for Kids, Health and Auto Racing|url=http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/id_0658|website=tobaccofreekids.org|publisher=Tobacco-Free Kids|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=June 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] passed new regulations preventing sponsorship for cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in any sporting event, including auto racing events. The announcement affected two teams: the No. 33 Truck of [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.]] and [[Kevin Harvick, Inc.]] lost its [[Swedish Match|Longhorn Moist Snuff]] sponsorship, while the No. 27 Nationwide Series car of [[Baker Curb Racing]] lost its [[Red Man]] sponsorship.&lt;ref name=SportsBuisnessDigest-Tobacco-NASCAR-10&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending an era: Tobacco sponsorship in NASCAR|url=http://sportsbusinessdigest.com/2010/06/ending-an-era-tobacco-sponsorship-in-nascar/|website=Sports Business Digest|publisher=Sports Business Digest|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker Curb would shut its doors the next year due to lack of sponsorship.

In spite of the legislation, tobacco sponsorship continues in the sports through [[electronic cigarette]]s, with companies such as Green Smoke, [[blu eCigs|blu]] (owned by R.J. Reynolds), and Arrowhead sponsoring NASCAR teams. A brand of [[herbal smokeless tobacco]], Smokey Mountain, has also sponsored drivers such as Hornaday, [[Johnny Sauter]], [[Brian Scott]], and [[Daniel Hemric]].

===Viceroy rule===
Though [[NASCAR]] typically promotes competition between multiple brands, including those that sponsor the sport and individual races, the sanctioning body provides exclusive protection to its series title sponsors, such as [[Monster Energy]] in the Cup Series, as well as current fuel supplier [[Sunoco]].&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007/&gt; This policy, known as the '''Viceroy rule''', prevents sponsorship from direct competitors within a certain series, although it does not prevent a company from moving to a different series within the sport, or advertising a product that does not directly conflict with the title sponsor. For example, [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Texaco]] and other oil companies have been allowed to promote their motor oil brands ([[Pennzoil]] and [[Havoline]] respectively) but not their gasoline products.&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007/&gt; When a new title sponsor creates conflicts with existing team sponsors, NASCAR typically allows the team sponsors to remain under a [[grandfather clause]].&lt;ref name="Westmoreland-Viceroy-Sep2007"/&gt; The rule is named after the British cigarette brand [[Viceroy (cigarette)|Viceroy]], and is in reference to the [[1972 USAC Championship Car season]] during which title sponsor [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] renounced its branding when Viceroy entered the sport to sponsor entries.&lt;ref name=SBJ-NASCAR-Viceroy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yost|first1=Mark|title=History shows NASCAR the high stakes of sponsor conflict|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2007/04/20070402/Opinion/History-Shows-NASCAR-The-High-Stakes-Of-Sponsor-Conflict.aspx|website=[[Advance Publications|Sports Business Journal]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MassLive-NASCAR-Verizon&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASCAR|title=Verizon Wireless shifts its racing sponsorship from NASCAR to IndyCar|url=http://blog.masslive.com/racinwithjason/2010/12/verizon_wireless_shifts_its_racing_sponsorship_from_nascar_to_indycar.html|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publication]], [[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=December 10, 2010|authorlink1=NASCAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule has come into effect on several occasions, most notably when [[Nextel Communications]] signed a ten-year $700 million deal to replace Winston as the Cup Series sponsor.&lt;ref name=Lubbock-Nextel-NASCAR-03&gt;{{cite web|author1=Associated Press|title=NASCAR gets $700 million from in Nextel sponsorship deal|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/062003/pro_062003080.shtml|website=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|lubbockonline.com]]|publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|location=[[New York City]]|date=June 20, 2003|authorlink1=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active sponsors [[Cingular Wireless]] (sponsoring [[Richard Childress Racing]]'s No. 31 team) and [[Alltel]] (sponsoring [[Team Penske]]'s No. 12 car of [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]]) were allowed to continue their deals,&lt;ref name=MassLive-NASCAR-Verizon /&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN-NASCAR-AT&amp;T-2007 /&gt; but both sponsor agreements were put into question when the companies were purchased and sought re-branding.&lt;ref name=Savannah-Sprint-Sunoco-2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coble|first1=Don|title=Sprint Nextel, Sunoco flex their muscles as NASCAR series sponsors|url=http://savannahnow.com/don-coble/2007-02-28/sprint-nextel-sunoco-flex-their-muscles-nascar-series-sponsors|website=[[Savannah Morning News|savannahnow.com]]|publisher=[[Savannah Morning News]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Robby Gordon was required to wear a full color Nextel patch on his driving suit.

==Special rules for combination races==
A combination race is a race run between multiple series that operate under compatible rules packages. During NASCAR's combination races (currently the two K&amp;N Pro Series ([[K&amp;N Pro Series East|East]] and [[K&amp;N Pro Series West|West]]), and formerly the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]]/[[K&amp;N Pro Series West|Winston West Series]] and [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]]/[[K&amp;N Pro Series East|Busch North Series]]), there is one race, but points are scored for both series. In previous years, drivers were given points based on how they finished among competitors from the same series. For 2017, drivers will receive points in their series based on their actual finish in the race among all competitors. However, drivers who declare they are running for a championship in both series (East &amp; West) will be awarded points in both series, provided they have the appropriate license for both.

Special rules apply as two teams will have the same number. The fastest lap time in qualifying determines which team will have the number for the race, and which team must temporarily change the number for the race. For example, during the [[1991 NASCAR Busch Series|1991 Busch Series]] season, there were selected races in the Northeast ([[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|Loudon]], [[Nazareth Speedway|Nazareth]], [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]], [[Oxford Plains Speedway|Oxford]]) where both the Busch Grand National (now [[Xfinity Series|Xfinity]]) and Busch Grand National North (now K&amp;N Pro East) Series raced in combination races. North team [[Ricky Craven]] (also drove his car) and Grand National team Don Beverly Racing ([[Jimmy Hensley]] driving) both used No. 25. Whoever had the faster qualifying time in each race used No. 25. Craven used No. 28 at Oxford when Hensley had the faster time, while Hensley used No. 5 when Craven had the faster time at Loudon. Both teams, however, scored respective owner points for the No. 25 in their respective series.

==Car and driver changes==
Teams must use a single car from the start of the first practice session through the end of the race. Teams that crash a car in practice or qualifying may go to a backup car, but racing a different car from the one that qualified results in that car having to start at the rear of the field.

Engine and transmission changes are prohibited during a race weekend. Xfinity and Truck Series engines must last two race weekends, excluding restrictor plate races. Changing either will result in starting in the rear of the field. Transmission changes are allowed during road course weekends and during the race weekends at [[Pocono Raceway]]. In addition, during [[Speedweeks]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] teams are allowed one free engine change between the qualifying races and final practice session.

Driver changes are permitted, however starting the race with a different driver than whom qualified the car will result in the car starting at the rear of the field. Driver changes during the race are permitted as well, performed during pit stops, but a team must incur any loss in position due to time spent swapping drivers. The driver who starts the race earns all the points, statistics, and purse money.&lt;ref name=Motorsport-Substitute-SadlerBowyer-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spivey|first1=Julian|title=NASCAR's substitute driver rule ... A flawed policy?|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-ns/news/nascar-s-substitute-driver-rule-a-flawed-policy-458301|website=motorsport.com|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=27 November 2014|date=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caution flag and restart procedure==
When the yellow flag is displayed and the yellow caution lights around the track come on, the field is frozen immediately at the moment of caution. All scoring ends immediately and cars are to slow to [[Safety car|pace vehicle (safety car)]] speed. Cars will line up behind the pace vehicle in the order in which they passed the last scoring loop on track (there are as many as 18 loops around the track, although the one at the start/finish line is the only one that counts for official race statistics). The exception to this rule is if the yellow flag waves after the white flag is thrown (or, in the case of an overtime attempt, if the yellow flag waves after the race leader has crossed the overtime line) or if the race will not be restarted (typically for rain; but sometimes for darkness if a track does not have night lights), in which case NASCAR will use video evidence to determine the finishing order.

When the caution comes out, the pit lane is immediately closed, a rule first implemented following the 1989 [[Atlanta 500]]. This is shown by a flashing red light at the entrance to pit road. Entering pit road when it is closed (with certain exceptions) is a penalty of restarting at the rear of the field.  When pit road is open, a steady green light will appear at the entrance to pit road, and a green light will come on in the rear window of the pace vehicle.

During a "quickie yellow" all cars may enter pit road the first time by when it is opened. After the pit stops, the first car one lap down at the moment of caution (known as the free pass car) is permitted to go around the pace car and start the race at the rear of the field, but back on the lead lap.

During a full yellow, only lead lap cars may pit the first time by the pit road. Once the lead lap cars who have decided to pit have entered pit road, the free pass car will be sent around the pace car to earn their lap back. The next time by, all cars (including the free pass car) may pit.

Cars may pit as often as they wish at the expense of track position, but the free pass car is limited to taking fuel only at the first pit stop opportunity. If the free pass car is judged to have caused the caution (intentionally or not) there will be no free pass car.

At the one to go signal, the pace car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of the leader of the race will be waved around to the rear of the field. These cars are not permitted to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars &gt; Cars 1 or more laps down &gt; Free Pass Car &gt; Wave Arounds &gt; Cars who have received a penalty.

Once the pace car has pulled into the pits, there is a restart "zone" consisting of lines painted on the outside wall of the track. The leader of the race is to begin accelerating inside this zone to resume the race. If they do not, the flagman controls the restart. The second place car may not be ahead of the leader at the moment of green flag, however either car on the front row may cross the start/finish line first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/09/15/nascar-drivers-meeting-restarts-chicagoland.html|title=NASCAR clarifies restart rules to drivers|last=Albert|first=Zack|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|date=September 15, 2013|website=NASCAR.com|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing is not permitted until the leader of the race crosses the start-finish line. Lane changes are also not permitted until after a car clears the finish line.

Per the NASCAR rule book, a restart is official once the legal lead car crosses the start/finish line. If the green flag is waved, but NASCAR calls off the restart because of an incident before the leader crosses the start/finish line, the restart is deemed aborted.

==Flags==
{{main article|Racing flags}}
Like most other sanctioning bodies, NASCAR will use flags to provide the drivers with information regarding track conditions. NASCAR, not adhering to the [[FIA]] rules (despite NASCAR being a member club of [[Automobile Competition Committee for the United States|ACCUS]], the U.S. motor racing sporting authority and representative to the [[FIA World Motor Sport Council]]), does not use the flag system outlined in the FIA International Sporting Code. Major differences include that in NASCAR (and other championships in [[North America]]) the white flag is used to signal that the leader is on the last lap, in FIA ISC regulated events (such as [[Formula One]] and most European championships) it is used to signal that a slower car is on track. Also, the blue flag specified in the FIA ISC does not have a diagonal stripe, and the black flag means that a driver is disqualified.

|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Green.svg|left|40px|Green Flag]]|| The '''green flag''' indicates that the race has started or restarted. It is shown by the official in the flag stand when the leader enters the designated restart zone, which is located a short distance before the start/finish line.
|-
|[[File:Green-white checkered flag.png|left|40px|Green and White Checkered Flag]]
|The '''green and white checkered flag''' is shown to indicate the end of a race stage. After the top 10 drivers cross the start/finish line, the caution flag is displayed.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Yellow.svg|left|40px|Yellow Flag]]
|The '''yellow flag''', or '''caution flag''', indicates a hazard on the track&amp;nbsp;— most often an accident, but sometimes also for debris, light rain, emergency vehicles entering (usually on short tracks with no tunnel) or a scheduled competition caution (usually used for races that have been postponed due to inclement weather). All cars must slow down and follow the [[pace car]]. Passing is not allowed under the yellow flag. NASCAR experimented the "local yellow" flag in road courses; cautions apply to the entire circuit, including road courses.
|-
|[[File:F1 red flag.svg|left|40px|Red Flag]]
|The '''red flag''' indicates that the race has been stopped. This may happen due to a large accident (such as a multi-car wreck like [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]], inclement weather),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.speedtv.com/article/cup-rain-pounds-pocono-raceway/ |title=CUP: Pocono Race Under Red Flag |publisher=Nascar.speedtv.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; track repair (such as damaged catch fencing), or for severe track cleaning (such as the final laps, when NASCAR may clean the entire track to ensure the race can finish under green flag conditions, and to do so with the track clean of oil from engine failure or crashes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.about.com/b/2012/02/27/red-flag-for-flaming-jet-dryer.htm |title=Red Flag For Flaming Jet Dryer |publisher=Nascar.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cars may be ordered into the pits or on the track depending on conditions; red flags for inclement weather generally result in all cars parking in the pits. Race teams are not permitted to repair or adjust cars during red flag conditions. However, drivers may exit their cars, and they may be provided with water, food or other necessities. This flag is also used with the black flag to signal the end of a practice or qualifying session. 
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing White.svg|left|40px|White Flag]]
|The '''white flag''' indicates one lap remaining in the race. More specifically, it indicates that all drivers will be scored for at most 1 more lap after passing the white flag.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Chequered.svg|left|40px|Checkered Flag]]
|The '''checkered flag''' indicates that the race is over.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Black.svg|left|40px|Black Flag]]
|The '''black flag''' indicates that a driver must pit immediately. This flag is shown if the driver or pit crew violates a rule (e.g., speeding through the pits), if the vehicle has sufficient mechanical damage that it is a hazard to other drivers, if the vehicle cannot maintain the minimum required speed (varies by track; typically disclosed in the pre-race drivers' meeting), or if a driver has been driving overly aggressively. In the event of a failure of the in-car radio, NASCAR will, at the team's request, display the black flag to signal a driver to pit, one time only.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing White Cross.svg|left|40px|Black Flag with a White Cross]]
|The '''black flag with a white cross''' indicates that a driver is no longer being scored. This is normally shown if a driver does not respond to a black flag within three laps.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Blue.svg|left|40px|Blue Flag with a Yellow Stripe]]
|The '''blue flag with a yellow stripe''' is shown to warn slow drivers of faster cars approaching. NASCAR rarely black-flags drivers for not obeying this flag; however, it is frequently displayed and warnings may be given if it is blatant (such as a lapped driver blocking for a teammate). NASCAR uses the yellow diagonal stripe on the blue flag because the flag is usually displayed on top of the starter's stand, and not at eye-level to the driver from the track.
|-
|[[File:Auto Racing Plain Blue.svg|left|40px|Blue Flag]]
|The '''blue flag''' is used to indicate an area on a road course where drivers should be careful due to slow or stopped cars or a partially blocked track. It is not used on ovals. If a full-course caution is required, NASCAR will use the yellow flag to indicate this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2004-06-24-infineon-preview_x.htm] Article on blue flag&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the local caution commonly used in other racing series, the blue flag is not a "local caution" and does not prohibit overtaking; rather, it merely tells drivers to be careful. Safety workers will not leave their designated spots and enter the track under this flag. In the wake of a fatal corner worker crash at Daytona International Speedway in 2004 in a non-NASCAR sanctioned race (but using track workers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newberry |first=Paul |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2004-02-08-dash-accident_x.htm |title=Track worker killed during Dash race at Daytona |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASCAR has become reluctant in recent years to use local cautions, opting to use the full-course yellow caution flag instead if any safety team members have to approach the track in an attempt to give safety workers a safer environment to inspect debris by forcing all cars under pace car speed, instead of race speed, to remove debris. The rationale is most of the field will be packed together while cleanup is happening, instead of being spread over the entire track.
|}

==Qualifying procedure==

===Standard procedure===
A knockout system similar to [[Formula One]] is used. During the time allotted, teams are allowed unlimited attempts to qualify with their fastest lap of each round counting as their official time.

Between attempts, cars are parked on pit road, where teams may hook up a cooling system through the cal flap in front of the windshield to cool the engine. However, teams are not permitted to raise the hood or make other significant adjustments during qualifying. Also, tires may not be changed without approval from NASCAR, who will only grant approval in cases of flat tires or safety issues.

On all open engine ovals in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, tracks shorter than 2 miles in the Xfinity Series, and tracks shorter than 1.5 miles in the Camping World Truck Series, round 1 is 15 minutes long. The fastest 24 advance to round 2 which is 10 minutes long. The fastest 12 advance to round 3 which determines pole position. In addition to determine who advances to round 2, round 1 also determines who will and will not qualify for the race and starting positions 25–40 (Cup Series), 25–40 (Xfinity), or 25–32 (Camping World Truck). Similarly, round 2 will determine starting positions 13–24, with round 3 determining positions 1–12.

On road courses, there are only two sessions: Round 1 is 25 minutes with the top 12 advancing to Round 2 which is 10 minutes.

In the event rain falls between rounds, NASCAR has the option of declaring the session over and the speeds from the previous round will count for all remaining starting positions.

===Restrictor plate tracks, ovals longer than 2 miles in Xfinity, and ovals longer than 1.5 miles in Trucks===
Due to how the draft works in restrictor plate racing, and a series of crashes in qualifying during 2015 Speedweeks, a single car qualifying format is used for restrictor plate racetracks. In July 2015, after making rules changes to the cars designed to increase drag and drafting, NASCAR used the format at Indianapolis and Michigan (but discontinued its use at both tracks for 2016). The single car system will only be used at the plate tracks, ovals 2 miles and longer in the Xfinity series, and ovals 1.5 miles or longer in the Truck series.

In round 1, cars are sent out one at a time at the direction of a NASCAR official. Each car has one warm-up lap, one timed lap, and one cool down lap. NASCAR will release cars roughly half a lap apart to prevent any aerodynamic advantage from being gained from a competitor's car. The order in which cars go on track is the inverse of practice speeds.  As with the road course format, the top 12 cars advance to the final round.

After the final car has returned to pit road in the first round, all 12 qualifying teams may hook up the cooling system to the car for 10 minutes. Round 2 cars will qualify from slowest to fastest based off their speeds from round 1. The fastest car will win the pole.

===Daytona 500 provisions===
The session results from single car qualifying set the starting lineups for the [[Can-Am Duel]] races on Thursday.
The duel races are two 60 lap/150 mile races. The first race consists of those who finished qualifying in odd-numbered positions and sets the lineup for odd-numbered positions in the 500. The second race does the same for even-numbered positions. However, there must be an equal number of "open" or "non-chartered" teams in each Duel race. After the Duel races, the lineup is set as follows:

* Positions 1–2: Fastest two qualifiers in Sunday's single car qualifying.
* Positions 3–38: Duel race results, consisting of all chartered teams and the highest finishing non-chartered team in each Duel.
* Positions 39-40: The fastest two cars of non-chartered teams that are not already qualified, based on Sunday's qualifying session.

===Provisional rule===
All three NASCAR national series will set a specific number of starting positions by timed laps and have a specific number of starting positions based on owner points of vehicles that have not already qualified.

*  Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series:  36 / 4
*  Xfinity Series: 33 / 6 / 1
*  Camping World Truck Series (except Eldora):  27 / 4 / 1

In the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series four positions are awarded to the fastest qualifying open teams. In the Xfinity Series, six positions are awarded based on owner points to cars not already qualified. In the Camping World Truck Series, four positions are awarded based on owner points to trucks not already qualified.

The final position in the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series is reserved for a past series champion. Each past champion can use this past champions' provisional up to six times per season. If the past champions' provisional is not needed, then the position goes to the first team in owner points not already qualified for the race. If a former champion driver's team is one of the top six or four teams, respectively, highest in owner points, not already qualified, then that does not count against usage of the provisional. 
If there are 40 or less (or 32 or less) vehicles entered in the respective races, no provisionals are charged and the field will be determined by timed laps only.

After these positions are awarded, the cars are arranged by lap times.

====Past champion's provisional====
In 1991, NASCAR introduced the past champion's provisional (sometimes known as the "Petty rule") after [[Richard Petty]] failed to qualify in four races in 1989, which resulted in a viewership ratings drop that season. This special provisional allowed a former Cup champion to claim the final starting position if he was too low in the points standings and was unable to qualify by speed. The past champion's provisional worked perfectly until 1997, when [[Darrell Waltrip]] failed to make the [[Bank of America Roval 400|UAW-GM Quality 500]] lineup because [[Terry Labonte]] was the more recent champion and was higher in points. NASCAR considered revising the guidelines to the past champion's provisional after Waltrip used it to enter 20 races in 1998. In 2004, NASCAR gave past Cup champions a maximum of 10 past champion's provisionals per season; this number was reduced to six in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/racing/news/story?id=2740483&amp;seriesId=2 |title=Past champion's provisional entry limited to six |author=Newton, David |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=eVi3hg7Y6ZkC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=NASCAR+past+champions+provisional&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VXmxstGUul&amp;sig=LMhoMulSUmrddPk6R5FTkJN4avk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig6bDixLTaAhWKbbwKHWrpABkQ6AEIYTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=NASCAR%20past%20champions%20provisional&amp;f=false |title=''NASCAR for Dummies'' |author=[[Mark Martin|Martin, Mark]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] via [[Google Books]] |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved disastrous for [[Dale Jarrett]] in 2007, as he moved to a fledgling [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] with no owner points and failed to qualify in 12 races after being forced to use all of his past champion's provisionals at the start of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/news/dale-jarrett-hall-of-fame-2014-ned-daytona-500-joe-gibbs-robert-yates/1fdor8jjodtgn106lwxvy4rzy0 |title=Dale Jarrett relishes joining father Ned in NASCAR Hall of Fame |author=Pockrass, Bob |publisher=[[Sporting News]] |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past champion's provisional was discontinued from the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series as part of the new Charter system and qualifying system in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jayski.com/news/stats/2016/story/_/page/2016-NASCAR-Past-Champions-Provisional |title=2016 Past Champions Provisional |publisher=Jayski's NASCAR Silly Season Site/[[ESPN]] |date=February 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-Star Weekend qualifying===
The Open uses the standard procedure, but with only 8 cars advancing to the final round. All-Star race qualifying consists of the combined time of 3 laps with a 4-tire pit stop. The fastest 5 drivers in the opening round advance to the final round.

===Eldora===
The [[Eldora Dirt Derby]] has a unique qualifying format. Each truck will take two timed laps, with the faster lap counting as that truck's official time. The trucks are assigned to one of five heat races where the top five trucks from each will advance to the feature. Those that fail to qualify will have one last chance race, where the top two trucks will also advance. Provisionals will be determined after the last chance race.

===Daytona Clash===
The [[Advance Auto Parts Clash]] is an annual invitation-only race held the weekend before the Daytona 500, and sets its lineup via a random draw.

==Penalties==
The following is a list of NASCAR penalties. Penalties listed as "NASCAR Discretion" can result in a simple restart at the tail of the field, a multiple lap penalty, or disqualification.

===Restarting at the End of the Line for the Ensuing Restart===

# Pitting before pit road is open (Section 10-4B), administered if a driver enters pit road while the flashing lights indicating pit road is closed are on (certain exceptions apply)
# Pitting out of order (10-4B)

===Restarting at the End of the Line (caution) or Drive-Through Penalty (green flag)===

# Car/truck must enter pit road in single file (9-15C)

## If the car is entering pit road to avoid an incident and has to cross the plane of road line track side, then enter pit road, no penalty.
## At Martinsville Speedway, the car must have two wheels cross the pit entrance line before the Turn 3 pit entrance.

===Stop and Go Penalty===
# Removing equipment from assigned pit area (9-15O).
# Speeding on pit road during pass-through penalty  (9-15R).

===Pass-Through Penalty===
# Jumping any green flag (10-2A)
# Passing after specific point on the "One to Go" signal (Turn 3 of most ovals, Turn 2 at Pocono, Turn 10 at Sonoma or Watkins Glen) (9-11)

# Illegal Lane Change on restart (9-11)
# Unapproved mechanical adjustment (flaring of rocker panels most notably) (10-7-1-1).
## Penalty only under yellow condition, enforced on the second lap following a restart, in addition to starting at the tail end of the field during for that restart. Under green condition, NASCAR will not allow the car on the track until the car is repaired legally.
# Failure to make qualifying attempt because of numerous failed pre-race technical inspections.
## Three failed inspection attempts also involves ejection of crew member.
## Four failed inspection attempts also involved a ten-point penalty.

===One Lap Penalty===
# Car/truck pitting out of the assigned pit box (9-15F) (NASCAR may relax the rule at tracks with shorter pit boxes)
# Passing the [[safety car]] (10-4D) (except for cars being subjected to the wave-around, or at some tracks where the radius of pit road is shorter than track, as in Martinsville and Bristol, where the pit road speed limit applies, and the safety car may be passed.)
# Pulling up to pit (9-15A) -- (drivers must maintain position in relation to field or face penalty, again rule differs at Martinsville and Bristol)
# Refueling car before race start OR when before the designated race distance, as in a competition caution called because of weather, passes (9-6D and 9-6E). Additional laps may be added to penalty.

====Penalties assessed at NASCAR's discretion====
# Running over/under equipment (9-15O)

# Verbal abuse to a NASCAR official (9-11)
# Disobeying Black Flag (10-6A)
# Safety violation

NASCAR conducts a complete technical inspection prior to the first practice session, before and after qualifying, and before the race. A quick safety inspection is also completed prior to each practice session after the first. Penalties for car violations are typically announced the Wednesday after a race, and can range from a simple fine to a suspension (typically a maximum of 12 races) and loss of points. After a race, the top 5 finishers, one other random car, and the first car failing to finish the race not due to an accident will have their cars inspected. The winner, random car, and first car out also have their cars and engines taken by NASCAR for further inspection at the NASCAR Research and Development Center. Further, there is one random race per year where NASCAR confiscates 15-20 engines and takes them to NASCAR's Research and Development Center for evaluation, comparison, and to help decide on future rule changes.

Starting in 2017, NASCAR will attempt to issue more penalties during a race weekend instead of waiting until Wednesday. There will now be L1 and L2 penalties:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2017/2/16/nascar-announces-new-deterrence-penalty-policy.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* L1 penalties concern areas of minimum heights and weights, the Laser Inspection Station (LIS), gear ratios, and flagrant lug nut violations where 17 or fewer are properly secured. Penalties will be a 10-40 point deduction, suspension for 1-3 races, plus a fine up to $75,000.
* L2 penalties involve more egregious infractions concerning tampering with the three "no man's land" technical areas of tires, engine and fuel. Major safety violations, the use of telemetry or traction control, plus breaches of the testing policy also fall under the L2 designation. These penalties will be a 75-point deduction, a 4-6 race suspension, and a fine up to $200,000.
* "Encumbered" finishes: The rules allow a victory to stand in the event of an infraction, but a winning team will be stripped of the benefits associated with the win.
* The list of pre-race penalties within a race weekend at the series directors' disposal, in order of increasing severity: Loss of annual "hard card" credential, loss of practice time, loss of pit selection position, tail of the field penalty, a green-flag pass-through on pit road after the initial start, a green-flag stop-and-go in the pits after the start, and lap(s) penalty.

As a member of ACCUS/FIA, NASCAR has a [[substance abuse]] policy requiring random testing of drivers, crew members, and officials. Those who have violated the policy (including suspensions for [[domestic violence]]) are suspended indefinitely immediately and given the opportunity to enroll in NASCAR's Road to Recovery program to be re-instated into NASCAR.

==Pit road==
[[File:Nascar Pit Road photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|NASCAR officials on pit road at [[Sonoma Raceway]]]]
During a race, teams must pit several times for refueling and new tires. Teams are permitted five crew members over the wall at the start of the race; that consists of two tire changers, one tire carrier, a jackman, and a gas man. Once NASCAR gives the OK (usually once the leader begins lapping cars), a 6th crew member is permitted only to service the driver/windshield. With the 2018 NASCAR rule changes, the gas man is now not allowed to make any adjustments to the car when refueling it.

There is an established pit road speed limit for each race. Since NASCAR cars do not have speedometers, the first [[Parade lap|pace lap]] of each race is run at pit road speed so drivers can get a tachometer reading for pit speed. There are a variety of other safety rules (see penalties above) that must be followed.

At the moment of caution or when there are two laps to go in the stage, pit road is immediately closed. NASCAR uses both a light at the end of pit road and a series of cameras to help determine the moment pit road is closed. The pits are opened once the field is under control of the pace/safety car unless there is an accident near the entrance/exit or on pit road, in which case the pits will remain closed until NASCAR deems the pits are safe to open.

After an incident at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit flagman waved a green flag but the light at the end of pit road was red, NASCAR added a light to the rear of the pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when pit road will be open, and thus removed the flagman from the entrance of pit road. NASCAR's official policy is that in the event of a discrepancy, the light at the end of pit road is official.

Starting in 2017, cars sustaining accident damage that cannot be repaired on pit road within 5 minutes will automatically be removed from the rest of the race. Speeding on pit road will see that time reduced by 15 seconds per infraction. Further, teams are not allowed to replace bodywork once the race begins. Teams using more than 5 crew members will also have their car removed from the race.

==Crew rosters==
For the 2018 season, NASCAR created a new roster system. This system would standardize the number of at-track team members. Rosters are split into three categories: Organizational, Road Crew, and Pit Crew. 

Examples of Organizational roster spots include competition director, team managers, technical director, IT specialists. In the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, teams are allotted three organizational roster spots for one- and two-car operations, and four spots for three- and four-car outfits. XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series teams are allowed one organizational roster spot each.

Examples of Road Crew include crew chief, car chief, mechanics, engine tuners, engineers, specialists (for areas such as tires, aerodynamics and shocks) and spotters. The limits for these personnel by series: Monster Energy Series, 12; XFINITY, 7; Camping World Trucks, 6. 

Pit Crews are the same in all series, with the maximum number being 5. 

The exceptions to these numbers are slight. Monster Energy Series teams are allowed one extra road crew position at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the three road courses (Sonoma, Watkins Glen, Charlotte), where teams often use multiple spotters. Also, an additional road crew roster spot will be allowed for XFINITY teams at 10 races and Truck Series teams at five. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/11/22/nascar-to-standardize-at-track-rosters-beginning-in-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race procedure==
Starting in 2017, NASCAR announced they may reserve the right to move up the start of the race one hour to beat inclement weather (heavy rain and lighting on road courses).

Two hours before the race, drivers and crew chiefs attend a mandatory driver's meeting.  They are required to attend in person, and no exceptions are allowed (which has caused trouble with drivers attempting the Memorial Day Double). Failure to attend the meeting will force drivers to start at the rear of the field. In August 2015, NASCAR announced they would experiment moving the driver's meeting to only one hour before the race since meetings at most races take less than 15 minutes.

Roughly a 30 to 45 minutes before the race start time, driver introductions will be held. Failure to attend these will also require the driver to start at the rear of the field as well.

At the designated start time, a pre-race invocation is given, followed by the singing of the national anthem. Once the anthem is complete, drivers have exactly five minutes to get in their cars with all the safety equipment fastened and ready to go. At the end of those five minutes, the grand marshal for the race will deliver the command "Drivers, start your engines!", at which point each car must start its engine. With the engines running, the cars sit on pit road for approximately three minutes before heading on the track for some warm-up laps before the pace car. The average number of pace laps is three, but there can be more or less depending on a wide variety of circumstances and conditions, including but not limited to track length, track drying efforts after rain, or if a car has a problem and stops on the track during those pace laps. At the end of the pace laps, the field will partake in a rolling start.

If the last lap of the race is started under caution, the race will be extended per [[Green–white–checker finish|NASCAR Overtime]]. Once the track is clear, the field will be given the green flag with two laps remaining. If there is another crash/caution before the leader reaches the "overtime line," usually located on the backstretch, then the race will continue to be extended until the leader reaches the line. However, when the leader of the race reaches the overtime line, the next flag (caution or checkered) will end the race (although competitors are required to cross the start/finish line at pace car speed to be scored in their position at the moment of caution).

After the race, the winning driver (and, if at the end of the season, championship winning driver) will usually complete a series of burnouts in celebration of their victory, before heading to victory lane for more celebrations and post-race interviews.

==Safety==
{{main article|Safety in NASCAR}}
Since late 2001, a head and neck restraint has been required for usage of all drivers. Since 2005 the [[HANS Device]] (Head and Neck Support Device) has been the only such approved device. Since 2003, helmets have been required for pit crew members as well. Drivers and pit crew members must also wear firesuits. Drivers are required to use carbon fiber seats and headrests for strength and durability. Cars have also been redesigned since the 2001 [[death of Dale Earnhardt]] and after spectacular crashes to reflect new discoveries and developments in safety.

All oval tracks in any of NASCAR's National Series (except Eldora) use the [[SAFER Barrier]] and other soft wall technology to lessen impacts.

After a series of flips and dangerous crashes in the 1980s, NASCAR began requiring all cars to run a [[restrictor plate]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. The restrictor plate limits air into the engine, reducing horsepower and speed at these tracks from 230-240&amp;nbsp;mph to 195-200&amp;nbsp;mph. At these races, in addition to the restrictor plate, there are a variety of other technical rules and regulations to keep the cars stable and on the track. In addition to these technical rules, restrictor plate races are the only races where drivers are prohibited from using the apron of the track to execute a pass. A double yellow line separates the track from the racing surface, leading many to call the rule the "Yellow Line Rule." Driving under the line to advance one's position is subject to a drive-through penalty, or if the foul occurs on the last lap that car will be relegated to the last car on the lead lap in official race results.

==Testing==
NASCAR previously sanctioned an annual 4-day pre-season test at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in January for all teams until 2015, when all private testing was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/nascar-sets-testing-ban-includes-daytona-500-0|title=NASCAR sets testing ban that includes Daytona 500|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|date=2014-09-23|website=Associated Press|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that test, each organization was allowed four 2-day tests. Each test was required to be at a different race track. Rookie drivers were allocated an additional test. Beginning in 2016, each team is eligible to participate in five open tests that will occur at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Watkins Glen International, Chicagoland Speedway, and Homestead-Miami Speedway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/12/goodyear-tire-test-dates-set-for-2016-season.html|title=Testing schedule for 2016 set|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|date=2016-01-12|publisher=NASCAR|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tire supplier [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] is allowed unlimited testing and can ask whichever teams it wants to complete the test. Usually Goodyear chooses the top three finishers from the previous year's event to run the test. However, Goodyear formerly staged a full-field tire test at Indianapolis in late June/early July in preparations for the [[Brickyard 400]].

==Weekend schedule==
The [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] usually runs one day of practice and qualifying on Friday, followed by a second day of practice on Saturday morning, followed by the race on Sunday. If running a Saturday night race, the second day of practice is not held. During impound races, the three-day schedule is maintained, with qualifying taking place of Saturday practice.

The [[Xfinity Series]] will run practice on Friday, followed by qualifying a few hours before the race on Saturday. If a race is on Friday (or the schedule is otherwise compacted for other reasons), it is not uncommon for practice, qualifying, and the race to all be held on the same day. The [[Camping World Truck Series]] usually does this.

Rain can and often does affect the weekend schedule. When it does, qualifying is routinely cancelled and the starting lineup is set by owners points (previous year's points for the first 3 races). Whenever a race is postponed due to rain, then the race is usually scheduled for the following day (i.e., a Saturday night race postponed to Sunday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon race postponed to Monday afternoon).

'''Naved Arif Gondal''' (born 2 December 1981 in [[Mandi Bahauddin]], Pakistan) is a former [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[cricket]]er who is banned for life for his involvement in spot-fixing. He is a left-handed [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]] who bowls left-arm [[Seam bowling|medium-fast]].  He played first-class cricket for [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] in the English [[county championship]].

In June 2014 he was banned from cricket for life, a month after he was charged with match-fixing by the England and Wales Cricket Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naved Arif: ECB bans ex-Sussex &amp; Pakistan A cricketer for life|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/27904861|agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Gujranwala Cricket Association===
Naved Arif began his career at the Gujranwala Cricket Association in Pakistan. He made his first-class debut on 26 January 2002 against Hyderabad Cricket Association in the [[Quaid-e-Azam Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2001-02/PAK_LOCAL/QEA/SCORECARDS/POOL-A/GUJRAN_HYDCA_QEA_26-29JAN2002.html "Hyderabad Cricket Association v Gujranwala Cricket Association scorecard"], ''Cricinfo'', 26 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He took 5–28 in his first innings. In his first season, he finished as the 4th highest wicket taker in his team despite only playing 3 matches.

===Rawtenstall Cricket Club===
Naved Arif signed for [[Rawtenstall Cricket Club]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]] during the 2010 season. Arif was largely described as a big success despite taking time to come to terms with English conditions. Arif took 64 wickets during the season with an average of 18.00 and a best of 8–35 against [[Lowerhouse Cricket Club]]. He was also a useful run scorer for the club. He scored 769 runs at 40.5 with 5 half centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lancashireleague.com/Players/Lancashire/PRO_PLAYERS/ARIF_NAVED.html "Naved Arif at Rawtenstall CC"], ''Lancashire League''&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Rawtenstall CC that Arif was given his nickname 'Barry' (as in the Great Barry Arif)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussexcricket.co.uk/fanzone/message-board/post/135016/#p135016 "'Barry' Arif"], ''Sussex Cricket Message Board''&lt;/ref&gt; a nickname that was adopted by his next club, Sussex CCC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/29/naved-arif-sussex-lancashire "Career-best by Naved Arif saves Sussex from defeat against Lancashire"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sussex County Cricket Club===
In February 2011, [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] announced that they had signed Naved Arif for the 2011 season. They stated that he would qualify to play as a non-overseas player due to his Danish-born wife. [[Mark Robinson (cricketer, born 1966)|Mark Robinson]], the Sussex coach, said that, "Naved is a late developer, and with his background in Pakistan he's had to do it the tough way." He added, "His record out there on unhelpful wickets is outstanding and he's got the potential to change games".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/502961.html "Sussex go global to build squad"], ''Cricinfo''&lt;/ref&gt; Naved Arif made his debut for Sussex in the [[County Championship]] match against [[Lancashire]] at [[Liverpool]]. Arif managed only 1 wicket in the match as Lancashire beat Sussex comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2011/engine/match/492087.html "Lancashire v Sussex scorecard"], ''Cricinfo''&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved cult hero status in his home debut at [[Hove]]. Once again, Sussex were facing almost certain defeat against Lancashire when Arif put on 90 runs with [[Monty Panesar]] for the 10th wicket to save the match. He also achieved his highest score in [[first-class cricket]] as he converted his first ever half century into an unbeaten century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2011/engine/match/492098.html "Sussex v Lancashire scorecard"], ''Cricinfo''&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite having the 4th best first-class average for Sussex in 2011, Naved Arif only played 4 matches. He took 15 wickets at 25.86.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2011/engine/records/bowling/best_career_bowling_average.html?class=4;id=2011;team=1422;type=season "Sussex first-class Bowling Averages"], ''Cricinfo''&lt;/ref&gt;
He made more of an impact in the List A campaign where he played 12 matches and took 9 wickets at 45.77 regularly bowling in tandem with fellow left handed fast bowler, Chris Liddle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2011/engine/records/bowling/best_career_bowling_average.html?class=5;id=2011;team=1422;type=season "Sussex List A Bowling Averages"], ''Cricinfo''&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Sussex announced that Naved Arif had signed a new one-year contract with Sussex. Naved stated, "I want to say thank you to Sussex for keeping faith in me. I know I have so much more to give the team in 2012 and I aim to establish myself as a regular". Cricket manager, Mark Robinson said, "I’m delighted that Naveed has agreed to come back for another year. Despite his age, he is still in many ways inexperienced. He is still learning and has got lots more to give."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussexcricket.co.uk/news/3026/naveed-arif-signs-for-second-year-at-sussex/"], ''Sussex CCC''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Naved Arif is married to a [[Danish people|Danish]] citizen and therefore was qualified to play for Sussex as non-overseas player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/counties/sussex/9406422.stm|title=Sussex complete signing of trio|date=24 February 2011|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''point guard''' ('''PG'''), also called the '''one''' or '''point''', is one of the five [[Basketball position|positions]] in a regulation [[basketball]] game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a [[quarterback]] in [[American football]] or a [[playmaker]] in [[association football]] (soccer). While the point guard must understand and accept the coach's gameplan, they must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing, and they also must control the pace of the game.

A point guard, like other player positions in basketball, specializes in certain skills. A point guard's primary job is to facilitate scoring opportunities for his/her team, or sometimes for themselves. [[Lee Rose (basketball)|Lee Rose]] has described a point guard as a coach on the floor, who can handle and distribute the ball to teammates. This involves setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate in the best position to score, and controlling the tempo of the game. A point guard should know when and how to instigate a [[fast break]] and when and how to initiate the more deliberate sets. Point guards are expected to be vocal floor leaders. A point guard needs always to have in mind the times on the [[shot clock]] and the game clock, the score, the numbers of remaining timeouts for both teams, etc.

Among the taller players who have enjoyed success at the position is [[Ben Simmons]], who at 6’ 10” won the 2018 [[National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year Award]]. Behind him is [[Magic Johnson]], who at 6’ 9” (2.06 m) won the [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award]] three times in his career. Other point guards who have been named NBA MVP include [[Russell Westbrook]], [[Bob Cousy]], [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Allen Iverson]], [[Derrick Rose]] and two-time winners [[Steve Nash]] and [[Stephen Curry]]. In the [[NBA]], point guards are usually about 6' 3" (1.93 m) or shorter, and average about 6' 2" (1.88 m) whereas in the [[WNBA]], point guards are usually 5' 9" (1.75 m) or shorter. Having above-average size (height, muscle) is considered advantageous, although size is secondary to situational awareness, speed, quickness, and ball handling skills. Shorter players tend to be better dribblers since they are closer to the floor, and thus have better control of the ball while dribbling. 

After an opponent scores, it is typically the point guard who brings the ball down court to begin an offensive play. Passing skills, ball handling, and court vision are crucial. Speed is important; a speedy point guard is better able to create separation and space off the dribble, giving him/herself room to work. Point guards are often valued more for their [[assist (basketball)|assist]] totals than for their scoring. Another major evaluation factor is Assist-to-[[Turnover (basketball)|Turnover]] ratio, which reflects the decision-making skills of the player. Still, a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective [[jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]].

== Offense ==
[[File:SteveNash3.jpg|thumb|[[Steve Nash]] led the NBA in assists five times.]]
The point guard is positioned on the perimeter of the play, so as to have the best view of the action. This is a necessity because of the point guard's many leadership obligations. Many times, the point guard is referred to by announcers as a "coach on the floor" or a "floor general". In the past, this was particularly true, as several point guards such as [[Lenny Wilkens]] served their teams as player-coaches. This is not so common anymore, as most coaches are now solely specialized in coaching and are non-players. Some point guards are still given a great deal of leeway in the offense. Even point guards who are not given this much freedom, however, are still extensions of their coach on the floor and must display good leadership skills. 

Along with leadership and a general basketball acumen, ball-handling is a skill of great importance to a point guard. Generally speaking, the point guard is the player in possession of the ball for the most time during a game and is responsible for maintaining possession of the ball for his team in the face of any pressure from the opponents. Point guards must be able to maintain possession of the ball in crowded spaces and in traffic and be able to advance the ball quickly. A point guard that has enough ball-handling skill and quickness to be able to drive to the basket in a half-court set is also very valuable and considered by some to be a must for a successful offense.

After ball-handling, passing and scoring are the most important areas of the game for a point guard. As the primary decision-maker for a team, a point guard's passing ability determines how well a point guard is able to put his decision into play. It is one thing to be able to recognize the player that is in a tactically advantageous position, but it is another thing entirely to be able to deliver the ball to that player. For this reason, a point guard is usually, but not always, more skilled and focused on passing than shooting. However, a good jump shot and the ability to score off a drive to the basket are still valuable skills. A point guard will often use his ability to score in order to augment his effectiveness as a decision maker and play maker.

In addition to the traditional role of the point guard, modern teams have found new ways to utilize the position. Notably, several modern point guards have used a successful style of post play, a tactic usually practiced by much larger centers and forwards. Working off of the fact that the opposing point guard is in all probability an undersized player with limited strength, several modern point guards have developed games close to the basket that include being able to utilize the drop step, spin move, and fade away jump shot. 

[[File:Stephen Curry 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stephen Curry]] is one of the best scoring point guards in [[NBA]] history.]]
In recent years, the sport's shift from a fundamental style of play to a more athletic, scoring-oriented game resulted in the proliferation of so-called [[Combo Guard|combo guards]] at the point guard position. More explosive and athletic point guards focus on scoring as opposed to play-making, forgoing assists and ball-movement, and often defense, for higher scoring numbers. Young players who are relatively short are now developing the scoring aspects of their skill-sets, whereas previously these players would find it difficult to enter the NBA without true point guard skills. These [[combo guard|combo]] point guards can surprise defenses. Instead of passing after bringing up the ball they quickly drive to the basket or step back for an outside shot. There are some disadvantages to this style of play. A point guard often controls the offense and he also controls who gets the ball and who doesn't, as this type of controlling style of play is necessary to control the tempo of a game. Scoring point guards typically look to score first, thus preventing teammates from getting the ball. This can cause other players to become dis-involved in the offense. Even so, combo guards still require above-average passing skill, but not as much as possessed by "pure" point guards (which is what those in the traditional mold of a point guard are referred to).

[[File:PaytonHeat.jpg|thumb|[[Gary Payton]], a point guard known for defensive prowess.]]
A point guard primarily defends on the perimeter, just as he primarily plays on the perimeter on offense. On defense, the point guard is tasked with making the opposing point guard as ineffective as possible. A defensive point guard will try to accomplish this with constant pressure on the ball, making it difficult to maintain possession. A defensive point guard will also pressure opponents in passing lanes in an attempt to generate steals and scoring opportunities for his own team.

'''Portrack Lane''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[County Durham|Durham]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1839, when Stockton played an [[All-England Eleven]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/758_misc.html Other matches played on Portrack Lane]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground also hosted 2 [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches, the first of which was in 1858 when a combined Yorkshire and Durham team played [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]].  The second and final first-class match to be played on the ground came in 1861, when Yorkshire with Stockton-on-Tees played [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/758_f.html First-Class Matches played on Portrack Lane]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match on the ground saw Stockton play a [[United South of England Eleven]].  Shortly after this the ground ceased to be used for cricket matches. The ground was located at the far western end of Portrack Lane. By 1899, an iron works had been built on the ground, with the site today is occupied by an industrial estate and a [[gas holder]].
Portrack Lane is now primarily known as a major shopping area / complex in Stockton on Tees  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stocktonteesside.co.uk/portrack-lane-shopping-in-stockton.html Shopping at Portrack Lane]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asda]] have had a large superstore on Portrack Lane since 1970. The old store was replaced by a larger new store with a petrol filling station in May 2008. The old building was subsequently demolished.

'''Suphanburi Provincial Stadium''' ({{Lang-th|สนามกีฬากลางจังหวัดสุพรรณบุรี}}), formerly known as ''Suphan Buri World War II Stadium (''สนามกีฬาสงครามโลกครั้งที่ 2 จังหวัดสุพรรณบุรี), is a multi-purpose [[stadium]] and the home of [[Suphanburi F.C.]], located in [[Suphan Buri]], [[Suphan Buri Province]], [[Thailand]]. It was opened in 1947 and expanded in 2001.

After Suphanburi F.C. came back to the top level as promoted to [[2013 Thai Premier League]], the stadium was re-expanded during the early time of the 2013 season as the northern stand was additionally built (only three sides beforehand) and entirely seated. The capacity then turned out to be 25,000 (standing (east and south) and seated (north and west)). Subsequent to the 2015 season ([[2015 Thai Premier League]]) and prior to the 2016 season ([[2016 Thai League T1]]), the roof of the main stand located on the west was renovated as required by the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]. Since January 2018, to lift up the club's standards and follow the AFC's club licensing enforced 2019 onwards, the stadium became [[All-seater stadium|all-seater]] bringing the capacity down to about 15,000.

Its historical highest attendance was 25,709, for Suphanburi winning 2-1 over Muangthong United in [[2015 Thai Premier League]] on 4 April 2015.

On 1 February 2014, the stadium also held the match of [[2014 Kor Royal Cup]] (acting as Thai super cup), where [[Buriram United F.C.|Buriram United]] won the trophy by beating [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] 1-0.

'''Tug of war''' (also known as Lbeng Teanh Prot[ in [[Cambodia|Khmer]]: ល្បែងទាញព្រ័ត្រ] '''war of tug''', '''tug o' war''', '''tug war''', '''rope war''', '''rope pulling''', '''tugging war''' or {{lang-af|'''toutrek'''}}) is a sport that directly puts two teams against each other in a test of strength: teams pull on opposite ends of a [[rope]], with the goal being to bring the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team's pull.

==Terminology==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says that the phrase "tug of war" originally meant "the decisive contest; the real struggle or tussle; a severe contest for supremacy". Only in the 19th century was it used as a term for an athletic contest between two teams who haul at the opposite ends of a rope.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Awatoceanofmilk01.JPG|thumb|upright|A tug of war between [[asura]]s and [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]]&lt;ref&gt;The bas-relief of the [[Samudra manthan|Churning of the Sea of Milk]] shows [[Vishnu]] in the centre, his turtle [[avatar]] [[Kurma]] below, [[asura]]s and [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] to left and right, and [[apsaras]] and [[Indra]] above.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Angkor Wat]], Cambodia)]]
The origins of tug of war are uncertain, but this sport was practised in [[Cambodia]], [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient India|India]] and [[Ancient China|China]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; where it was held in legend that the Sun and Moon Lakhon Khol or Khmer Mask Drama Dance is a Cambodian traditional theater that has its origins in pre-Angkorian performance. It is believed to have begun during the mid-9th century through the carvings on the walls of Angkor. During the Angkorian period, the drama was developed by a man entirely in the dance of the Royal Palace. The real reason is still unknown, but researchers have shown that the rise of religion has made Buddhism conflict with Buddhism during the reign of Jayavarman VII (1243-1295). Many dancers have been murdered, so they have trained male dancers to create this dance based on Buddhists.

According to a [[Tang dynasty]] book, ''The Notes of Feng'', tug of war, under the name "hook pulling" (牽鉤), was used by the military commander of the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (8th century BC to 5th century BC) to train warriors. During the Tang dynasty, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]]  promoted large-scale tug of war games, using ropes of up to {{convert|167|m|ft}} with shorter ropes attached, and more than 500 people on each end of the rope. Each side also had its own team of [[drummer]]s to encourage the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Tang dynasty Feng Yan: Notes of Feng, volume 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]] the sport was called ''helkustinda'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ἑλκυστίνδα), ''efelkustinda'' (ἐφελκυστίνδα) and ''dielkustinda'' (διελκυστίνδα),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddielkusti%2Fnda διελκυστίνδα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from ''dielkō'' (διέλκω), meaning amongst others "I pull through",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddie%2Flkw διέλκω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; all deriving from the verb ''helkō'' (ἕλκω), "I draw, I pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%28%2Flkw ἕλκω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Helkustinda'' and ''efelkustinda'' seem to have been ordinary versions of tug of war, while ''dielkustinda'' had no rope, according to [[Julius Pollux]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollux, 9.112&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the teams held hands when pulling, which would have increased difficulty, since handgrips are more difficult to sustain than a grip of a rope. Tug of war games in ancient Greece were among the most popular games used for strength and would help build strength needed for battle in full armor.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Marie Layne, ''The Enculturative Function of Toys and Games in Ancient Greece and Rome'', ProQuest, UMI Dissertation Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological evidence shows that tug of war was also popular in India in the 12th century:

{{quote|There is no specific time and place in history to define the origin of the game of Tug of War. The contest of pulling on the rope originates from ancient ceremonies and rituals. Evidence is found in countries like Egypt, India, Myanmar, New Guinea... The origin of the game in India has strong archaeological roots going back at least to the 12th century AD in the area what is today the State of Orissa on the east coast. The famous Sun Temple of Konark has a stone relief on the west wing of the structure clearly showing the game of Tug of War in progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tugofwarindia.gov.in/History/en-GB/code/Subcontinent/default.aspx Tug of War Federation of India: History] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a sport==
[[File:1904 tug of war.jpg|thumb|Tug of war competition in [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]
There are tug of war clubs in many countries, and both men and women participate.

The sport was [[Tug of war at the Summer Olympics|part of the Olympic Games]] from 1900 until 1920, but has not been included since. The sport is part of the [[World Games]]. The [[Tug of War International Federation]] (TWIF), organises World Championships for nation teams biannually, for both indoor and outdoor contests, and a similar competition for club teams.

In England the sport was formally governed by the [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] until 1984, but is now catered for by the Tug of War Association (formed in 1958), and the Tug of War Federation of Great Britain (formed in 1984). In Scotland, the Scottish Tug of War Association was formed in 1980. The sport also features in [[Highland Games]] there.

Between 1976 and 1988 Tug of War was a regular event during the television series ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. Teams of celebrities representing each major network competed in different sporting events culminating into the final event, the Tug of War. [[Lou Ferrigno]]'s  epic tug-o'-war performance in May 1979 is considered the greatest feat in 'Battle' history.

==National organizations==
[[File:Harvard tug of war team 1888.jpg|thumb|[[Harvard]] Tug of War team, 1888]]
The sport is played almost in every country in the world. However, a small selection of countries have set up a national body to govern the sport. Most of these national bodies are associated then with the International governing body call TWIF which stands for The Tug of War International Federation. As of 2008 there are 53 countries associated with TWIF, among which are [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[England]], [[India]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.figest.it/&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]].

==Regional variations==

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, ''Tarik Tambang'' is a popular sport held in many events, such as the [[Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration, school events, and scout events. The rope used is called ''dadung'', made from fibers of ''lar'' between two jousters. Two [[cinder blocks]] are placed a distance apart and the two jousters stand upon the blocks with a rope stretched between them. The objective for each jouster is to either a) cause their opponent to fall off their block, or b) to take their opponent's end of the rope from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Maximum Middle School Physical Education |author=Mary Hirt, Irene Ramos |chapter=Rope Jousting |page=144 |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7360-5779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===

In [[Japan]], the tug of war (綱引き/Tsunahiki in Japanese) is a staple of school sports festivals. The tug-of-war is also a traditional way to pray for a plentiful harvest throughout Japan and is a popular ritual around the country. The Kariwano Tug-of-war in [[Daisen, Akita]], is said to be more than 500 years old, and is a national folklore cultural asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/michi/cgi/detail.cgi?dasID=D0004200024_00000　Kariwano Ootsunahiki] NHK&lt;/ref&gt; The Underwater Tug-of-War Festival in [[Mihama, Fukui]] is 380 years old, and takes place every January.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=103YC1hftQc　Underwater Tug-of-War Festival in Mihama] Fukui Shimbun, 2013/01/20&lt;/ref&gt; The Sendai Great Tug of War in [[Satsumasendai, Kagoshima]] is known as ''Kenka-zuna'' or "brawl tug".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kic-update.com/en/whatup/sendai-great-tug-of-war-sendai-otsunahiki- SENDAI GREAT TUG-of WAR (Sendai Otsunahiki / 川内大綱引き)] Kagoshima Internationalization Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 3,000 men pull a huge rope which is {{convert|365|m|ft}} long. The event is said to have been started by feudal warlord Yoshihiro Shimadzu, with the aim of boosting the morale of his soldiers before the decisive [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. Nanba Hachiman Jinja's tug-of-war, which started in the [[Edo period]], is [[Osaka]]'s folklore cultural asset.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH0g1Ow0RrM Tsunahiki Shinji(Shinto ritual)] Nanba Hachiman Jinja, 2015/01/18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naha Tug-of-war]] in [[Okinawa]] is also famous.

=== Korea ===
{{main|Juldarigi}}
Juldarigi ({{korean|hangul=줄다리기}}, also '''''chuldarigi''''') is a traditional [[Korea]]n sport similar to tug of war. It has a ritual and divinatory significance to many agricultural communities in the country and is performed at festivals and community gatherings. The sport uses two huge rice-straw ropes, connected by a central peg, which is pulled by teams representing the East and West sides of the village (the competition is often rigged in favor of the Western team). A number of religious and traditional rituals are performed before and after the actual competition.

Several areas of Korea have their own distinct variations of ''juldarigi'', and similar tug-of-war games with connections to agriculture are found in rural communities across [[Southeast Asia]].

=== Peru ===
The Peruvian children's series ''[[Nubeluz]]'' featured its own version of tug-of-war (called ''La Fuerza Glufica''), where each team battled 3-on-3 on platforms suspended over a pool of water in an effort to pull the other team into the pool.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, a [[Polish Dragon Boat Racing|version]] of tug of war is played using a [[dragon boat]], where teams of 6 or 8 attempt to row towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/26/poland-tug-of-war-dragon-boat/|title=Dragon boat tug of war is Poland's newest sports craze|last=Lynch|first=Molly|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Miami University ====
[[File:GW Puddle Pull 031.jpg|thumb|right|2004 Greek Week Puddle Pull at [[Miami University]]]]
Puddle Pull is a biannual tug of war contest held at [[Miami University]].  The current event is a timed, seated variation of tug of war in which [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternities &amp; Sororities]] compete.  In addition to the seated participants, each team has a caller who coordinates the movements of the team.

Although the university did host an unrelated freshman vs. sophomores tug of war event in the 1910s and 1920s, the first record of modern Puddle Pull is its appearance as a tug of war event in the school's newspaper, [[The Miami Student]], in May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/cdm/ref/collection/student/id/3446 | work= [[The Miami Student]] | title= Delta Chis Win Tug-O-War As Large Crowd Watches | date= May 24, 1949 | volume= 074 | number= 55 | accessdate= March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fraternity event was created by Frank Dodd of the Miami Chapter of [[Delta Upsilon]].  Originally, the event was held as a standing tug of war over the [[Four Mile Creek (Ohio)|Tallawanda stream]] near the Oxford waterworks bridge in which the losers were pulled into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/cdm/ref/collection/student/id/3912 | work= [[The Miami Student]] | title= Fraternity Tug-O-War Teams Begin Practice For Struggle | date= May 20, 1949 | volume= 074 | number= 56 | accessdate= March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This first event was later seen as a driving force for creating interfraternity competitive activities (Greek Week) at Miami University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/cdm/ref/collection/student/id/4672 | work= [[The Miami Student]] | title= Greek Week Has Brief, Busy Past | date= April 20, 1965 | volume= 088 | number= 44 | accessdate= March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a part of moving to a seated event, a new rule was created in 1966 to prohibit locks and created the event that is seen today with the exception of a large pit that was still being dug in between the two teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/cdm/ref/collection/student/id/4864 | work= [[The Miami Student]] | title= Greeks Set Theme Of 'Athenian Antics' | date= April 13, 1965 | volume= 088 | number= 42 | accessdate= March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/14217600/ | title= Greek Week Scheduled | date= April 29, 1971 | accessdate= March 20, 2018 | work= [[Hamilton JournalNews|The Journal News]] | page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event is held in a level grass field and uses a 2-inch diameter rope that is at least 50 feet long is used for the event. Footholes or "pits" are dug for each participant at 20-inch intervals. The pits are dug with a flat front and an angled back.  Women began to compete sporadically starting in the 1960s and would become regular participants as sorority teams in the mid-1980s.

==== Hope College ====
[[The Hope College Pull]] is an annual tug-of-war contest held across the [[Macatawa River|Black River]] in [[Holland, Michigan]] on the fourth Saturday after Labor Day. Competitors are 40 members of the freshman and sophomore classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/10/victory_in_hope_colleges_pull.html | title= Victory in Hope College annual 'Pull' goes to sophomore class | date= October 4, 2016 | accessdate= August 1, 2018 | last= Farrand | first= Allison | website= [[MLive Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal rules==
[[File:Touwtrekken.jpg|thumb|The Dutch team at the 2006 World Championships]]
Two teams of eight, whose total mass must not exceed a maximum weight as determined for the class, align themselves at the end of a [[rope]] approximately {{convert|11|cm|in}} in [[circumference]]. The rope is marked with a "centre line" and two markings {{convert|4|m|ft}} to either side of the centre line. The teams start with the rope's centre line directly above a line marked on the ground, and once the contest (the "pull") has commenced, attempt to pull the other team such that the marking on the rope closest to their opponent crosses the centre line, or the opponents commit a foul.&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=TWIF Rules|accessdate=2018-04-08|url=http://tugofwar-twif.org/2016/08/05/rules/| work=2017 TWIF Rules Manual|date=2017|publisher=Tug of War International Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering one's elbow below the knee during a pull, known as "locking", is a foul, as is touching the ground for extended periods of time. The rope must go under the arms; actions such as pulling the rope over the shoulders may be considered a foul. These rules apply in highly organized competitions such as the World Championships. However, in small or informal entertainment competitions, the rules are often arbitrarily interpreted and followed.&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt;

A contest may feature a [[moat]] in a neutral zone, usually of mud or softened ground, which eliminates players who cross the zone or fall into it.

==Tactics==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Highland games tug of war 2.JPG|thumb|Tug of war at the [[Highland Games]] in [[Stirling]]]]
Aside from the raw muscle power needed for tug of war, it is also a technical sport. The cooperation or "rhythm" of team members play an equally important role in victory, if not more, than their physical strength. To achieve this, a person called a "driver" is used to harmonize the team's joint traction power. He moves up and down next to his team pulling on the rope, giving orders to them when to pull and when to rest (called "hanging"). If he spots the opponents trying to pull his team away, he gives a "hang" command, each member will dig into the grass with his/her boots and movement of the rope is limited. When the opponents are played out, he shouts "pull" and rhythmically waves his hat or handkerchief for his team to pull together. Slowly but surely, the other team is forced into surrender by a runaway pull. Another factor that affects the game that is little known are the players' [[weight]]s. The heavier someone is, the more [[static friction]] their feet have to the ground, and if there isn't enough friction and they weigh too little, even if he/she is pulling extremely hard, the force won't go into the rope. Their feet will simply slide along the ground if their opponent(s) have better static friction with the ground. In general, as long as one team has enough static friction and can pull hard enough to overcome the static friction of their opponent(s), that team can easily win the match.

==Injury risks==
In addition to injuries from falling and from [[Back injury|back strains]] (some of which may be serious), catastrophic injuries may occur, such as finger, hand, or even arm [[amputation]]s. Amputations or [[Avulsion injury|avulsions]] may result from two causes: looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist, and impact from [[Tether|elastic recoil]] if the rope breaks. Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated, or overestimate the [[breaking strength]] of common ropes, and may thus be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension. The broken ends of a rope made with a somewhat [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[polymer]] such as common [[nylon]] can reach high speeds, and can easily sever fingers. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contractorsrope.com/tug-of-war-rope.html?gclid=CPS-9-L4wMgCFUoXHwod7BMKoQ|date=October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universal Rating System''' (URS) is a system for rating [[chess]] players devised by [[Jeff Sonas]], [[Mark Glickman]], J. Isaac Miller and Maxime Rischard. It was introduced to determine seedings and qualification for the 2017 [[Grand Chess Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universalrating.com/about-us.php |title=Universal Rating System |date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference from [[FIDE]]'s [[Elo rating system]] is the combination of all three time controls (classical, rapid and blitz) into a single rating list, whereas FIDE maintains three different rating lists.

==Development==
The first rating list was published in January 2017, following two years of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chess.com/news/wesley-so-also-wins-london-chess-classic-3027|title=Wesley So Double Winner In London|date=2016-12-18|last=Doggers|first=Peter|publisher=Chess.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monthly rating lists from August 2016 onwards have been retroactively published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universalrating.com/ratings.php|title=Universal Rating System |date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number one player in every rating so far has been [[Magnus Carlsen]], with [[Hikaru Nakamura]] occupying second place.
