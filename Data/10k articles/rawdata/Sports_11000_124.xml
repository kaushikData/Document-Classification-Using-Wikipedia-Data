      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5989">The '''Albert Ground''' was a cricket ground located in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] between 1864 and 1877.

==History==
[[File:Albert Ground Sydney.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of an 1876 [[intercolonial cricket in Australia|intercolonial cricket]] match between [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] and [[Victorian cricket team|Victoria]] at the Albert Ground]]
[[Cricket]] had been played in [[NSW]] since 1803, first in [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and then in the [[The Domain, Sydney|Domain]]. Neither were satisfactory facilities mainly because they were open grounds on which spectators walked and animals grazed. Fences could not be erected to keep people and animals out or to charge much needed admission.

When the Albert Ground opened in Redfern on 29 October 1864, these problems appeared to be solved. The ground had been developed as a money-making venture in the swampy area that Redfern was at the time.

Despite this, the Albert Ground had significant advantages over Sydney’s existing cricket facilities. It was centrally located and featured good facilities for players and crowd alike. There was a grandstand in the north west corner and a pavilion ran around three sides of the ground. A row of trees had been planted by the [[English cricket]] tourists of 1863-1864 captained by [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]].

The pitch was made of a matted [[Cynodon dactylon|couch grass]] and was very spongy and soft. It was a slow pitch that favoured the bowlers. The ground was the home of the Albert Club, one of the most powerful in Sydney, which could boast three teams of 11. The club’s players wore white caps and pants and blue shirts and counted amongst their number the greatest bowler of the day ‘The Demon’ [[Fred Spofforth]].

Above all however, the Albert Ground had been established as a business with the aim of making money and fees were charged to those who wanted to use it, including the [[New South Wales Cricket Association|NSW Cricket Association]]. The cost to the NSWCA of staging matches there was so high that until the early 1870s it continued to use the Domain whenever possible despite its disadvantages. By then inter-colonial games had become so important and popular that the NSWCA had little choice but to use the Albert Ground for these at least. In all, five first-class matches were played at the Albert Ground between the 1870 and 1877 seasons.

In the late 1870s however, the Albert Ground company was wound up and the ground closed. The NSWCA began using the Garrison Ground at [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]], later to be renamed the Association Ground and then the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. Eventually the Albert Ground was demolished.

The Albert Ground was located to the east of Redfern Park in the block now roughly bounded by Elizabeth, Redfern, Kettle and Moorehead Streets. The site is now occupied by public housing.

'''Armand Rousso''', also known as '''Marc Rousso''', is a [[France|French]] businessman. He is the founder of Accoona.com, a business-to-business search engine, and X3D Technology. He is the father of [[Vanessa Rousso]], professional [[poker]] player and [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|Big Brother]] contestant.

== Biography ==
French born entrepreneur Armand Rousso settled in the United States in 1982, working as a trader of stamps. In 1985 he stated he bartered $45 million (catalog value) in rare stamps.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In 1986, when the Internet was little known entity, Rousso started an online stamp exchange website, ''The International Stamp Exchange'', which lasted until 1990. The International Stamp Exchange was part of a network by David N. Glassman who created NaicoNet the first online retail online stock trading system.  He thought online advertising revenues could be lucrative enough to make a business dedicated to philatelists profitable. Rousso and the ISE are profiled in the March 28, 1988 issue of [[New York Magazine]].

In the mid 1990s, Rousso became involved with Philippe V. Hababou, a Frenchman convicted of check fraud. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money-laundering charges; in 1999, he was convicted of securities fraud in France and was also noted in the investigation over illegal campaign contributions to the 1996 Senate campaign of [[Robert G. Torricelli]].&lt;ref name="misgivings"/&gt;

Rousso was identified as having bought at auction the [[Treskilling Yellow]], a unique Swedish [[postage stamp]] printed in the wrong color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stamps.about.com/od/buyingsellingstamps/qt/Mystery-Owner-Of-Treskilling-Yellow-Rarity-Revealed.htm John Finch, Mystery Owner of Treskilling Yellow Rarity Revealed, Entrepreneur and Fixture on the Philatelic Scene]&lt;/ref&gt; The stamp had been auctioned on 22 May 2010, by David Feldman in Geneva, Switzerland, for at least $2.3 million, the world's record price for a stamp at auction.  In May 2013 the stamp was acquired in a private sale by [[Gustaf Douglas|Count Gustaf Douglas]], a Swedish nobleman and politician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stampmagazine.co.uk/news/article/treskilling-yellow-is-back-in-the-hands-of-a-philatelist/17013 Treskilling Yellow is back in the hands of a philatelist] by Julia Lee, stampmagazine.co.uk, 1 November 2013. Retrieved 6 November 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6KvVwRib9 Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Hoff''' (9 May 1902 &amp;ndash; 19 February 1985) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]], coach, sports journalist, novelist and sports administrator.

As an active athlete he competed in [[pole vault]], [[long jump]], [[triple jump]], [[sprint (running)|sprints]] and [[middle distance running]] events. He set four [[world records in athletics|world records]] [[World record progression pole vault men|in the pole vault]] during his career, became Norwegian champion ten times in different events, and competed in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. In 1926 he was excluded from the sport for [[Professional sport|professionalism]].

After his time as an athlete he took up a career as a sports journalist. During [[World War II]] he was a sports leader under the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]], leading the [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports|Norwegian Confederation of Sports]] from 1942 to 1944.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Fredrikstad]] as the son of mechanic Karl Ludvig Hoff and his wife Olga Kristine Karlsen. After taking the [[examen artium]] in 1921, he moved to [[Oslo|Kristiania]] to attend the [[Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry]]. He also briefly attended the [[Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts]] as well as a painting school in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|title=Charles Hoff|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Finn|last=Olstad|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|editor=Helle, Knut|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Charles_Hoff/utdypning|accessdate=26 February 2009|language=Norwegian|editor-link=Knut Helle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics career==
Hoff set his first [[world records in athletics|world record]] [[World record progression pole vault men|in the pole vault]] on 22 July 1922 in [[Copenhagen]] with 4.12 metres. He increased this record to 4.21 metres exactly one year later in the same city, then to 4.23 metres on 13 August 1925 in Oslo, and finally on 27 September 1925 when he jumped 4.25 metres at a meet in [[Turku]]. The record stood until May 1927, when American [[Sabin Carr]] jumped 4.27 metres.&lt;ref name=athletix&gt;{{cite news|url=http://athletix.org/?p=693.html|title=World Record Progression.

Internationally he competed at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], in both [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres|400]] and [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Men's 800 metres|800 metres]]. He reached the semi-final in the 400 metres and finished eighth in the 800 metres final. He did not participate in the [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics - Men's pole vault|pole vault]] due to an injured ankle.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Charles Hoff|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|first=Rolf|last=Bryhn|author2=Knut Are Tvedt|url=http://www.snl.no/Charles_Hoff|accessdate=26 February 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the Norwegian champion in the 200 metres from 1923 and 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/m200.htm|title=Norwegian championships medallists, men's 200 metres|publisher=Norwegian Athletics Association|accessdate=21 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202408/http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/m200.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 400 metres from 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/m400.htm|title=Norwegian championships medallists, men's 400 metres|publisher=Norwegian Athletics Association|accessdate=21 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202623/http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/m400.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the pole vault from 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/mpv.htm|title=Norwegian championships medallists, men's pole vault|publisher=Norwegian Athletics Association|accessdate=21 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185054/http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/mpv.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the triple jump from 1922 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/mtj.htm|title=Norwegian championships medallists, men's triple jump|publisher=Norwegian Athletics Association|accessdate=21 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205234039/http://www.friidrett.no/friidrett/statistikk/nm/mtj.htm |archivedate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the sports club [[Torshaug IF]], Hoff won the King's Cup twice. In total he held fourteen Norwegian records in 200, 400 and 800 metres, long jump and pole vault.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

In the winter of 1926, Hoff toured the United States, staging show competitions as a part of a [[varieté]] performance group.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Among other things he beat Olympic gold medalist [[Harold Osborn]] in a [[heptathlon]] competition.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; He also set several unofficial world indoor records. Following this tour, however, he was considered to be a [[professional sport]]sperson. This affected his eligibility to compete in the sport of athletics as a whole, since the sport was governed under [[Amateur sports|amateurist]] rules at the time. Hoff explained that the paid performances were necessary to earn a living, as the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] had withheld some money that had been promised to Hoff in advance, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Thus, when jumping a new world record of 4.32 metres in [[Hønefoss]] on 27 September 1931, the record was not ratified by the [[International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF).&lt;ref name=athletix/&gt;

==Non-active career==
In December 1925 he married Heddy Aubert, a daughter of the [[Norsk Hydro|Director General of Norsk Hydro]], [[Axel Aubert]]. The marriage was dissolved after a few years, but Hoff married for the second time, this time to Aase Synnøve Bing Nilsen. Hoff was also a brother-in-law of [[Per Mørch Hansson]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

From 1927 to 1936 he was the editor of the sports magazine ''[[Sportsmanden]]''. He made his mark on ''Sportsmanden'' by emphasizing sensationalist news, front page headlines and the inclusion of pictures. The overall layout, which Hoff in retrospect described as "revolutionary", was inspired by his time in the United States. As a writer he was not uncontroversial, though, and after he was found guilty of libel, he was pressured by the magazine owner to resign. He found a new job as sports editor of ''Oslo Illustrerte'' from 1936 to 1940, and also wrote for the Nasjonal Samling party newspaper ''[[Fritt Folk]]'' in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was also a coach in the [[Norwegian Athletics Association]].&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Tønnesson|first=Stein|authorlink=Stein Tønnesson|editor=Dahl, Hans Fredrik|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Hoff, Charles (Carl Gunnøy)|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/h/h6.html#hoff-charles|accessdate=26 February 2009|edition=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|language=Norwegian|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315115128/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/h/h6.html#hoff-charles|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
When Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by Germany]] in April 1940, many Norwegian athletes volunteered to fight in the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. Hoff then made his mark as he called on the fighters to lay down their weapons and return to the sports field.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; For this he was sacked by the Norwegian Athletics Association.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; However, Germany was able to establish an [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation of Norway]], and soon moved to tighten their grip on Norwegian society. At this point Hoff contacted the ''[[Reichskommissar]]iat'' to propose a Nazi reorganization of sports life in Norway.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; In September 1940 he was given the position as deputy under-secretary of state in the new [[Norwegian Ministry of Labour and Sports|Ministry of Labour and Sports]],&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; which was headed by [[Axel Heiberg Stang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/norway-at-war/ministries-1940---1945---under-german-oc.html?id=438672|title=Norwegian Government Ministries 1940–1945—under German occupation in Oslo|publisher=[[Government.no]]|accessdate=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined the Nasjonal Samling at that time.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

However, the Nazi interference with sports resulted in a nationwide boycott of official athletics meetings in Norway from the end of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Tønnesson |first=Stein |editors=Dahl, Hjeltnes, Nøkleby, Ringdal, Sørensen |encyclopedia=Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45 |title=idrettsstreik |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/i/i1.html#idrettsstreik |page=192 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |volume= |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=27 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185901/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/i/i1.html#idrettsstreik |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the reorganization of sports life was implemented in November 1940, the Germans, knowing that Hoff was unpopular, kept him out of the spotlight. [[Egil Reichborn-Kjennerud]] was installed as leader of the [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports|Norwegian Confederation of Sports]], while Hoff used the [[Hird (Nazi)|Hird]] as an arena for his work. In the spring of 1942, it became clear that Reichborn-Kjennerud had failed to deal with the still-ongoing sports boycott, and Hoff became the new leader of the Confederation of Sports.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; He had a number of grand plans; sports in Norway should be state-led, and the aim was to produce a broad range of athletes rather than a few stars. In addition to the physical dimension, the "spiritual" dimension should be emphasized.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He originally received generous funding, but from 1943 Germany lost interest in his projects, and in 1944 the projects were largely disestablished. Hoff protested this decision, and was removed from his position as a result.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;

===Post-war life===
As a part of the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]] in 1947 he was sentenced to nine years of forced labour.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; A number of his ideas were actually realized some years later, including a national school of sport sciences and a state-owned gambling company.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; [[Norsk Tipping]] was established already in 1948, and the [[Norwegian School of Sport Sciences]] in 1968.

After serving his sentence, Hoff worked as an editor in the publishing house Hauge &amp; Co. In 1952 he published the crime novel ''Døden i Bygdø Allé'', under the pseudonym Texas Bang. He had formerly published the novel ''Systemet'' in 1925 as well as a retelling of his experiences in the United States, titled ''Fra New York til Hollywood. Mine oplevelser i Amerika'', in 1927. Hoff died in 1985 in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

The game of [[chess]] is commonly divided into three phases: the [[chess opening|opening]], [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]], and [[Chess endgame|endgame]].&lt;ref&gt;John Watson, ''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy: Advances Since Nimzowitsch'', Gambit Publications, 1998, p. 10. {{ISBN|1-901983-07-2}}. {{ISBN|0-486-20290-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large body of theory regarding how the game should be played in each of these phases, especially the opening and endgame. Those who write about '''chess theory''', who are often also eminent players, are referred to as "theorists" or "theoreticians".

"Opening theory" commonly refers to consensus, broadly represented by current literature on the openings.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hooper (chess player)|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]], ''[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]'', Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 1992, p. 418 ("theory" entry). {{ISBN|0-19-866164-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Endgame theory" consists of statements regarding specific positions, or positions of a similar type, though there are few universally applicable principles.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; "Middlegame theory" often refers to maxims or principles applicable to the middlegame.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern trend, however, is to assign paramount importance to analysis of the specific position at hand rather than to general principles.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of theory in all of these areas has been assisted by the vast literature on the game. In 1913, preeminent chess historian [[H. J. R. Murray]] wrote in his 900-page magnum opus ''[[A History of Chess]]''
that, "The game possesses a literature which in contents probably exceeds that of all other games combined."&lt;ref&gt;[[H. J. R. Murray]], ''A History of Chess'', Oxford University Press, 1913, p. 25. {{ISBN|0-19-827403-3}}. This quote is also given in Hooper and Whyld, p. 229 ("literature of chess" entry).&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that at that time the "total number of [[list of chess books|books on chess]], [[List of chess periodicals|chess magazines]], and newspapers devoting space regularly to the game probably exceeds 5,000".&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 25 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Baruch Harold Wood|B. H. Wood]] estimated that the number had increased to about 20,000.&lt;ref name="Hooper and Whyld, p. 229"&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See B. H. Wood, "Books About Chess", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 1949, reprinted in [[Fred Reinfeld]] (editor), ''The Treasury of Chess Lore'', Dover, 1959, pp. 268-70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hooper (chess player)|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]] wrote in 1992 that, "Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed..."&lt;ref name="Hooper and Whyld, p. 229"/&gt; The world's largest [[chess libraries|chess library]], the [[John G.

==Opening theory==
[[File:Lucena1497.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Early printed work on chess theory by [[Luis Ramirez de Lucena]] c. 1497]]
The earliest printed work on chess theory, whose date can be established with some exactitude, is ''Repeticion de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez'' by the [[Spain|Spaniard]] [[Luis Ramirez de Lucena]], published c. 1497, which included among other things analysis of eleven chess openings. Some of them are known today as the [[Giuoco Piano]], [[Ruy Lopez]], [[Petroff's Defense]], [[Bishop's Opening]], [[Damiano Defence|Damiano's Defense]], and [[Scandinavian Defense]], though Lucena did not use those terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Golombek]], ''Chess: A History'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1976, pp. 97-101. {{ISBN|0-399-11575-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorship and date of the [[Göttingen manuscript]] are not established,&lt;ref name="Murray, p. 782"&gt;Murray, p. 782.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 156 ("Göttingen manuscript" entry).&lt;/ref&gt; and its publication date is estimated as being somewhere between 1471 and 1505.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether it or Lucena's book was published first.&lt;ref name="Murray, p. 782"/&gt; The manuscript includes examples of games with the openings now known as Damiano's Defence, [[Philidor's Defense]], the Giuoco Piano, Petroff's Defense, the Bishop's Opening, the Ruy Lopez, the [[Ponziani Opening]], the [[Queen's Gambit Accepted]], 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 Bf5 (a form of the [[London System]]), [[Bird's Opening]], and the [[English Opening]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp. 782-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray observes that it "is no haphazard collection of commencements of games, but is an attempt to deal with the Openings in a systematic way."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen years after Lucena's book, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[apothecary]] [[Pedro Damiano]] published the book ''Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi et de la partiti'' (1512) in Rome. It includes analysis of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, showing what happens when Black tries to keep the [[gambit]] [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] with ...b5.&lt;ref&gt;Golombek, pp. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt; Damiano's book "was, in contemporary terms, the first bestseller of the modern game."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eales, ''Chess: The History of a Game'', Facts on File Publications, 1985, p. 81. {{ISBN|0-8160-1195-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Golombek]] writes that it "ran through eight editions in the sixteenth century and continued on into the next century with unflagging popularity."&lt;ref&gt;Golombek, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern players know Damiano primarily because his name is attached to the weak opening Damiano's Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6?), although he condemned rather than endorsed it.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 101 ("Damiano Defence" entry).&lt;/ref&gt;

These books and later ones discuss games played with various openings, opening traps, and the best way for both sides to play. Certain sequences of opening moves began to be given names, some of the earliest being Damiano's Defense, the [[King's Gambit]] (1.e4 e5 2.f4), the [[Queen's Gambit]] (1.d4 d5 2.c4), and the [[Sicilian Defense]] (1.e4 c5).&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 886.&lt;/ref&gt;

Damiano's book was followed by general treatises on chess play by [[Ruy López de Segura]] (1561), [[Giulio Cesare Polerio]] (1590), [[Gioachino Greco]] (c. 1625), [[Joseph Bertin]] (1735), and [[François-André Danican Philidor]] (1749).&lt;ref name="I.A. Horowitz, 1964"&gt;I.A. Horowitz, ''Chess Openings: Theory and Practice'', Simon and Schuster, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, pp. 38–39 ("Bertin, Joseph" entry), 157-58 ("Greco, Gioacchino" entry).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first author to attempt a comprehensive survey of the openings then known was [[Aaron Alexandre]] in his 1837 work ''Encyclopedie des echecs''.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, pp. 10, 280 ("Alexandre, Aaron" and "openings literature" entries).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hooper and Whyld, "[Carl] [[Carl Jaenisch|Jaenisch]] produced the first openings analysis on modern lines in his ''Analyse nouvelle des ouvertures'' (1842-43)."&lt;ref name="Hooper and Whyld, p. 280"&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer]] published the German ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'', which combined the virtues of Alexandre and Jaenisch's works.&lt;ref name="Hooper and Whyld, p. 280"/&gt; The ''Handbuch'', which went through several editions, last being published in several parts in 1912–16, was one of the most important opening references for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;"Bilguer's ''Handbuch'' was the dominant reference for some time until it was superseded by a number of international treatises, which, in the English-speaking world, included ''Modern Chess Openings'' and ''Practical Chess Openings''." I.A. Horowitz, ''Chess Openings: Theory and Practice'', Simon and Schuster, 1964, p. VII. Four years after the first edition of the ''Handbuch'' was published, [[Howard Staunton]] in the preface to ''The Chess-Player's Handbook'', discussed below, called the ''Handbuch'' "a production&amp;mdash;whether considered in reference to its research, its suggestiveness, or the methodical completeness of its arrangement&amp;mdash;which stands unrivalled and alone". Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Handbook'', Henry C. Bohn, 1847, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; The last edition of the ''Handbuch'' was edited by [[Carl Schlechter]], who had drawn a match for the World Championship with [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1910. [[International Master]] [[William Hartston]] called it "a superb work, perhaps the last to encase successfully the whole of chess knowledge within a single volume."&lt;ref&gt;William Hartston, ''The Kings of Chess'', Harper &amp; Row, 1985, p. 87. {{ISBN|0-06-015358-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[England|English]] [[master (chess)|master]] [[Howard Staunton]], perhaps the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Statistician [[Arpad Elo]], developer of the [[Elo rating|Elo rating system]], analyzed the results of all 342 match, tournament, and exhibition games of record among the top nine players in the world from 1846 to 1862. From those games, he estimated the ratings of the top players during that period as 1. [[Paul Morphy]] 2695; 2. [[Adolf Anderssen]] 2552; 3. [[Daniel Harrwitz]] 2518; 4. [[Ignatz Kolisch]] 2516; 5. Staunton 2508. Arpad E. Elo, ''The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present'', Arco Publishing, 1978, p. 55–56. {{ISBN|0-668-04721-6}}. Staunton was arguably the strongest player in the world between 1843, when he won a match against the French champion [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant]], and 1851, when he finished fourth in the London 1851 knock-out tournament, won by Anderssen.&lt;/ref&gt; included over 300 pages of analysis of the openings in his 1847 treatise ''The Chess Player's Handbook.''&lt;ref&gt;Staunton, pp. 59–401.&lt;/ref&gt; That work immediately became the standard reference work in English-speaking countries,&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld state that it "became the standard reference work in English-speaking countries." Hooper and Whyld, p. 280 ("Openings literature" entry).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray states that the book "took rank at once as the leading English text-book on chess." Murray, p. 885.&lt;/ref&gt; and was reprinted 21 times by 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eales, Chess: The History of a Game, Facts on File Publications, 1985, p. 137 (the book "became the standard reference work for English club players down to the end of the century, with twenty-one reprints by 1935"). {{ISBN|0-8160-1195-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "as time passed a demand arose for more up-to-date works in English".&lt;ref name="Whyld p. 280"&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 280 ("Openings literature" entry).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], the first [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]], widely considered the "father of modern chess,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Kasparov]], ''My Great Predecessors, Part I'', Everyman Publishers, 2003, pp. 45–46. {{ISBN|1-85744-330-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Emanuel Lasker]], ''Lasker's Manual of Chess'', Dover Publications, 1960, pp. 188–229. {{ISBN|0-486-20640-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Réti]], ''Masters of the Chessboard'', Dover Publications, 1976, pp. 47–49. {{ISBN|0-486-23384-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Saidy]], ''The Battle of Chess Ideas'', RHM Press, 1975, pp. 20–21. {{ISBN|0-89058-018-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively analyzed various [[Open Game|double king-pawn openings]] (beginning 1.e4 e5) in his book ''The Modern Chess Instructor'', published in 1889 and 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Steinitz, ''The Modern Chess Instructor'', Edition Olms AG, Zürich, 1990 (reprint). {{ISBN|3-283-00111-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1889, [[Edward Freeborough|E. Freeborough]] and the Reverend [[Charles Ranken|C.E. Ranken]] published the first edition of ''Chess Openings Ancient and Modern''; later editions were published in 1893, 1896, and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessville.com/reviews/ChessOpeningsAncientandModern_and_ChessEndings.htm Review of Chess Openings Ancient &amp; Modern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007101938/http://chessville.com/reviews/ChessOpeningsAncientandModern_and_ChessEndings.htm |date=2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, [[Richard Griffith (chess player)|R.C. Griffith]] and [[John Herbert White|J.H. White]] published the first edition of ''[[Modern Chess Openings]]''. It is now the longest-published opening treatise in history; the fifteenth edition (commonly called ''MCO-15''), by [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Nick de Firmian]], was published in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Nick de Firmian, ''Modern Chess Openings, 15th Edition'', McKay Chess Library, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8129-3682-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hooper and Whyld, the various editions of ''Modern Chess Openings'', the last edition of the ''Handbuch'', and the fourth edition of [[Ludvig Collijn|Ludvig Collijn's]] ''[[Larobok]]'' (in [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]]), with groundbreaking contributions by Rubinstein, Reti, Spielmann and Nimzowitch "were the popular reference sources for strong players between the two [[world wars]]."&lt;ref name="Whyld p. 280"/&gt; In 1937-39 former World Champion [[Max Euwe]] published a twelve-volume opening treatise, ''De theorie der schaakopeningen'', in [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]]. It was later translated into other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 281 ("Openings literature" entry).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s to early 1950s [[Reuben Fine]], one of the world's strongest players,&lt;ref&gt;Fine tied for first with [[Paul Keres]] at [[AVRO tournament|AVRO 1938]], at the time the strongest tournament ever held, ahead of such players as reigning world champion [[Alexander Alekhine]], former world champion [[José Raúl Capablanca]], and future world champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]. After Alekhine's death in 1946, Fine was invited to participate in the match-tournament to select the new champion, but declined in order to pursue his study of [[psychoanalysis]]. "From about 1936 to 1951, when he practically gave up competitive chess, Fine was among the strongest eight players in the world." [[David Hooper (chess player)|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]], ''The Oxford Companion to Chess'', Oxford University Press, 1984, p. 113. {{ISBN|0-19-217540-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also became one of its leading theoreticians, publishing important works on the opening, middlegame, and endgame. These began with his revision of ''Modern Chess Openings'', which was published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Griffith, J.H. White, Reuben Fine, and P.W. Sergeant, ''Modern Chess Openings'', David McKay (6th ed. 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he published ''Ideas Behind the Chess Openings'', which sought to explain the principles underlying the openings.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Fine, ''Ideas Behind the Chess Openings'', David McKay, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, he published his own opening treatise, ''Practical Chess Openings'', a competitor to ''MCO''.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Fine, ''Practical Chess Openings'', David McKay, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[International Master]] [[I.A. Horowitz]] published the 789-page tome ''Chess Openings: Theory and Practice'', which in addition to opening analysis includes a large number of illustrative games.&lt;ref name="I.A. Horowitz, 1964"/&gt;

In 1966, the first volume of ''[[Chess Informant]]'' was published in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]], containing 466 annotated games from the leading chess tournaments and matches of the day.&lt;ref&gt;''Chess Informant'', Volume 1, [[Belgrade|Beograd]], 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The hugely influential ''Chess Informant'' series has revolutionized opening theory. Its great innovation is that it expresses games in languageless [[algebraic chess notation#Figurine algebraic notation|figurine algebraic notation]] and annotated them using no words, but rather seventeen symbols, whose meanings were explained at the beginning of the book in six different languages. This enabled readers around the world to read the same games and annotations, thus greatly accelerating the dissemination of chess ideas and the development of opening theory. The editors of ''Chess Informant'' later introduced other publications using the same principle, such as the five-volume ''[[Encyclopedia of Chess Openings]]'' and ''Encyclopedia of Chess Endings'' treatises.  ''Chess Informant'' was originally published twice a year, and since 1991 has been published thrice annually. Volume 100 was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''Chess Informant'', Volume 100, Šahovski Informator, 2007. ISSN 0351-1375.&lt;/ref&gt; It now uses 57 symbols, explained in 10 languages, to annotate games (see [[punctuation (chess)]]), and is available in both print and electronic formats. In 2005, former World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] wrote, "We are all Children of the ''Informant''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahovski.co.rs/other/beyond/article47_ws.htm The Best of Chess Informant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601231112/http://www.sahovski.co.rs/other/beyond/article47_ws.htm |date=June 1, 2011 }}: Garry Kasparov&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and thereafter, the development of opening theory has been further accelerated by such innovations as extremely strong [[chess engines]] such as [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]] and [[Rybka]], [[software]] such as [[ChessBase]], and the sale of multi-million-game databases such as ChessBase's Mega 2013 database, with over 5.4 million games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4008711 The new Mega Database 2013 is shipping] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712034439/http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4008711 |date=July 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the most important openings have been analyzed over 20 moves deep,&lt;ref&gt;For example, various lines of the Botvinnik Variation of the [[Semi-Slav Defense]] (1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 dxc4 6.e4 b5 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5 hxg5 10.Bxg5 Nbd7) have been analyzed more than 30 moves deep. John Watson, ''Mastering the Chess Openings, Volume 2'', Gambit Publications, 2007, p. 101. {{ISBN|978-1-904600-69-5}}. ''Nunn's Chess Openings'' (1999), a one-volume treatise that does not go into as much detail as more specialized opening manuals, analyzed one line of the Botvinnik Variation to a [[List of chess terms#Draw|draw]] by [[perpetual check]] after 44 moves. [[John Nunn]], [[Graham Burgess]], [[John Emms (chess player)|John Emms]], and [[Joseph Gallagher|Joe Gallagher]], ''Nunn's Chess Openings'', Everyman Publishers, 1999, p. 407 n. 41. {{ISBN|1-85744-221-0}}. [[Vladimir Kramnik]] learned after his game with [[Viswanathan Anand]] at the London Chess Classic 2014, also a Botvinnik Variation, that the first 40 moves of the game had occurred in 10 prior games, all played by computer programs. ''New in Chess'' Magazine 2015, No. 1, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes well into the endgame,&lt;ref&gt;GM [[Alexander Kotov]] mentions an instance from the 1950 [[Candidates Tournament]] where GM [[David Bronstein]], "who for years worked closely with [GM Isaac] [[Isaac Boleslavsky|Boleslavsky]]", expressed surprise that the latter was thinking for a long time about his next move in a game against GM [[Gideon Ståhlberg]]. Bronstein remarked that "this position has been analyzed by us far into the end game". Alexander Kotov, "Why the Russians?", ''Chessworld'', January–February 1964, pp. 62–69, at 69. Kotov wrote that the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] had analyzed many opening variations "far into the end game". ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instance, GM [[Andrew Soltis]] mentions a line in the [[Sicilian Defense#Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defense]] that begins 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 Nc6 8.Qd2 0-0 9.Bc4 Nxd4 10.Qxd4 Qa5 11.0-0-0 Be6 12.Bb3 b5 13.Kb1 Rfc8 14.Rhe1! Bxb3 15.cxb3 b4 16.Bxf6! bxc3 17.Bxc3 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Qxc3 19.Qxc3 Rxc3 20.Rc1! Rac8 21.Rxc3 Rxc3 22.Rc1! Rxc1+ 23.Kxc1. Soltis writes that since this position began appearing 30 years ago "it's looked more and more like a forced win for White because he can create an [[outside passed pawn]]. A recent analysis in ''[[New in Chess]]'' concluded that White's win is certain-once you get to move 69." Andrew Soltis, "Chess to Enjoy" column, "The Neutron Bomb Middlegame", ''[[Chess Life]]'', October 2006, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not unusual for leading players to introduce [[List of chess terms#Theoretical novelty|theoretical novelties]] on move 25 or even later.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[John L. Watson]] writes of the [[Ruy Lopez#Marshall Attack|Marshall Attack]] in the [[Ruy Lopez]], "When I opened a book on the Marshall Attack ... I learned that for the 'old main line' (which is still extremely popular), 'the real struggle begins around move 30'! And in fact, [[correspondence chess]] games sometimes take it a step further, with one side playing a new move as the endgame begins!" John Watson, ''Mastering the Chess Openings, Volume 1'', Gambit Publications, 2006, pp. 161–62. {{ISBN|978-1-904600-60-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1542350 Shulman–Marin, Reykjavik Open 2009], [[Mihail Marin|Marin]] played a theoretical novelty on move 34 in the [[Exchange Variation]] of the [[Grünfeld Defense]]. ''[[Chess Informant]]'', ''1000 TN!! The Best Theoretical Novelties'', 2012, pp. 579–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Sicilian Defense#Sveshnikov Variation: 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e5|Sveshnikov Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defense]], another heavily analyzed line, the game O. Korneev–M. Devereaux, [[Port Erin]] 2006, featured a theoretical novelty on Black's 29th move, improving on a previous high-level game [[Veselin Topalov|Topalov]]–[[Peter Leko|Leko]], [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] 2005.

Thousands of books have been written on chess openings. These include both comprehensive openings encyclopedias such as the ''Encyclopedia of Chess Openings'' and ''Modern Chess Openings''; general treatises on how to play the opening such as ''Mastering the Chess Openings'' (in four volumes), by International Master [[John L. Watson]];&lt;ref&gt;''Mastering the Chess Openings, Volume 1'', cited above.&lt;/ref&gt; and myriad books on specific openings, such as ''Understanding the Grünfeld''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Rowson]], ''Understanding the Grünfeld'', Gambit Publications, 1999. {{ISBN|1-901983-09-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Chess Explained: The Classical Sicilian''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Yermolinsky]], ''Chess Explained: The Classical Sicilian'', Gambit Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|1-904600-42-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Books and monographs on openings are popular, and as they are thought to become out of date quickly there is a steady supply of new titles."&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 230 ("literature of chess" entry).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andrew Soltis]], "Virtually all the new information about chess since 1930 has been in the opening."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Soltis, "Tools of the Trade . . .", ''[[Chess Life]]'', July 1995, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middlegame theory==
[[File:Aron Nimzowitsch.jpg|thumb|144px|right|Aron Nimzowitsch]]
Middlegame theory is considerably less developed than either opening theory or endgame theory.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, ''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson writes, "Players wishing to study this area of the game have a limited and rather unsatisfactory range of resources from which to choose."&lt;ref name="Modern Chess Strategy p. 10"&gt;''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest theories to gain attention was that of [[William Steinitz]], who posited that a premature attack against one's opponent in an equal position could be repelled by skillful defence, and so a player's best bet was to slowly maneuver with the goal of accumulating small advantages.  Emanuel Lasker in ''Lasker's Manual of Chess'' and Max Euwe in ''The Development of Chess Style'' outlined theories that they attributed to Steinitz.

Leading player and theorist [[Aron Nimzowitsch|Aron Nimzowitsch's]]&lt;ref&gt;GM [[Raymond Keene]] writes that Nimzowitsch "was one of the world's leading Grandmasters for a period extending over a quarter of a century, and for some of that time he was the obvious challenger for the world championship. ... [He was also] a great and profound chess thinker, second only to Steinitz, and his works&amp;mdash;''Die Blockade'', ''My System'' and ''Chess Praxis''--established his reputation as one of the father figures of modern chess." Keene, ''Aron Nimzowitsch: A Reappraisal'', David McKay, 1974, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-679-13040-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; influential books, ''[[My System]]'' (1925),&lt;ref&gt;Aron Nimzowitsch, ''My System (21st Century Edition)'', Hays Publishing, 1991. {{ISBN|1-880673-85-1}}. Aron Nimzovich, ''My System'', David McKay, 1947, {{ISBN|0-679-14025-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Die [[List of chess terms#Blockade|Blockade]]'' (1925) (in [[German (language)|German]]),&lt;ref&gt;Aron Nimzowitsch, ''Blockade'' (English translation), Chess Enterprises, 1980. {{ISBN|0-931462-07-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Chess Praxis'' (1936),&lt;ref&gt;Aron Nimzowitsch, ''Chess Praxis (21st Century Edition)'', Hays Publishing, 1993. {{ISBN|1-880673-91-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aron Nimzovich, ''Chess Praxis: The Praxis of My System'', Dover Publications, 1962. SBN 486-20296-8.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most important works on the middlegame.&lt;ref name="Modern Chess Strategy p. 10"/&gt;  Nimzowitsch called attention to the possibility of letting one's opponent occupy the centre with pawns while you exert control with your pieces as in the Nimzo-Indian or Queen's Indian defences. He pointed out how in positions with interlocking pawn chains, one could attack the chain at its base by advancing one's own pawns and carrying out a freeing move (pawn break).  He also drew attention to the strategy of occupying open files with one's rooks in order to later penetrate to the seventh rank where they could attack the enemy pawns and hem in the opponent's king.  Another of his key concepts was prophylaxis, moves aimed at limiting the opponent's mobility to the point where he would no longer have any useful moves.

In 1952, Fine published the 442-page ''The Middle Game in Chess'', perhaps the most comprehensive treatment of the subject up until that time.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Fine, ''The Middle Game in Chess'', David McKay, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-20th century also saw the publication of ''The Middle Game'', volumes 1 and 2, by former World Champion [[Max Euwe]] and Hans Kramer,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. M. Euwe and H. Kramer, ''The Middle Game, Book One: Static Features'', G. Bell and Sons, 1964. {{ISBN|0-7135-0431-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. M. Euwe and H. Kramer, ''The Middle Game, Book Two: Dynamic and Subjective Features'', G. Bell and Sons, 1965. {{ISBN|0-7135-0432-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of books by the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]]-German grandmaster [[Luděk Pachman]]: three volumes of ''Complete [[Chess strategy|Chess Strategy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Luděk Pachman, ''Complete Chess Strategy, Volume 1: First Principles of the Middle Game'', Cornerstone Library, 1975. {{ISBN|0-346-12321-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luděk Pachman, ''Complete Chess Strategy, Volume 2: Principles of [[Pawn (chess)|Pawn]] Play and the [[List of chess terms#Center|Center]]'', Cornerstone Library, 1976. {{ISBN|0-346-12343-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luděk Pachman, ''Complete Chess Strategy: Play on the [[List of chess terms#W|Wings]]'', David McKay, 1978. {{ISBN|0-679-13252-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Chess Strategy'',&lt;ref&gt;Luděk Pachman, ''Modern Chess Strategy'', Dover Publications, 1971. {{ISBN|0-486-20290-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern [[Chess tactics|Chess Tactics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Luděk Pachman, ''Modern Chess Tactics'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd, 1972. {{ISBN|0-7100-7098-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[List of chess terms#Attack|Attack]] and [[List of chess terms#Defence|Defense]] in Modern Chess Tactics''.&lt;ref&gt;Luděk Pachman, ''Attack and Defense in Modern Chess Tactics'', David McKay, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key turning point in middlegame theory came with the release of Alexander Kotov's book ''Think like a Grandmaster'' in 1971.  Kotov outlined how a player calculates by developing a tree of variations in his head, and recommended that players only examine each branch of the tree once.  He also noted how some players seem to fall victim to what is now known as Kotov's Syndrome: they calculate out a large range of different lines, become dissatisfied with the result, and realizing that they are short on time, play a completely new candidate move without even checking whether it is sound.  More recently, Jonathan Tisdall, John Nunn and Andrew Soltis have elaborated on Kotov's tree theory further.

In 1999, Watson's ''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy: Advances Since Nimzowitsch'' was published, in which Watson discusses the revolution in middlegame theory that has occurred since Nimzowitsch's time.&lt;ref&gt;''Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy'', pp. 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many books on specific aspects of the middlegame, such as ''The Art of Attack in Chess'' by [[Vladimir Vuković]],&lt;ref&gt;V. Vuković, ''The Art of Attack in Chess'', Pergamon Press, 1965. {{ISBN|0-08-011196-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art of [[Sacrifice (chess)|Sacrifice]] in Chess'' by [[Rudolf Spielmann]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Spielmann, ''The Art of Sacrifice in Chess'', David McKay, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art of the [[Checkmate]]'' by Georges Renaud and Victor Kahn,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Renaud and Victor Kahn, ''The Art of the Checkmate'', Dover Publications, 1962. {{ISBN|0-486-20106-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Basis of [[Combination (chess)|Combination]] in Chess'' by J. du Mont,&lt;ref&gt;J. du Mont, ''The Basis of Combination in Chess'', Dover Publications, 1978. {{ISBN|0-486-23644-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Art of Defense in Chess'' by [[Andrew Soltis]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Soltis, ''The Art of Defense in Chess'', David McKay, 1975. {{ISBN|0-679-13043-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame theory==
Many significant chess treatises, beginning with the earliest works, have included some analysis of the endgame. Lucena's book (c. 1497) concluded with 150 examples of endgames and [[chess problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Golombek, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition (1777) of Philidor's ''Analyse du jeu des Échecs'' devoted 75 pages of analysis to various endgames.&lt;ref&gt;François-André Danican Philidor, ''Analysis of the Game of Chess'', Hardinge Simpole, 2005 (reprint), pp. 230-304. {{ISBN|1-84382-161-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These included a number of theoretically important endings, such as rook and bishop versus rook, queen versus rook, queen versus rook and pawn, and rook and pawn versus rook. Certain positions in the endings of rook and bishop versus rook, rook and pawn versus rook, and queen versus rook have become known as [[Philidor position|Philidor's position]]. Philidor concluded his book with two pages of (in the English translation), "Observations on the ends of parties", in which he set forth certain general principles about endings, such as: "Two knights alone cannot mate" (see [[two knights endgame]]), the ending with a bishop and rook pawn whose queening square is on the opposite color from the bishop is drawn (see [[wrong rook pawn#Bishop and pawn]]), and a queen beats a bishop and knight (see [[pawnless chess endgame#Queen versus two minor pieces]]).&lt;ref&gt;Philidor, pp. 305-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Staunton's ''The Chess-Player's Handbook'' (1847) includes almost 100 pages of analysis of endgames.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Staunton, ''The Chess-Player's Handbook'', Henry G. Bohn, 1847, pp. 403-500. Some of Staunton's analysis, such as his analysis of the very rare rook versus three minor pieces endgame, is surprisingly sophisticated. At page 439, he wrote, "Three minor Pieces are much stronger than a Rook, and in cases where two of them are Bishops will usually win without much difficulty, because the player of the Rook is certain to be compelled to lose him for one of his adversary's Pieces. If, however, there are two Knights and one Bishop opposed to a Rook, the latter may generally be [[Exchange (chess)|exchanged]] for the Bishop, and as two Knights are insufficient of themselves to force checkmate, the game will be drawn." Modern-day [[endgame tablebase]]s confirm Staunton's assessments of both endings. [[Karsten Müller]] and [[Frank Lamprecht]], ''Fundamental Chess Endings'', Gambit Publications, 2001, p. 403. {{ISBN|1-901983-53-6}}. Yet Reuben Fine, 94 years after Staunton, erroneously wrote on page 521 of ''[[Basic Chess Endings]]'' that both types of rook versus three minor piece endings "are theoretically drawn." Grandmaster [[Pal Benko]], an authority on the endgame and like Fine a world-class player at his peak, perpetuated Fine's error in his 2003 revision of ''Basic Chess Endings''. Reuben Fine and Pal Benko, ''Basic Chess Endings (Algebraic Edition)'', McKay Chess Library, 2003, p. 524, {{ISBN|0-8129-3493-8}}. Grandmaster [[Andrew Soltis]] in a 2004 book expressly disagreed with Staunton, claiming that the rook versus two bishops and knight ending is drawn with correct play. Andrew Soltis, ''rethinking the chess pieces'', Batsford 2004, p. 84. {{ISBN|0-7134-8904-9}}. At the time Benko and Soltis offered their assessments (in 2003 and 2004, respectively), endgame tablebases had already proven that Staunton was correct, and that Fine, Benko, and Soltis were wrong, although the ending can take up to 68 moves to win. Müller and Lamprecht, p. 403.

Staunton's conclusions on these endgames were, however, anticipated by the British master [[George Walker (chess player)|George Walker]], who wrote in 1846 (and perhaps earlier):&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the two Bishops and Kt win, as a general proposition, against Rook, yet the two Knights with a Bishop cannot expect the same success; and the legitimate result of such conflict would be a draw. The Bishops, united, are stronger than the Knights, as they strike from a greater distance. When the two Knights are left with a Bishop, the Rook has also the chance of exchanging for the latter, which can hardly be avoided by his adversary, and the two Knights, alone, have not the mating power.&lt;/blockquote&gt; George Walker, ''The Art of Chess-Play: A New Treatise on the Game of Chess'' (4th ed. 1846), Sherwood, Gilbert, &amp; Piper, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Reuben Fine published his monumental 573-page treatise ''Basic Chess Endings'', the first attempt at a comprehensive treatise on the endgame.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Fine, ''Basic Chess Endings'', David McKay, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; A new edition, revised by [[Pal Benko]], was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Fine and Pal Benko, ''Basic Chess Endings'', Random House, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8129-3493-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Averbakh1950s.JPG|left|150px|thumb|Yuri Averbakh in the 1950s]] --&gt;
[[USSR|Soviet]] writers published an important series of books on specific endings:  ''Rook Endings'' by [[Grigory Levenfish]] and [[Vasily Smyslov]],&lt;ref&gt;Grigory Levenfish and Vasily Smyslov, ''Rook Endings'', Chess Digest, 1971. {{ISBN|0-7134-0354-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pawn Endings'' by [[Yuri Averbakh]] and I. Maizelis,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Averbakh and I. Maizelis, ''Pawn Endings'', Chess Digest, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Queen and Pawn Endings'' by Averbakh,&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Averbakh, ''Queen and Pawn Endings'', Chess Digest, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7134-3041-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bishop Endings'' by Averbakh,&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Averbakh, ''Bishop Endings'', Batsford, 1977. {{ISBN|0-7134-0096-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knight Endings'' by Averbakh and [[Vitaly Chekhover]],&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Averbakh and Vitaly Chekhover, ''Knight Endings'', Batsford 1977. {{ISBN|0-7134-0552-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bishop v. Knight Endings'' by Yuri Averbakh,&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Averbakh, ''Bishop v. Knight Endings'', Batsford, 1976. {{ISBN|0-7134-3179-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rook v. Minor Piece Endings'' by Averbakh,&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Averbakh, ''Rook v. Minor Piece Endings'', Batsford, 1978. {{ISBN|0-7134-0868-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Queen v. Rook/Minor Piece Endings'' by Averbakh, Chekhover, and V. Henkin.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Averbakh, V. Chekhover, and V. Henkin, ''Queen v. Rook/Minor Piece Endings'', Batsford, 1978. {{ISBN|0-7134-0866-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These books by Averbakh and others were collected into the five-volume ''Comprehensive Chess Endings'' in English.

In recent years, computer-generated [[endgame tablebase]]s have revolutionized endgame theory, conclusively showing [[Perfect play|best play]] in many complicated endgames that had vexed human analysts for over a century, such as [[queen (chess)|queen]] and pawn versus queen. They have also overturned human theoreticians' verdicts on a number of endgames; for example by proving that the two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]] versus [[knight (chess)|knight]] ending, which had been thought drawn for over a century, can be a win for the bishops (see [[pawnless chess endgame#Minor pieces only]] and [[Chess endgame#Effect of tablebases on endgame theory]]).

Several important works on the endgame have been published in recent years, among them ''Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual'',&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dvoretsky, ''Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual (second Edition)'', Russell Enterprises, 2006. {{ISBN|1-888690-19-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fundamental Chess Endings'' by [[Karsten Müller]] and [[Frank Lamprecht]],&lt;ref&gt;Karsten Muller and Frank Lamprecht, ''Fundamental Chess Endings'', Gambit Publications, 2001. {{ISBN|1-901983-53-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Basic Endgames: 888 Theoretical Positions'' by [[Yuri Balashov]] and Eduard Prandstetter,&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Balashov and Eduard Prandstetter, ''Basic Endgames'', Prague Chess Agency, 1992. {{ISBN|80-901056-0-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chess Endgame Lessons'' by Benko,&lt;ref&gt;Pal Benko, ''Chess Endgame Lessons'', 1989, Library of Congress Catalogue No. 89-64215.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Rook Endings''&lt;ref&gt;John Nunn, ''Secrets of Rook Endings'', Henry Holt, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8050-2640-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Pawnless Endings'' by [[John Nunn]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nunn, ''Secrets of Pawnless Endings'', Henry Holt, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8050-3285-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have been aided by analysis from endgame tablebases.

'''Cotterell Court''' is a 1,750-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Hamilton (village), New York|Hamilton, New York]]. It was built in 1959 and is home to the [[Colgate University]] Raiders [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] [[team]]s. It is named for Wesley M. Cotterell '19, a two-time letterwinner in basketball and school trustee.  The basketball arena was built as the northern half of the William A. Reid Athletic Center, a twin barrel-vaulted complex which also houses [[Starr Arena|Starr Rink]].  The complex is located on the western side of campus next to [[Andy Kerr Stadium]] and across Broad Street from Huntington Gymnasium, the school's former athletics facility.  It was renovated in 2000-2001. The gym has bleacher seating on three sides, with the main sides being the east and west sides and a much shorter section on the north side. The main entrance to the arena is on the south side, leading into the rest of the athletic center.

It hosted the 1996 [[Patriot League]] men's basketball tournament final.  On November 4, 1977 the [[Grateful Dead]] played here as the homecoming weekend headliners.  Similarly, [[The Doors]] and [[Bob Marley]] have played here, as well as [[Phish]], who headlined Spring Party Weekend on April 23, 1993.

This '''glossary of surfing''' includes some of the extensive [[vocabulary]] used to describe various aspects of the sport of [[surfing]] as described in literature on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finney |first=Ben |author2=Houston, James D. |title=Surfing-A History of the Ancient Hawaiian Sport |publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks |location=Rohnett, CA |isbn=0-87654-594-0 |chapter=Appendix A-Hawaiian Surfing terms |pages=94–97 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guisado |first=Raul |title=The Art of Surfing: A Training Manual for the Developing and Competitive Surfer |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |location=Guilford, CT |year=2003 |chapter=Appendix A-Glossary of Surfing Lingo |pages=165–0170 |isbn=0-7627-2466-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.

==About the water==
* '''Barrel''': The effect when a big wave rolls over, enclosing a temporary horizontal tunnel of air with the surfer inside
* '''Beach break''': An area where waves that are good enough to surf break just off a beach, or on a sandbar farther out
* '''Blown out''': When waves that would otherwise be good have been rendered too choppy by wind
* '''Bomb''': An exceptionally large set wave
* '''Choppy, chop''': Waves that are subjected to cross winds have a rough surface (chop) and do not break cleanly
* '''Close-out''': A wave is said to be "closed-out" when it breaks at every position along the face at once, and therefore cannot be surfed
* '''Face''': The forward-facing surface of a breaking wave
* '''Flat''': No waves
* '''Glassy''': When the waves (and general surface of the water) are extremely smooth and glossy, not disturbed by wind
* '''Gnarly''': Large, difficult, and dangerous (usually applied to waves)
* '''Line-up''': The area where most of the waves are starting to break and where most surfers are positioned in order to catch a wave&lt;ref name=StayingOnTop/&gt;
* '''Off the hook''': A positive phrase meaning the waves are a very good size and shape
* '''Outside''': The part of the water's surface that is farther from the shore than the area where most waves are breaking
* '''Point break''': Area where an underwater rocky point creates waves that are suitable for surfing
* '''Sections''': The parts of a breaking wave that are rideable
* '''Set waves''': A group of waves of larger size within a swell
* '''Shoulder''': The unbroken part of the wave
* '''Shorey/shore break''': A wave that lasts all the way to the shore before crashing
* '''Surf's up''': A phrase used when there are waves worth surfing
* '''[[Swell (ocean)|Swell]]''': A series of waves that have traveled from their source in a distant storm, and that will start to break once the swell reaches shallow enough water
* '''Whitewater''': As a wave breaks, it continues on as a ridge of turbulence and foam called "whitewater."

==Techniques and maneuvers==
* '''Air/Aerial''': Riding the board briefly into the air above the wave, landing back upon the wave, and continuing to ride &lt;ref name=StayingOnTop&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Scott D. |author2=Mark Hubble |author3=Seth Houdeshell  |title=Staying on Top and Keeping the Sand Out of Your Pants: A Surfer's Guide to the good life |publisher=Heath Communications |location=Deerfield Beach, FL |chapter=Glossary of surfing terms |pages=139–140 |isbn=0-7573-0033-2 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bail''': To step off of the board in order to avoid being knocked off (a wipe out)
* '''Bottom turn''': The first turn at the bottom of the wave
* '''Carve''': Turns (often accentuated)
* '''Caught inside''': When a surfer is paddling out and cannot get past the breaking surf to the safer part of the ocean (the outside) in order to find a wave to ride &lt;ref name=StayingOnTop/&gt;
* '''Cross step''': crossing one leg over the other across the board (usually to make it to the nose)
* '''Cutback''': A turn cutting back toward the breaking part of the wave
* '''Drop in''': Dropping into (engaging) the wave, most often as part of standing up
* "To drop in on someone": To take off on a wave that is already being ridden.  Not a legitimate technique or maneuver.  It is a serious breach of surfing etiquette.
* '''Duck dive''': Pushing the board underwater, nose first, and diving under an oncoming wave instead of riding it
* '''Fade''': On take-off, aiming toward the breaking part of the wave, before turning sharply and surfing in the direction the wave is breaking
* '''Fins-free snap (or "fins out")''': A sharp turn where the surfboard's fins slide off the top of the wave
* '''Floater''': Riding up on the top of the breaking part of the wave, and coming down with it
* '''Goofy foot''': Surfing with the left foot on the back of board (less common than regular foot)
* '''Hang Heels''': Facing backwards and putting the surfers' heels out over the edge of a longboard
* '''Hang-five/[[hang ten]]''': Putting five or ten toes respectively over the nose of a longboard
* '''Off the Top''': A turn on the top of a wave, either sharp or carving
* '''Pearl''': Accidentally driving the nose of the board underwater, generally ending the ride
* '''Pop-up''': Going from lying on the board to standing, all in one jump
* '''Pump''': An up/down carving movement that generates speed along a wave
* '''Re-entry''': Hitting the lip vertically and re-reentering the wave in quick succession.
* '''Regular/Natural foot''': Surfing with the right foot on the back of the board
* '''Rolling, Turtle Roll''': Flipping a longboard up-side-down, nose first and pulling through a breaking or broken wave when paddling out to the line-up (a turtle roll is an alternative to a duck dive)
* '''Smack the Lip / Hit the Lip''': After performing a bottom turn, moving upwards to hit the peak of the wave, or area above the face of the wave.
* '''Snaking, drop in on, cut off, or "burn"''': When a surfer who doesn't have the right of way steals a wave from another surfer by taking off in front of someone who is closer to the peak (this is considered inappropriate)
* '''Snaking/Back-Paddling''': Stealing a wave from another surfer by paddling around the person's back to get into the best position
* '''Snap''': A quick, sharp turn off the top of a wave
* '''[[Soul arch]]''': Arching the back to demonstrate casual confidence when riding a wave
* '''Stall''': Slowing down by shifting weight to the tail of the board or putting a hand in the water. Often used to stay in the tube during a tube ride
* '''Side-slip''': travelling down a wave sideways to the direction of the board
* '''Switch-foot''': Having equal ability to surf regular foot or goofy foot (i.e. left foot forward or right foot forward), like being [[Cross-dominance|ambidextrous]]
* '''Take-off''': The start of a ride
* '''Tandem surfing''': Two people riding one board. Usually the smaller person is balanced above (often held up above) the other person
* '''[[Tube riding]]/Getting barreled''': Riding inside the hollow curl of a wave

==Accidental==
* '''Over the falls''': When a surfer falls off the board and the wave sucks him or her up in a circular motion along with the lip of the wave. Also referred to as the "wash cycle", being "pitched over" and being "sucked over"
* '''Wipe out''': Falling off, or being knocked off, the surfboard when riding a wave
* '''Rag dolled''': When underwater, the power of the wave can shake the surfer around as if he/she were a rag doll
* '''Tombstone''': When surfer is held underwater and tries to climb up their leash the board is straight up and down.

==About people==
* '''Dilla''': A surfer who is low maintenance, without concern, worry or fuss, One who is confidently secure in being different or unique
* '''[[Grommet (sportsperson)|Grom/Grommet]]''': A young surfer &lt;ref name=StayingOnTop/&gt;
* '''Hang loose''': Generally means “chill,” “relax” or “be laid back". This message can be sent by raising a hand with the thumb and pinkie fingers up while the index, middle and ring fingers remain folded over the palm, then twisting the wrist back and forth as if waving goodbye, see [[shaka sign]]
* '''Hodad''': A nonsurfer who pretends to surf and frequents beaches with good surfing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hodad |title=Hodad |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=10 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Bay Country Club''' ('''GBCC''') is a [[country club]] located in [[Bellevue, Wisconsin|Bellevue]], [[Wisconsin]].  The club was established in 1995 and has two sections, a sports center and a [[golf course]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/golf/29310899.html|title= 'I've become a day care center' Private clubs find that family amenities are key to building membership|last=D’Amato|first= Gary |date= May 13, 2007|work= Journal Sentinel (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports center ==
The sports center contains a swimming pool with a [[waterslide]], beach [[volleyball]], a [[cabana (structure)|cabana]], six [[tennis court|tennis courts]], a nine-hole [[miniature golf|putting course]], a practice putting and chipping green, and a six-hole par three golf course, also called the Quarry Course.

===Tournaments===
Green Bay Country Club was the home of the Great Lakes Classic, an event played during the first three years of the Women's Senior Golf Tour (now the [[Legends Tour]]).  In 2000, the initial year of the tour, the tournament was sponsored by [[Shopko|ShopKo]] and won by [[Vicki Fergon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Legends Tour]] [http://www.thelegendstour.com/tournaments_2000.htm 2000 Tournaments Recap] (accessed 2012-07-11).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Juliano, [http://articles.philly.com/2000-08-27/sports/25595575_1_lpga-commissioner-ty-votaw-limited-field-event-new-tour "A Force Of Will Creates A Tour De Force Four Years In The Making, The Women's Senior Golf Tour Was Born Because Of The Never-say-die Spirit Of Jane Blalock."]  ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', August 27, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 it was again sponsored by ShopKo, and won by [[Hollis Stacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Legends Tour]] [http://www.thelegendstour.com/tournaments_2001.htm 2001 Tournaments Recap] (accessed 2012-07-11).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the tournament was renamed the [[Copps Food Center|Copps]] Great Lakes Classic, and the winner was [[Patty Sheehan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Legends Tour]] [http://www.thelegendstour.com/tournaments_2002.htm 2002 Tournaments Recap] (accessed 2012-07-11).&lt;/ref&gt;

The course has also been the venue for the [[Wisconsin State Golf Association]] Match Play Championship.&lt;ref&gt;Gary D'Amato, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147082726.html "Long-shot Hill wins match play: 24-year-old pars 10 of last 11 holes to take title."], ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', June 16, 2006 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Golf Digest]]'' has listed the course as one of the top 10 courses in Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72488315.html "Two State Courses Among Magazine's Top 100"], ''[[The Capital Times]]'', March 29, 2001 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8363">The '''Halliwick Concept''' focuses on biophysical principles of motor control in water, in particular developing [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance (equilibrioception)]] and [[core stability]].  The '''Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme''' implements the concept in a progressive programme of mental adjustment, disengagement, and development of motor control, with an emphasis on rotational control, and applies the programme to teach physically disabled people [[Equilibrioception|balance control]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], and [[Independent living|independence]].  '''Halliwick Aquatic Therapy''' (also known as Water Specific Therapy, WST), implements the concept in patient-specific [[aquatic therapy]] for application in [[physical rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of [[injury]] and [[physical disability|disability]].

== The Halliwick Concept ==
The Halliwick Concept was originally developed by fluid mechanics engineer James McMillan in the late 1940s and 1950s, at the Halliwick School for Girls with Disabilities in London, to teach [[physically disabled]] people [[Independent living|independence]] in water.  Based on [[fluid mechanics]], McMillan developed teaching and therapeutic approaches to enhance [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance (equilibrioception)]] and [[core stability]].&lt;ref name=DuttonHalliwick2011&gt;Dutton, M. 2011.  Orthopaedics for the physical therapist assistant. p 187 Halliwick Concept.  Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning. {{ISBN|978-0763797553}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AinslieHalliwick2012&gt;Ainslie, T. 2012. The concise guide to physiotherapy - 2-volume set: Assessment and Treatment. Elsevier Health Sciences. pp 1106-1116 (Halliwick Concept). {{ISBN|9780702053030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lambeck2011&gt;Lambeck, J and Gamper U. 2011. The Halliwick Concept. In: Becker, BE and Cole, AJ and (eds). 2011. Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0615365671}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Halliwick Concept, physical properties of water form the basis for therapeutic intervention:&lt;ref name=AinslieHalliwick2012/&gt;
*'''Turbulence, Flow, and Resistance:''' [[Turbulent]] moving water provides resistance,; therefore [[Sense of balance|balance]] is lost slowly and there is time to react and learn [[motor control]].
*'''Buoyancy:''' [[Buoyancy]] provides an easy way to change position, which influences the [[vestibular system]] in sensory integration.
*'''Buoyancy, Gravity, and Rotational Torques:''' [[Buoyancy]] forces counteract [[gravity]] forces and create rotational torques ([[metacentric height|metacentric]] effects). These torques can be used to increase load on [[connective tissue]].

The first part of the concept, the Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme, incorporates these biophysical principles and focuses on mental adjustment, disengagement, and development of motor control, with an emphasis on rotational control, and is applied to teach participation in water activities, moving independently in water, and swimming. McMillan emphasized participation and independence: the willingness to lose balance and knowing how to stand up again.&lt;ref name=AinslieHalliwick2012/&gt; 

The second part of the concept, Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also known as Water Specific Therapy, WST), applies the fundamental biophysical principles and the underlying principles of the Ten-Point-Programme for planning and implementing patient-specific [[aquatic therapy]].&lt;ref name=AinslieHalliwick2012/&gt;

== Technique ==

=== The Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme ===

The first part of the Halliwick Concept implements the Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme to develop balance control, swimming skills, and [[Independent living|indendence]]:&lt;ref name=AinslieHalliwick2012/&gt;
#'''Mental Adjustment:''' adjusting turbulence and buoyancy, learning breath control, cultivating confidence and good attitude.
#'''Disengagement:''' reducing reliance on instructor, changing instructors, practicing independently.
#'''Transversal Rotation Control:''' learning movement in the sagittal plane around a transverse axis, in particular, regaining the upright position from the horizontal position, and the horizontal position from the upright position; eventually learning somersaulting.
#'''Sagittal Rotation Control:''' learning movement in the transverse plane around a sagittal axis, controlling activities that involve trunk side flexion, such as side stepping.
#'''Longitudinal Rotation Control:''' learning movement around a longitudinal axis, controlling activities that involve rolling over.
#'''Combined Rotation Control:''' learning to control any combination of rotations executed in a single movement; once learned a swimmer can control position in pool and is safe.
#'''Upthrust or Mental Inversion:''' learning about buoyancy, in particular that water always pushes up.
#'''Balance in Stillness:''' learning to maintain a relaxed body while floating and with turbulence.
#'''Turbulent Gliding:''' learning to control the position of the body while being moved by the instructor.
#'''Simple Progression and Basic Swimming Movement:''' progressing from simple propulsive movements to coordinated arm, leg, head, and torso movements required for swimming.

=== Halliwick Aquatic Therapy ===

The second part of the Halliwick Concept, known as Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also called Water Specific Therapy, WST) is an [[aquatic therapy]] approach developed in [[Bad Ragaz, Switzerland]] since 1974. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy is a system-oriented aquatic motor (re)learning approach, which includes elements of the Ten-Point-Programme. It uses a holistic task-directed approach within the context of the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)]], in particular postural control, normalizing muscle stiffness, and facilitation of movement to attain functional goals on land. It also follows training guidelines of [[physiology]] and its clinical reasoning in various patient populations. Most Halliwick therapy is active (dynamic) to facilitate movement and sensory input. Halliwick also has a passive (static) component, in which, for example involving selective activation of muscles and stabilization of specific joints by the therapist. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy is a problem-solving approach, in that specific possibilities and constraints of the client are analyzed in order to plan a systematic intervention to help the client gain functional increases.&lt;ref name=AinslieHalliwick2012/&gt;

==Applications==

The Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme has been applied for teaching swimming to people with disability, as well as more broadly as a general approach to teaching swimming and working with disability. 

Halliwick Aquatic Therapy has mainly used in [[neurorehabilitation]] and [[pediatrics]]. It has resemblances to [[Bobath]] and [[Conductive education]]. In [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|neurological]] and paediatric [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], clients can experience early mobility. The mechanical advantages of water support the abilities of the trunk in a mobilising and stabilising way. In this sense Halliwick is a constraint-induced movement therapy without the disadvantage of gravity compensation.  Many activities easily can be repeated and varied and clients can learn balance- and stumble- strategies, which have carry-over effects to dry land. This application in fall prevention is extended by using obstacle courses or Ai Chi.&lt;ref name=Noh2008&gt;Noh DG, Lim JY, Shin HI, Paik NJ. 2008. The effect of aquatic therapy on postural balance and muscular strength in stroke survivors - a randomized controlled trial. Clinical Rehabilitation 22: 966-976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliwick also enables a graded activity programme: with low mechanical impact and increasing physiological demand, chronic low back pain patients and others can increase their functional capacity in a mostly joyful way.

'''Independence Arena''' (also known as ''Ix-Xagħra tal-Furjana'') was a multi-use stadium in [[Floriana]], [[Malta]]. The '''stadium''' has fallen in a state of disrepair and is now used as a parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-10-07/local-news/Floriana-Residents-angry-about-car-park-at-ix-Xaghra-281297 | title=Floriana Residents angry about car park at ix-Xaghra | date=7 October 2010 | newspaper=Malta Independent |  accessdate=6 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was used mostly for football matches and was the home [[Training ground (association football)|training pitch]] of [[Floriana FC|Floriana]]. The stadium held 3,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://int.soccerway.com/teams/malta/floriana-fc/venue/ Malta - Floriana FC] - Soccerway&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and description==

===History===
When [[Malta]] was a [[Crown Colony of Malta|crown colony]] of the [[United Kingdom]], the Arena was mainly used for training purposes by the British Military in preparation of important ceremonies. The grandstand, which is still present to this say, was erected in anticipation of Malta's [[History_of_Malta#From_Home_Rule_to_independence|Independence]] celebrations. Indeed, on 21 September 1964 the [[Flag of Malta|Maltese flag]] was hosted for the first time at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140921/life-features/The-arduous-road-to-independence.536653|title=The arduous road to independence|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also explains why the stadium was named the Independence Arena and why it is held in fond regard by the Maltese public in general.

===Future===
Over the years, [[Floriana FC|Floriana]] expressed their willingness to develop the stadium on more than one occasion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-03-11/others/football-new-facilities-for-floriana-fc-271467/|title=Football: New Facilities for Floriana FC - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160401/football/Ground-project-delay-is-cause-of-concern-for-Gaucci.607456|title=Ground project delay is cause of concern for Gaucci|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing had materialised as yet.

The '''Israel national American football team''' is the official [[American football]] senior national team of [[Israel]]. The team formed in 2012 mainly of [[Israeli Football League]] players and coaching staff.

== First game ==
The first international American football game played by Israel was played 17 May 2012 in Baptist village near [[Petah Tikva]], when the Israeli national team met [[Maranatha Baptist Bible College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In ‘grass roots miracle,’ Israel national team to play its first football game|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/forward-progress-israels-first-national-tackle-football-team-to-take-the-field/|last=Tepper|first=Greg|date=16 May 2012|publisher=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Israeli players it was first ever game on 100 yards field in 11 players team. In the [[Israeli Football League|IFL]] American football is played on 60 yard fields by 9 player teams (in 2012, the IFL played with 8 player teams). The game finished with a 49 - 6 Maranatha win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel's American football team debuts|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/football/story/Israels-American-football-team-plays-first-game-051712|date=18 May 2012|accessdate=25 May 2012|publisher=Foxsports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kings Heath Stadium''' was a [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom|greyhound racing]] track in [[Birmingham]].

==Origins and Opening==
In 1927 the British Greyhound Sports Club acquired the lease of the newly constructed stadium on the south side of Taylor Road and which was accessed off the east side of Alcester Road South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/407623/280229/12/100739|title=OS County Series Warwickshire 1937|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first race meeting was on 21 May 1927 and the company owned four other tracks in 1927, [[Darnall Stadium]] in Sheffield, [[Knowle Stadium]] in [[Bristol]], [[The Boulevard (stadium)|Boulevard Stadium]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Blackpool Greyhound Stadium|St Annes]] in [[Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarter|first=P Howard|title=Greyhound Racing Encyclopedia|pages =58–59|year=1949|publisher=Fleet Publishing Company Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1936 the lease switched to Herbert Leo Craven and he introduced a major new event called the Lincoln. The first running of the Lincoln was won by Slightly Polly trained by Arthur Doc Callanan. In 1949 the freehold was finally bought outright by the Kings Heath Racecourse Ltd. The track was described as a fair sized course with fairly easy turns and a good length run in despite the circuit having a small 390 yard circumference. The main distances were 480 and 675 yards and greyhounds chased an ‘Outside Sumner’ hare. On the Alcester Road South entrance there was the main stand featuring the Silver Club and Best Ring Club with matching betting rings. On the opposite side of the course were two covered stands, to the west was the popular betting ring and to the east were the racing kennels, isolation kennels and home kennels that included a rest room and surgery. Rest kennels were located at [[Cookhill]] in [[Worcestershire]]. Perspective owners had to pay kennel charges of one guinea per week and the greyhound would be accepted into the track kennels on the understanding that all greyhounds were subject to veterinary examination, [[National Greyhound Racing Club]] rules and company conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarter|first=P Howard|title=Greyhound Racing Encyclopedia|page =62|year=1949|publisher=Fleet Publishing Company Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first track trained success came in 1948 when King Hero trained by P.E Frost won the Cambridgeshire at [[West Ham Stadium]]. Another race called the Midland Oaks was introduced and trainers included Jim Todd, Bill Bryant, Alf Gibbins, Len Bane and Mr Allen.

Following the 1964 closure of the [[Lythalls Lane Stadium]] in [[Coventry]], a major race the prestigious [[Eclipse (greyhounds)|Eclipse Stakes]] was transferred to the track. Following the formation of the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) in 1967 the track was chosen as one of the first four tracks to host live betting shop race meetings along with [[Oxford Stadium|Oxford]], [[Park Royal Stadium|Park Royal]] and [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|page =45|year=1981|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In 1971 developers bought the stadium from the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] who themselves had only purchased the stadium the previous year. The final race meeting was held on 31 March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =418|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north part of the stadium is now Wynfield and Leander Gardens and the south part is where the Cocks Moors Woods golf course stands.

[[Image:Eugene W. Britt House, West Adams, Los Angeles.JPG|right|thumb|The foundation's main building]]The '''LA84 Foundation''' (known until June 2007 as the '''Amateur Athletic Foundation of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]''') is a private, nonprofit institution created by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee to manage Southern California's endowment from the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]]. Under an agreement made in 1979, 40 percent of any surplus was to stay in Southern California, with the other 60 percent going to the [[United States Olympic Committee]]. The total surplus was $232.5 million. Southern California's share was approximately $93 million.

The LA84 Foundation's mission&lt;ref name="la84who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/who/who_frmst.htm |title=About |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328111820/http://www.la84foundation.org/who/who_frmst.htm |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is to promote and expand youth sports opportunities in Southern California and to increase knowledge of sport and its impact on people's lives. Since inception, the Foundation has invested more than $225 million in Southern California by awarding grants to youth sports organizations, initiating sports and coaching education programs, and operating the world's premier sports library.&lt;ref name="la84who"/&gt;

Grants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/1gm/over_frmst.htm |title=Grantmaking |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; are awarded to organizations that provide on-going, structured youth sports programs combining the essential elements of teaching, learning and competition. The Foundation makes grants in the eight southernmost counties of California ([[Imperial County, California|Imperial]], [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Orange County, California|Orange]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]], [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]]). Youth organizations in the Los Angeles area receive priority. The LA84 Foundation has made grants to more than 1,100 Southern California organizations since 1985.

The LA84 Foundation has initiated programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/2ysp/over_frmst.htm |title=Youth Sports Programs |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to meet the youth sports needs of Southern California and to create models that can be applied elsewhere. These include the LA84 Foundation Coaching Education Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/3ce/over_frmst.htm |title=Coaching Education |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as large-scale sports programs such as Summer Swim and Run 4 Fun, which serve nearly 20,000 children and teenagers each year.

The Foundation's headquarters is the historic [[Eugene W. Britt House]], a [[National Register of Historic Places|Registered Historic Place]] located at 2141 West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles' [[Jefferson Park, Los Angeles, California|Jefferson Park]] neighborhood. It was formerly a sports museum that featured the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]]'s collection of sports books, film, photographs and memorabilia. [[First Interstate Bancorp|First Interstate Bank]] and the Peter and Ginny Ueberroth Foundation donated the Helms Collection, house and grounds to the LA84 Foundation in the summer of 1985.

The Paul Ziffren Sports Resource Center houses the world's premier sports library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/4sl/over_frmst.htm |title=Sports Library &amp; Digital Collection |publisher=LA84 Foundation |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221003809/http://la84foundation.org/4sl/over_frmst.htm |archivedate=2013-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The library maintains an extensive collection of books, periodicals, photograph and moving footage, with a special emphasis on the [[Olympic Games]]. The traditional library has been supplemented by the development of an extensive electronic collection of 100,000 PDFs including scholarly publications, popular magazine and primary historical documents available at no cost on the LA84 Foundation website.

The LA84 Foundation also hosts conferences and sponsors research on a variety of sport topics. The LA84 Foundations practical knowledge, acquired through years of direct involvement in youth sports, combined with its wide range of education services enables the Foundation to serve as a leading forum for the exchange of ideas and exploration of issues in sport.

In June 2007, the Foundation adopted the name LA84 Foundation to establish a unique identity and honor the spirit of the 1984 Olympic Games, which created the Foundation's endowment.

The [[Swimming at the 1932 Summer Olympics|swimming]] stadium used for the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympic Games]] has been renamed the LA84 Foundation/John C. Argue Swim Stadium.  Argue was instrumental in bringing the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles.  He later served as chair of the LA84 Foundation.

This is a list of major '''sports [[scandal]]s'''.

== American football scandals ==
* [[Minnesota Vikings boat party scandal]] (2005) – a pleasure cruise that reportedly featured sexual shenanigans by several members of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL)
* [[National Football League player conduct controversy]] (2007–present) – various off the field incidents involving [[American football]] athletes from the NFL, including [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam "Pacman" Jones]], [[Tank Johnson|Terry "Tank" Johnson]], [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], [[Ray Rice]] and [[Adrian Peterson]], who earned suspensions as a result.
* [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]] (2007) – the [[New England Patriots]] were disciplined for videotaping the opposing team's coach's signals. Coach [[Bill Belichick]] was fined $500,000 and the New England Patriots were fined $250,000 and lost their [[2008 NFL Draft|2008 1st round draft pick]].
* [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal]] (2012) – the NFL discovered that the [[New Orleans Saints]] had operated a secret slush fund from [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]] to [[2011 New Orleans Saints season|2011]] that paid "bounties" to defensive players for big plays during games, most controversially for injuring opponents. The scheme was allegedly organized by a number of players plus defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]], with the acquiescence of head coach [[Sean Payton]]. Shortly after the investigation came to light, Williams was accused of running similar schemes while he was defensive coordinator of the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]] and [[Washington Redskins]], as well as the head coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]]. The league suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for one year and suspended the Saints' general manager and another assistant for parts of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]. [[Jonathan Vilma]], a Saints player who had a major role in the scheme and reportedly offered a $10,000 bounty on [[Brett Favre]], was suspended for the entire season and three other players were suspended for parts of the season. However, in September 2012, an arbitrator overturned the suspensions of the players involved in the affair. Williams' suspension ultimately lasted one year.
* [[Deflategate]] (2015) – during the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 45.2C Indianapolis Colts 7|AFC Championship Game]], 11 of the 12 the footballs (this was later proved to be false) under the Patriots' control during the first half were found to be inflated below the level mandated by the rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 of the 12 footballs deflated|url=http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/12202450/nfl-says-new-england-patriots-had-inflated-footballs-afc-championship-game|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then closed because of the referees' failure to check the balls prior to the game. [[Tom Brady]] was suspended by the NFL for the first 4 games of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12867594/punishments-handed-tom-brady-new-england-patriots-deflategate|title=NFL suspends Brady 4 games; Pats lose picks|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association football scandals ==
* [[Totonero 1980|1980 Italian football scandal]] – a [[match fixing]] scandal in [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] involving several major teams.
* [[1988 Mexico national football team scandal]]
* [[French football bribery scandal|1993 French football bribery scandal]] – a match fixing scandal involving a [[1992–93 French Division 1]] match between [[Olympique de Marseille]] and [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], in which Valenciennes players were bribed by Olympique de Marseille president [[Bernard Tapie]], through Marseille [[midfielder]] [[Jean-Jacques Eydelie]]. It is believed that Eydelie offered three Valenciennes players ([[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Christophe Robert]] and [[Jacques Glassmann|Jacques Glassman]]) [[French franc|₣]]250,000 to "take the foot off of the gas" in a May 20 match between the sides, so that the team would be fresh to play in the [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] soon after. Marseille were subsequently stripped off the 1992–93 French Division 1 title, relegated to [[Ligue 2|Division 2]] and handed bans from all 1993 [[UEFA competitions]]. The [[French Football Federation]] also suspended Eydelie, Robert and Burruchaga, whilst Tapie was replaced as club president by [[Bernard Moreau]]. Tapie received a prison sentence of over two years, of which he served six months and received a [[French franc|₣]]20,000 fine, whilst Eydelie, Robert, Burruchaga and Marseille general manager [[Jean-Pierre Bernes]] were all given prison sentences and fined. Eydelie's prison sentence was a suspended sentence.
* [[Bundesliga scandal (2005)]] – a match fixing scandal in [[Football in Germany|German football]] centering on disgraced referee [[Robert Hoyzer]].
* [[Brazilian football match-fixing scandal]] (2005) – a match fixing scandal involving referees in [[Football in Brazil|Brazil]].
* [[2006 Italian football scandal|2006 Calciopoli scandal]] – a match fixing scandal in Italian football involving several major teams, including three of the country's four qualifiers to the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League]].
* In the [[Commonwealth of Independent States Cup]] [[2006 Commonwealth of Independent States Cup|2006]], the [[Armenia]]n champion [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] refused to play with an [[Azerbaijan]]i team, [[PFC Neftchi]]. The team [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] defeated the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 3–1 in the quarter-final, when it already knew that in case of victory they would have to play against [[Neftçi PFK|Neftchi]]. After the match, they told the referee they would not play against an Azerbaijani team and later that evening left Moscow on an airplane. The [[Russian Football Union]] gave Shakhtar Donetsk a technical victory 3–0 so they could play in the half-final instead of Pyunik, but Shakhtar Donetsk declined the offer stating that "[W]e would really want to play in the half-final, but we don't want to get there by any other way then sport". Eventually, because no one could play against Neftchi in the half-final, Neftchi were right away promoted to the final, where they defeated the [[Lithuania]]n club [[FBK Kaunas|Kaunas]] 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/sport/19jan2006/scandal.html|title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Скандал на Кубке Содружества: чемпионы Армении отказались играть с азербайджанцами|work=newsru.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[2011 Turkish sports corruption scandal]] – in July 2011, as part of a major match-fixing investigation by authorities in Turkey, nearly 60 people suspected to be involved with fixing games were detained by Istanbul Police Department Organized Crime Control Bureau and then arrested by the court. On June 2014, retrial process has started for all the convicted people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/07/turkey-match-fixing|title=Turkish court charges 15 more in Fenerbahce match-fixing scandal|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Spor/Futbol/2014/06/23/mahkeme-sike-davasi-kararini-verdi|title=Şike Davası'nda yeniden yargılama kararı|date=23 June 2014|work=Sabah}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[2015 Greek football scandal]] – it emerged on 6 April 2015, when prosecutor Aristidis Korreas' 173-page work was revealed. [[Telephone tapping]] operated by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service of Greece]] has played a significant role in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/264541493/1-%CE%A0%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=12 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prosecutor's conclusion, [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiakos.]] owner [[Evangelos Marinakis]] along with [[Hellenic Football Federation|Greek Football Federation]] members Theodoros Kouridis, Aristidis Stathopoulos and Georgios Sarris were suspected of directing a criminal organization since 2011. The goal behind their scheme was to "absolutely control Greek football's fate by the methods of blackmailing and fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/264541497/3-%CE%A0%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=159 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referees, judges, football directors and chairmen were also involved in the scandal, but all defendants deny charges.

* Tampered handwraps controversy of 2009 resulting in the suspension of [[Antonio Margarito]]

== College sporting scandals ==
* [[CCNY point shaving scandal]] – in 1951, more than 30 players at seven schools were implicated in a [[point shaving]] scheme that also had connections to organized crime. The scandal was most strongly linked to the [[City College of New York]] because several central figures had played on the school's [[1949–50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team|1949–50 team]] that won that season's [[1950 NCAA Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and [[1950 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].
* [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College basketball]] point shaving scandal in [[1978–79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal|1978–79]]
* [[Southern Methodist University football scandal]] – in 1986, it was revealed that [[Southern Methodist University]] boosters gave football players thousands of dollars from a "slush fund" with the knowledge of university administrators. Along with a string of prior NCAA violations, this led the NCAA to level the [[Death penalty (NCAA)|"death penalty"]] on the school's football team.
* [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]] – four players, most notably [[Chris Webber]], were paid by a booster to launder money from his gambling operations. In some cases, the payments extended to their high school days.
* [[University of Minnesota basketball scandal]] – the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' reported the day before the [[1999 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] that an academic counseling staffer at the university publicly acknowledged doing coursework for many basketball players.
*[[Baylor University basketball scandal]] – player Patrick Dennehy [[Murder of Patrick Dennehy|was murdered]] by teammate Carlton Dotson. Later, coach [[Dave Bliss]] instructed his players to lie to NCAA investigators that Dennehy dealt drugs. In the wake of these events, numerous violations of NCAA rules were discovered.
* [[Duke lacrosse case]] – a stripper hired by members of the [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse|Duke University men's lacrosse team]] for an informal team party in 2006 falsely accused three players of [[rape]].
* [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football scandal]] – over ten football players received improper benefits and committed academic fraud by turning in coursework prepared by tutors.
* [[2011 University of Miami athletics scandal]] – [[Yahoo! Sports]] broke a story in which former Miami booster [[Nevin Shapiro]], currently imprisoned for running a [[Ponzi scheme]], indicated he had provided massive amounts of improper benefits to Miami players and coaches, mostly in [[Miami Hurricanes football|football]], but also in [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|men's basketball]].
* [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]] – in November 2011, former Penn State defensive coordinator [[Jerry Sandusky]] was arrested on 40 counts of sexually abusing eight boys over a 15-year period including incidents in Penn State's football facilities. In June 2012, Sandusky was convicted on 45 charges related to the scandal.
* [[University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal]] – in a follow-up to the UNC football scandal, new accusations of academic fraud arose in relation to the university's African and Afro-American Studies department and men's basketball program, men's football team, women's soccer and other sports as well. The Wainstein Report, an independent report commissioned by UNC, revealed academic fraud that occurred over at least 18 years involving thousands of students and student athletes. Allegedly, thousands of student athletes were directed by the UNC administration to take "sham" classes in order to maintain eligibility. UNC avoided major NCAA penalties, mainly because said sham classes had been offered to the entire student body.
* [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal]] – In 2015, Yahoo! Sports reported that a self-described former [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] alleged that she had been paid several thousand dollars from 2010 to 2014 by men's basketball staffer [[Andre McGee]] for strip shows and sex parties for players and prospective recruits. The NCAA announced the results of its investigation in June 2017, announcing major sanctions that included a 10-year [[show-cause penalty]] for McGee and the potential loss of the team's [[2012–13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2013 national title]]. An appeal by Louisville failed, and in February 2018 the Cardinals became the first Division I basketball program to be stripped of a national championship.
*[[Baylor University sexual assault scandal]] – in 2016, Baylor and its [[Baylor Bears football|football program]] were rocked by the revelation that university officials failed to act on numerous alleged sexual and non-sexual assaults by football team members between 2012 and 2016, with one player convicted of felony sexual assault. A later lawsuit filed by a group of victims alleged that 31 football players committed 52 rapes between 2011 and 2014. In the wake of the scandal, head football coach [[Art Briles]] was fired, athletic director [[Ian McCaw]] resigned, and university president [[Ken Starr]] was first demoted and then resigned.
* [[2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal]] – An ongoing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into corruption in NCAA men's basketball that has so far resulted in the arrest of 10 individuals, including college assistant coaches from Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State, and USC plus high-ranking executives of sports apparel giant [[Adidas]]. Other programs initially implicated in the scandal included Louisville, Miami (FL), and South Carolina. Louisville placed head coach [[Rick Pitino]] and athletic director [[Tom Jurich]] (the latter not directly involved in the scandal) on administrative leave, and soon fired both. Further revelations in February 2018 saw more than a dozen additional programs possibly implicated.

== Cricket scandals ==
{{further information|Betting controversies in cricket}}
* [[John the bookmaker controversy]] – a scandal in which [[Australia national cricket team|Australia's]] [[Mark Waugh]] and [[Shane Warne]] were paid in 1994–95 to provide information on [[cricket pitch|pitch]] and weather conditions to an Indian bookmaker. The scandal came to light in 1998.
* [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal]] – in 2010, three [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] players—team captain [[Salman Butt]], [[Mohammad Asif]] and [[Mohammad Amir]]—were accused of involvement in a [[spot-fixing]] scheme in which they allegedly accepted large sums of money to influence specific events within a match, as opposed to an actual match result. After an investigation, the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] banned all three from the sport for periods from 5 to 10 years. Later, Butt and Asif were tried in a London court and found guilty of charges related to the scheme, whilst Amir pleaded guilty to similar charges in the same court. All received prison sentences ranging from 6 to 30 months.
* [[South Africa cricket match fixing]] in 2000 which resulted in the banning from cricket of [[Hansie Cronje]]

This compilation of films covers all sports activities. [[Sports films]] have been made since the era of [[silent film]]s, such as the 1915 film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'' starring [[Charlie Chaplin]]. Films in this genre can range from serious (''[[Raging Bull]]'') to silly (''[[Horse Feathers]]''). A classic theme for sports films is the triumph of an individual or team who prevail despite the difficulties, standard elements of [[melodrama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Maynard''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] during the 1740s.

==Career==
Maynard is mentioned in reports from 1744 to 1750.  He was especially prolific in 1748 when he took part in a number of [[single wicket]] matches.

On Saturday, 2 June 1744, he played for [[London Cricket Club|London]] against [[Slindon Cricket Club|Slindon]] in the earliest match that has a surviving scorecard.&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G B Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;  He is not mentioned again until 1747 but it is assumed that he remained active in the interim.  In 1747, he played for [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] versus [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] on Monday, 31 August.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;

The 1748 season was the zenith of single wicket and Maynard, who must have been an adept at this form of cricket, is mentioned in the reports of five matches.&lt;ref name=GB18/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt; 

The last two mentions of Maynard are in first-class matches for Surrey when he played against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] at [[Dartford Brent]] in June 1749 and again in July 1750.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

As Maynard had established his reputation by 1744, he must have been active for some years previously.  His career possibly began in the 1730s and continued into the 1750s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

'''Norfolk county cricket teams''' were the teams that represented the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Norfolk]] before the first official formation of [[Norfolk County Cricket Club]] in 1876.

==18th century==
Cricket had probably reached Norfolk by the end of the 17th century. The earliest known reference to cricket in Norfolk was in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/235/Other_Matches.html |title=Other Matches played by Norfolk |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of a Norfolk representative team is in 1764, playing against [[Suffolk county cricket teams|Suffolk]] at Bury St Edmunds racecourse (today the location of [[RAF Bury St Edmunds|Rougham Airfield]]) on 23 August. Norfolk won this match, which was reported in the ''[[Daily Gazetteer|Gazetteer &amp; London Daily Advertiser]]'' on Tuesday, 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Norfolk played two further matches against Suffolk on 10 and 12 September at [[Scole]].&lt;ref name="MIS"/&gt;

==19th century==
The first [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]] Norfolk club of the 19th century was that based at [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] and an 1820 Norfolk v [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) match, in which [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]] made a then-record score of 278, was in fact the Holt Club with [[E. H. Budd]], [[Thomas Vigne]] and [[Felix Ladbroke]] as given men.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;ACS, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; This was perhaps a "borderline" match in terms of its status but, because of its historical importance in the light of Ward's record and the addition of the three given men, the standard was above the general run of Holt/Norfolk matches. The Holt club declined from the mid-1820s.

After that, the centre of county cricket was [[Norwich]] and a prominent club was founded there on 11 January 1827. For a few seasons, prior to [[Fuller Pilch]]'s departure for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] about 1835, Norfolk could put a fairly strong eleven into the field. Their only major county opponent, however, was [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] (playing as Yorkshire) and the five games they played in 1833, 1834 (twice), 1835 and 1836 are important.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

Apart from the games against Yorkshire, the main opponents of the Norwich/Norfolk team were Bury/Suffolk and MCC. These games however were not quite in the class of the Yorkshire matches. Norfolk played Cambridge Town Club (a.k.a. [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]]) in the 1840s but Norfolk generally fared very poorly and by 1852 the team had lost important status.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; After the present [[Norfolk County Cricket Club]] was founded in 1876, the county did not regain important status and it joined the [[Minor Counties Championship]] when it was formed in 1895.

The following is a list of matches played by Holt, Norwich or Norfolk from 1818 to 1871; those marked with {{dagger}} are definitely minor fixtures while the majority are potentially important matches depending on their treatments by different sources:{{fact|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">There is currently no '''offside''' rule in [[field hockey]].  There were prior offside rules, rules that restricted the positioning of players from the attacking team in a way similar to the [[Offside (association football)|offside]] rule in [[association football]].  The evolution of the field hockey offside rule culminated with its abolition in the mid-1990s.

==History of the offside rule==

===1876 rule===
A set of rules of field hockey was drawn up by several clubs in [[London]] in January 1876 following the establishment of the first, briefly existing, Hockey Association (of England) the year before. (The second, and final, Hockey Association was formed in 1886.) An offside rule was included in the 1876 rules. Under this rule, a player who was nearer to the opponent team's goal-line than both the ball and the third to last opponent was said to be at an offside position (simply put: an attacking player was offside if the ball was behind them and there were fewer than three defenders between them and the goal they were attacking).  The rule was applied on the whole pitch, except when the ball was hit from the goal-line.

===1886 rule===
In 1886, the second England Hockey Association drew up a code of Rules based on those used by clubs in the London area. Offside was then applied to attacking players from the half-way line only.

===1972 rule change===
The 1886 offside rule remained unchanged until 1972, when offside was changed from 3 to 2 defenders.

===1987 rule change===
In 1987, the offside was amended to apply only in the 25 yards area.

===Offside abolished===
After various amendments, the offside rule was finally repealed. "No offside" was introduced as a  [[mandatory experiment]] in 1990 and it was confirmed as a rule in 1992 by the [[Hockey Rules Board]]. The aims of this change were:
* to transfer the balance of power towards the offense,
* to create more space around the circle and mid-field,  
* to help the flow of play, more goals and fewer whistles, and 
* to make the game more exciting and appealing to spectators.

New tactics were developed by many teams to exploit this new rule.

{{Expand Spanish|Plaza de toros de Manizales|date=July 2016}}

'''Plaza de Toros de Manizales''' is a [[bullring]] located on its homonym city, in the center of [[Colombia]]. It's currently used for [[bullfighting]] during the Annual Fair of Manizales on January (Feria de Manizales), musical events and sport events to a lesser extent.

== History ==
Around 1897, a small circus was inaugurated for the first taurine festivity made in the city. Afterwards a number of circus would be built, leading to the construction of '''Plaza de toros El Soldado''' located in what currently is Batallón de Ayacucho, it was built in 15 days and inaugurated on May 14, 1944.

On September 27, 1945 the ''Plaza de Toros de Manizales'' society was assembled by José Restrepo Restrepo, Pedro Jaramillo, Vicente Gutiérrez, Jesús María Bermúdez, Antonio Pinzón, Benjamín Patiño Callejas, Laserna Hoyos Ltda., Alberto Gómez U., Rafael Villegas, Luis Carlos Valencia, Oscar Hoyos Botero, Ignacio González, Gustavo Vélez Arango, Pantaleón González, Roberto Cardona Arias and don Antonio Cuartas. Over the years, they transferred the ownership to Cruz Roja Seccional Caldas, its actual owner.

Construction company "Robledo y Borrero" delivered the building on December 23, 1951, when the first bullfight was performed under the advise of Octavio Gutiérrez A. The building was made for twelve thousand seats but was first enabled for seven thousand. Between 1951 and 1955 some bullfighting event and festivities where made, including the presentation of Mexican comediant Mario Moreno -Cantinflas-, Rubén Escobar – Escobarito-, Félix Rodríguez Antón, José Eslava, Julián e Isidro Marín, José María Martorel, Antonio Ordóñez, Pedro Martínez -Pedrés- and Joselillo de Colombia.

'''Rainout''', '''washout''', '''rain delay''', and '''rain stopped play''' are terms regarding an outdoor event, generally a [[sport]]ing event, delayed or canceled due to [[rain]], or the threat of rain. It is not to be confused with a type of [[Out (baseball)|out]] in baseball, though a baseball game can be rained out. Delays due to other forms of [[weather]] are named "snow delay", "lightning delay", "thunderstorm delay", or "fog delay" (or generically "weather delay"), while there are many other [[effects of weather on sport]]. Also, a [[night game]] can be delayed if the [[floodlights (sport)|floodlight]] system fails. Often spectators will be issued a ticket for a make up event, known as a "[[Rain check (baseball)|rain check]]".

Sports typically stopped due to the onset of rain include [[baseball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[cricket]], where even slightly damp conditions in the latter three sports seriously affect playing quality and the players' safety. In the case of tennis, several venues (such as those of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[Australian Open]]) have built [[retractable roof]]s atop their existing courts and stadiums in the last decade to avert rain delays that could push a tournament further than the final date.

[[Association football]] generally plays on through rain, although matches can be abandoned if the [[Association football pitch|pitch]] becomes severely waterlogged or there is [[lightning]] in the area, with the latter case being more for the protection of spectators within the metal stands surrounding stadiums. In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] play, should lightning be detected by any pitch official, a minimum 30-minute delay and a potential "rainout" can be declared if the lightning continues for a considerable amount of time under the NCAA's all-sports policy regarding lightning.

In [[North America]], the only one of the four major team sports to stop play due to rain is baseball. Individual sports such as golf, tennis and auto racing are also subject to rainouts, in the last case because a wet racetrack poses a risk of [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]] for vehicles traveling at high speeds, the combination of which can be fatal. [[Gridiron football|Gridiron-style football]] almost always plays through even the heaviest of rain or snow, only [[Canceled NFL games|canceling, relocating or delaying a game]] in the event that conditions are so severe as to be unsafe for spectators to attend (most commonly in the event of a lightning storm). [[Ice hockey]], when [[List of outdoor ice hockey games|played outdoors]], may also be subject to rainouts or rain delays, as the conditions to maintain a playable ice surface depend on a narrow set of favorable weather conditions. Almost all meaningful basketball games are played indoors and are thus not subject to rainouts.

If there is severe rain during a match, it can become a point of controversy whether a match should be abandoned. A notable example of this was on the final day of the [[Serie A 1999-00]] season, when [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] had to play out a match against [[A.C. Perugia|Perugia]] despite the pitch appearing to be unplayable. Juventus lost the match 1-0 and consequently lost the ''[[Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Rob.

Generally, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams will continue play in light to moderate rain but will suspend play if it is raining heavily or if there is standing water on the field.  Games can also be delayed or canceled for other forms of inclement weather, or if the field is found to be unfit for play, and for other unusual causes such as [[Swarming (honey bee)|bee swarm]]s.  Bee delays and cancellations have occurred in games such as the spring training game in 2005 that was canceled,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050324&amp;content_id=975977&amp;vkey=spt2005gamer&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403104816/http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050324&amp;content_id=975977&amp;vkey=spt2005gamer&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |archive-date=2005-04-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2009 [[Houston Astros]]-[[San Diego Padres]] game that was delayed in the ninth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290702125 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704143530/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290702125 |archive-date=2009-07-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rain is by far the most common cause for cancellations or stoppages of play. In case of rain out after the game has begun but before it is official, a [[Rain check (baseball)|rain check]] is issued; this dates to the 1870s, but did not become widespread until the 20th century.

Before a baseball game commences, unless it is the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], the [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the home team is in charge of deciding whether or not the game should be delayed or canceled due to rain or other inclement weather (see [http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/game_preliminaries_3.jsp Rule 3.10] of baseball's Official Rules).  Once the home team manager hands his lineup card to the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] shortly before the game is to begin, the umpiring crew chief has sole discretion to decide if a game should be delayed or canceled (see Rule 3.10 and [http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/start_end_4.jsp Rule 4.01] of the Official Rules).  This also applies to the second game of a doubleheader.  Umpires are required by rule to wait at least 30 minutes to see if conditions improve; this is referred to as a '''rain delay''' and is not counted as part of the length of the game listed in the [[box score (baseball)|box score]].  In practice, umpires are encouraged to see that games are played if at all possible, and will most of the times wait as long as three hours before declaring a rainout.

If a game is rained out before play begins, it is rescheduled for a later date. If it has already begun and rain falls, several scenarios are used to determine the need to resume play:
*If a game has completed the top half of the 5th inning and the home team is ahead, the game can be deemed an [[official game]]. The home team is declared the winner, and the game officially counts in standings.
*If a game has completed the bottom half of the 5th inning and either team is ahead, and in Minor League Baseball and college games if it is the final game of the series, the game can be deemed an [[official game]]. The leading team is declared the winner, and the game officially counts in standings.  However, if the game is rained out prior to the completion of an inning in which the visiting team scored one or more runs to take the lead, and the home team has not retaken the lead, the game is suspended, to be resumed at a later date.
*If a game has completed the 5th inning, and the teams are tied, or in college and some [[Minor League Baseball]] games regardless of inning, and it is not the final game in the series (the first or second game in a three-game series, also regardless of inning), the game is considered [[Suspended game|suspended]], and the resumption of the game is scheduled for a future date (usually the following day). The game picks up from where it left off. All games stopped for [[power outages]] after the 5th inning are considered suspended if it is not the final game in the series, regardless of the game's score.
**In the Major League Baseball postseason, regardless of inning, all games stopped at any time for weather or power outages are considered suspended and continued from the point of stoppage when play resumes, no matter if the game has not reached the requirements above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/start_end_4.jsp|title=Official Rules: 4.00 Starting and Ending a Game|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|pages=Rule 4.12|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was put into place as a result of Game 5 of the [[2008 World Series]], which was the first postseason game in history to be suspended and resumed from the point of suspension.  Prior to the 2009 postseason, a playoff game had to have at least five innings completed in order to be suspendable; a playoff game stopped prior to that point had to be started over.  An example was Game 1 of the [[1982 National League Championship Series]], which reached the top of the fifth inning, but had to be restarted from scratch the next day.
*If none of the previous scenarios apply, the game cannot be deemed official. {{which|The umpire|I believe that each game has six umpires; I know that it has at least four.|date=April 2018}} declares "No Game," and a make-up of the game is scheduled for a future date unless it is not feasible. The latter occurs mainly among the minor leagues and college due to travel schedules, and only in the major leagues among teams that have been declared mathematically eliminated from postseason play where no benefit in the standings would be derived. The statistics compiled during the rained out game are not counted.

The scheduling of make up dates generally follow these guidelines:

*If the game is postponed or suspended and both teams play each other the following day, then the game will be completed the next day as part of a doubleheader. Venue remains the same.
*If the game is postponed or suspended and neither team has a game the following day, then the game will be made up the following day. Venue remains the same.
*If the game is postponed or suspended, one or both teams play a different team the following day, and the teams meet again at the same venue later in the season, then the game will be rescheduled to a future series between the two teams at that venue, usually as part of a doubleheader. This mainly applies to division rivals.
*If the game is postponed or suspended, one or both teams play a different team the following day, and the teams do not meet again at the same venue later in the season, then two options apply. Usually, the teams find a convenient shared open date to play the makeup game at the venue where the rainout occurred. In rare cases, if the teams play again later in the season, the game gets rescheduled to that series, usually as part of a doubleheader. For the makeup game, the team that would have hosted the game will wear their home jerseys even though the game is played at a different venue. This happened in 2013, when the Giants and the Reds met in a doubleheader at [[AT&amp;T Park]] because a game between the two at [[Great American Ball Park]] got rained out and both teams had to play the following day.
*If more than one game is postponed or suspended in a series, then the previous rules apply to each game separately.
*If a makeup game must be postponed or suspended again, then the same doubleheader rules apply. This scenario is very uncommon.
*In the Major League Baseball postseason, doubleheaders are prohibited under the current collective bargaining agreement. The game gets scheduled to a future date at the same venue. In some independent baseball leagues, postseason doubleheaders can happen, but are very uncommon.
*If the teams are playing an international series and the game gets rained out, then the game will usually be made up at the neutral site as part of a doubleheader, but if that is not possible then the game gets rescheduled as part of a future series between the two at the designated home team's venue, usually as part of a doubleheader.
*Triple headers are now prohibited under the current collective bargaining agreement, except when the first game is the conclusion of a game suspended from a prior date. This would only happen in the extremely rare case of the only remaining dates between teams being doubleheaders and no single games are left for the suspended game to precede. The last triple header occurred on October 1, 1920.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Domed stadiums===
In areas that receive high amounts of rain or otherwise could be impacted by the weather, those teams have built stadiums with a roof to protect the field, first as a [[dome]]d stadium, and more recently with a [[retractable roof]]. Despite this, the [[Houston Astros]]—who played at the [[NRG Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]] for 35 years and currently play at the retractable roof-equipped [[Minute Maid Park]], primarily to protect fans from the intense summer Texas heat—ironically had [[NRG Astrodome#June 15.2C 1976 .22The Rainout.22|a rainout at the Astrodome]] on June 15, 1976 due to intense flooding in the [[Houston]] area. The game, against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], was later made up at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] despite the Astros still having a home series against the Pirates later that season. Also, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] that opened in Milwaukee on April 6, 2001 has a fan-style roof that opens and closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/hoffman/6485163.html |title=Hoffman: Astros made history with a rainout - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Snow delay===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ExhibitionStadium.jpg|thumb|275px|April 7, 1977. A snow-covered field prior to the first [[Toronto Blue Jays]] game at [[Exhibition Stadium]].]] --&gt;
Although rare, a delay caused by [[snow]] has been known to happen in baseball. This is usually the case in the early parts of the season that, although always starts after the [[Spring (season)|spring]] [[equinox]], is still within the traditional snow season in the northern half of North America. In fact, the first ever game of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in 1977, although not delayed, was affected by a minor snowstorm. Although some areas of North America begin to receive snow in October, it is still too warm for snow to start accumulating, and with most teams done playing for the season by that point due to the [[Major League Baseball postseason|MLB playoffs]], is largely a non-issue anyway, and very rarely does the [[World Series]] extend into November—something that has only happened six times (2001 World Series, 2009 World Series, 2010 World Series, 2015 World Series, 2016 World Series and 2017 World Series).

In April 2007, [[Winter storms of 2006–07|snow storms in northern Ohio]] caused the [[Cleveland Indians]] to postpone their [[Opening Day|home opening series]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] and forced the Indians to find a different location for their home series against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. MLB took advantage of the roof at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] (home of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]) and moved the Indians-Angels series to [[Milwaukee]]. All seats were sold for $10 apiece, and attendance was 52,496 for the three games.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070409&amp;content_id=1888109|title=Angels-Indians Series Moved|accessdate=February 15, 2009|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=April 9, 2007|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|location=Cleveland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians-Mariners games were eventually made up at various points in the season, including one game at [[Safeco Field]] during their regularly-scheduled series in [[Seattle]] as part of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] in which the Indians were the designated home team for the first game.

==Motorsport==
Some auto racing series do not compete in rain, especially series that race on paved [[oval track]]s. The rain severely diminishes the [[traction (engineering)|traction]] between the [[slick tire]]s and the surface. Other series, especially those that race on [[Road racing|road courses]] such as [[Formula One]] and public roads as in [[rallying]], use special treaded [[rain tire]]s while the surface is wet but not in excessively heavy rain, standing water, or lightning (which is an automatic cessation of racing because of pit crew, race marshals, and safety). [[Dirt track racing]] can be run in a light rain as the vehicles have treaded tires. [[Rallying]] can be held in rain or snow.

[[IndyCar]] and [[NASCAR]] do not compete on a wet or moist surface at most oval tracks. They will not start an event unless the surface is dry. If the surface become wet during a race, the event is typically halted, and the cars are pulled off the track. Very light moisture may warrant only a temporary yellow caution period, while heavier rains usually require a red flag, stopped condition.

After the rain ceases, the sanctioning body will determine if the track surface can be dried within a reasonable time frame. The track is considered "lost" if rain thoroughly wets the surface, usually characterized by a dark look to the asphalt or concrete pavement. Track crews use [[Glossary of motorsport terms#J|jet dryers]], which consist of modified [[jet engines]], mounted upside down to allow the hot exhaust to pummel the surface. The hot exhaust acts to quickly evaporate the rainwater, and allow the surface to dry considerably quicker than normal conditions. Large scale wet-vacs are also sometimes used to supplement.

The [[safety car]] driver will work with race stewards on the proper decision on a red flag when rain falls.  In NASCAR, if the race start is delayed, officials may ask a more experienced driver to evaluate if a track is sufficiently dry by having the driver run medium-speed laps around the circuit to evaluate the dryness of the circuit.  He then reports the results to his crew chief, who sends a report to a NASCAR official.

In rain conditions, officials may start the race under the safety car, and wave the green after a few laps have been run under such conditions.  In that situation, all Safety Car laps count towards the race distance, but in IndyCar and NASCAR, only after both green and yellow are waved together (some laps may be run beforehand that do not count).  However, officials may only allow the laps to count if the green flag is the next flag to wave and not the red flag, and officials may discard all laps run if cars do not complete a lap under green flag conditions.  This procedure may be used by officials in an attempt to reach the race to official race status (halfway or three-fourths).

If rain does not subside, the sanctioning body has several options. Typically, the race is considered "official" if has completed at least one lap beyond the halfway point of the advertised distance (similar to baseball). If such is the case, the race is deemed complete, and a winner can be declared. In some cases, if the race has already gone beyond the halfway point (especially if it is very near the scheduled finish) when rain falls, and the weather forecast is for day-long rain, no attempt to complete the remainder of the race will be attempted. If a downpour occurs very near the end of the race, the officials, in fact, may use their authority to wave the checkered flag at that instant, and end the race immediately (such as during the [[1975 Indianapolis 500]]). However, if the event is stopped any lap before the halfway point, the remainder of the event can be postponed to the following day (such as during the [[1997 Indianapolis 500]]). 

IndyCar and NASCAR both will use rain tires if they are at a road course.  However, if the rain is severe enough where standing water, visibility becomes an issue, or if lightning is detected within a 12&amp;nbsp;km radius of the circuit, the race will be stopped.  At the 2014 Honda Indy Toronto Race 1, IndyCar attempted to wave green and yellow together to start the race under the Safety Car.  After numerous incidents, IndyCar decided to abandon the race and wiped the slate clean for Sunday with two races. IndyCar also has cancelled qualifying at a circuit because of lightning, primarily as a safety issue with electronics, radio communications, teams on pit lane, race marshals, and spectators.

The code in USAC, NASCAR, and IndyCar states if fewer than half the laps are completed or if the race is unable to start, the event is resumed on a later date, usually the next day. With the introduction of lights at numerous oval tracks, the time frame for resuming a rain delayed race on the same day has been largely expanded. Some races stopped during the day for rain have seen the track dried, and the race completed later in the evening on the same day. Since the 2017 season, all NASCAR national series utilize a format in which races are divided into three or four stages, with a competition caution after each; a race is considered official following the conclusion of the second stage, which is typically positioned around two quarters of the scheduled distance.

Most road racing (except in the United States) does not use the 50 percent rule.  In the FIA Code, if severe rain forces the race to be interrupted, the regulations state if less than three laps were completed, the race is canceled and will not be made up.  Once a race is on its fourth green flag lap, the race is official, and only half points will be awarded until 75% of the race has been completed.

===Famous events delayed by rain in motorsport===
The [[1976 Indianapolis 500]] was the shortest Indianapolis 500 in history, one lap past official status, with 102 laps completed.

The [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix]] was delayed because of rain. When the race eventually started, championship leader [[Niki Lauda]] pulled out because of the dangerous conditions, allowing [[James Hunt]] to score enough points to win the championship.

The [[1992 Tooheys 1000]] was drastically affected by rain, with the [[Dick Johnson Racing]] team leading the race on Lap 145 after a series of crashes at Forrest's Elbow.  However, as the [[Gibson Motor Sport|Winfield Racing Nissan]] team was part of a crash on Lap 144 at the section, the rules ordered a countback to the 143rd lap when the race was called to rain.  The Nissan team was declared winner.

The MotoGP [[2008 Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|2008 Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix]] was drastically affected by [[Hurricane Ike]].  The 250cc (now 600cc Moto2) class race was cancelled because of heavy rains, while earlier in the days the races in the 125cc (now 250cc Moto3) and MotoGP classes were curtailed because of weather.

The [[2009 Petit Le Mans]] in [[Braselton, Georgia]], was an example of a rainout under the FIA Code, where only three completed laps are needed for an official race and less than half the race (184 of 394 laps).  The red flag waved after 184 laps at the 4:52 point of the race.  In endurance racing, the clock does not stop for red flags.  IMSA waited until 8 PM to declare the race official. While the race was 13 laps from official (500 miles), the clock had passed the five-hour mark when the race was called at 8 PM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=347422&amp;FS=ALMS |title=Petit Le Mans: An Explanation |publisher=[[Motorsport.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606081807/http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=347422&amp;FS=ALMS |archive-date=2011-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Formula One's [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix]], a rainstorm was predicted to hit the half of the race of 56 laps, however, at the start of the race the weather was sunny with large black clouds in the distance.  By lap 19 it began to rain as some drivers entered pit road for wet tyres as the rain was falling hard. By lap 28, the rain was torrential to the point officials called a caution, deploying the Safety Car, but still several cars were out due to spins or crashes. The rain became worse and the race was red-flagged on lap 33. Once the rain had ceased, it was deemed too late and dark to continue and the race was stopped.  Some drivers and spectators protested the race organizer's decision but no action was taken.  The 2009 season was the first year that the FIA started the Asia and Australia races as late-afternoon starts where the sun would be setting during the race finish in order to maximise European television broadcasts.

In the [[2011 Canadian Grand Prix]] of Formula One, rain before the race wet the circuit. 30 minutes into the race, a heavy rainstorm hit the circuit and the race was red-flagged. The rain didn't stop quickly and the event was delayed for more than 2 hours, but the full distance was eventually run and was the longest race in Formula One history.  To prevent a repeat, FIA rules were changed so that a four-hour [[race clock]] starts when the cars start their warm-up lap.  The clock will not be stopped for any situation, effectively ending a race four hours after cars roll off, regardless of how far the race has finished.

The [[2012 Daytona 500]] was postponed by rain for the first time in history, as it was postponed 30 hours from 1 PM Sunday to 7 PM Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/story/2012-02-26/Daytona-500-postponed-by-rain/53257710/1 |title=Rained out: Daytona 500 postponed until Monday |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2012-02-26 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2013 6 Hours of Fuji]] in the FIA World Endurance Championship was effectively cancelled because of rain;  officials started the clock and ran laps under caution, hoping for conditions to improve;  after 17 laps, all under caution, the race was effectively cancelled, but under FIA rules, was an official race.  To prevent a repeat, FIA rules were changed to state the three completed laps rule to make a race official applied only to green flag laps.

The [[2015 Petit Le Mans]] was shortened to 7 hours, 51 minutes after being under one weather delay earlier in the race;  after a safety car with slightly over two hours remaining, the race was abandoned after 179 laps because of weather conditions related to [[Hurricane Joaquin]] and related heavy rains in the Southeastern United States.

==Cricket==

In [[cricket]], when part of a game is rained out causing a reduction in the number of overs batted by one or both teams then the number of runs accredited to either one or both teams may be revised.  A common method to recalculate the number of runs accredited to either team is the [[Duckworth–Lewis method]].

==Consequences in live broadcasting==

In event of a rain delay, most television broadcasters run alternate programming (also known as "rain delay filler"), in place of the scheduled game or event. Depending on event, the alternate programming takes many forms, such as a movie, a rerun of a television program, interviews and analysis, highlights of the last event, or even another game or for networks such as [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports 1]], "whiparound" coverage of other games from other [[regional sports networks]] (Fox Sports 1 also maintains a regularly scheduled program, ''MLB Whiparound''). The delay continues until the weather is cleared up enough to resume the game, or if it comes to a point where it is not practical to resume it; in this case, it would become a "rain out".

In some cases, if the rain delay is in danger of interfering with the network's schedule that would follow after the game, they would often transfer coverage of the game to another station or channel, or show it later on via [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]], depending on the organizational policy. For instance, with Sunday afternoon [[NASCAR]] events and Saturday night [[National Hockey League|NHL]] games, a race on a broadcast network such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] or [[NBC]] would be moved to an alternate cable network such as [[Fox Sports 1]] or [[NBCSN]] if the delay runs several hours, to allow those networks to present their prime time entertainment schedules (or, in NBC's case, its late night show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which has been protected from sports-related delays since [[XFL#Broadcast schedule|an incident with the XFL in 2001]]), or later in NASCAR's season with NBC, allows contingency as ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' takes [[Heidi Game|full contractual precedence]] over NASCAR events.

''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'' was an example of a live broadcast of a game show that was filmed outdoors (it was filmed in an hourglass-shaped outdoor structure on top of a building with a flat roof). There was also an alternate indoor set where the non-primetime broadcasts took place. However, if inclement weather activity happened in the area where the show was filmed during primetime, the game show temporarily moved to its alternate set located inside the building. During the event, the clock did not stop for weather-related delays or other circumstances. The show was broadcast on NBC for only one season, after which it was canceled.

The [[2011 NHL Winter Classic]] was scheduled to take place at 1 PM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] [[New Year's Day]], but ended up delayed to 8 PM EST due to unusually warm weather in the Pittsburgh area, with rain impacting the game. Because the game was then moved to [[prime time]], the game ended up having the [[Unintended consequences|unintended result]] of bringing in higher ratings for [[NBC]] in the United States, giving the NHL the highest ratings for a regular-season game since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/144652 | title= Winter Classic On NBC Is Top NHL Regular-Season Audience In 36 Years |date= January 3, 2011 |work= SportsBusiness Daily |publisher= [[Street &amp; Smith]] | accessdate= 2011-01-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110104062357/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/144652| archivedate= 4 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, subsequent Winter Classics remain played in the early afternoon hours, as the game is purposefully scheduled at that time to avoid the [[College Football Playoff]] [[bowl game]]s, mainly the [[Rose Bowl Game]] and [[Sugar Bowl]] most years.

'''Richard N Newman''' (dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er and match organiser who played batsman for [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]], [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] from the [[1773 English cricket season|1773 season]] to [[1793 English cricket season|1793]]. Richards first-class debut came on 21 June 1773, While playing for Kent in a match against Surrey,a game which saw him playing alongside the Duke of Dorset. He was a leading amateur player and an early member of MCC. Richard Newman's greatest achievement in his career came on Thursday 31 May 1787 in the first ever game played at Lord's, between Middlesex and Essex, where Richard scored the first ever half century at Lord's, while batting for Essex.

Surprisingly little is known of Newman personally.  He made 22 known first-class appearances. On 12 July 1793 Richard made his debut for England against Surrey, 10 days later Richard was called up again, this time however it was through default. Richard was selected by Surrey to play in a match against England, his teammate R.Robinson dropped out at this point Hammond of England decided to swap teams with Richard Newman, Hammond went on to Stump Richard out on both innings.In Richard's final season, he became a proveen fielder with 20 know catches in the 1793 season. Richard's final game came on 19 August 1793,in a match organised by himself between RN Newman's XI and R Leigh's XI.

      <comment>/* NBA steals records */ a lot of really ticky-tacky stats and arbitrary cutoffs about number of seasons with xyz s/g, this should be just a brief list of absolutes - most in a game/season/career are indisputably worthy of inclusion, the others can be found on many sports stats websites devoted to this type of thing</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7000">In [[basketball]], a '''steal''' occurs when a defensive player legally causes a [[turnover (basketball)|turnover]] by his positive, aggressive action(s).&lt;ref name="FIBA Manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=554 | title=FIBA Statistics Manual 2005 | accessdate=March 9, 2011 | author=[[FIBA]] | pages=43, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/Stats_Manuals/Basketball/2011EZ.pdf | title=NCAA Official Basketball Statistician's Manual | accessdate=March 9, 2011 |author1=Isaacs, David |author2=Johnson, Gary K. | pages=10, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done by deflecting and controlling, or by catching the opponent's pass or [[Dribble#Basketball|dribble]] of an offensive player.  The defender must not touch the offensive player's hands or otherwise a ''[[foul (basketball)|foul]]'' is called.

Steals are credited to the defensive player who first causes the turnover, even if he does not end up with possession of the live ball. To earn a steal, the defensive player must be the initiator of the action causing the turnover, not just the benefactor.&lt;ref name="FIBA Manual" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Manual" /&gt;  Whenever a steal is recorded by a defensive player, an offensive player must be credited as committing a turnover.

Stealing the ball requires good anticipation, speed and fast reflexes, all common traits of  good defenders. However, like [[Block (basketball)|blocked shots]], steals are not always a perfect gauge of a player's defensive abilities. An unsuccessful steal can result in the defender being out of position and unable to recover in time, allowing the offense to score. Therefore, attempting to steal is a gamble. Steals, though risky, can pay off greatly, because they often trigger a [[fastbreak]] for the defensive team.

There is no prototypical position from which a player may get many steals. While smaller, quicker [[point guard|guards]] tend to accumulate the most steals, there are many exceptions. For example, forward [[Rick Barry]] led the [[NBA]] in steals in 1974-75, and for many years [[basketball center|center]] [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] led his team in the category, consistently ranking among the league's leaders, and is the only center ranked in the top 10 [[List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders|all-time in steals]]. [[Karl Malone]], a [[Power Forward (basketball)|power forward]], is currently number ten.

==NBA steals records==

Steals were first recorded in the NBA in the [[1973–74 NBA season|1973–74 season]], while the rival [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] league first recorded steals during the same season.

[[Kendall Gill]] and [[Larry Kenon]] are tied for most steals in a regular season NBA game with eleven. Kenon's was recorded on December 26, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Antonio Spurs at Kansas City Kings Box Score, December 26, 1976|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197612260KCK.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gill recorded his on April 3, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Single Game Leaders and Records for Steals|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_game.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most steals by a player in an NBA season is 301 by [[Alvin Robertson]] in 1985-86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA &amp; ABA Single Season Leaders and Records for Steals|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_season.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA's all-time leader for steals is [[John Stockton]] with 3,265 in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA &amp; ABA Career Leaders and Records for Steals|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_career.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBA leader in steals per game (SPG) is Robertson with an average of 2.71 (career, 1250 steals minimum)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA &amp; ABA Career Leaders and Records for Steals Per Game|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_per_g_career.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.67 (season, 125 minimum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA &amp; ABA Single Season Leaders and Records for Steals Per Game|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_per_g_season.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baron Davis]] is the all-time playoff leader in steals per game for a career with 2.28 SPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA &amp; ABA Career Playoff Leaders and Records for Steals Per Game|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_per_g_career_p.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Cheeks]] in the [[1979 NBA Playoffs|1979 Playoffs]] averaged a playoff record 4.11 SPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA &amp; ABA Single Season Playoff Leaders and Records for Steals Per Game|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_per_g_season_p.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable players in the NBA==
Some of the greatest defensive specialists in the steals category in the NBA include:
* [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] &amp;nbsp;- ranking in the top 10 All-Time in both steals and blocks.
* [[Walt Frazier]]&amp;nbsp;– renowned for his masterful defense, which culminated around his ability to deflect dribbling and passes using his incredibly quick hands.  Steals were not recorded during the early part of his career. Frazier once made 8 consecutive steals during a third quarter against Atlanta in 1971.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* [[Allen Iverson]]&amp;nbsp;– led the league in steals three times (consecutively); most steals in a playoff game.
* [[Michael Jordan]]&amp;nbsp;– led the league in steals and steals per game three times, #3 all-time in career steals and #3 all-time in steals per game.  #2 all-time in career steals in the playoffs behind Scottie Pippen.

* [[Michael Ray Richardson]]&amp;nbsp;– led the league in steals three times; #2 all-time in steals per game.
* [[Alvin Robertson]]&amp;nbsp;– led the league in steals and steals per game three times, #9 [[List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders|all-time in career steals]] and #1 all-time in steals per game.
* [[John Stockton]]&amp;nbsp;– led the league in steals twice, #1 all-time in career steals and #6 in steals per game.
* [[Jerry West]]&amp;nbsp;– is widely known for his ability to execute steals, but the statistic was not recorded until his final season.  West was the first player to officially record [[List of National Basketball Association players with most steals in a game|10 steals in a game]].
* [[Clyde Drexler]]&amp;nbsp;– Drexler had 2,207 steals in his 15-year career with the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Houston Rockets]]. He is #7 [[List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders|all-time in career steals]].

'''''The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers''''' is a documentary episode of [[Al Jazeera Investigates]] released by [[Al Jazeera English]] and [[Al Jazeera America]] which investigated professional athletes' potential use of [[Performance-enhancing drugs]] (PEDs) naming [[Peyton Manning]] and other prominent athletes like [[Ryan Howard]], [[Ryan Zimmerman]], [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]], and [[Clay Matthews III]].

==Content==
On December 27, 2015, Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera America released a report conducted by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit called ''The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers'' which investigated professional athletes' potential use of [[Performance-enhancing drugs]] (PEDs) naming several prominent athletes as having received drugs from Charles Sly, a pharmacist who had worked at the Guyer Anti-Aging Clinic in Indianapolis during the fall of 2011. The report involved Liam Collins, a British hurdler, going undercover in an attempt to obtain banned substances from Sly and other medical professionals. The report claimed that Manning's wife, Ashley, had been shipped [[Off-label use|off-label]] [[Growth hormone|human growth hormone]] (HGH) by the Guyer Institute during the fall of 2011 while Manning was out with a severe neck injury, with the intention of hiding that Manning was the one actually receiving the drugs; as well as several other athletes been provided the banned hormone supplement Delta-2. Moreover, Sly spoke with great acknowledge about doping and tossed out several athletes like Howard, Zimmerman, Manning and fellow football players [[Mike Neal]] and [[Dustin Keller]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/dark-side-secrets-sports-dopers-151227133355144.html |title=The dark side: The secret world of sports doping |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14441114/documentary-links-peyton-manning-other-pro-athletes-use-peds |title=Documentary links Peyton Manning, other pro athletes to use of PEDs |website=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/29/al-jazeera-reporter-stresses-that-no-allegation-is-being-made-against-peyton-manning/ |title=Al Jazeera reporter stresses that no allegation is being made against Peyton Manning &amp;#124; ProFootballTalk |website=[[Pro Football Talk]] |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sly said on a hidden camera record:
{{quote|I did part of my training at the Guyer Institute, which is this anti-aging clinic in Indiana. Him and his wife would come in after hours and get IVs and shit. So one thing that Guyer does is he dispenses drugs out of his office, which physicians can do in the United States. It’s just not very many of them do it. And all the time we would be sending Ashley Manning drugs. Like growth hormone, all the time, everywhere, Florida. And it would never be under Peyton’s name. it would always be under her name. We were sending it everywhere... it’d go to Florida... Almost all drugs you can prescribe off-label. GH is one of the few drugs, it’s really the only drug you cannot prescribe off-label. It has three indications.

[About Guyer]
I know for a fact he does. I would see patients with him part of the day and the other part of the day I would work in his pseudo-pharmacy. I’m surprised his place has not been shut down yet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peyton-manning-human-growth-hormone_us_567f16e4e4b0b958f6599440?&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[MLB]] player [[Taylor Teagarden]] also claimed in an undercover footage included in the documentary:
{{quote|I used it last year, I was very ... I was scared to be honest with you. I took it for like two weeks and I had a test four weeks after my last administration of it. Nothing happened ... And I was also taking peptides too but they were all urine tests, no blood tests ... Once a year, maybe twice at most.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25538782&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reactions==
Manning told [[ESPN]]'s [[Lisa Salters]] about the reports, on an interview on the morning of the 27th for ESPN [[Sunday NFL Countdown]]: 
{{quote|“Disgusted is how I feel. Sickened by it. I’m not sure I understand how someone can make something up about somebody, admit he’s made it up and yet somehow it gets published in a story. I don’t understand that. Maybe you can explain it to me, somebody else can. It’s completely fabricated, complete trash, garbage. It makes me sick it brings Ashley into it. Her medical history, her medical privacy being violated. That makes me sick. I don’t understand that. It’s not right. I don’t understand it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/peyton-manning-responds-to-forthcoming-hgh-allegations-1749843040|title=Peyton Manning Appears On ESPN To Refute "Garbage" HGH Claims That Haven't Aired Yet [UPDATE]|author=Timothy Burke|work=[[Deadspin]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Salters pointed other cases have been seen in which athletes deny first and then eventually admit allegations and Manning answered he can't speak for others and he know how hard he worked.&lt;ref name="denvbron"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Transcript-Peyton-Manning-interviews-with-ESPNs-Lisa-Salters/f07ef954-bada-42fc-ab64-f9f38dc9fb49 |title=Transcript: Peyton Manning interviews with ESPN's Lisa Salters |website=Denverbroncos.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Manning also stated he had visited the Guyer Institute 35 times during 2011 and that he had received both medication and treatment from Guyer during this time.&lt;ref name="denvbron"/&gt; Sly recanted his story and requested the report not to be aired via a YouTube video following the release of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sports |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-sly-recants-statements-about-peyton-manning-2015-12 |title=Charlie Sly recants statements about Peyton Manning |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleary |first=Tom |url=http://heavy.com/sports/2015/12/charles-charlie-sly-pharmacist-gave-peyton-manning-hgh-human-growth-hormone-texas-indiana-youtube-photos-al-jazeera-documentary-howard-zimmerman-james-harrison/ |title=Charlie Sly: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |website=[[Heavy.com]] |date= |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning took response and hired former [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush]] press secretary [[Ari Fleischer]] to manage the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25427627/report-manning-hires-crisis-manager-ari-fleischer-in-wake-of-hgh-documentary|title=Report: Peyton Manning turns to Ari Fleischer in wake of HGH doc|work=[[CBSSports.com]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also threatened to sue Al Jazeera but then backed up.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2016/05/25/peyton-manning-hgh-allegations-al-jazeera/84922710/&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Fleischer confirmed that Ashley Manning did receive shipments from the Guyer Institute, but refused to confirm if the shipments had included HGH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14718227/peyton-manning-legal-team-looked-al-jazeera-documentary |title=Peyton Manning's legal team looked into Al Jazeera documentary |website=ESPN.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reactions were varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peyton-manning-al-jazeera-espn_us_568e6d74e4b0cad15e638886|title=Here’s Why ESPN Didn’t Break The Peyton Manning Story|website=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]]' contributor [[Jesse Watters]] claimed on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' the PED allegations reported by Al Jazeera were a plot to go "after American icons and US institutions," citing the allegations against Manning as the prime example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nomorecocktails.com/post/2015/12/28/Jesse-Watters-Is-Al-Jazeera-Going-After-American-Icons-and-US-Institutions-with-Manning-Report.aspx |title=Jesse Watters: Is Al Jazeera ‘Going After American Icons and U.S. Institutions’ with Manning Report? |website=[[Fox News]] |date=2015-12-28 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC News]] on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' gave Al Jazeera's reporter Deborah Davies space to specify details about the reports and provide Al Jazeera's version of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Ley |url=http://deadspin.com/al-jazeera-reporter-defends-peyton-manning-hgh-report-o-1750120420 |title=Al Jazeera Reporter Defends Peyton Manning HGH Report On Today Show |website=Deadspin |date=2015-12-29 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]]'s ''[[Reliable Sources]]'' with [[Brian Stelter]] reported Al Jazeera was in contact with a second source who confirmed that the clinic sent HGH to Ashley Manning in Florida and elsewhere, and according to Davies was “absolutely impeccably placed, knowledgeable and credible”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Timothy Burke |url=http://deadspin.com/al-jazeera-reporter-second-knowledgable-and-credible-1750778458 |title=Al Jazeera Reporter: Second "Knowledgable And Credible" Source Confirms HGH Sent To Manning House |website=Deadspin |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Salters' interview with Manning, former [[NFL]] coach and ESPN pundit [[Mike Ditka]] expressed on the same Sunday NFL Countdown episode: “Al Jazeera is not a credible news organization. They’re out there spreading garbage.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/ditka-takes-heat-al-jazeera-not-credible-article-1.2478031|title=Ditka takes heat for saying Al Jazeera is 'not credible'|author=SCOTT CHIUSANO|date=27 December 2015|work=[[NY Daily News]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' sportswriter and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' contributor [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] called Al Jazeera on his column ''The MMQB'' a day later "a quite credible and respected international news organization" and "the CNN of the Middle East spreading its news-gathering around the world in recent years", and also contacted Davies to ask about information related to the Guyer Clinic and Sly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2015/12/28/peyton-manning-hgh-allegations-nfl-week-16-upsets|title=The MMQB with Peter King: Upsetting Developments |website=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]] sportscaster and ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' #1 Play-by-play commentator [[Jim Nantz]] refused to acknowledge the report while on the air, referring to it as a "non-story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barry Petchesky |url=http://deadspin.com/jim-nantz-is-a-sanctimonious-wiener-1750929687 |title=Jim Nantz Is A Sanctimonious Wiener |website=Deadspin |date=2015-12-28 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jim-nantz-cbs-punt-peyton-manning-hgh-story-article-1.2484590&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the backlash, on January 5, 2016 it was announced that Howard and Zimmerman had filed a lawsuit suing Al Jazeera for defamation following the publication's release of the documentary which linked them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/report--ryan-zimmerman-suing-al-jazeera-after-hgh-story-230924477.html|title=Ryan Zimmerman, Ryan Howard suing Al Jazeera after steroid story|website=[[Yahoo Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Zimmerman's team, the [[Washington Nationals]], issued a statement in support of their player.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2015/12/27/nationals-issue-statement-supporting-ryan-zimmerman-amid-allegations-of-ped-use/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further investigations==
Sly said he had never seen the Mannings and told ESPN's [[Chris Mortensen]] that he is not a pharmacist and was not at the Guyer Institute in 2011, as Al Jazeera claimed, but state licensing records indicate that someone named "Charles David Sly" was licensed as a pharmacy intern in Indiana from April 2010 to May 2013 and that his license expired May 1, 2013.&lt;ref name="abcny7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc7ny.com/sports/documentary-links-peyton-manning-other-pro-athletes-to-use-of-peds/1136912 |title=Documentary links Peyton Manning, other pro athletes to use of PEDs |work=[[WABC-TV]] |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jazeera later confirmed that Sly had worked at the Guyer Institute during the Fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/12/29/al-jazeera-releases-video-to-counter-attack-on-its-doping-investigation/|title=Al Jazeera releases video to counter attack on its doping investigation|author=Erik Wemple|date=29 December 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sly also claimed to ESPN that the reporter involved, Collins, had taken advantage of him during a vulnerable time in his life as Sly's fiancée had allegedly died, although Sly refers to his fiancée, "Karen", several times in the present tense during his conversations with Collins and gave no indication to Collins that she had died.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Sly had also described one of the athletes mentioned, Mike Neal, as a good friend and told in the documentary he had spent about six weeks in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], [[Green Bay Packers|where Neal played]]; and while on Green Bay, Sly was introduced by Neal to several of his teammates, in a roster which has included players like Matthews III and [[Julius Peppers]], both whom Sly mentioned on camera. Neal served a four-game suspension for doping in [[2012 NFL season|2012]].&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/sports/baseball/al-jazeera-peyton-manning-derek-jeter-charles-sly.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Furthermore, the owner of the Guyer Clinic, Dale Guyer, was linked to doubtful businesses in the past.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/guyer-clinic-linked-notorius-ponzi-schemer-article-1.2481062&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, ''[[The New York Times]]'' made the link between most of the names mentioned in the documentary and a sports therapy clinic called Performance Compound in [[Tampa, Florida]] run by Sly's partner Jason Riley, a fitness trainer based in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. Sly and Riley also launched ''Elementz Nutrition'', a nutritional supplement company whose website and Facebook page feature many of the athletes Sly referred.

On February 5, 2016, two men visited Sly's parents, and according to a 911 call from Sly's parents' house during the visit, one of the men initially said he was a law enforcement officer, but didn’t have a badge.

'''The Drive''' was an offensive series in the fourth quarter of the 1986 [[AFC Championship Game]] played on January 11, 1987, at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]] between the [[Denver Broncos]] and [[Cleveland Browns]]. Broncos quarterback [[John Elway]], in a span of 5 minutes and 2 seconds, led his team 98 yards in 15 plays to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation. Denver won the game in overtime making a 38 yard field goal, the Broncos pulled off a 23–20 win over the Cleveland Browns. 

The 98-yard drive ranks as pro football's prototypical clutch performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/decades/1980s/the_drive.jsp|title=Pro Football Hall of Fame – The Drive|website=ProFootballHOF.com|access-date=June 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elway and his team spanned almost all of the 100-yard football field. According to an article by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist and Colorado resident [[Rick Reilly]], when Elway started the drive, Broncos [[offensive guard]] [[Keith Bishop (American football)|Keith Bishop]] said of the Browns, "We got 'em right where we want 'em!" Cleveland could not force a fourth down against Denver. The Cleveland Browns, along with lead rusher "the captain" Cory Chaney, ran for 659 yards.

==Play-by-play==
The Browns had jumped to a 20–13 lead and Denver had muffed the ensuing kickoff when Elway took over, first-and-10 on their own 2-yard line, with 5:32 to play in regulation.

#First down and 10, Denver 2-yard line. [[Sammy Winder]] 5-yard pass from Elway.
#Second down and 5, Denver 7-yard line. Winder 3-yard run.
#Third down and 2, Denver 10-yard line. Winder 2-yard run.
#First down and 10, Denver 12-yard line. Winder 3-yard run.
#Second down and 7, Denver 15-yard line. Elway 11-yard run.
#First down and 10, Denver 26-yard line. [[Steve Sewell]] 22-yard pass from Elway.
#First down and 10, Denver 48-yard line. [[Steve Watson (American football)|Steve Watson]] 12-yard pass from Elway.
'''Two-minute warning'''
#&lt;li value="8"&gt;First down and 10, Cleveland 40-yard line (1:59 left). Incomplete pass by Elway, intended for [[Vance Johnson]].&lt;/li&gt;
#Second down and 10, Cleveland 40-yard line (1:52 left). [[Dave Puzzuoli]] sack of Elway, 8-yard loss.
#Third down and 18, Cleveland 48-yard line (1:47 left). [[Mark Jackson (American football player)|Mark Jackson]] 20-yard pass from Elway.
#First down and 10, Cleveland 28-yard line (1:19 left). Incomplete pass by Elway, intended for Watson.
#Second down and 10, Cleveland 28-yard line (1:10 left). Steve Sewell 14-yard pass from Elway.
#First down and 10, Cleveland 14-yard line (:57 left). Incomplete pass by Elway, intended for Watson.
#Second down and 10, Cleveland 14-yard line (:42 left). John Elway 9-yard run (scramble).
#Third down and 1, Cleveland 5-yard line (:39 left). Mark Jackson 5-yard pass from Elway for the touchdown. [[Rich Karlis]] then adds the [[extra point]] to tie the game.

==In popular culture==

The Drive was featured in the movie ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]'', but due to the [[butterfly effect]], Jackson was distracted by a squirrel and failed to catch the pass and Cleveland went on to win. It was inaccurately portrayed as being in 1986 (the game was played on January 11, 1987, though it was at the end of the [[1986 NFL season]]). The movie implied that it was played at night; however, when Karlis kicked the winning field goal in OT, it was still daytime in Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2010/04/john_elways_drive_never_happen.php|title=John Elway's "Drive" Never Happened?|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2837">A '''touch judge''' is an official who monitors the [[touch-line]] in a game of [[rugby union]] or [[rugby league]] and raises a flag if the ball (or player carrying it) goes into [[touch (rugby)|touch]]. Touch judges also stand behind the posts to confirm that a goal has been scored following a penalty kick or conversion of a try. There are two touch judges, one for each '''touch-line''' and each holding a different coloured flag.

==Rugby union==
Rugby union touch judges support the referee by marking 'touch' (identifying when the ball leaves the playing area and comes into contact with something there or when the player carrying the ball steps out of the playing area), indicating successful kicks at goal and marking offside lines at set piece plays (the scrum and line out).

Depending on the relevant national regulations, touch judges can be recognised as 'assistant referees' and can have the authority to indicate foul play, support with pre-match protocols and other roles delegated to them by the referee.

In England, touch judges are only recognised as assistant referees when appointed by the RFU or by the relevant Referees' Society. Touch judges in the vast majority of community matches do not act as assistant referees and cannot comment on matters of foul play or other technical matters.

In [[Rugby union#Tournaments|test match]]es, it is normal for the referee and assistant referees to be connected by a radio link to aid the communication of all this information.

At elite levels of the 'sevens' variation of rugby union, additional in-goal assistant referees exist to support the referee with in-goal decisions.

==Rugby league==
{{main|Rugby league match officials}}
In [[rugby league]], touch judges can communicate with the referee verbally or through a number of specific flag and hand signals. These indicate specific breaches of the laws, for example [[forward pass]], knock on and [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty]] offences, how play should restart and whether the ball was grounded correctly for a try. As in rugby union, touch judges stand behind the posts to confirm success of a penalty kick or the conversion of a try. Touch judge and referee signals and duties in [[rugby league]] are laid out in the laws of the game. In some matches, additional officials are used solely to determine whether a try has been correctly grounded. These are known as "in-goal" officials.

'''Tucker Stadium''' is a 16,500-seat [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Cookeville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Tucker Stadium-Cookeville, TN|publisher=stadiumjourney.com|url=http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/tucker-stadium-s1797/|accessdate=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to the [[Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles football|Tennessee Technological University Golden Eagles team]], and is named for former coach, Wilburn Tucker (1920&amp;ndash;1980).  The football field is named Overall Field in honor of former coach and administrator [[Preston Vaughn Overall|P.V. Overall]]. The stadium opened in 1966 and currently seats 16,500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttusports.com/inside_athletics/Facilities_Photos/Tucker_Stadium_Page Tucker Stadium: Home of Golden Eagles Football]," TTUSports.com. Accessed: 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Tucker Stadium has hosted the [[TSSAA]] high school football state championships since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ttusports.com/sports/fball/2012-13/releases/8_14_tssaa_until_2016 Champions Are Made Here: Tucker Stadium to Host TSSAA Through 2016], TTUSports.com, 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Renovations===
In 2007, Tucker Stadium received upgrades to its playing field with the installation of artificial turf, as well as renovations and a new surface to the nine-lane track.&lt;ref name="Upgrades1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tucker Stadium: Home of Golden Eagle Football|url=http://www.ttusports.com/inside_athletics/Facilities_Photos/Tucker_Stadium_Page|publisher=TTUSports.com|accessdate=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an upgraded lighting system was added to the stadium.&lt;ref name="Upgrades1"/&gt;

In 2009, additional facility upgrades were performed on the press box.&lt;ref name="Upgrades1"/&gt;

On August 21, 2017, Tennessee Technological University hosted a solar eclipse viewing party at Tucker Stadium, to view a [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|solar eclipse]] which was viewable in [[Solar eclipse#Terminology for central eclipse|totality]] on this day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg3kn1aQ2QI https://www.youtube.com] Eclipse Across America (Cookeville, TN: 0:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2018 football season, a new, large video scoreboard was installed.

'''U.S. Bank Stadium''' is an enclosed [[stadium]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]]. Built on the former site of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], the indoor stadium opened in 2016 and is the home of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL); it also hosts early season [[college baseball]] games of the [[University of Minnesota]] [[Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball|Golden Gophers]] ([[NCAA]]).

The Vikings played at the Metrodome from [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|1982]] until its closure in 2013; during construction, the Vikings played two seasons ([[2014 Minnesota Vikings season|2014]], [[2015 Minnesota Vikings season|2015]]) at the open-air [[TCF Bank Stadium]] on the campus of the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Metrodome Next|url=http://www.msfc.com/tour.cfm|publisher=[[Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission]]|accessdate=March 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210094221/http://www.msfc.com/tour.cfm|archivedate=February 10, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's first home was [[Metropolitan Stadium]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]] {{nowrap|([[1961 Minnesota Vikings season|1961]]–[[1981 Minnesota Vikings season|1981]]),}} now the site of the [[Mall of America]].

On June 17, 2016, U.S. Bank Stadium was deemed substantially complete by contractor Mortenson Construction, six weeks before the ribbon-cutting ceremony and official grand opening on July 22. Authority to use and occupy the stadium was handed over to the Vikings and the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority. The Vikings played their first pre-season game at U.S. Bank Stadium on August 28; the home opener of the regular season was in week two against the [[2016 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] on September 18, a 17–14 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibbs|first=Thom|title=Minnesota Vikings salute heroes old and new in US Bank stadium win over Green Bay Packers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/american-football/2016/09/19/minnesota-vikings-salute-heroes-old-and-new-in-us-bank-stadium-w/|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=September 19, 2016|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the first fixed-roof stadium built in the NFL since [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]], which opened in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. As of March 2015, the overall budget was estimated to be $1.061 billion, with $348 million from the state of Minnesota, $150 million from the city of [[Minneapolis]], and $551 million from the team and private contributions.&lt;ref name="Cost"/&gt;

U.S. Bank Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl LII]] on February 4, 2018,&lt;ref name="superbowllii"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Super Bowl LII Headed to Minnesota|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000352335/article/super-bowl-lii-headed-to-minneapolis|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ESPN]] [[X Games]] on July 19–22, 2018, and is expected to host the 2019 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]], and the 2020 [[NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships]].

==Design==
[[File:New Minnesota Stadium 13 April 2015.jpg|thumb|From directly east of the stadium: the southeast facade with doors and windows going in, as well as the northeast facade with part of its exterior wall up.]]
[[File:U.S. Bank construction 2 October 2015.jpg|alt=Architectural Form|thumb|US Bank Stadium under construction]]
[[File:US Bank Stadium interior - Minnesota Vikings orientation.jpg|alt=US Bank Norwegian Inspiration|thumb|Transparent roof and walls]]
While the Vikings' owners wanted an outdoor stadium, the state and local governments would only provide funding for an indoor stadium capable of hosting major events like the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]]. A retractable roof, the trend in 2010s football stadiums, would have been too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vikings Unveil Design of New Stadium|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9272021/minnesota-vikings-unveil-glass-centric-design-new-stadium|work=[[ESPN]]|date=May 14, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture firm [[HKS, Inc.]], also responsible for the [[Dallas Cowboys]]' [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] and the [[Indianapolis Colts]]' [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], decided to go for a lightweight translucent roof and glazed entrances with giant pivoting doors, aiming to get as much natural light from the outside as possible. The roof is made up of 60% Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ([[ETFE]]), a fluorine-based clear plastic, and is the largest in North America, spanning {{convert|240000|sqft}} supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]]. ETFE's low [[R-factor (crystallography)|R-factor]] and the roof's slanted design, inspired by [[Vernacular architecture in Norway|Nordic vernacular architecture]], allows the stadium to endure heavy snow loads. Snow accumulates in areas that are more safely and easily accessible, and also moves down the slanted roof into a heated gutter, the water from which drains to the nearby [[Mississippi River]].

The translucent roof and large wall panels also give fans a view of downtown Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=arch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/784289/us-bank-stadium-a-game-changing-multi-purpose-nfl-stadium|title=U.S. Bank Stadium: A Game-Changing, Multi-Purpose NFL Stadium |author=Quintal, Becky|date=March 26, 2016|work=Architecture Daily|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The glass operable wall panels will allow the stadium to experience some of the outdoor elements while providing protection from the snow, rain, and the cold winter weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=The Roof That Isn't There|first=Tim|last=Newcomb|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/sports/a19066/minnesota-viking-football-stadium-roof/|work=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is aligned northwest and the [[elevation]] at street level is approximately {{convert|840|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

===Bird fatalities===
Years before construction began on the stadium, local and national conservation groups - including the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] and the [[Audubon Society]] - requested a "bird-friendly" design of the stadium's exterior using slightly less transparent bird-safe glass.&lt;ref name=pbsbird&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/birds-perish-new-vikings-stadium|title=Flocks of birds perish by crashing into new Minnesota Vikings stadium|author=Thoet, Alison|work=PBS|date=March 1, 2017|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designers ignored the advice and instead used highly reflective glass for aesthetic reasons. The reflective glass, combined with the stadium lying along the [[Mississippi Flyway]] migration route, has resulted in a large number of bird deaths, double any other building in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=pbsbird /&gt; A "bird fatality study" being financed by the Vikings and the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority is expected to be completed in 2019. If changes are made, it will now cost about $10 million to replace the existing glass with bird-safe glass rather than the $1 million it would have added to the original construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/josh-peter/2018/01/30/site-super-bowl-2018-death-trap-birds-eagles-patriots-us-bank-stadium/1079934001/|title=Site of Super Bowl LII is a death trap for birds|author=Peter, Josh|date=January 30, 2018|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crystal Cathedral comparison===
The design for U.S. Bank Stadium has been compared to the [[Crystal Cathedral]] in [[Southern California|southern]] [[California]], which was created by architect [[Philip Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Bank Stadium Ugly on the Outside, Awesome on the Inside|first=John|last=Shipley|url=http://www.twincities.com/2016/07/19/vikings-us-bank-stadium-ugly-on-the-outside-better-interior/|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=August 12, 2016|accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypages.com/arts/what-nickname-should-we-give-us-bank-stadium-poll/393686251|title=What nickname should we give US Bank Stadium?

===Capacity===
[[File:US Bank Stadium (Southeast) - Sep. 5, 2015.jpg|alt=Sharp sloping angles|thumb|Dark facade side of stadium]]
The [[seating capacity]] is 66,860 for most games, slightly more than the Metrodome, and can be expanded to 73,000 for soccer, concerts, and special events, such as the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |title=New Vikings Stadium Facts and Figures|url=http://www.vikings.com/news/article-1/New-Vikings-Stadium-Facts-and-Figures/7b3cb5b4-0979-4e3a-b08a-12760787dd13|publisher=Minnesota Vikings|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Bank Stadium: What It cost and By the Numbers|first=Brian|last=Murphy|url=https://www.twincities.com/2016/07/31/u-s-bank-stadium-by-the-numbers/|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=July 31, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrodome lease==
The Vikings' lease with the [[Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission]] (MSFC), as signed by both parties in August 1979, kept them in the Metrodome until 2011.&lt;ref name=MPR112006&gt;{{cite news |title=Anoka County Walks Away From Vikings' Plan|first=Tom|last=Scheck|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/11/20/vikes/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=November 20, 2006|accessdate=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lease was considered one of the least lucrative among NFL teams; it included provisions where the commission owned the stadium, and the Vikings were locked into paying rent until the end of the 2011 season. For several years prior to the Metrodome's demolition, however, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission waived the team's nearly $4 million rent.&lt;ref name="MinnPost11/17/2009"&gt;{{cite news |title=As Interim Solution, Stadium Commission Offering New Deal to Keep Vikings in Dome|first=Jay|last=Weiner|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2009/11/17/13530/as_interim_solution_stadium_commission_offering_new_deal_to_keep_vikings_in_dome|newspaper=[[MinnPost]]|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings paid the MSFC 9.5% of their ticket sales; the commission "reserve[d] all rights to sell or lease advertising in any part of the Stadium," the team could not use the scoreboard for any ads, and the team did not control naming rights for the building. Though the Vikings received revenue from the sale of luxury suites during the [[Minnesota Twins]] baseball season (a contributing factor to the Twins leaving the Metrodome for [[Target Field]] in 2010), the commission controlled the limited parking and its revenue and paid the team 10% of all concession sales while retaining roughly 35% of concessions sold during Vikings games.&lt;ref name=CP010307&gt;{{cite news |title=Eye of the Beholder|first=G.

Wilf's Vikings began acquiring significant land holdings in the [[Downtown East, Minneapolis|Downtown East]] neighborhood around the Metrodome. In June 2007, the Vikings acquired four blocks of mostly empty land surrounding the ''Star Tribune'' headquarters from [[Avista Capital Partners]] (the [[private equity]] owner of the ''Star Tribune'') for $45 million; it is also believed the Vikings have first right of refusal to later buy the paper's headquarters building.&lt;ref name=Strib062107a&gt;{{cite news |title=Vikings, Star Tribune Close Land Deal|first=Paul|last=Levy|url=http://www.startribune.com/vikings/story/1258359.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=June 21, 2007|accessdate=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, the Vikings also acquired three other downtown parking lots for a total of $5 million, and have made a bid for a city-owned, underground parking ramp next to the neighborhood's [[U.S. Bank Stadium (Metro Transit station)|light rail station]].&lt;ref name="Strib062107a"/&gt;

==Proposal timeline==

===2007===
[[File:Stabbur in Figjan Numedal Norway drawing.jpg|alt=Roots of US Bank Stadium|thumb|Example of [[Vernacular architecture in Norway|Nordic vernacular architecture]], the style used for the design of the stadium roof]]
On April 19, 2007, the MSFC and the Vikings unveiled their initial plans for the stadium and surrounding urban area, with an estimated opening of 2012.&lt;ref name=Strib-Levy-041907&gt;{{cite news |title=Vikings Stadium: Great View, But Who Pays?|first=Paul|last=Levy|url=http://www.startribune.com/510/story/1131935.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan included substantial improvements to the surrounding area, including an improved light rail stop, 4,500 residential units, hotels with a combined 270 rooms, {{convert|1700000|sqft|m2}} of office space and substantial retail space.&lt;ref name="Strib-Levy-041907"/&gt;

As of 2007, the stadium would have held approximately 73,600 people and was to have been complete by August 2011. The initial proposal did not have the final architectural design renderings, but did include key features that were to have been included in any final plan, including the plans for neighboring urban development.  These included demands for a retractable roof, an open view of the surroundings (particularly the downtown skyline), a glass-enclosed Winter Garden alongside the already-existing adjacent Metrodome light-rail stop, leafy urban square with outdoor cafés and dense housing around its edges, aesthetic improvements to roads connecting the stadium to nearby cultural institutions, and adaptive reuse of neighboring historic buildings.&lt;ref name=Strib-features-041907&gt;{{cite news |title=The Plan's Key Ingredients|url=http://www.startribune.com/510/story/1132787.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof would have allowed Minneapolis to remain a potential venue for the [[Super Bowl]] and [[Final Four]], both of which had been held at the Metrodome. The proposed urban plan itself was received with cautious welcome.&lt;ref name=Strib-Peterson-041907&gt;{{cite news |title=Urban Planners See Sketches As First Step|first=David|last=Peterson|url=http://www.startribune.com/462/story/1131934.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 proposed cost estimate for the downtown Minneapolis stadium was $953,916,000.&lt;ref name=Strib-cost-041907&gt;{{cite news |title=Cost Comparison|url=http://www.startribune.com/510/story/1132738.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total broke down to $616,564,000 for the stadium, $200,729,000 for a retractable roof, $58,130,000 for parking, $8,892,000 for adjacent land right-of-way, and $69,601,000 to take into account inflation by 2010.&lt;ref name="Strib-cost-041907"/&gt;  The estimate compared to then-upcoming stadiums in [[Lucas Oil Stadium|Indianapolis]] at $675 million (retractable roof, completed 2008), [[Cowboys Stadium|Dallas]] at $932 million (retractable roof, completed 2009), and New York at $1.7 billion (open-air, completed in 2010).&lt;ref name="Strib-cost-041907"/&gt;  In addition, according to Wilf, taking into account the costs for the surrounding urban developments put forth in the proposal would have brought the estimated total to $2 billion.&lt;ref name="Strib062107a"/&gt;  The estimated costs were based on projected 2008 construction and material costs, so it would have been possible that the stadium costs could have hovered near $1 billion if the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] had not approved the project in the 2008 session.&lt;ref name=Strib062107b&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Could Cost $1 Billion|first=Paul|last=Levy|url=http://www.startribune.com/462/story/1260199.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=June 22, 2007|accessdate=November 14, 2017|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No proposals were made, at that time, for paying for the stadium.&lt;ref name="Strib-Levy-041907"/&gt;  The MSFC and Vikings made initial pitches to the Minnesota State Legislature during the end of the 2007 session, but expected to make serious efforts during the 2008 legislative session.&lt;ref name=paullevymaybe&gt;{{cite news|title=No Vikings Stadium Bill Now, But Next Year, Maybe?|first=Paul|last=Levy|url=http://www.startribune.com/vikings/story/1194481.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=May 19, 2007|accessdate=December 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523114341/http://www.startribune.com/vikings/story/1194481.html|archivedate=May 23, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vikings proposed creating a Minnesota Football Stadium Task Force, which they expect would take 24 months to plan the stadium.&lt;ref name="paullevymaybe"/&gt;

In December 2009, commission chairman Terwilliger said, "We know what the art of the possible is at this particular location."

===2010===
The 2010 Vikings stadium proposal was dealt a setback on May 5, 2010, when a Minnesota House panel defeated the proposal by a 10–9 vote.

The stadium debate was revived in the aftermath of the Metrodome's roof deflation on December 12, 2010, which forced the relocation of the Vikings' final two home games of the 2010 season and led to more calls for a new stadium from various sources in the local and national media.&lt;ref name=LAT12132010&gt;{{cite news |title=Metrodome Roof Collapse Had to Be a Sign From Above|first=Chris|last=Erskine|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/13/sports/la-sp-erskine-20101214|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 13, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT12142010&gt;{{cite news |title=With Their Dome Deflated, the Vikings Still Need a Home|first=Pat|last=Borzi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/sports/football/14dome.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota Governor [[Mark Dayton]] discussed the matter with NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], but said "any new stadium must first benefit the people of Minnesota".&lt;ref name=Dayton&gt;{{cite news |title=Dayton Meeting with NFL Commissioner|first=Mike|last=Kaszuba|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/blogs/112096334.html|newspaper=[[Star-Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010|quote=On December 26, 2010 the [[Zigi Wilf]] the Vikings owner agreed to accept an outdoor stadium.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minneapolis plan was for a fixed-roof stadium costing an estimated $895 million. The proposal also included funding solutions for $95 million in renovations to the [[Target Center]]. The team reacted with skepticism to the proposal and did not want to play at nearby 50,000-seat capacity [[University of Minnesota]] [[TCF Bank Stadium]] during the three years of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minneapolis Kicks Off $1 Billion Stadium 'Game Changer'|first1=Kevin|last1=Duchschere|first2=Rochelle|last2=Olson|first3=Steve|last3=Brandt|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/121518294.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Minneapolis dome site was a less expensive option, football fans were expected to return to the Minneapolis plan if the shortfall in the Ramsey County plan were not realized.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite news |title=Plenty of Doubts Ramsey County Can Pull off Stadium Deal|first=Brian|last=Lambert|url=http://www.minnpost.com/dailyglean/2011/05/11/28220/plenty_of_doubts_ramsey_county_can_pull_off_stadium_deal|newspaper=[[MinnPost]]|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ramsey County Proposal====
In May 2011, Ramsey County officials announced they had reached an agreement with the Minnesota Vikings to be the team’s local partner for a new stadium, subject to approval by the [[Minnesota Legislature]] and to approval of a sales tax by the [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] Board.&lt;ref name=Duchschere&gt;{{cite news |title=Ramsey County Vikings? $1 Billion Stadium Agreement Says Yes|first=Kevin|last=Duchschere|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/121580574.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=May 10, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the stadium would be the former [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant|Twin Cities Army Ammunitions Plant]] in [[Arden Hills, Minnesota|Arden Hills]], which is about 10 miles from the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] in Minneapolis and is a [[Superfund]] clean up site. The agreement called for an $884 million stadium and an additional $173 million for on-site infrastructure, parking and environmental costs.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news |title=Vikings, Ramsey Co.

Ramsey County said the Vikings would commit $407 million to the project, which would have been about 44% of the stadium cost and 39% of the overall cost. The county's cost would have been $350 million, to be financed by a half-cent sales tax increase.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; The state of Minnesota's cost would have been $300 million.&lt;ref name=Duchschere /&gt; This totalled about $1.057 billion, leaving at least a $131 million shortfall.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt;

===2012===
On March 1, 2012, Governor Dayton announced an agreement for a new stadium to be built on the site of the Metrodome, pending approval by the state legislature and the Minneapolis city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Gov.

On May 10, 2012, the [[Minnesota Legislature]] approved funding for a new Vikings stadium on that site. The project is projected to have a $975 million price tag, with the Vikings covering $477 million, the state covering $348 million, and $150 million covered by a hospitality tax in Minneapolis.

On May 13, 2013, the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA), the Minnesota Vikings, and HKS Sports &amp; Entertainment Group together unveiled the new stadium's design.

===2014===
In January 2014, a lawsuit was started by former [[Minneapolis mayoral election, 2013|Minneapolis mayoral candidate]] Doug Mann and two others to block the construction of the new stadium. The suit questioned the constitutionality of the stadium's funding plan and delayed a $468 million bond sale.

==Charitable gambling funding shortfall==
The State of Minnesota's portion of the cost of the stadium was to be funded by revenue from a proposed new charitable gambling source, which was dubbed electronic [[pull-tab|pulltabs]].  When the stadium funding bill was passed in the legislature and signed by the governor on May 14, 2012, the new revenue from the games was estimated to be $34 million for 2013, and rising each year thereafter.

===November 2012 revenue forecast===
Six months later, the first budget estimate from the Minnesota Office of Management and Budget was released, revising the projected revenue from the electronic pulltab games.  This first revision cut the estimated revenue from the game for 2013 by 51%, to $16 million (versus the legislation's estimate of $34 million).

From page 15 of the Minnesota Management and Budget Complete Forecast, November 2012:  "For FY 2013, the projected reserve balance has been reduced from $34 to $16 million.  Projected new gambling revenues from stadium legislation are expected to be $18 million (51%) below end of session estimates." "The forecast reduction reflects a slower than expected implementation of electronic gaming options and reduced estimates for daily revenue per gaming device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnesota Financial Report November 2012|url=http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/fu/12/complete-nov12.pdf|publisher=Minnesota Management and Budget|accessdate=April 28, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2013 revenue forecast===
In March 2013, the Minnesota Office of Management and Budget released another updated budget forecast for fiscal years 2013 to 2017. Included in this forecast was another revision in the projected revenue from charitable gambling sources, from the previous estimate of $16 million, down to $1.7 million, a further 90% reduction in the estimate for 2013 revenue. This total was a 95% reduction from what was estimated in the stadium bill passed in May 2012.

From page 12 of the Minnesota Management and Budget Complete Forecast, February 2013:  "The forecast for lawful gambling revenue has been reduced $15 million in FY 2013 and $46 million in FY 2014–15.  Slower than expected implementation of electronic gambling options and a reduction in estimates for daily revenue per gambling location were the reasons for the revenue reduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=February 2012 Forecast|url=http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/fu/12/complete-feb12.pdf|publisher=Minnesota Management and Budget|accessdate=April 28, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political fallout from projected shortfall===
As a result of the projected shortfall, members of the Minnesota Legislature and the Governor's office began discussing ideas to fix the shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time for a Plan B for Vikings Stadium Financing?|first=Richard|last=Meryhew|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/202045991.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature decided to impose an inventory tax on cigarettes to make up for any shortfall over the next year of construction and closing of a corporate income-tax loophole for the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vikings Stadium Backup-Funding Controversy: General Funds or Not|first=Doug|last=Grow|url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2013/05/vikings-stadium-backup-funding-controversy-general-funds-or-not|newspaper=[[MinnPost]]|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uptick in revenue===
The state reported in July 2016 that pulltab revenue is "soaring" and that there is optimism in Minneapolis about its continuing to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/taxes-to-pay-for-u-s-bank-stadium-rebound/387999002/|title=Taxes to pay for now-open U.S. Bank Stadium rebound, thanks to gamblers|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=August 31, 2016|quote=Tax revenues from pulltabs and other charitable gambling, the original source of money to cover the state’s contribution to the $1.1 billion public-private partnership — the largest in Minnesota history — are soaring.

In August 2012, the [[Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority]] (MSFA)—the stadium's newly created owner—received bids and plans from five architectural and engineering firms, all nationally recognized stadium designers, including [[Populous (company)|Populous]], [[AECOM]], [[EwingCole]], and [[HNTB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bids Are in on Vikings Stadium Project|first=Richard|last=Meryhew|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/168078086.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=August 31, 2012|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Architects Make Pitches for Vikings Stadium Contract|first=Tim|last=Nelson|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/09/07/sports/vikings-stadium-architects-make-pitches/|work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 2012, the MSFA selected the Dallas firm of [[HKS, Inc.]], which had designed both [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] and [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] within the previous decade, to serve as the project's architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dallas Firm Chosen to Design Viking Stadium|first=Richard|last=Meryhew|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/171776421.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=September 28, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HKS also designed [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]], home of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]; the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]’ [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and renovations to the [[Chicago White Sox]]’s [[Guaranteed Rate Field]]. Initial design plans were not immediately released to the public, but Viking officials said they hoped the budget would allow the new stadium to include a retractable roof, walls, or windows. The design team also planned to incorporate interactive technology into some elements to create a more engaging fan experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minnesota Vikings to Build New Stadium for Team, Fans, Community|first=Tracy|last=Keller|url=http://online.csp.edu/blog/sports/minnesota-vikings-to-build-new-stadium|publisher=[[Concordia University (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Concordia University]]|date=October 17, 2012|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the facility was originally slated to begin in October 2013, but was delayed until December 3, 2013, as an ongoing investigation of the Wilfs' finances continued to take place after a 21-year lawsuit against them came to a conclusion in late August. On August 27, 2015, one worker died and another was injured after falling during construction on the U.S. Bank Stadium roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1 Worker Dead, 1 Injured in Fall from Roof at Vikings Stadium|first1=Rochelle|last1=Olson|first2=Libor|last2=Jany|url=http://www.startribune.com/1-trapped-rescue-underway-on-roof-of-new-vikings-stadium/322946061/|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=August 27, 2015|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeramie M. Gruber, 35, of Northfield and the other injured worker were employed by St. Paul-based Berwald Roofing Co. which had been cited 6 times since 2010 for OSHA violations regarding improper fall protection for workers.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigated the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Bank Stadium Construction Update|url=http://www.vikings.com/media-vault/videos/US-Bank-Stadium-Construction-Update/30c133e1-c438-4892-9f29-8a563727969f|publisher=Minnesota Vikings|date=February 11, 2016|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, contractor Mortenson Construction and subcontractor Berwald Roofing faced fines of $173,400 for "serious" and "willful" safety violations. The reports do not provide an explanation of the accidents, but the largest fine, $70,000, and most serious alleged violation faults Berwald for willfully failing to have workers use proper fall protection while working at heights above 6 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Bank Stadium Contractor Mortenson, Subcontractor Face Fines of $173,000 in Death, Injury of Roof Workers|first=Rochelle|last=Olson|url=http://www.startribune.com/u-s-bank-stadium-contractor-mortenson-subcontractor-face-fines-of-173-000-in-death-injury-of-roof-workers/383200841/|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=June 16, 2016|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2015, the Vikings announced that [[U.S. Bank]] had acquired the [[naming rights]] to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Bank, Vikings Introduce "U.S. Bank Stadium" &amp; 'Places To Play' Program|url=http://www.vikings.com/news/new-stadium/article-1/US-Bank-Vikings-Introduce-US-Bank-Stadium--Places-To-Play-Program/531e4aa4-e705-4da7-b63a-d395cfcb06e4?campaign=social_20150615_47577276&amp;adbid=610555072053772288&amp;adbpl=tw&amp;adbpr=25545388|website=Vikings.com|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naming deal is worth $220 million over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: U.S. Bank to Get Naming Rights for Vikings Stadium|first=Howard|last=Sinker|url=http://www.startribune.com/report-u-s-bank-to-get-naming-rights-for-vikings-stadium/307386291/|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major events==
On May 20, 2014, the NFL awarded Minneapolis [[Super Bowl LII]], beating out bids by [[Indianapolis]] and [[New Orleans]] for the game.&lt;ref name="superbowllii"/&gt; On November 14, 2014, the [[NCAA]] announced the stadium will host the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|men's basketball Final Four]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minneapolis: New Vikings Stadium to Host Final Four in 2019|first=Josh|last=Verges|url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_26940006/minnesotas-chances-at-final-four-be-announced-today|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=November 14, 2014|accessdate=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Governor Mark Dayton announced a bid to host the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]] in 2020. However, on November 4, 2015, it was announced that the game was awarded to New Orleans. This was the first losing bid for a major sporting event offered to be held at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The first NFL game at the stadium was the Week 3 [[National Football League preseason|preseason game]] against the [[San Diego Chargers]] on August 28, 2016. Although the Vikings scored first with a field goal, the Chargers scored the first touchdown in the new stadium. The Vikings ultimately won, 23–10.

The first NFL regular season win at the stadium was on September 18, 2016 by the Vikings against the Green Bay Packers by a score of 17-14.
[[File:Super Bowl LII pregame.jpg|thumb|Inside U.S. Bank Stadium just before Super Bowl LII]]
The [[AMA Motocross Championship]] hosts a round at U.S. Bank Stadium since 2017. The Metrodome had last hosted an AMA Supercross round in 2013.

U.S. Bank Stadium hosted its first playoff game, an [[NFL Playoffs|NFC divisional]] game, on January 14, 2018, as the Vikings hosted the [[New Orleans Saints]]. The Vikings won the game 29-24 on a last second 61-yard catch by wide receiver [[Stefon Diggs]], in a play that became known as the [[Minneapolis Miracle]]. The Vikings then advanced to the NFC Championship game against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in Philadelphia’s [[Lincoln Financial Field]], where the Vikings lost 38-7, costing the Vikings the chance to become the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its own home stadium.

Super Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the [[New England Patriots]] with the Eagles winning 41-33 for their first Super Bowl win.

===Soccer===
The Vikings said the design includes a soccer field measuring 115 by 74 yards to accommodate a [[Expansion of Major League Soccer#Minneapolis|potential Major League Soccer expansion team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikings.com/stadium/new-stadium/faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=vikings.com|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Vikings received a five-year window to host a Major League Soccer team in the state's legislation to finance the stadium, and the Vikings ownership launched a bid to own an expansion franchise.&lt;ref name="minnesota united"&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: Minnesota United FC to Be MLS Franchise|first=Andy|last=Greder|url=http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_27707228/report-minnesota-united-fc-be-mls-franchise|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=March 14, 2015|accessdate=August 31, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525091032/http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_27707228/report-minnesota-united-fc-be-mls-franchise|archivedate=May 25, 2015|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Vikings Vice President Lester Bagley presented rendering of the stadium configured for a potential Major League Soccer team, with tarps and curtains covering the upper deck to bring the capacity down to 20,000. He said the stadium was "being built specifically with soccer in mind" and drew a contrast with [[Gillette Stadium]], [[New England Revolution]]'s home field, which he called "a football stadium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First Look: Renderings of Vikings Stadium Outfitted for Major League Soccer|first=Michael|last=Rand|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/284544091.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=December 3, 2014|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2015, the Vikings announced they ended their expansion bid after MLS informed them that they preferred the bid by [[Minnesota United FC|Minnesota United]] with its own plan for a smaller, outdoor stadium in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minnesota a Major Step Closer to Getting an MLS Team|first1=Dennis|last1=Brackin|first2=Rochelle|last2=Olson|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/296469491.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first soccer match at U.S. Bank Stadium was between [[AC Milan]] and [[Chelsea FC]] on August 3, 2016, as part of the [[2016 International Champions Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/testing-testing-us-bank-stadium-opens-for-first-packed-house/389068461/|title=First packed house puts U.S. Bank Stadium to the test|author=Olson, Rochelle|date=August 4, 2016|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021 the ECLA youth gathering will be held in the U.S. bank stadium from June 29 to July 3rd

===Baseball===
As with the Metrodome, the new stadium will have the capability to host baseball games in the winter months.  The [[Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball|University of Minnesota]] will play selected games, primarily during February and March, including hosting the Dairy Queen Classic, a non-conference series of games featuring top NCAA teams in Minnesota that was suspended during stadium construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/012216aaa.html|title=Minnesota Baseball Tours U.S. Bank Stadium|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's first baseball game was between [[Century College]] and [[Iowa Central Community College|Iowa Central]] on February 24, 2017. The University of Minnesota were scheduled to play the first baseball game at the new stadium, but converting it from Supercross to baseball took stadium officials longer than projected. Minnesota ended up playing [[Seattle Redhawks|Seattle University]] later on that same day as the third game at the stadium, first indoor home game for the university since the [[Metrodome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Christensen|first1=Joe|title=Take me into the ballgame: U.S. Bank Stadium makes its baseball debut|url=http://www.startribune.com/take-me-into-the-ballgame-u-s-bank-stadium-makes-its-baseball-debut/414677414/|accessdate=February 24, 2017|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerts===
As part of the opening weekend festivities for the stadium, two concerts were held: [[Country music|country]] artist [[Luke Bryan]] on August 19, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbankstadium.com/event/luke-bryan/|title=Luke Bryan - U.S. Bank Stadium|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]] performing the following night, August 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbankstadium.com/event/metallica/|title=Metallica - U.S. Bank Stadium|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], a Minneapolis native, was in preliminary talks to perform the first concert at the new stadium in August 2016, but he died on April 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/prince-was-in-talks-for-an-aug-13-concert-at-u-s-bank-stadium/378822271/|title=Prince was in talks for an Aug. 13 concert at U.S. Bank Stadium|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=May 10, 2016|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fencing==
{{main article|Fencing at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}
Venezuela sent a seven-person fencing team to Beijing, but they combined to win just two matches. Considering the team included the #1 ranked men's épée fencer, [[Silvio Fernández (fencer born 1979)|Silvio Fernández]], this was somewhat of a disappointment. Fernandez won his opening match, but then lost to a Hungarian opponent in the second round. The other win came from the men's épée team, who lost their quarterfinal, but won a placement match against Korea before ending up in 6th place overall.

{{main article|Softball at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}
The Venezuelan women's softball team qualified for the Olympics by winning the Pan-American qualifying tournament at home [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]]. At the Olympics, they initially struggled, losing their first three games by a combined score of 21-1, but then won two straight games without conceding a run, leaving them at 2-3 and in the hunt for a medal round place. However, they lost two difficult matches against eventual medal winners to close out the round robin, and fell one loss short of a medal round spot.

Venezuela won their first Olympic medal in Taekwondo in Athens, and though [[Adriana Carmona]], who won that medal, lost her first round match in Beijing, Venezuela was able to win another medal in 2008. [[Dalia Contreras]] won her first two matches to make the semifinals in the women's under 49&amp;nbsp;kg division, where she lost a tied match on a judges decision. Still, her semifinals appearance allowed her to progress directly to the bronze medal match, where she beat a Kenyan opponent to claim Venezuela's only medal of the 2008 Games. Overall, the four person Taekwondo team went 4-4, with three of the four wins from Contreras.

===Indoor===
Both Venezuelan volleyball teams won the South American Qualification tournament to earn their Olympic berths, but were less successful in Beijing. Between them, the two teams won just one out of ten matches, with the men's team beating Japan in straight sets. The men's team also forced a fifth set against both the American and Chinese teams, eventually finishing fifth in their group, while the women's team won only a single set and finished last in their group. The final ranking of the men's team was tied for 9th place, while that of the women's team was tied for 11th place.

{{main article|Weightlifting at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}
The top finish from a Venezuelan lifter in Beijing was a 9th from [[Judith Chacon]] in the 53&amp;nbsp;kg division, but this was last placed finish in a division with few entrants. The next best finish came from [[Israel José Rubio]] in the men's 69&amp;nbsp;kg division, where he finished 13th. Three of the seven Venezuelan lifters did not complete a valid lift in one of the portions of the competition, and thus did not finish with a legal total.

'''Yulman Stadium''' is the on-campus venue for [[American football|football]] at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. It currently has a capacity of 30,000 spectators, with 4,500 premium seats in two fan clubs - the Westfeldt Terrace and the Jill H. and Avram A. Glazer Family Club.&lt;ref name="amenities"/&gt; The stadium's first game and grand opening was the [[2014 Tulane Green Wave football team|2014 season]]'s home opener against its former [[Southern Conference|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Conference]] foe [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] on September 6, 2014.&lt;ref name="WDSU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Press release"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Tulane University Announces Fundraising Campaign for Stadium|url=http://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_120811_s.cfm|publisher=[[Tulane University]]|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Call It Yulman Stadium|url=http://tulaneathletics.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/newsletter16.pdf|publisher=Tulane Athletics|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunez"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tulane Plans to Build a 30,000-Plus Seat On-Campus Football Stadium|first=Tammy|last=Nunez|url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2011/12/tulane_plans_to_build_a_30000-.html|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|location=New Orleans|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yulman replaced the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] as the home stadium of [[Tulane Green Wave football]] after 39 seasons at that venue, and it is situated on the university's [[Tulane University#Uptown|Uptown campus]] between the [[Tulane Green Wave baseball|Tulane baseball team]]'s [[Greer Field at Turchin Stadium|Turchin Stadium]] and the former site of Tulane's last on-campus football stadium, [[Tulane Stadium]].&lt;ref name=Nunez/&gt; As of the 2017 season, the Green Wave are 10-14 all-time in games played in Yulman.

==Stadium features==
The stadium features two elevated club decks on the home side. The Jill H. and Avram A. Glazer Family Club is the premier club-level seating in the stadium, with 1,500 chair back seats, two club rooms, two bars, expanded concessions, and a large meeting space. The remainder of Yulman's premium seating is composed of 3,000 chair back seats in the Westfeldt Terrace, located directly above the Glazer Club and covered by a canopy. Westfeldt features a panoramic view of the New Orleans skyline and premium concessions, including traditional New Orleans dishes.&lt;ref name="amenities"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taste"&gt;{{cite web |title=In Yulman Stadium, Tulane strives for unique home, 'taste of New Orleans'|url=http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/sports/8820875-171/in-yulman-stadium-tulane-strives|author=Scott Kushner|publisher=The New Orleans Advocate|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale meeting space is located on the ground level for use year-round. The entry space in front of the stadium, known as the Athletes Plaza, is used for pre- and post-game activities. The field's end zones feature a green and white checkerboard pattern such as that in the original Tulane Stadium, as well as an alternating green pattern made to look similar to real, mown grass.&lt;ref name="turf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amenities"/&gt; Yulman holds a 94-by-24-foot LED video board, as well as two ribbon displays, all made by [[Daktronics]].&lt;ref name="taste"/&gt;&lt;ref name="video board"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tulane University Adds Daktronics Video Display System to Power Green Wave Football Fans|url=http://www.daktronics.com/news/Pages/Tulane-University-Adds-Daktronics-Video-Display-System.aspx|publisher=Daktronics Inc.|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Kern from [[Mardi Gras World]] created a float for use during pre-game parades, as well as a mural inside the Glazer Club.&lt;ref name="Glimpse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Media gets a glimpse of Yulman Stadium's interior and an update on construction and ticket sales Friday|url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2014/04/media_gets_a_glimpse_of_yulman.html|author=Tammy Nunez|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2016 season, Athletic Director Troy Dannen announced the addition of a 2,400-pound sculpture of the program's classic "Angry Wave" to the top of the scoreboard.

==History==
For some time, Tulane fans had felt chagrin at playing games at the Superdome. The stadium seated over 75,000 people for football, but in most cases, Green Wave football games were swallowed up by the environment.

University representatives initially named the stadium "Tulane Community Stadium" but revealed its official name in late 2012. Richard Yulman, the former chair/owner of [[Serta (company)|Serta]] and a member of the Board of Tulane, and his wife donated $15 million toward construction of the project, gaining naming rights to the stadium in the process. He later committed another $10 million to the project as a challenge to other donors to completely fund the project through private donations by the end of the first football season in the stadium.&lt;ref name="Yulman2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tulane gets another $10 million donation from Richard Yulman|first=Scott|last=Kushner|url=http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/sports/tulane/10194071-123/tulane-gets-another-10-million|newspaper=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The New Orleans Advocate]]|date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium’s playing surface was named Benson Field after [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[New Orleans Pelicans]] owner [[Tom Benson]] and his wife Gayle, who jointly donated $7.5 million from the Gayle and Tom Benson Charitable Foundation.&lt;ref name="Yulman"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tulane's New Venue Will Be Called Yulman Stadium|first=Tammy|last=Nunez|url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2012/11/tulane_stadium_will_be_called.html|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|location=New Orleans|date=November 1, 2012|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
