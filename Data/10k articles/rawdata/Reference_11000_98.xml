{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

'''4-1-1''' is the [[telephone]] number for local [[directory assistance]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

4-1-1 is also commonly referred to as "D.A.", "Directory Assistance", or "Information".

Approximately 6 billion calls are made to 4-1-1 within the United States every year.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

4-1-1 has been used since at least 1930&lt;ref&gt;New York Telephone Directory for Manhattan, 1930, on film at the NYPL&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Helpful information about your telephone service Manhattan 1940.jpg|New York Telephone Directory for Manhattan, 1940, page 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:SF Bay Phone Book 1938 Page 3.jpg|San Francisco Bay Telephone Book, 1938, page 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; and other large cities where [[Panel Switch|panel]] and [[Number One Crossbar Switching System|crossbar]] [[Telephone exchange|switching equipment]] installed by the [[Bell System]] was prevalent. However, in smaller Bell System cities and almost all areas served by [[GTE]] and other companies where [[Strowger switch|step-by-step]] equipment was the norm such as [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:LA Phone Book 1938 Title page.jpg|Telephone Directory Los Angeles Extended Area, 1938, title page]]&lt;/ref&gt; '''1-1-3''' was used until at least the 1960s, and in some cases (the Pacific Northwest, for example) until the mid-1980s.

Until the early 1980s, 4-1-1 and 1-1-3 calls were free in most states.

In the United States and Canada, Directory Assistance was historically a local function, and most companies updated listings at their directory assistance centers almost daily. Callers would dial 4-1-1 or 1-1-3 for fast, efficient, and accurate service. When [[long-distance calling|long-distance]] numbers were needed, prior to the full introduction of direct-dialed [[long-distance calling|long-distance]] service, callers would call either 4-1-1 or "0" (Operator) and request a free long-distance connection to the directory assistance center in the distant city.

In 1962, direct-dialed long-distance directory assistance became available. The number in cities with panel and crossbar switching equipment was [[area code]]-555-1212, whereas in cities with step-by-step equipment the number was 1-555-1212 (or 112-555-1212) for numbers not local but in the same area code and 1-[[area code]]-555-1212 (or 112-[[area code]]-555-1212) for numbers in other area codes. In some area codes, the directory assistance center was able to serve the entire area code, but in many, the operator in the principal city of the area code dialed would connect the caller onward to a more local directory assistance center for the most up-to-date information.

After the introduction of [[Competitive local exchange carrier|local exchange competition]], most telephone companies outsourced directory assistance service to nationwide call centers. This has blurred the distinction between 4-1-1 and 555-1212. For [[Modification of Final Judgment|regulatory reasons]], where telephone service is provided by traditional local-exchange carriers, the [[Local exchange carrier|local carrier]] will determine how to handle 411, the chosen local toll (intra-[[LATA]]) carrier will determine how to handle 555-1212 calls for area codes within the [[LATA]], and the chosen [[Interexchange carrier|long distance carrier]] for inter-[[LATA]]) calls will determine how to handle other [[area code]]-555-1212 calls. For service provided by cellular and [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] carriers where the customer does not have a choice of local toll or long distance carriers, all calls may be handled the same way.

In North America, all areas formerly using 1-1-3 have been converted to using 4-1-1, and 1-1- is now reserved for [[vertical service code]]s. Outside North America, "1-1-N" numbers are still in use, for these and other services. In most European countries, "1-1-N" numbers are related to emergency services and 112 is the European Unified Emergency Number.

4-1-1 is commonly used in the United States and Canada as a [[slang]] word for "information" or "gossip". In the 1982 "[[Jump to It (song)|Jump to It]]" by American recording artist [[Aretha Franklin]], for example, the lyric runs "We have a lot of fun, don't we, girl, dishin' out
The dirt on everybody and givin' each other the 411".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrolyrics.com/jump-to-it-lyrics-aretha-franklin.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The relationship between 4-1-1, 1-1-3, and long-distance dialing==
Direct-distance dialing (DDD) was first introduced in areas with common-control switching ([[Panel switch|panel]] and [[Number One Crossbar Switching System|crossbar]]) in the 1950s. These areas had used 4-1-1 for directory assistance, and because of the ability of common-control switching to analyze the initial digits of a number in a "[[sender]]" before routing the call, these areas did not require the dialing of an initial "1" to initiate a [[long-distance calling|long-distance]] call. There was no ambiguity, because the initial assignment of [[area code]]s always used either a "0" or a "1" as the second digit, and the second digit of local numbers was never a "0" or a "1" because of the use of two-letter plus 5-digit local numbering, with the letters only on digits 2-9 of the dial.

Areas with [[Strowger switch|step-by-step]] equipment processed the call one digit at a time as dialed by the caller, and thus needed a common prefix to distinguish long-distance dialing from local calls. The Bell System design choice was "1", but since "1-1-3" was in use for directory assistance, along with other "1-1-" codes ("Repair" was 1-1-4).,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlantatelephonehistory.info/part4.html&lt;/ref&gt; changes had to be made in the step-by-step areas. Initially, "1-1-2" was used temporarily as the prefix in most of these areas. To simplify [[long-distance calling]] it was desirable to change this to a "1". Some areas converted immediately to 4-1-1 for directory assistance and 6-1-1 for repair. Other areas retained 1-1-3 by installing what was known as "double-header" trunks, which actually connected the call to the long distance equipment and then "snatched it back" if the second digit was also a "1".

The conversion proceeded as follows in Springfield, Massachusetts:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Year !! Local D.A. !! L.D. Prefix !! Long Distance D.A.
|-
| 1961 || 1-1-3 || 1-1-2 || "0"&lt;ref&gt;Springfield District Telephone Directory, Apr 1961, available at the Springfield Museum&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 1962 || 4-1-1|| 1 || "0"&lt;ref&gt;Springfield District Telephone Directory, Apr 1962, ditto&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| 1963 || 4-1-1 || 1 || 1-555-1212 (for information outside Springfield but within 413)&lt;br&gt;1-[[area code]]-555-1212 (for information in other area codes)&lt;ref&gt;Springfield District Telephone Directory, Apr 1963, ditto&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

==Directory assistance data==

The services of [[directory assistance]] queries is often outsourced to a [[call centre]] who specializes in that function. Historically, when a single carrier provided most of the telephony services for a region, the data used to satisfy the search could exclusively come for that carriers subscriber rolls. Today, when the market is fragmented amongst many carriers, the data must be aggregated by a [[data aggregator]] specializing in directory listings, such as [http://www.lssidata.com LSSi]. The [[data aggregator]] distributes the data to the 4-1-1 services either on a "live" basis, actually servicing each query, or by periodically transferring large swaths of listings to the call center's systems for local searching.

The [[data aggregator]] collects the data from the rolls of many telecommunication carriers. Some carriers such as [[Vonage]] do not send their customer rolls to the aggregator. Their customers can get their listings in the directory assistance database using a free service such as [http://www.listyourself.net ListYourself.net].

==Landline telephone directory assistance==
4-1-1 landline service has been historically provided by local telephone companies, including those of the former [[Bell System]] or subsequent [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] (RBOCs). Telephone carriers since that time may provide the 4-1-1 calls to the customer free of charge and [use ad supported or a customer retention model][meaning unknown]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Metro_One_Telecommunications_(INFO)/Directory_Assistance_Market_Customers http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Metro_One_Telecommunications_(INFO)/Directory_Assistance_Market_Customers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1984 [[Bell System divestiture]], the [[RBOC]]s in the United States have priced 4-1-1 use higher to an average of $1.25 USD per call, compared to $0.50 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in most of Canada,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} providing opportunities for competing services in the United States, such as ad-sponsored [[1-800-FREE-411]].

==Wireless telephone directory==
In addition to the local and long distance directory services, there is also consumer-choice and privacy-protected "Wireless 411 Service". As specified by the industry, the service will give consumers the choice of including their wireless phone numbers in voice 411. Consumers who choose to opt in will not have their information disclosed for print, online directories, lists, or telemarketing firms. The service will allow any [[landline]] or wireless phone user to call 4-1-1 and be connected to the wireless listing of a person who has chosen to participate in the service. Carriers who make up the industry LLC creating the service include [[Alltel]] (now absorbed by [[Verizon Wireless]]), [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]], [[Sprint Nextel]] and [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]].

==Background==
{{Democracy movements in Burma}}

===Economic problems===
Before the crisis, Burma had been ruled by the repressive and isolated regime of General [[Ne Win]] since 1962. The country had a national debt of $3.5 billion and currency reserves of between $20 million and $35 million, with [[debt service ratio]]s standing at half of the national budget.&lt;ref&gt;Lintner (1989), pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1985, students gathered and [[boycott]]ed the government's decision to withdraw Burmese local currency notes. Economic problems coupled with [[counter-insurgency]] required continuous involvement in the international market.&lt;ref name=bou1&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 1987, Ne Win announced the withdrawal of the newly replaced currency notes, 100, 75, 35 and 25 [[Myanma kyat|kyats]], leaving only 45 and 90 kyat notes, apparently because only the latter two are numbers divisible by 9, considered lucky by Ne Win.&lt;ref name=p228&gt;Tucker (2001), pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Students were particularly angry at the government's decision as savings for tuition fees were wiped out instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Fong (2008), pp. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Students from the [[Yangon Technological University|Rangoon Institute of Technology]] (RIT) ran riot through [[Rangoon]], smashing windows and traffic lights down [[Insein Road]].&lt;ref&gt;Lwin (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Universities in Rangoon closed and sent students home. Meanwhile, larger protests in [[Mandalay]] involved monks and workers, with some burning government buildings and state businesses.&lt;ref name=bou2&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 193&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media of Burma|Burmese state media]] reported little on the protests, but information quickly spread through the students.&lt;ref name=bou2/&gt;

With the re-opening of schools in late October 1987, [[Resistance movement|underground groups]] in Rangoon and Mandalay produced [[dissident]] leaflets which culminated in bombs exploding in November.&lt;ref name=bou2/&gt; Police later received threatening letters from underground groups, who organised small protests around the university campus.&lt;ref&gt;Lintner (1989), pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; After securing [[Least Developed Countries|Least Developed Country]] status from the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] in December 1987, government policy requiring farmers to sell produce below market rates to create greater revenue for the government sparked several, violent rural protests.&lt;ref&gt;Yitri (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were fanned by public letters to Ne Win by former second in command General Brigadier [[Aung Gyi]] from July 1987, reminding him of the 1967 rice riots and condemning lack of economic reform, describing Burma as "almost a joke" compared to other Southeast Asian nations. He was later arrested.&lt;ref name=bou1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yawnghwe2&gt;Yawnghwe (1995), pp. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early democracy protests===
On 12 March 1988, students from the RIT were arguing with out-of-school youths inside the ''Sanda Win'' tea shop about music playing on a sound system.&lt;ref name=Yawnghwe1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bou2/&gt;  A drunken youth would not return a tape that the RIT students favoured.&lt;ref name=f1&gt;Fong (2008), pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt; A brawl followed in which one youth, who was the son of a BSPP official, was arrested and later released for injuring a student.&lt;ref name=bou2/&gt; Students protested at a local police department where 500 riot police were mobilised and in the ensuing clash, one student, [[Phone Maw]], was shot and killed.&lt;ref name=bou2/&gt; The incident angered pro-democracy groups and the next day more students rallied at the RIT and spread to other campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1999), pp. 1–14&lt;/ref&gt; The students, who had never protested before, increasingly saw themselves as [[student activism|activists]].&lt;ref name=bou2/&gt; There was growing resentment towards military rule and there were no channels to address grievances, further exacerbated by [[police brutality]], economic mismanagement and corruption within the government.&lt;ref name=Yawnghwe1/&gt;

By mid-March, several protests had occurred and there was open dissent in the army. Various demonstrations were broken up by using [[tear gas]] canisters to disperse crowds.&lt;ref name=p228/&gt; On 16 March, students demanding an end to one party rule marched towards soldiers at [[Inya Lake]] when riot police stormed from the rear, clubbing several students to death and [[Rape|raping]] others.&lt;ref&gt;Fong (2008) pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; Several students recalled the police shouting, "Don't let them escape" and "Kill them!".&lt;ref&gt;Fink (2001), pp. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ne Win resigns===
Following the latest protests, authorities announced the closure of universities for several months.&lt;ref name=f2&gt;Fong (2008), pp. 148&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1988, large demonstrations of students and sympathisers were a daily sight.&lt;ref name=f2/&gt; Many students, sympathisers and riot police died throughout the month as the protests spread throughout Burma from Rangoon. Large scale protests were reported in [[Pegu]], [[Mandalay]], [[Tavoy]], [[Toungoo]], [[Sittwe]], [[Pakokku]], [[Mergui]], [[Minbu]] and [[Myitkyina]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1999"&gt;Smith (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrators in larger numbers demanded [[multi-party]] democracy, which marked Ne Win's resignation on 23 July 1988.&lt;ref name=f2/&gt; In a valedictory address given that day, Win affirmed that "When the army shoots, it shoots to kill."&lt;ref name=p228/&gt; He also promised a [[multi-party system]], but he had appointed the largely disliked [[Sein Lwin]], known as the "Butcher of Rangoon"&lt;ref&gt;Fong (2008). In 1962, Lwin had ordered troops to fire on student protestors, killing dozens, and ordered the Union Building at Rangoon University to be blown up.&lt;/ref&gt; to head a new government.&lt;ref name=Yawnghwe2/&gt;

==Main protests==

===1–7 August===
[[File:Burma Socialist Programme Party flag.svg|200px|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]], the sole legal political party that ruled the country from 1962 to 1988.]]
Protests reached their peak in August 1988. Students planned for a nationwide demonstration on 8 August 1988, an auspicious date based on numerological significance.&lt;ref name=f3&gt;Fong (2008), pp. 149&lt;/ref&gt; News of the protest reached rural areas and four days prior to the national protest, students across the country were denouncing Sein Lwin's regime and Tatmadaw troops were being mobilised.&lt;ref name=f3/&gt; Pamphlets and posters appeared on the streets of Rangoon bearing the fighting [[peacock]] insignia of the All-Burma Students Union.&lt;ref name=bou4&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbourhood and strike committees were openly formed on the advice of underground activists, many of which were influenced by similar underground movements by workers and monks in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=bou4/&gt; Between 2 and 10 August, co-ordinated protests were occurring in most Burmese towns.&lt;ref&gt;Lintner (1989), pp. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, dissident newspapers were freely publishing, fighting-peacock banners were unfurled, synchronised marches were held and rally speakers were protected.&lt;ref name=bou4/&gt; In Rangoon, the first signs of the movement began around the [[Buddhist]] [[full moon]] of ''Waso'' at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] when student demonstrators emerged demanding support for the demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Lintner (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbourhood and strike committees barricaded and defended neighbourhoods and mobilised further demonstrations.&lt;ref name=bou4/&gt; In some areas, committees built makeshift stages where speakers addressed the crowds and brought donations to support rallies.&lt;ref name=vin1&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of National League for Democracy.svg|200px|thumb|right|The [[National League for Democracy|NLD]] Flag depicting a fighting peacock became a symbol of the protests on the streets of Burma.]]
In the first few days of the Rangoon protests, activists contacted lawyers and monks&lt;ref&gt;Boudreau (2004) Two groups considered to have large underground and internal support networks&lt;/ref&gt; in Mandalay to encourage them to take part in the protests.&lt;ref name=vin1/&gt; The students were quickly joined by Burmese citizens from all walks of life, including government workers, Buddhist [[monks]], air force and navy personnel, customs officers, teachers and hospital staff. The demonstrations in the streets of Rangoon became a focal point for other demonstrations, which spread to other states' capitals.&lt;ref name="ghosh"&gt;Ghosh (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 10,000 protesters alone demonstrated outside the [[Sule Pagoda]] in [[Rangoon]], where demonstrators burned and buried [[effigy|effigies]] of Ne Win and Sein Lwin in coffins decorated with demonetised bank notes.&lt;ref name=p228/&gt; Further protests took place around the country at stadiums and hospitals.&lt;ref name=mydans&gt;Mydans, Seth.

===8–12 August===
{{rquote |right|Across Burma, people poured out in thousands to join the protests – not just students but also teachers, monks, children, professionals, and trade unionists of every shade. It was on this day, too, that the junta made its first determined attempt at repression. Soldiers opened fire on the demonstrators and hundreds of unarmed marchers were killed. The killings continued for a week, but still the demonstrators continued to flood the streets.

A general strike, as planned, began on 8 August 1988. Mass demonstrations were held across Burma as ethnic minorities, [[Buddhist]]s, [[Muslims]], [[students]], [[workers]] and the young and old all demonstrated.&lt;ref name=p228/&gt; The first procession circled Rangoon, stopping for people to speak. A stage was also erected.&lt;ref name=vin1/&gt; Demonstrators from the Rangoon neighbourhoods converged in downtown Rangoon. Only one casualty was reported at this point as a frightened traffic policeman fired into the crowd and fled.&lt;ref name=vin1/&gt; (Such marches would occur daily until 19 September.)&lt;ref name=vin1/&gt; Protesters kissed the shoes of soldiers, in an attempt to persuade them to join the civilian protest, whilst some encircled military officers to protect them from the crowd and earlier violence&lt;ref&gt;Williams Jr., Nick.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bou5&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four days these demonstrations continued; the government was surprised by the scale of the protests and stated that it promised to heed the demands of the protesters "insofar as possible".&lt;ref name=mydans/&gt; Lwin had brought in more soldiers from insurgent areas to deal with the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mandalay Division]], a more organised strike committee was headed by lawyers and discussion focused on multi-party democracy and human rights. Many participants in the protests arrived from nearby towns and villages.&lt;ref name=bou6&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers who were particularly angry with the government's economic policies joined the protests in Rangoon. In one village, 2,000 of the 5,000 people also went on strike.&lt;ref name=bou6/&gt;

A short while later, the authorities opened fire on the protesters.&lt;ref name=fer313/&gt;&lt;ref name=p228/&gt; Ne Win ordered that "guns were not to shoot upwards," meaning that he was ordering the military to shoot directly at the demonstrators.&lt;ref name="ghosh"/&gt; Protesters responded by throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s, swords, knives, rocks, poisoned darts and bicycle spokes.&lt;ref name=p228/&gt; In one incident, protesters burned a police station and tore apart four fleeing officers.&lt;ref name=bou5/&gt; On 10 August, soldiers fired into Rangoon General Hospital, killing nurses and doctors tending to the wounded.&lt;ref name="Burma Watcher 1989, pp. 179"&gt;Burma Watcher (1989), pp. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; State-run Radio Rangoon reported that 1,451 "[[looters]] and disturbance makers" had been arrested.&lt;ref name=Yawnghwe2/&gt;

Estimates of the number of casualties surrounding the 8-8-88 demonstrations range from hundreds to 10,000;&lt;ref name=fer313/&gt;&lt;ref name=fog/&gt;&lt;ref name=win/&gt; military authorities put the figures at about 95 people killed and 240 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vancouver Sun'' 17 August 1988. pg. A.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===13–31 August===
Lwin's sudden and unexplained resignation on 12 August left many protestors confused and jubilant. Security forces exercised greater caution with demonstrators, particularly in neighbourhoods that were entirely controlled by demonstrators and committees.&lt;ref name=bou5/&gt; On 19 August, under pressure to form a civilian government, Ne Win's biographer, Dr. [[Maung Maung]] was appointed as head of government.&lt;ref&gt;Fink (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Maung was a legal scholar and the only non-military individual to serve in the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]].&lt;ref name=f3/&gt; The appointment of Maung briefly resulted in a subsidence of the shooting and protests.
[[File:8888 navy protest.jpg|280px|thumb|left|[[Myanmar Navy|Burmese Navy]] personnel demonstrating]]

Nationwide demonstrations resumed on 22 August 1988. In Mandalay, 100,000 people protested, including Buddhist monks and 50,000 demonstrated in [[Sittwe]].&lt;ref name=f3/&gt; Large marches took places from [[Taunggyi]] and [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmein]] to distant ethnic states (particularly where military campaigns had previously taken place),&lt;ref&gt;Fink (2001), pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; where red, the symbolic colour for democracy was displayed on banners.&lt;ref name=f3/&gt; Two days later, doctors, monks, musicians, actors, lawyers, army veterans and government office workers joined the protests.&lt;ref name=fong7&gt;Fong (2008), pp. 150&lt;/ref&gt; It became difficult for committees to control the protests. During this time, demonstrators became increasingly wary of "suspicious looking" people and police and army officers. On one occasion, a local committee mistakenly beheaded a couple thought to have been carrying a bomb.&lt;ref name=bou208&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents like these were not as common in Mandalay, where protests were more peaceful as they were organised by monks and lawyers.&lt;ref name=bou208/&gt;

On 26 August, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who had watched the demonstrations from her mother's bedside,&lt;ref&gt;Clements (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; entered the political arena by addressing half a million people at Shwedagon Pagoda.&lt;ref name=fong7/&gt; It was at this point that she became a symbol for the struggle in Burma, particularly in the eyes of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1999), pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Kyi, as the daughter of [[Aung San]], who led the independence movement, appeared ready to lead the movement for democracy.&lt;ref name="silverstein"&gt;Silverstein (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Kyi urged the crowd not to turn on the army but find peace through [[non-violent]] means.&lt;ref&gt;Fink (2001), pp. 60&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in time for many in Burma, the uprising was seen as similar to that of the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=Yawnghwe2/&gt;

Around this time, former Prime Minister [[U Nu]] and retired Brigadier General Aung Gyi also re-emerged onto the political scene in what was described as a "democracy summer" when many former democracy leaders returned.&lt;ref name="Smith 1999"/&gt; Despite the gains made by the democracy movement, Ne Win remained in the background.

===September===

During the September congress of 1988, 90% of party delegates (968 out of 1080) voted for a multi-party system of government.&lt;ref name=fong7/&gt; The BSPP announced they would be organising an election, but the opposition parties called for their immediate resignation from government, allowing an interim government to organise elections. After the BSPP rejected both demands, protesters again took to the streets on 12 September 1988.&lt;ref name=fong7/&gt; Nu promised elections within a month, proclaiming a provisional government. Meanwhile, the police and army began fraternising with the protesters.&lt;ref name=t229&gt;Tucker (2001), pp. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had reached an impasse relying on three hopes: daily demonstrations to force the regime to respond to their demands, encouraging soldiers to defect and appealing to an international audience in the hope that United Nations or United States troops would arrive.&lt;ref&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Tatmadaw did defect, but only in limited numbers, mostly from the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan (1999), pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Solarz]] who had experienced the recent democracy protests in the [[Philippines]] and [[South Korea]] arrived in Burma in September encouraging the regime to reform, which echoed the policy of the [[Government of the United States|United States government]] towards Burma.&lt;ref&gt;United States State Department, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-September, the protests grew more violent and lawless, with soldiers deliberately leading protesters into skirmishes that the army easily won.&lt;ref name=b210&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters demanded more immediate change, and distrusted steps for incremental reform.&lt;ref&gt;Maung (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 1988, the military retook power in the country. General [[Saw Maung]] repealed the 1974 constitution and established the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC), "imposing more Draconian measures than Ne Win had imposed."&lt;ref&gt;Delang (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; After Maung had imposed martial law, the protests were violently broken up. The government announced on the state-run radio that the military had assumed power in the people's interest, "in order to bring a timely halt to the deteriorating conditions on all sides all over the country."&lt;ref&gt;Ferrara (2003), pp. 313–4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tatmadaw]] troops went through cities throughout Burma, indiscriminately firing on protestors.&lt;ref name=fer/&gt;

Although an exact body count has not been determined as bodies were often cremated, it is estimated that within the first week of securing power, 1,000 students, monks, and schoolchildren were killed, and another 500 were killed whilst protesting outside the United States embassy&lt;ref name="Burma Watcher 1989, pp. 179"/&gt; – footage caught by a cameraman nearby who distributed the footage to the world's media.&lt;ref name=f151&gt;Fong (2008), pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Maung described the dead as "looters".&lt;ref name=f151/&gt; Protestors were also pursued into the jungle and some students took up training on the country's borders with [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=b210/&gt;

By the end of September, there were around 3,000 estimated deaths and unknown number of injured,&lt;ref name=b210/&gt; with 1,000 deaths in Rangoon alone.&lt;ref name=fer&gt;Ferrara (2003), pp. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point in time, Aung San Suu Kyi appealed for help.&lt;ref name=t229/&gt; On 21 September, the government had regained control of the country,&lt;ref name=fer/&gt; with the movement effectively collapsing in October.&lt;ref name=t229/&gt; By the end of 1988, it was estimated that 10,000 people – including protesters and soldiers, had been killed.

==Aftermath==

Many in Burma believed that the regime would have collapsed had the United Nations and neighbouring countries refused recognition to the coup.&lt;ref&gt;Yawnghwe (1995), pp. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Western governments and Japan cut aid to the country.&lt;ref name=f151/&gt; Among Burma's neighbours, [[India]] was most critical; condemning the suppression, closing borders and setting up refugee camps along its border with Burma.&lt;ref&gt;Europa Publications Staff (2002), pp. 872&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, 6,000 [[National League for Democracy|NLD]] supporters were detained in custody and those who fled to the ethnic border areas, such as [[Kawthoolei]], formed groups with those who wished for greater [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Fong (2008), pp.152.&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated 10,000 had fled to mountains controlled by ethnic insurgents such as the [[Karen National Liberation Army]], and many later trained to become soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1999), pp. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1999), pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the uprising, the SLORC embarked on "clumsy propaganda" towards those who organised the protests.&lt;ref name=b190&gt;Boudreau (2004), pp. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence Chief [[Khin Nyunt]], gave [[English-language]] press conferences aimed at providing an account favourable to the SLORC towards foreign diplomats and media.&lt;ref name=b190/&gt;&lt;ref name=l52&gt;Lintner (1990), pp. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burmese media]] underwent further restriction during this period, after reporting relatively freely at the peak of the protests. In the conferences, he detailed a conspiracy of [[Right-wing politics|the right]] acting with "subversive foreigners" of plotting to overthrow the regime and a conspiracy of [[Left-wing politics|the left]] acting to overthrow the State.&lt;ref name=b190/&gt; Despite the conferences, few believed the government's theory.&lt;ref name=b190/&gt; While these conferences were ongoing, the SLORC was secretly negotiating with [[Mutiny|mutineers]].&lt;ref name=l52/&gt;

Between 1988 and 2000, the Burmese government established 20 museums detailing the military's central role throughout [[History of Burma|Burma's history]] and increased its numbers from 180,000 to 400,000.&lt;ref name=t229/&gt; Schools and universities remained closed to prevent any further uprisings.&lt;ref name=t229/&gt; [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[U Tin Oo]] and [[Aung Gyi]] initially publicly rejected the SLORC's offer to hold elections the following year, claiming that they could not be held freely under military rule.&lt;ref&gt;Mydans, Seth.

==Significance==
Today, the uprising is remembered and honoured by Burmese [[expatriate]]s and citizens alike. There is also support for the movement amongst students in [[Thailand]], which is commemorated every 8 August since.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation. (9 August 1997). [https://archive.is/20120713150359/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Av4JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AjIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6445,3383710&amp;dq= Burmese exiles mark protest]. ''[[The Nation (Thailand)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 20th anniversary of the uprising, 48 activists in Burma were arrested for commemorating the event.&lt;ref&gt;*Tun, Aung Hla. (8 August 2008). [http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/08/08/asia/OUKWD-UK-MYANMAR.php Myanmar arrests "8-8-88" anniversary marchers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108142207/http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/08/08/asia/OUKWD-UK-MYANMAR.php |date=8 January 2009 }}. ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The event garnered much support for the Burmese people internationally. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120161032/http://www3.soros.org/burma/Voices88/poems88.html Poems] were written by students who participated in the protests. The [[1995 in film|1995 film]] ''[[Beyond Rangoon]]'' is based on a true story that took place during the uprising.

The uprising led to the death and imprisonment of thousands of individuals. Many of the deaths were inside the prisons, where prisoners of conscience were subjected to inhumane torture and deprived of basic provisions, such as food, water, medicine, and sanitation. From 1988 up until 2012, the military and police illegally detained and imprisoned tens of thousands of democracy leaders, as well as intellectuals, artists, students, and human rights activists. [[Pyone Cho]], one of the leaders of the uprising, spent 20 years of his adult life in prison. [[Ko Ko Gyi]], another leader of the uprising, spent 18 years of his life in prison. [[Min Ko Naing]] was placed in solitary confinement for nine years for his role as a leader of the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moe|first1=K Z|title=The last night in the cell|url=http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=22898|accessdate=May 30, 2016|publisher=The Irrawaddy|date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the uprising began as a student movement, many of the individuals targeted, tortured, and killed by the police and military were high school and university students.

Many of the student leaders of the uprising became lifelong activists and human rights leaders. Many of the same activists played a role 19 years later during the [[2007 Saffron Revolution]]. The [[88 Generation Students Group]], named for the events of 8 August 1988, organised one of the first protests that eventually culminated in the Saffron Revolution. They were arrested, however, prior to large-scale demonstrations and given lengthy prison sentences of up to 65 years. Included in these arrests are prominent figures such as [[Min Ko Naing]], [[Mya Aye (activist)|Mya Aye]], [[Htay Kywe]], [[Mie Mie]], [[Ko Ko Gyi]], Pyone Cho, Min Zeyar, Ant Bwe Kyaw, and [[Nilar Thein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Harsh sentences for Burma rebels |author=Jonathan Head |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7721589.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=17 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511161211/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7721589.stm| archivedate= 11 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not an 88 Generation Students Group member, a solo protester [[Ohn Than]] also joined the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aappb.org/release42.html |title=A former political prisoner was arrested for protesting alone in front of the United Nations office in Rangoon |date=23 September 2004 |publisher=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602200853/http://www.aappb.org/release42.html |archivedate=2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were released in a [[Reforms in Burma|general amnesty]] in 2012. They continue to work as politicians and human rights activists in Myanmar. They also campaigned for the [[National League for Democracy]] in the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 Elections]]. Pyone Cho, one of the main leaders of the 88 Generation, was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]] in the 2015 Election.

&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with [[ARP4754]], ARP4761 is used to demonstrate compliance with  14&amp;nbsp;CFR&amp;nbsp;25.1309 in the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) [[airworthiness]] regulations for [[transport category]] [[aircraft]], and also harmonized international airworthiness regulations such as [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) CS&amp;ndash;25.1309.

This Recommended Practice defines a process for using common modeling techniques to assess the safety of a system being put together. The first 30 pages of the document covers that process. The next 140 pages give an overview of the modeling techniques and how they should be applied. The last 160 pages give an example of the process in action.

Some of the methods covered:
*[[Hazard analysis|Functional Hazard Assessment]] (FHA)
*Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA)
*System Safety Assessment (SSA)
*[[Fault Tree Analysis]] (FTA)
*[[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis]] (FMEA)
*Failure Modes and Effects Summary (FMES)
*Common Cause Analysis (CCA), consisting of:
**[[zonal safety analysis|Zonal Safety Analysis]] (ZSA)
**Particular Risks Analysis (PRA)
**[[Common mode failure|Common Mode]] Analysis (CMA)

== Safety life cycle ==
The general flow of the safety life cycle under ARP4761 is:
# Perform the aircraft level FHA in parallel with development of aircraft level requirements.
# Perform the system level FHA in parallel with allocation of aircraft functions to system functions, and initiate the CCA.
# Perform the PSSA in parallel with system architecture development, and update the CCA.
# Iterate the CCA and PSSA as the system is allocated into hardware and software components.
# Perform the SSA in parallel with system implementation, and complete the CCA.
# Feed the results into the certification process.

The Functional Safety process is focused on identifying functional failure conditions leading to hazards. Functional Hazard Analyses / Assessments are central to determining hazards. FHA is performed early in aircraft design, first as an Aircraft Functional Hazard Analysis (AFHA) and then as a System Functional Hazard Analysis (SFHA). Using qualitative assessment, aircraft functions and subsequently aircraft system functions are systematically analyzed for failure conditions, and each failure condition is assigned a hazard classification. Hazard classifications are closely related to Development Assurance Levels (DALs) and are aligned between ARP4761 and related aviation safety documents such as ARP4754A, 14&amp;nbsp;CFR&amp;nbsp;25.1309, and [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA)]] standards [[DO-254]] and [[DO-178B]]. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Hazard Classification !! Development Assurance Level !! Maximum Probability per Flight Hour
|-
| Catastrophic || A || 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Hazardous || B || 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Major || C || 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Minor || D || --
|-
| No Effect || E || --

|}

FHA results are normally shown in spreadsheet form, with columns identifying function, failure condition, phase of flight, effect, hazard classification, DAL, means of detection, aircrew response, and related information. Each hazard is assigned a unique identifier that is tracked throughout the entire safety life cycle. One approach is to identify systems by their ATA system codes and the corresponding hazards by derivative identifiers. For example, the thrust reverser system could be identified by its ATA code 78-30. Untimely deployment of thrust reverser would be a hazard, which could be assigned an identifier based on ATA code 78-30.

FHA results are coordinated with the system design process as aircraft functions are allocated to aircraft systems. The FHA also feeds into the PSSA, which is prepared while the system architecture is developed.

The PSSA may contain qualitative FTA, which can be used to identify systems requiring redundancy so that catastrophic events do not result from a single failure (or dual failure where one is latent). A fault tree is prepared for each SFHA hazard rated hazardous or catastrophic. Fault trees may be performed for major hazards if warranted. DALs and specific safety design requirements are imposed on the subsystems. The safety design requirements are captured and traced. These may include preventive or mitigation strategies selected for particular subsystems. The PSSA and CCA generate separation requirements to identify and eliminate common mode failures. Subsystem failure rate budgets are assigned so that hazard probability limits can be met.

The CCA consists of three separate types of analyses which are designed to uncover hazards not created by a specific subsystem component failure. The CCA may be many separate documents, may be one CCA document, or may be included as sections in the SSA document. The Particular Risk Analysis (PRA) looks for external events which can create a hazard such as a birdstrike or engine turbine burst. The Zonal Safety Analysis (ZSA) looks at each compartment on the aircraft and looks for hazards that can affect every component in that compartment, such as loss of cooling air or a fluid line bursting. The Common Mode Analysis (CMA) looks at the redundant critical components to find failure modes which can cause all to fail at about the same time. Software is always included in this analysis as well as looking for manufacturing errors or "bad lot" components. A failure such as a bad resistor in all flight control computers would be addressed here. The mitigations for CMA discoveries is often DO-254 or DO-178B components.

The SSA includes quantitative FMEA, which is summarized into FMES. Normally FMES probabilities are used in quantitative FTA to demonstrate that the hazard probability limits are in fact met. Cutset analysis of the fault trees demonstrates that no single failure condition will result in a hazardous or catastrophic event. The SSA may include the results of all safety analysis and be one document or may be many documents. An FTA is only one method for performing the SSA. Other methods include dependence diagram or [[reliability block diagram]] and [[Markov chain|Markov Analysis]].

The PSSA and CCA often result in recommendations or design requirements to improve the system. The SSA summarizes the residual risks remaining in the system and should show all hazards meet the 1309 failure rates.

The ARP4761 analyses also feed into Crew Alerting System (CAS) message selection and the development of critical maintenance tasks under ATA MSG3.

== Future changes ==

In 2004, SAE Standard Committee S-18 began working on Revision A to ARP4761. When released, [[EUROCAE]] plans to jointly issue the document as ED&amp;ndash;135.

MacDonald believes this advantage has been used by a number of Jews to advance Jewish group interests and end potential [[antisemitism]] by either deliberately or inadvertently undermining the power and self-confidence of the [[white people|European-derived]] majorities in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name="understanding1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toqonline.com/archives/v3n2/TOQv3n2MacDonald.pdf |format=PDF |title=Understanding Jewish Influence I: Background Traits For Jewish Activism |author=MacDonald, Kevin |website=Toqonline.com |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="understanding2"&gt;*Kevin MacDonald:''[http://www.toqonline.com/archives/v3n3/TOQv3n3MacDonald.pdf Understanding Jewish Influence II: Zionism and the Internal Dynamics of Judaism]''.

An '''artillery museum''' is a [[museum]] exhibiting the history and artifacts of [[artillery]]. In addition to actual or replica ordnance ([[guns]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], [[ammunition]], etc.), exhibits can include photographs, maps, models, dioramas, clothing and equipment used by gunners.

Artillery museums may be owned by national, regional or local governments or entities, or by private associations. They may display their equipment only statically or in working order (e.g.: [[self-propelled gun]]s).

Some museums have sets of periodicals, technical manuals, photographs and personal archives. These are often made available to researchers for use in writing articles or books, or to restoration specialists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1180">The '''Bermuda Admiralty Case''' occurred in 1861 during the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Confederate agents in [[Liverpool]], [[England]] were loading a British steamer, the Bermuda, with munitions for the [[Confederate Army]] when United States Minister [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] learned of it, and notified [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]]. Russell replied that the Crown [[Admiralty]] law officers found the [[evidence]] insufficient to warrant interference; their [[law]] applied only to the equipment of vessels to be used as transports or [[cruiser]]s, and not to the nature of the [[cargo]]. The ''Bermuda'' sailed, and safely ran the blockade into [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].

The '''Big Bethel AME Church''' is the oldest African-American congregation in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta]], Georgia, and according to AME historical documents, it is the mother church of AME in North Georgia. It is located at 220 [[Auburn Avenue]] NE in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood. It is the "first" church on the North Atlanta District, in the Atlanta-North Georgia Annual Conference of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=bb&gt;[http://www.bigbethelame.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 "About Bethel", Big Bethel AME website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Bethel was founded in 1847 as Union Church in the town of Marthasville, Georgia. Marthasville became Terminus, and finally Atlanta, and Union Church became Bethel Church, then Bethel Tabernacle.{{cn|date=July 2012}} At the close of the Civil War, the AME Church spread rapidly throughout the former Confederacy, and the Bethel Tabernacle allied herself with the denomination, becoming Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her first pastor was Rev. Joseph Woods.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

In 1879, the first public school for blacks in Atlanta, Gate City Colored School, was founded in the basement of the church, though it would later move to Houston Street.{{cn|date=July 2012}} [[Morris Brown College]] held its first classes here in 1881 before moving to its first campus. Big Bethel was known as "[[Sweet Auburn]]'s City Hall." In 1911, President [[William Howard Taft]] spoke here, as did [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

It was heard in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Budlender AJ on June 6, 2001, with judgment handed down June 12. S. Joseph SC appeared for the applicants and A. Kemack for the first respondent. There was no appearance for the second respondent.

In terms of section 29(1) of the Close Corporations Act,&lt;ref&gt;Act 69 of 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; only natural persons are permitted to be members of a close corporation, subject to certain exceptions in section 29(2)(b) and (c). In terms of s 29(2)(c), "a natural or juristic person, ''nomine officii'' who, in the case of a member who is insolvent, deceased, mentally disordered or otherwise incapable or incompetent to manage his affairs, is a trustee of his insolvent estate or an administrator, executor or curator in respect of such member or is otherwise a person who is his duly appointed or authorised legal representative" qualifies for membership.

In the present case, in which a member of a close corporation was deceased, the executor of the deceased's estate qualified for membership of the corporation. The court found, however, on the plain meaning of the Act, that an executor may hold a member's interest in a close corporation only if the deceased held that member's interest at the time of his death: Only an executor of a deceased estate where the deceased was a member of the close corporation in question falls within the exception in s 29(2)(c).&lt;ref&gt;1271I, 1272A-B, 1272F-G.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''broadside''' is a large sheet of paper printed on one side only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilab.org/eng/glossary/90-broadside.html ILAB: ''Definition of term: Broadside''] Retrieved 2011-07-06&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, broadsides were used as posters, announcing events or proclamations, commentary in the form of ballads, or simply advertisements.

==Description and history==
The historical type of broadsides, designed to be plastered onto walls, were [[ephemera]], i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. They were one of the most common forms of printed material between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in Britain, Ireland and North America. They were often [[advertisement]]s, but could also be used for news information or [[proclamation]]s.

Broadsides were a very popular medium for printing topical ballads starting in the 16th century. [[Broadside (music)|Broadside ballads]] were printed on thin sheets of paper and sold in the [[Victorian era]] [[London]] for a [[penny]] or half-penny. Broadsides were generally folded twice to make small pamphlets or [[chapbook]]s. Collections of songs in chapbooks were known as garlands. Broadside ballads lasted longer in Ireland, and although never produced in such huge numbers in North America, they were significant in the eighteenth century and provided an important medium of propaganda, on both sides, in the [[American War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Savelle, Seeds of liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind (Kessinger Publishing, 2005), p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadsides were commonly sold at [[public execution]]s in the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries. These were often produced by printers who specialised in them. They were typically illustrated by a crude picture of the crime, a portrait of the criminal, or a generic [[woodcut]] of a hanging taking place. There would be a written account of the crime and of the trial and often the criminal's confession of guilt. A [[Doggerel|doggerel verse]] warning others to not follow the executed person's example, to avoid their fate, was another common feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://broadsides.law.harvard.edu/ | title=Dying Speeches and Bloody Murders: Crime Broadsides Collected by Harvard Law School Library | publisher=Harvard University Law School Library | accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the advent of [[newspaper]]s and inexpensive [[novel]]s resulted in the demise of the street literature broadside.

One classic example of a broadside used for proclamations is the [[Dunlap broadside]], which was the first publication of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], printed on the night of July 4, 1776 by [[John Dunlap]] of [[Philadelphia]] in an estimated 200 copies.&lt;ref name=25copies&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/07/04/opinion/04opart.ready.html Illustration] for Widmer, Ted, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/opinion/04widmer.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Looking for Liberty"], oped{{clarify|date=July 2016}} commentary article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 4, 2008, accessed July 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a broadside used for news information is the first published account of [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|George Washington crossing the Delaware]], printed on December 30, 1776 by John Dunlap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040225165345/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbpe&amp;fileName=rbpe00/rbpe000/00000200/rbpe00000200.db&amp;recNum=1&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/rbpebib:@field(NUMBER+@band(rbpe+00000200))&amp;linkText=0 Library of Congress – An American Time Capsule, "Congress received the following intelligence..."] Retrieved 2011-07-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, broadside printing is done by many smaller printers and publishers as a fine art variant, with poems often being available as broadsides, intended to be framed and hung on the wall. Broadsides pasted on walls are still used as a form of mass communication in [[Haredi]] Jewish communities, where they are known by the Yiddish term "[[pashkevil]]" ([[pasquil]]), even if they are not attacks or lampoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1132475714075&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter |work=Jerusalem Post |title=The writing on the wall |author=Rena Rossner |date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Collaborative Cataloging''' is 
shared action of a group making bibliographic records available to its participants in order to prevent duplication of bibliographic records.  Thus, cooperative cataloging has benefits such as cost effectiveness and availability of a ready cataloging model&lt;ref&gt;David Banush (2010): Cooperative Cataloging at the Intersection of Tradition and Transformation: Possible Futures for the Program for Cooperative Cataloging, Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly, 48:2-3, 247-257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah E. Thomas PhD &amp; Jennifer A. Younger PhD (1994): Cooperative Cataloging:, Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly, 17:3-4, 237-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example of collaborative cataloging takes place at the [[National Transportation Library]] or NTL, which is administered by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]. NTL participates in a consortium called the National Transportation Knowledge Network (TKN), “which was establishe[d]… to help facilitate access to information in support of transportation development".&lt;ref&gt;http://ntl.bts.gov/networking/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Midwest Transportation Knowledge Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuing that goal, the TKN engages in cooperative cataloging with other transportation libraries.  For example, in early summer 2011, the TKN held a meeting on cataloging standards that are used by transportation libraries nationwide.

More specifically, NTL uses cooperative cataloging to examine [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|subject headings]] that are used in transportation literature. NTL is a key player in the organization of subject headings and has made significant contributions to the [http://ntl.bts.gov/tools/trt/ Transportation Research Thesaurus].  The Transportation Research Thesaurus, or TRT, is a controlled vocabulary that was developed to improve the indexing and retrieval of transportation information. The TRT is used by indexers, content managers and librarians in the transportation community and is an internationally recognized standard.

'''''A Dictionary of Love, Or, the Language of Gallantry Explained''''' is a [[dictionary]] originally compiled by the British author [[John Cleland]] in 1753 and revised in 1777 and 1795, though there is no evidence that Cleland was involved with the revisions. It continued to appear in reprints until 1825.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Dictionary of Love|url = https://universityofglasgowlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/a-dictionary-of-love/|website = University of Glasgow Library|accessdate = 6 October 2015|last = Ramsay|first = Lisa|type = blog entry|date = 12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explains the words used by lovers in conversation and [[courtship]] in an 'unsentimental' way,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; cynically interpreting the terms to suggest that readers should not take lovers' words literally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 514321|title = New Attributions to John Cleland|last = Lonsdale|first = Roger|date = 1979|journal = The Review of English Studies|doi = |pmid = |series = New Series|volume = 30|issue = 119|pages = 268–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleland produced the dictionary as a partial translation of the French ''Dictionnaire d’Amour'' of 1741 by [[Jean-François Dreux du Radier]], with the addition of his own entries, which comprise about a quarter of the entries, and about a fifth of the contents of the original omitted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The dictionary was originally published as an anonymous work by [[Ralph Griffiths]], also the publisher of Cleland's novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'', and Griffiths reviewed the book himself in his journal, the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]''. Because of the lack of attribution, its authorship was unknown for many years, but in 1979 [[Roger Lonsdale]] discovered a note by Griffiths in his own copy of the review, identifying 'Mr Cleland' as the author.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In '''''Ex Parte Boedel Steenkamp''''', an important case in the South African law of persons and succession, heard on June 21, 1962, the residue of the deceased’s estate was bequeathed in equal shares in his will to his daughter and his daughter’s children "wat by datum van dood in die lewe is" (who are alive when I die). At the time of the deceased’s death, his daughter had two children and was pregnant with a third. The question before the court was whether the ''nasciturus'' could inherit. The court was unwilling to act to the prejudice of the ''nasciturus'', and held, therefore, that it could inherit. A child ''in ventre matris'' had to be presumed to be alive for the purpose of inheritance, and was entitled to inherit equally with his mother, the testator's daughter, and her other children already born at the death of the testator.

The applicant's attorneys were McIntyre &amp; van der Post.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3354">[[Image:Inside Winter Palace.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A corner of the courtyard garden of the [[Winter Palace]]]]

The '''gardens of the Winter Palace''', [[St Petersburg]], are little known, as the great imperial palace of the [[Romanov]]s was never intended to have gardens. As the [[Tsar]]'s principal residence, situated in the capital, it was very much intended as a symbol of power rather than a place of relaxation and pleasure. 

Bordered by the [[River Neva]] on its northern side and [[Palace Square]] on its southern, the Winter Palace was devoid of space for gardens; however, the last two empresses of Russia each created gardens from previously paved areas.

In 1885, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Tsaritsa Maria Feodorovna]], wife of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], had a garden created in the principal courtyard, an area which had previously been paved. This was designed in a formal rectangular shape, reflecting the shape of the courtyard which contained it. The lawned garden was planted with trees and shrubs, and surrounded by a [[Cobblestone|cobble]]d carriage drive which led from the palace's principal arched entrance on Palace Square to the various doors giving access to the palace's interior from the courtyard.

The second garden was created in 1896 for [[Alix of Hesse|Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna]], wife of the last Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], who lived briefly at the palace at the turn of the 20th century. She found the public access to all the exterior facades of the palace disconcerting, and disliked the way that the members of the public would stare at the windows of the private apartments in the western part of the palace. She also wished for an area where her children could play in privacy and seclusion, as a result she had a garden created on the parade ground beneath her windows. This was surrounded by a high wall topped with railings. The garden was created based on a project by [[landscape architect]] [[Georg Kuphaldt]], the director of the [[Riga]] city gardens and parks.&lt;ref name="kavere"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kāvere| first = Anne| authorlink = Anne Kaaver| title =Rīgas dārzu arhitekts Georgs Kūfalts.| language = Latvian| publisher = [[Jumava]]| location = Riga| pages = 107–108| year = 2007| oclc = 191090541| isbn = 978-9984-38-349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinman''' (born 1951) is an American [[archaeologist]], and the MacArthur Curator of Mesoamerican, Central American, and East Asian Anthropology at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago. He was a part of the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] Settlement Pattern Project which focused on the evolution of the [[Monte Albán]] state and shifts in settlement in the region over three millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Richard Blanton|last=Blanton|first=Richard|authorlink2=Gary M. Feinman|last2=Feinman|first2=Gary M.|first3= Stephen A.|last3=Kowalewski|authorlink3=Stephen A. Kowalewski|first4=Linda M.|last4=Nicholas|authorlink4=Linda M. Nicholas|title=Ancient Oaxaca|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=978-0521577878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has conducted research in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico for over 30 years, most recently in the lands of the communities Tlacolula, [[Mitla]], Matatlán, and Ejutla.  These studies focused on household excavations at three sites (Ejutla, El Palmillo, and the Mitla Fortress). Most recently, he has begun excavations at Lambityeco in collaboration with representatives of the Mexican Institute of Anthropology and History. At Lambityeco, Feinman and colleagues have documented a large Classic-period ball court, which was not previously recorded during surface mapping of this site. The Field Museum of Natural History team also found the largest carved stone ever recovered at this site.

Since 1995 Feinman has also been conducting archaeological survey in coastal Shandong Province, China in conjunction with [[Shandong University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fieldmuseum.academia.edu/GaryFeinman|publisher=Academia.edu|title=Gary Feinman|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal Shandong settlement pattern research, spearheaded by Feinman, Linda Nicholas (Field Museum), and Professor Fang Hui (Shandong University) has had a role in introducing this regional-scale systematic field methodology to Chinese archaeology. The team has documented a large segment of the ancient Qi Great Wall, which was built during the Warring States period, and ultimately was breached by Qin armies just prior to the first unification of China.

Feinman is the author of numerous articles, books, and book chapters.&lt;ref&gt;SSCI average of 18 citations per year (http://apps.webofknowledge.com/CitationReport.do?product=WOS&amp;search_mode=CitationReport&amp;SID=3B3aD5bGcA4jhp77faL&amp;page=1&amp;cr_pqid=11&amp;viewType=summary)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the founding co-editor of the ''[[Journal of Archaeological Research]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/archaeology+%26+anthropology/journal/10814|publisher=Springer|title=Journal of Archaeological Research|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; past editor of ''[[Latin American Antiquity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saa.org/Portals/0/SAA/publications/SAAbulletin/15-1/SAA7.html|title=SAA Bulletin 15(1)|accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/newsandnotes/inside125.shtml|title=AAAS News &amp; Notes|date=28 October 2005|editor=Edward W.

==Contributions to Archaeology==
Feinman helped to develop full coverage survey methods, which he and colleagues applied to the Valley of Oaxaca to help understand the evolution of the Monte Alban state &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-link=Stephen Kowaleski|editor-last= Kowaleski|editor-first=Stephen|title=Monte Alban’s Hinterland, Part II|location=Ann Arbor|publisher=University of Michigan Museum|year= 1982|isbn=978-0915703180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The particular method developed by Feinman and colleagues [[Richard Blanton]] and [[Stephen Kowalewski]] influenced a generation of archaeologists and are still widely used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Suzanne Fish|last= Fish|first=Suzanne|title=The Archaeology of Regions: The Case for Full Coverage Survey|location=New York|publisher=Percheron Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0979773105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feinman continues to employ and refine this method in his ongoing work in the Valley of Oaxaca and [[Shandong|Shandong Province, China]].

Feinman was an early proponent of [[world-systems theory]], and actively applied it to the evolution of Mesoamerican and Southwestern US polities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Richard Blanton|last=Blanton|first=Richard|authorlink2=Gary M. Feinman|last2=Feinman|first2=Gary M.|title=The Mesoamerican World-System|journal=[[American Anthropologist]]|volume=86|pages=673–682|year=1984|doi=10.1525/aa.1984.86.3.02a00100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this work was criticized at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Philip L. Kohl|first1= Philip L.|last1= Kohl|title=The Use and Abuse of World-Systems Theory|journal=Advances in Archaeological Method and Theory|issue=11|pages=1–35|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was further developed and employed by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-link=Peter N. Peregrine|editor1-first=Peter N.|editor1-last=Peregrine|editor2-link=Gary Feinman|editor2-first=Gary|editor2-last=Feinman|title=Pre-Columbian World-Systems|location=Madison|publisher=Prehistory Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1881094166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinman also helped to develop [[dual processual theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-link=Richard Blanton|editor=Blanton, Richard|title=A Dual-Processual Theory for the Evolution of Mesoamerican Civilization|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|issue=1|pages=1–14|year=1996|doi=10.1086/204471|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has had a broad impact in American archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Mills, Barbara J.|editor-link=Barbara J. Mills|title=Alternative Leadership Strategies in the Prehispanic Southwest|location=Tucson|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2000|isbn= 978-0816520282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies, underpinned by a career of regional survey and residential excavation, has offered new perspectives on prehispanic Mesoamerican economies, in which most production for exchange was undertaken in domestic contexts and marketplace exchanges had a central importance. This model is markedly different than prior perspectives that presumed centralized/administered production and exchange. In addition to drawing on results from survey and excavation, Feinman, in conjunction with Linda Nicholas, Mark Golitko and colleagues from Mexico and the United States, has begun an effort to greatly increase the quantity of sourced obsidian from documented prehispanic contexts in the Valley of Oaxaca.By combining these newly sourced sets of obsidian data from Oaxaca with a larger archive of sourced obsidian from across prehispanic Mesoamerica, Feinman and colleagues have documented significant shifts in networks of exchange over time, while casting further doubt on extant models that presume the prevalence of state-controlled economies and redistribution.

Feinman is the co-curator of two permanent exhibitions at the Field Museum, the Ancient Americas and the Cyrus Tang Hall of China). He also served as curator for a number of temporary exhibitions, including Chocolate, The Aztec World, China's First Emperor and His Terracotta Warriors, and Mexican Nativity Scenes.

With T. Douglas Price, Feinman is the author of the world prehistory text, Images of the Past, which presently is in its 7th edition.

The '''''Gesta Regum Anglorum''''' ([[Latin]] for "Deeds of the Kings of [[English people|the English]]"), originally titled {{nowrap|'''''De Gestis Regum Anglorum'''''}} ("On the Deeds of the Kings of the English") and also [[anglicization|anglicized]] as {{nowrap|'''''The Chronicles'''''}} or {{nowrap|'''''The History of the Kings of England'''''}}, is an early-12th-century [[history]] of the [[kings of England]] by [[William of Malmesbury]]. It is a companion work of his ''[[Gesta Pontificum Anglorum]]'' (''Deeds of the English Bishops'') and was followed by his ''Historia Novella'', which continued its account for several more years.

The '''''Home and Colonial Library''''' was a series of works published in London from 1843 to 1849, comprising 49 titles, by [[John Murray III]]. He founded it, as a series of cheap reprints, original works and translations, slanted towards travel literature in the broad sense, in the year of death of his father, [[John Murray II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Innes M.

Originally there were some extra titles, or works later substituted. Two books were often printed in one volume, and 49 works in all were in 37 volumes.

'''''House I''''' is a sculpture by [[Roy Lichtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=FX01327960E26.20894&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=28&amp;source=%7E%21siartinventories&amp;index=.GW&amp;term=house+i+lichtenstein&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;x=19&amp;y=9#focus "House I, (sculpture)"]. ''SIRIS''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located at the [[National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/feature/sculpturegarden/sculpture/sculpture15.shtm "House I", Roy Lichtenstein, American, 1923-1997], ''National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4420_House_I_by_Roy_Lichtenstein_National_Gallery_Sculpture_Garden_Washington_DC Waymarking]&lt;/ref&gt;

The house uses optical illusion to play with perspective. To appreciate the full effect, walk at a steady rate along the arc of the sidewalk that runs in front of and nearly perpendicular to the sculpture, with your head turned to one side, facing the sculpture. The house will appear to be spinning in space, like the "Wizard of Oz" house.

'''Terry Gene Bollea''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ||ə}}, born August 11, 1953), better known by his [[ring name]] as '''Hulk Hogan''', is an American retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], actor, television personality, [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] and [[musician]].

Hogan is regarded by many as the greatest professional wrestler of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/43312/Hulk-Hogans-son-in-car-crash|title=Hulk Hogan's son in car crash|date=August 29, 2007|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|access-date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[IGN]], he is "the most recognized wrestling star worldwide and the most popular wrestler of the 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/02/top-50-wrestlers-of-all-time?page=5|title=Top 50 Wrestlers of All Time|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=April 10, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155319/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/02/top-50-wrestlers-of-all-time?page=5|archivedate=April 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan enjoyed considerable mainstream popularity between 1984 and 1993 as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]), which continued for the remainder of the 1990s in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), where he turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in 1996 and performed as the villainous [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order (nWo)]] leader "Hollywood" Hulk Hogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_22898.shtml|title=The Original Triple H|last=Combs|first=Jason|date=September 20, 2007|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|access-date=September 27, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001171459/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_22898.shtml|archivedate=October 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular [[pay-per-view]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Main eventer|main eventer]] and box office [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|draw]] in both organizations, Hogan headlined the premier annual events of the WWF and WCW, [[WrestleMania]] a record eight times (also being the only one who closed five WrestleMania events in a row) and [[Starrcade]] three times; against [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], he closed the most profitable WCW pay-per-view ever at the [[Starrcade (1997)|1997 edition]] of Starrcade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_24141.shtml|title=Nostalgia: Starrcade '97|last=Hoops|first=Brian|date=January 7, 2008|publisher=PWTorch|access-date=August 10, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234924/http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_24141.shtml|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from those promotions, he has notably performed for the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) and [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). He is a twelve-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]]: a [[List of WWE Champions|six-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion/WWF Champion]] (with his last reign being as Undisputed WWF/WWE Champion) and a [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions|six-time]] [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]]. Hogan's first WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign is the longest in history, while his first WWF Championship reign is the third-longest ever (and the longest of the 1980s). He was the first wrestler to win consecutive [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble]]s, in [[Royal Rumble (1990)|1990]] and [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991]], and was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2005)|class of 2005]], by [[Sylvester Stallone]].

During and after wrestling, Hogan had an extensive acting career, beginning with his 1982 antagonist role in ''[[Rocky III]]''. He has starred in several movies (including ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]'', ''[[Suburban Commando]]'' and ''[[Mr. Nanny]]'') and three television shows (''[[Thunder in Paradise]]'', ''[[Hogan Knows Best]]'' and ''[[China, IL]]''), as well as in [[Right Guard]] commercials and the video game, ''[[Hulk Hogan's Main Event]]''. He was also the frontman for [[The Wrestling Boot Band]], whose sole record, ''Hulk Rules'', reached #12 on the ''Billboard'' [[Kid Albums|Top Kid Audio]] chart in 1995.

When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to [[Port Tampa (neighborhood)|Port Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref name="HHP11"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hogan, Hulk|year=2009|title=My Life Outside the Ring|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=11|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy, he was a [[pitcher]] in [[Little League Baseball]]. He attracted scouts from the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]], but an injury ended his baseball career. He began watching professional wrestling at 16 years old. While in high school, he revered [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]],&lt;ref name=lk45/&gt; and he regularly attended cards at the [[Tampa Sportatorium]]. It was at one of those wrestling cards where he first turned his attention towards [[Superstar Billy Graham]] and looked to him for inspiration;&lt;ref name=lk45&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=45|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; since he first saw Graham on TV,&lt;ref name=lk45/&gt; Hogan wanted to match his "inhuman" look.&lt;ref name=lk45/&gt;

Hogan was also a musician, spending a decade playing [[Bass guitar#Fretted and fretless basses|fretless bass guitar]] in several Florida-based rock bands.&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200552 |title=Hulk Hogan |publisher=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture |author=Patrick Jones |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111070903/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200552 |archivedate=November 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to study at [[Hillsborough Community College]] and the [[University of South Florida]]. After music gigs began to get in the way of his time in college, Hogan decided to drop out of the University of South Florida before receiving a degree.&lt;ref name=lk457u&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=41|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Hogan and two local musicians formed a band called Ruckus in 1976.&lt;ref name=lk4544&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=44|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band soon became popular in the Tampa Bay region.&lt;ref name=lk4544/&gt; During his spare time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting.&lt;ref name= lk457u5&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=42|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the wrestlers who were competing in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing.&lt;ref name= lk45/&gt; Among those attending his performances were [[Jack Brisco|Jack]] and [[Gerald Brisco]],&lt;ref name= lk45/&gt; two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region.

Impressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked [[Yasuhiro Kojima|Hiro Matsuda]]{{emdash}}the man who trained wrestlers working for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF){{emdash}}to make him a potential trainee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/geraldbrisco|title=Gerald Brisco's profile|accessdate=June 4, 2012|publisher=[[WWE]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160125170339/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/geraldbrisco|archivedate=January 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Hogan eventually agreed.&lt;ref name= lk455147&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=47|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, however, [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]], the son of CWF promoter [[Eddie Graham]], refused to put Hogan in the ring; according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along. However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling people in town that he was going to be a wrestler,&lt;ref name= lk4551&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=51|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early years (1977–1979) ===
In mid-1977, after training for more than a year with Matsuda, the Brisco brothers dropped by Matsuda's gym to see Hogan. During this visit, Jack Brisco handed Hogan a pair of wrestling boots and informed him that he was scheduled to wrestle his first match the following week.&lt;ref name=lk455156h&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=56|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his professional wrestling debut, Eddie Graham [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#B|booked]] him against [[Brian Blair]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] on August 10, 1977 in CWF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldschool-wrestling.com/geeklog/article.php/20061017223545426|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029002801/http://www.oldschool-wrestling.com/geeklog/article.php/20061017223545426|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-10-29|title=Old School Wrestling – Florida results 1977 (August 10)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 7uiomnx&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=57|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, Bollea donned a mask and assumed the persona of "The Super Destroyer", a hooded character first played by [[Don Jardine]] and subsequently used by other wrestlers.

Hogan eventually could no longer work with Hiro Matsuda, whom he felt was an overbearing trainer, and left CWF. After declining an offer to wrestle for the Kansas City circuit, Hogan took a hiatus from wrestling and managed The Anchor club, a private club in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]], for a man named Whitey Bridges. Eventually, Whitey and Hogan became close friends, and decided to open a gym together; the gym became known as Whitey and Terry's Olympic gym.&lt;ref name="765yuiomnfx"&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=61–62|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Hogan's friend Ed Leslie (later known as [[Brutus Beefcake]]) came to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry's Olympic Gym. On his spare time, he and Leslie worked out in the gym together,&lt;ref name="765yuiomnfx"/&gt; and eventually, Beefcake developed a muscular physique; Hogan was impressed by Beefcake's physical stature and became convinced that the two of them should wrestle together as [[tag team]] partners. Depressed and yearning to return to wrestling, Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida; Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet's [[Alabama]] territory. Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler, to come with him and promised to teach him everything he knew about the sport.&lt;ref name=765yu8omnfx&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=67|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, Bollea and Leslie wrestled as Terry and Ed Boulder, known as The Boulder Brothers. These early matches as a tag team with the surname Boulder being used by both men prompted a rumor among wrestling fans unaware of the inner workings of the sport that Hogan and Leslie were brothers,&lt;ref name=76hbw8omnfx&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=73|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; as few people actually knew their real names outside of immediate friends, family, and the various promoters the two worked for. After wrestling a show for [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) in Memphis, Jerry Jarrett, the [[List of professional wrestling promoters|promoter]] for the CWA, approached Hogan and Leslie and offered them a job in his [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] for $800 a week; this was far more than the $175 a week they would make working for Tillet.&lt;ref name= 7oubw8omnfx/&gt; Hogan and Leslie accepted this offer and left Tillet's territory.&lt;ref name= 7oubw8omnfx&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=75|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in Memphis, Hogan appeared on a local talk show, where he sat beside [[Lou Ferrigno]], star of the television series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=76|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host commented on how Hogan, who stood 6&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in (201&amp;nbsp;cm) and weighed 295 pounds with 24-inch biceps, actually dwarfed "The Hulk". Watching the show backstage, Mary Jarrett noticed that Hogan was actually bigger than Ferrigno, who was well known at the time for having large muscles. As a result, Bollea began performing as Terry "The Hulk" Boulder&lt;ref name= 79nmbx&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life Outside the Ring|author=Hulk Hogan|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=77|year=2009|isbn=9780312588892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes wrestled as Sterling Golden.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

On December 1, 1979, Bollea won his first [[professional wrestling championship]], the [[NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division)]], recognized in [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]], when he defeated [[Bob Roop]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Bollea would [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|drop]] the title in January 1980 to [[Bob Armstrong]]. Bollea briefly wrestled in the [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW) territory from September thru December 1979 as Sterling Golden.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980) ===
Later that year, former NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Terry Funk]] introduced Bollea to the company owner/promoter [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vincent J. McMahon]], who was impressed with his charisma and physical stature. McMahon, who wanted to use an Irish name, gave Bollea the last name Hogan, and also wanted him to dye his hair red.

After the match, Hogan thanked DiBiase for putting him over and told him that he "owed him one", a favor that he would end up repaying during DiBiase's second run with the company in the late 1980s and early 1990s as "The Million Dollar Man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o5LMndqP_o|title=Ted DiBiase shoots on Hulk Hogan and Steve Austin|first=|last=Wrestling Shoots|date=October 1, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402042519/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o5LMndqP_o|archivedate=April 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon gave Hogan former [[World tag team championship|tag team champion]] [[Tony Altomare]] as chaperone and guide.&lt;ref name=albano&gt;{{cite book|title=Often Imitated, Never Duplicated: Captain Lou Albano|last=Albano|first=Lou|pages=104|publisher=GEAN Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-615-18998-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Hogan wrestled [[Bob Backlund]] for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Heavyweight Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1980|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80.htm|year=1980|accessdate=May 18, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423131734/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80.htm|archivedate=April 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he started his first big feud with [[André the Giant]], which culminated in a [[Showdown at Shea (1980)|match]] with André at [[Shea Stadium]] in August 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1980|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80.htm|accessdate=May 18, 2015|date=August 9, 1980|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423131734/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80.htm|archivedate=April 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his initial run as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] in the WWF, Hogan was paired with [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]], a wrestler-turned-[[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]].

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1980–1985) ===
In 1980, Hogan began appearing in [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) where Japanese wrestling fans nicknamed him "Ichiban" (which translates to "Number One"). Hogan first appeared on May 13, 1980, while he was still with the WWF. He occasionally toured the country over the next few years, facing a wide variety of opponents ranging from [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] to [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. When competing in [[Japan]], Hogan used a vastly different repertoire of wrestling moves, relying on more technical, traditional wrestling holds and maneuvers as opposed to the power-based, brawling style American fans became accustomed to seeing from him. In addition, Hogan used the ''Axe Bomber'', a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Crooked arm lariat|crooked arm lariat]], as his finisher in Japan instead of the [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running leg drop]] that has been his standard finisher in America. Hogan still made appearances for the WWF, even unsuccessfully challenging [[Pedro Morales]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] on March 26, 1981.&lt;ref name="page39"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pedro Morales: 70 años del pionero Latinoamericano|author=Alexander Trujillo|publisher=''El Diario Culebrense''|language=Spanish|chapter=Reportaje Especial|date=October 24, 2012|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 1983, Hogan became the first [[International Wrestling Grand Prix]] (IWGP) tournament winner (although he held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] belt, this was not the beginning of the actual championship), defeating [[Antonio Inoki]] by knockout in the finals of a ten-man tournament.&lt;ref name="iwgp1983"/&gt; Hogan and Inoki also worked as partners in Japan, winning the MSG Tag League tournament two years in a row: in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, Hogan returned to NJPW to wrestle Inoki in the finals of the IWGP League, in which he lost the [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|title belt]] by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]], thanks to interference from [[Riki Choshu]]. Hogan also defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against[[Seiji Sakaguchi]] and Fujinami, among others, until ending his tour in Nagoya on June 13 with a count-out to Inoki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=39&amp;bild=0&amp;details=7&amp;liga=121&amp;jahr=1985 "The 19 NJPW matches fought by Hulk Hogan in 1985", from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Wrestling Association (1981–1983) ===
After filming his scene for ''[[Rocky III]]'' against the elder McMahon's wishes, Hogan made his debut in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), owned by [[Verne Gagne]]. Hogan started his AWA run as a villain, taking on "Luscious" [[John L. Sullivan (wrestler)|Johnny Valiant]] as his manager. This did not last for long as the AWA fans fell in love with Hogan's presence and Hogan became the top [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] of the AWA, battling the [[Heenan Family]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Hogan's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#T|turn]] as a fan favorite came at the end of July 1981, when during a television taping that aired in August, [[Jerry Blackwell]], after suffering a pinfall loss to [[Brad Rheingans]], began beating down Rheingans and easily fighting off anyone who tried to run in for the save; however, Hogan ran in, got the upper hand and ran Blackwell from the ring. Hogan was eventually victorious in his [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with Blackwell and by the end of 1981, gained his first title matches against Bockwinkel.

=== Return to WWF ===
==== Rise of Hulkamania (1983–1984) ====
[[File:Hulk Hogan And Brutus Beefcake.jpg|thumb|Hogan as the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] with [[Brutus Beefcake]]]]
After purchasing the company from his father in 1982, [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] had plans to expand the territory into a nationwide promotion, and he handpicked Hogan to be the company's showpiece attraction due to his charisma and name recognition. Hogan made his return at a television taping in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] on December 27, 1983 defeating Bill Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1983|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/83.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519180847/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/83.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the January 7, 1984, episode of ''Championship Wrestling'', Hogan confirmed his fan favorite status for the WWF fans by saving Bob Backlund from a three-way assault by [[The Wild Samoans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1984|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|accessdate=May 18, 2015|date=January 7, 1984|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ph1kKm14?url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] was explained simply by Backlund: "He's changed his ways. He's a great man. He's told me he's not gonna have Blassie around". The storyline shortcut was necessary because less than three weeks later on January 23, Hogan won his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship, [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] [[The Iron Sheik]] (who had Blassie in his [[Cornerman|corner]]) in [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=james/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454120 |title=Hulk Hogan's first WWE Championship reign |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624000129/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454120 |archivedate=June 24, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline accompanying the victory was that Hogan was a "last minute" replacement for the Sheik's original opponent Bob Backlund,&lt;ref name="WWEBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/Hulkhogan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717061714/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/hulkhogan|archivedate=July 17, 2015|title=Hulk Hogan bio|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the champion by way of being the first man to escape the camel clutch (the Iron Sheik's finishing move).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWF Show Results 1984|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2008|date=January 23, 1984|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ph1kKm14?url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backstage story was that then champion Bob Backlund had refused to let Hogan win the title from him, demanding that any wrestler to whom he lost the title have a legitimate wrestling background. As a consequence, The Iron Sheik won the title from Backlund first and then dropped it to Hogan. However, this was mostly made to not make two fan favorites face each other.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Hoganlegdrop.jpg|right|thumb|Hogan performing his signature ''Atomic [[Leg Drop]]'' on [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]
Immediately after the title win, commentator [[Gorilla Monsoon]] proclaimed: "Hulkamania is here!". Hogan frequently referred to his fans as "Hulkamaniacs" in his interviews and introduced his three "demandments": [[training]], saying prayers, and eating [[vitamin]]s. Eventually, a fourth demandment ([[Self-confidence|believing in oneself]]) was added during his feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] in 1990. Hogan's ring gear developed a characteristic yellow-and-red color scheme; his ring entrances involved him [[ritual]]istically ripping his shirt off his body, [[Posedown|flexing]], and listening for audience cheers in an exaggerated manner. The majority of Hogan's matches during this time involved him wrestling heels who had been booked as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#M|unstoppable monsters]], using a format which became near-routine: Hogan would deliver steady offense, but eventually lose momentum, seemingly nearing defeat. After being hit with his opponent's finishing move, he would then experience a sudden [[second wind]], fighting back while "feeding" off the energy of the audience, becoming impervious to attack{{snd}} a process described as "Hulking up". His signature maneuvers{{snd}} pointing at the opponent (which would later be accompanied by a loud "you!" from the audience), shaking his finger to scold him, three punches, an Irish whip, the [[big boot]] and [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running leg drop]] – would follow and ensure him a victory. That finishing sequence would occasionally change depending on the storyline and opponent; for instance, with "giant" wrestlers, the sequence might involve a [[body slam]].

In 1984, similarities between Hogan's character and that of [[The Incredible Hulk]] led to an [[Quitclaim deed|quitclaim]] deal between Titan Sports, [[Marvel Comics]] and himself wherein Marvel obtained the trademarks "Hulk Hogan", "Hulkster" and "Hulkamania" for 20 years, and Titan agreed to no longer refer to him as "incredible" nor simply "Hulk" or ever dress him in purple or green. Marvel also subsequently received .9% of reportable gross merchandise revenue associated with Hogan, $100 for each of his matches and 10% of Titan's portion of his other earnings under this name (or 10% of the earnings, if Titan held no interest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/304714653/1985-marvel-hulk-hogan-titan-sports-contract|title=1985 Marvel/Hulk Hogan/Titan Sports Contract - Wwe - Entertainment|website=Scribd|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402042519/https://www.scribd.com/doc/304714653/1985-marvel-hulk-hogan-titan-sports-contract|archivedate=April 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mule&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redheadedmule.com/comics/hulk-hogan-marvel/10579/|title=When Hulk Hogan and Marvel Collided|work=Red-Headed Mule|accessdate=August 8, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727065916/http://redheadedmule.com/comics/hulk-hogan-marvel/10579/|archivedate=July 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988's ''Marvel Comics Presents #45'', Hogan was tossed through an arena roof by The Incredible Hulk, because he "picked the wrong name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/sbt/someone-bought-this-hulk-hogan-vs-the-incredible-hulk-in-an-epic-battle-of-the-hulks/|title=Someone Bought This: Hulk Hogan Vs.

==== International renown (1985–1988) ====
Over the next year, Hogan became the face of professional wrestling as McMahon pushed the WWF into a [[Popular culture|pop culture]] enterprise with [[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] on [[MTV]], drawing record houses, [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view]] buyrates, and television ratings in the process. The centerpiece attraction for the [[WrestleMania I|first WrestleMania]] on March 31, 1985, Hogan teamed with [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#L|legit]] friend, TV and movie star [[Mr. T]] to defeat his archrival [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]] and [[Paul Orndorff|"Mr Wonderful" Paul Orndorff]] when [[Bob Orton, Jr.|"Cowboy" Bob Orton]], who had been in the corner of Piper and Orndorff, accidentally caused his team's defeat by knocking out Orndorff after he jumped from the top turnbuckle and hit him in the back of the head with his arm cast in a shot meant for Hogan.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WrestleMania I Main Event|publisher=[[WWE]]|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/1/mainevent1|accessdate=October 25, 2016|date=March 31, 1985|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628014908/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/1/mainevent1|archivedate=June 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event I|first episode]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', Hogan successfully defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Orton in a match that Hogan won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/may111985|title=Saturday Night's Main Event I results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 12, 2008|date=May 11, 1985|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329070003/http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/history/1985to1992/may111985|archivedate=March 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogan was named the most requested celebrity of the 1980s for the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make-a-Wish Foundation]] children's charity. He was featured on the covers of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (the first and {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, only professional wrestler to do so), ''[[TV Guide]]'', and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazines, while also appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and having his own [[CBS]] [[Saturday morning cartoon]] titled ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling]]''.

In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at [[house show]]s in [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles competition]] with his "War Bonnet", a red and yellow [[Galea (helmet)|gladiator helmet]] with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://droptoehold.com/post/4287696459/wwf-fist|title=The Rarely Seen Hulk Hogan Fist Helmet – Boston, MA 9/10/88|publisher=''Drop Toehold''|date=April 2, 2011|accessdate=March 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523050901/http://droptoehold.com/post/4287696459/wwf-fist|archivedate=May 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series ''Are You Serious?'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwmania.com/john-cena-debuting-attire-tonight-hulk-hogans-fist-helmet-ays-mick-foley|title=John Cena Debuting New Attire Tonight, Hulk Hogan's Fist Helmet On "AYS?", Mick Foley|publisher=PWMania|date=November 18, 2012|accessdate=March 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402062436/http://www.pwmania.com/john-cena-debuting-attire-tonight-hulk-hogans-fist-helmet-ays-mick-foley|archivedate=April 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|Royal Rumble]] in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by [[The Twin Towers (professional wrestling)|The Twin Towers]] himself.&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hogan.html|title=Hulk Hogan's Bio|work=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=April 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515055440/http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hogan.html|archivedate=May 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the [[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event II|February 3 episode]] of ''The Main Event'', when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage, who slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself.&lt;ref name="mainevent2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/snme/890203.html|title=The Main Event results – February 3, 1989|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502205307/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/snme/890203.html|archivedate=May 2, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, which started a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the two.&lt;ref name="megapowers"/&gt; Their feud culminated in Hogan beating Savage for his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania V]].&lt;ref name="WWEBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="megapowers"/&gt;

==== Final WWF Championship reigns (1989–1993) ====
[[File:Hulk Hogan Pointing.jpg|thumb|right|Hogan making his way to the ring in 1989]]
Hogan's second run in 1989 lasted a year, during which he defended the title in two matches against Savage in April that he lost both times by countout, before defeating [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|The Big Boss Man]] in a steel cage match on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXI|April 25 episode]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', which was aired on May 27. In May on ''WWF on NESN'', Hogan retained the title by losing once again by countout against Savage. This was also the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was referred to as such during a televised title defense, as Hogan's next successful title defense against [[The Honky Tonk Man]] on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXII|July 18 episode]] of ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' saw the title being renamed and referred simply as the WWF Championship. Also during Hogan's second reign as champion, he starred in the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]'', which was the inspiration of a feud with Hogan's co-star [[Tom Lister, Jr.]], who appeared at wrestling events as his movie character, Zeus (an "unstoppable monster" who was "jealous" over Hogan's higher billing and wanted revenge). However, Hogan was easily able to defeat Zeus in a series of matches across the country during late 1989, beginning with a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]] at [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam]], in which Hogan and Brutus Beefcake topped Zeus and Savage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1989/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan &amp; Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake w/ Elizabeth vs. "Macho Man" Randy Savage &amp; Zeus w/ Sensational Sherri|publisher=[[WWE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810051117/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1989/mainevent/|archivedate=August 10, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan and Zeus would later meet at the [[Survivor Series (1989)|Survivor Series]], where the "Hulkamaniacs" faced the "Million Dollar Team"; in the early part of the match, Hogan put Zeus [[Glossary of professional wrestling#O|over]] by hitting him with everything to no effect before Zeus then dominated Hogan until Zeus was disqualified by referee Dave Hebner. Hogan and Beefcake then defeated Zeus and Savage in a rematch at the [[No Holds Barred (1989 film)#The match|No Holds Barred]] pay-per-view to end the feud. Hogan also had defeated Savage to retain the WWF Championship in their official WrestleMania rematch on October 10, at United Kingdom-only pay-per-view [[UK Rampage (1989)|First WWF UK Event]] at [[London Arena]].&lt;ref name="Hulkbrutus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/Hulkbrutus.html|title=Mega-Maniacs Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423073622/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/hulkbrutus.html|archivedate=April 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1980s.html#nhb|title=No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie results|publisher=Wrestling and Tournaments|accessdate=April 13, 2008|date=December 27, 1989|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412162122/http://prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1980s.html#nhb|archivedate=April 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his second reign as the WWF Champion, Hogan won the [[Royal Rumble (1990)|1990 Royal Rumble match]],&lt;ref name="rumble"/&gt; before dropping the title to then [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[The Ultimate Warrior]] in a title versus title match at [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm6/mainevent/|title=Ultimate Warrior vs. Hulk Hogan – Intercontinental and WWE Championship Match|publisher=|accessdate=April 13, 2008|date=April 1, 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327023335/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm6/mainevent/|archivedate=March 27, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogan soon became embroiled in a heated feud with the 468-pound Earthquake, who had crushed Hogan's ribs in a sneak attack on ''[[Bruce Prichard#Brother Love Show|The Brother Love Show]]'' in May 1990. On television, announcers explained that Hogan's injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior both took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit that he wanted to retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a "thank you"). Hogan returned by [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam]], and he for several months dominated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1990/mainevent/|title=Hulk Hogan w/ Big Bossman vs. Earthquake w/ Jimmy Hart and Dino Bravo|publisher=WWE|accessdate=April 13, 2008|date=August 27, 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729035606/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1990/mainevent/|archivedate=July 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe caused Hogan to add a fourth demandment – believing in yourself, and he also became known as "The Immortal" Hulk Hogan.

At the first annual [[King of the Ring (1993)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view on June 13, Hogan defended the championship against the former champion Yokozuna in his first title defense since defeating him at WrestleMania IX. Yokozuna [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#K|kicked out]] of Hogan's signature leg drop and scored the [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] win after Hogan was blinded by a fireball shot by a "Japanese photographer" (actually a disguised Harvey Wippleman).

Hogan also wrestled [[The Road Warriors|The Hell Raisers]] with Muta and [[Masahiro Chono]] as his tag team partners. His last match in Japan was on January 4, 1994 at [[January 4 Dome Show#Battlefield|Battlefield]], when he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami.

After Hogan headlined WCW's premier annual event [[Starrcade]] ([[Starrcade (1994)|Starrcade: Triple Threat]]) in December 1994 by defeating [[Brutus Beefcake|The Butcher]] for the title, his next feud was against [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], who challenged him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at [[SuperBrawl V]], where Hogan won by disqualification after the returning Flair's interference. Hogan then defeated Vader (who was managed part-time by Flair) in a non-title [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|leather strap match]] at [[Uncensored (1995)|Uncensored]]. Because of the controversial ending caused once again by Flair at Uncensored, Hogan's feud with Vader culminated in a steel cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at [[Bash at the Beach (1995)|Bash at the Beach]], where Hogan won by escpaing the cage.

After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the "creative control" clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [Hogan] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#J|job]] to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.&lt;ref name="acceleratorbio"/&gt;

As a result, Hogan filed a [[Defamation|defamation of character]] lawsuit against Russo soon after,&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{cite book|title=Eric Bischoff: Controversy Creates Cash|author=Eric Bischoff|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn= 1-4165-2729-X|pages=344–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was eventually dismissed in 2002.

=== Post-WCW endeavors (2001) ===
In the months following the eventual demise of WCW in March 2001, Hogan underwent surgery on his knees in order for him to wrestle again. As a test, Hogan worked a match in [[Orlando, Florida]] for the [[Xcitement Wrestling Federation]] (XWF) promotion run by his longtime handler Jimmy Hart. Hogan defeated [[Curt Hennig]] in this match and felt healthy enough to accept an offer to return to the WWF in February 2002.&lt;ref name="OWW"/&gt;

During this period, the "Hulk Rules" logo of the 1980s was redone with the text "Hulk Still Rules", and Hogan also wore the original "Hulk Rules" attire twelve years earlier, when he headlined WrestleMania VI at the same arena, in the [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]]. For a time, he was still known as "Hollywood" Hulk Hogan, notably keeping the Hollywood Hogan style blond mustache with black beard while wearing Hulkamania-like red and yellow tights and using the "[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)|Voodoo Child]]" entrance theme music he used in WCW.

Lesnar became only the second WWE wrestler to defeat Hogan by submission (after Kurt Angle), and the first to defeat Hogan by having the match called. Following the match, Lesnar continued to beat on Hogan, leaving him bloody and unconscious in the ring.

As a result of Lesnar's assault, Hogan went on hiatus and was not able to return until early 2003, shaving off his black beard and dropping "Hollywood" from his name in his return.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Hogan battled The Rock (who had turned villainous) once again at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|title=The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=February 23, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219180229/http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2003/mainevent/|archivedate=February 19, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defeated [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in a match billed as "twenty years in the making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/|title=WrestleMania XIX official results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=March 30, 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329101800/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/|archivedate=March 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After WrestleMania XIX, he had a run as the masked Mr. America, who was supposed to be Hogan in [[Deception|disguise]], wearing a mask. He used Hogan's "Real American" as entrance theme and all of Hogan's signature gestures, moves, and phrases.

(lampooning Hogan's use of "brother" in his promos).&lt;ref name="OWW" /&gt; The feud continued through the month of May, with a singles match between Mr. America and Hogan's old rival Roddy Piper at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2003/results/ |title=Judgment Day 2003 official results |publisher=[[WWE]] |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |date=May 18, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327021814/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2003/results/ |archivedate=March 27, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. America's last WWE appearance was on the June 26 episode of ''SmackDown!'' when [[Big Show]] and [[The World's Greatest Tag Team]] ([[Charlie Haas]] and [[Shelton Benjamin]]) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030626.html|title=SmackDown! results – June 26, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=April 16, 2008|date=June 26, 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420101557/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/030626.html|archivedate=April 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his finger to his lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret.

=== Second return to NJPW (2003) ===
Hogan returned to NJPW in October 2003, when he defeated [[Masahiro Chono]] at Ultimate Crush II in the [[Tokyo Dome]].

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2004) ===
Shortly after Hogan left WWE, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) began making overtures to Hogan, culminating in Jeff Jarrett, co-founder of TNA and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion, launching an on-air attack on Hogan in Japan in October 2003. The attack was supposed to be a precursor to Hogan battling Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's first three-hour pay-per-view. However, due to recurring knee and hip problems, Hogan did not appear in TNA. Still, the incident has been shown several times on TNA broadcasts, and was included in the TNA DVD ''TNA's Fifty Greatest Moments''.

=== Third return to WWE (2005–2007) ===
[[File:Hulk Hogan3.jpg|thumb|left|Hogan making his entrance at [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]] in 2005]]

The build-up to Hogan's Hall of Fame induction and preparation for his WrestleMania angle was shown on the first season of ''[[Hogan Knows Best]]''. The next night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite [[Shawn Michaels]]. The following week on ''Raw'', Michaels approached [[List of WWE Raw on-air personalities#Authority figures|Raw General Manager]] Eric Bischoff demanding a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused, but told Michaels if he found a partner he would be granted a tag team match. Michaels then made a plea for Hogan to team with him. On the April 18 episode of ''Raw'', Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared, saving Michaels and accepting his offer. At [[Backlash (2005)|Backlash]], Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Zerr|title=Hogan thrilled to be retro|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/05/01/1021236.html|publisher=SLAM!

Hogan then appeared on July 4 episode of ''Raw'', as the special guest of [[Carly Colón|Carlito]] on his talk-show segment ''Carlito's Cabana''. After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter [[Brooke Hogan|Brooke]], Hogan attacked Carlito. Kurt Angle then also appeared, making comments about Brooke, which further upset Hogan, who was eventually double teamed by Carlito and Angle, but was saved by Shawn Michaels.

On December 5, 2009, Hogan announced on [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC)'s ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' that he would be making his official TNA debut on January 4, 2010, in a special live three-hour Monday night episode of ''Impact!'' to compete with WWE's ''Raw'' (which featured the return of Bret Hart).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1836/84/|title=Watch The Video Of Hulk Hogan On UFC|publisher=[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207091124/http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1836/84/|archivedate=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]] revealed Hogan's role in the company in an interview with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The UK Sun]]'' stating when his job came to question, "He is involved with everything from looking at the talent to how we shoot the show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/Hulk-hogan-downs-ric-flair-in-burswood-bout/story-e6frg13u-1225803762480|title=Hulk's job is to get TNA over|date=January 3, 2010|last=Rothstein|first=Simon|publisher=The UK Sun|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025112756/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/hulk-hogan-downs-ric-flair-in-burswood-bout/story-e6frg13u-1225803762480|archivedate=October 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the January 4 episode of ''Impact!'', Hogan debuted, reuniting briefly with former nWo partners Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and [[Sean Waltman]], the latter two of whom made their returns to the company. He, however, refused to join them for a full-fledged reunion of their group claiming, "it's a different time", and stuck to his business relations with Bischoff, who made his appearance to declare that, the two of them would "flip the company upside down" and everyone would have to earn their spot. Hogan also encountered TNA founder Jeff Jarrett on the broadcast, appearing via video wall and interrupting Jarrett's company success speech, stating that Carter was instrumental to the company's survival, and that just like the rest, Jarrett would have to (kayfabe) earn his spot in TNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_37861.shtml|title=Keller's TNA Impact Live Report 1/4: Jeff Hardy, NWO reunion, Hulk Hogan, TNA Knockout Title match, more surprises – ongoing coverage|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=January 4, 2010|work=PWTorch|accessdate=January 5, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106163017/http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_37861.shtml|archivedate=January 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[WrestleMania XXX]] in March, Hogan served as the host, coming out at the start of the show to hype up the crowd. During his promo, he mistakenly referred to the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]], the venue the event was being held at, as the [[Silverdome]], which became the subject of jokes throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/04/wrestlemania-hulk-hogan-silverdome-superdome "Hulk Hogan flubbed the name of the Superdome, and New Orleans' reaction was priceless"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822014626/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/04/wrestlemania-hulk-hogan-silverdome-superdome |date=August 22, 2017 }}.

Later in the show, Hogan shared a moment with [[Mr. T]], [[Paul Orndorff]] and [[Roddy Piper]], with whom he main evented the first WrestleMania.

On February 27, 2015, Hogan was honored at Madison Square Garden during a WWE live event dubbed "Hulk Hogan Appreciation Night" with a special commemorative banner hanging from the rafters, honoring his wrestling career and historic matches he had in the arena.&lt;ref name="banner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/556745-photos-hulkamania-banner-msg|title=PHOTOS: MSG Honors Hulk Hogan with "Hulkamania" Banner|author=Nick Paglino|date=February 27, 2015|work=Wrestlezone|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the March 23 episode of ''Raw'', Hogan along with [[Snoop Dogg]] confronted [[Curtis Axel]] – who at the time had been "borrowing" Hogan's Hulkamania gimmick with Axel referring to himself as "AxelMania". On March 28, the night before WrestleMania, Hogan posthumously inducted longtime partner and rival "Macho Man" Randy Savage into the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2015)|class of 2015]]. The next night at [[WrestleMania 31]], Hogan reunited with Hall and Nash to reform the nWo, appearing in Sting's corner in his match against Triple H, who himself was joined by [[D-Generation X]] members [[Billy Gunn]], [[X-Pac]], [[Road Dogg]], and Shawn Michaels.

Hogan created and financed a restaurant called ''Pastamania'' located in the [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="WrestleCrap140"&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|page=140|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55022-584-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on the Labor Day weekend of 1995 and was heavily promoted on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s live show ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''. The restaurant, which remained in operation for less than a year, featured such dishes as "Hulk-U's" and "Hulk-A-Roos".&lt;ref name="WrestleCrap140"/&gt;

In an interview on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Bollea claimed that the [[George Foreman Grill]] was originally offered to him, but he failed to respond in time, so Foreman endorsed the grill instead. Instead, Bollea endorsed a [[blender]], known as the Hulk Hogan Thunder Mixer. He has since endorsed a grill known as "The Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill".

In 2006, Bollea unveiled his own energy drink ''Hogan Energy'', distributed by Socko Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hogan Energy Powered By Socko|publisher=BeverageWorld.com|date=September 27, 2006|accessdate=November 3, 2006|url=http://www.beverageworld.com/content/view/33168/168/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034431/http://www.beverageworld.com/content/view/33168/168/|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name and likeness are also applied to a line of microwavable hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and chicken sandwiches sold at [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] called "Hulkster Burgers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chipperprime.img.jugem.jp/20080426_337514.jpg |title=Hulkster Cheesburger.

[[File:Hulk Hogan in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Hulk Hogan in [[Toronto]] in 2009]]

=== Legal issues ===

==== Belzer lawsuit ====
On March 27, 1985, just days prior to the inaugural WrestleMania, [[Richard Belzer]] requested on his cable TV talk show ''[[Hot Properties (talk show)|Hot Properties]]'' that Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After consistently refusing but being egged on by Belzer, Hogan put Belzer in a modified [[Guillotine choke]], which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court. On October 20, 2006, on the ''[[Bubba the Love Sponge Show]]'', it was claimed (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. During his June 23, 2008, appearance on Sirius Satellite Radio's ''The Howard Stern Show'', Belzer suggested that the real settlement amount was actually closer to $400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/the-triangle/wrestlings-greatest-shoots-wrestlemania-edition-hulk-hogan-vs-richard-belzer/|title=Wrestling's Greatest Shoots, 'WrestleMania' Edition: Hulk Hogan vs. Richard Belzer |author=The Masked Man|work=Grantland|accessdate=August 11, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921012131/http://grantland.com/the-triangle/wrestlings-greatest-shoots-wrestlemania-edition-hulk-hogan-vs-richard-belzer/|archivedate=September 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Testimony in McMahon trial ====
In 1994, Hogan, having received [[immunity from prosecution]], testified in the trial of [[Vince McMahon]] relating to shipments of steroids received by both parties from WWF physician Dr. George T. Zahorian. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used [[anabolic steroid]]s since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that McMahon had neither sold him the drugs, nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government's case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/23/nyregion/a-promoter-of-wrestling-is-acquitted.html|title=A Promoter Of Wrestling Is Acquitted|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319152909/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/23/nyregion/a-promoter-of-wrestling-is-acquitted.html|archivedate=March 19, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollea is a Christian. Bollea has spoken about his faith in his life saying, "[I've] leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I accepted [[Jesus|Christ]] as my savior.

=== Health ===
Bollea has suffered numerous health problems, particularly with his back since retiring as a wrestler following the years of heavyweight training and jolting as a wrestler.&lt;ref name="Decline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96230/Hulk_Hogans_painful_decline|title=Hulk Hogan's painful decline|publisher=TheWeek.com|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=May 13, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516153144/http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96230/Hulk_Hogans_painful_decline|archivedate=May 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2013, Bollea filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Laser Spine Institute for $50 million, citing that the medical firm persuaded him to undergo a half-dozen "unnecessary and ineffective" spinal operations that worsened his back problems. He claimed that the six procedures he underwent over a period of 19 months only gave him short-term relief. After the procedures failed to cure his back problems, Bollea underwent a traditional spinal fusion surgery on December 2010, which enabled him to return to his professional activities. In addition, the Laser Spine Institute used his name on their advertisements without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/hulk-hogan-wrestles-with-laser-spine-center-in-lawsuit.html|title=Hulk Hogan Wrestles with Laser Spine Center in Lawsuit|author=Armstrong, David|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224334/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/hulk-hogan-wrestles-with-laser-spine-center-in-lawsuit.html|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''indenture''' is a legal [[contract]] that reflects or covers a debt or purchase obligation. It specifically refers to two types of practices: in historical usage, an [[indentured servant]] status, and in modern usage, it is an instrument used for commercial debt or real estate transaction.

==Historical usage==
An indenture is a legal [[contract]] between two parties, particularly for [[Indentured servant|indentured labour]] or a term of [[apprenticeship]] but also for certain [[real estate|land]] transactions. The term comes from the medieval English "indenture of retainer"&lt;ref name="KOM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth O.| authorlink = Kenneth O. Morgan |title=The Oxford History of Britain|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=2001|page=126|chapter=The Early Middle Ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; a legal contract written in duplicate on the same sheet, with the copies separated by cutting along a jagged (toothed, hence the term "in''dent''ure") line so that the teeth of the two parts could later be refitted to confirm authenticity ([[Chirograph]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example Brown, M.P., ''A Guide To Western Historical Scripts From Antiquity to 1600'', British Library, 1990, pp. 78-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Each party to the deed would then retain a part. When the agreement was made before a court of law a ''tripartite'' indenture was made, with the third piece kept at the court. The term is used for any kind of [[deed]] executed by more than one party, in contrast to a [[deed poll]] which is made by one individual. In the case of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], the indenture shows the pledge, promises, representations and covenants of the issuing party.

Although other evidence indicates that the method has been in use from around the year 1000, the earliest surviving examples in [[England]] are from the thirteenth century. These are agreements for military service, proving that a paid, contract army was then in existence.&lt;ref name="KOM" /&gt; [[Exchequer]] records of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s French campaign of 1415 (the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] campaign), including the indentures of all the captains of the army agreeing to provide specified numbers of men and at what cost, may still be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An example of such a use can be found in the [[The National Archives|National Archives]], where an indenture, from about 1401, recording the transfer of the [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Pinley]], [[Warwickshire]], is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the early history of the United States, many European immigrants served a period of indentured labour in order to pay the cost of their transportation. This practice was common during the 17th and 18th centuries, where over half of immigrants worked off an average of three years' servitude.

==Modern usage==
'''Bond indenture''' (also '''trust indenture''' or '''deed of trust''') is a [[legal document]] issued to lenders and describes key terms such as the [[interest rate]], [[maturity date]], [[convertible bond|convertibility]], pledge, promises, representations, covenants, and other terms of the bond offering. When the [[Prospectus (finance)|offering memorandum]] is prepared in advance of marketing a bond, the indenture will typically be summarised in the "description of notes" section.

In the United States, public debt offerings in excess of $10 million require the use of an indenture of trust under the [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]]. The rationale for this is that it is necessary to establish a collective action mechanism under which creditors can collect in a fair, orderly manner if [[default (finance)|default]] takes place (like that which occurs during [[bankruptcy]]).&lt;ref&gt;William J. Carney. ''Corporate Finance: Principles and Practice (University Casebook Series)''. Thomson-West. 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-58778-769-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No trust relationship exists between the bondholder and the issuing corporation. These two are in a regular contractual, [[arm's length principle|arm's length]], non-[[fiduciary]], non-[[equity (law)|equity]] relationship. Rather, the trustee in a "trust indenture" is a third party, usually a specialist company, who is appointed by the issuer to handle and safeguard the interests of the numerous public bondholders, in events ranging from the usual distribution of [[coupon (bond)|coupon]]s and [[principal (finance)|principal]] payments to dealing with the issuer's default, if any occurs.

'''[[Nahuatl]]''' has been in intense '''[[Language contact|contact]] with [[Spanish language|Spanish]]''' since the Spanish invasion of 1521. Since that time, there have been a large number of Spanish [[Loanword|loanwords]] introduced to the language, loans which span from nouns and verbs to adjectives and particles. [[Syntax|Syntactical constructions]] have also been borrowed into Nahuatl from Spanish, through which the latter language has exerted [[Linguistic typology|typological]] pressure on the form such that Nahuatl and Spanish are exhibiting syntactic and typological convergence. Today, hardly any Nahuatl monolinguals remain, and the language has undergone extreme shift to Spanish, such that some consider it be on the way to extinction.

The Nahuatl and Spanish languages have coexisted in stable contact for over 500 years in central [[Mexico]]. This long, well-documented period of contact provides some of the best linguistic evidence for contact-induced grammatical change. That is to say, Spanish seems to have exerted a profound influence on the Nahuatl language, but despite the extreme duration of their contact Nahuatl has only recently begun to show signs of language shift. This shift is progressing at a startling rate. Though Nahuatl still has over a million speakers, it is considered by some linguists to be endangered and on the way to extinction (''Hill &amp; Hill 1980, 321''). As with regional languages the world over, Nahuatl finds itself being replaced by a ‘world’ language, Spanish, as other small linguistic communities have shifted to languages like [[English language|English]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. The world’s loss in linguistic diversity can be tied to the its changing economic and political conditions, as the model of industrial capitalism under a culturally homogenizing nation state spread throughout the world and culture becomes more and more global rather than regional. However, we do not always know exactly why some local or ‘traditional’ languages are clung to and preserved while others vanish much more quickly (''Hill &amp; Hill, 1980, 321'').

== Contact history ==

=== Spanish conquest ===
Contact in earnest between the two languages began along with the beginning of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest of Mexico]] in 1519. Prior to that, Nahuatl existed as the dominant language of much of central, southern, and western Mexico, the language of the dominant [[Aztec|Aztec culture]] and [[Mexica]] ethnic group. Though the Spanish tried to eradicate much of Mexica culture after their defeat of the Mexica Aztec in their capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1521, Aztec culture and the Nahuatl language were spread among a variety of ethnic groups in Mexico, some of whom, like the Tlaxcala, were instrumental allies of the Spanish in their defeat of the Aztec empire. Since a large part of the surviving indigenous population, whom the Spanish hoped to [[Christianization|Christianize]] and assimilate, were part of the now fragmented Aztec culture and thus speakers of Nahuatl, the Spanish missionaries recognized that they would continue to need the help of their Nahuatl speaking indigenous allies, and allowed them some relative autonomy in exchange for their help in conquering and Christianizing the remainder of the territory, in parts of which indigenous populations remained hostile throughout the 16th century. In this way, friendly Nahuatl speaking communities were valuable in their role as intermediaries between the Spanish and other indigenous groups.

=== Growing marginalization and emerging shift ===
Though the Spanish issued many decrees throughout the centuries discouraging the uses of native tongues, such decrees were difficult to enforce, and often counter-productive to the goals of the missionary and military forces actually interacting with the indigenous populations (''Schmal, 2004'').{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} That is early Spanish [[Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King|Franciscan missionaries]] believed mutual comprehension between converter and convertee to be essential to a successful Christianization. Many such missionaries learned Nahuatl and developed a system of writing for the language with the [[Latin alphabet]], enabling them to transcribe many works of classical Nahuatl poetry and mythology, preserving the older, pre-contact varieties of the language. Thanks to the efforts of these early missionaries, we have documented sources of the Classical Nahuatl language dating back to the 1540s, which have enabled a systematic investigation of the changes it has undergone over the centuries under the influence of Spanish. Learning Nahuatl also enabled missionaries to teach the [[Gospel|Christian gospel]] to American Indians using evangelical materials prepared in the indigenous language and using indigenous concepts, a technique which certain sects, particularly the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], believed was often met with better results (Hill &amp; Hill, 1986). 

Thus, though Nahuatl usage was discouraged officially, its use was actually preserved and encouraged by the Spanish in religious, scholarly, and civil spheres into the late 18th century, until the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]] began to take a more hard-line approach towards assimilating indigenous populations into the state. By the time of the 1895 census, there were still 659,865 Mexican citizens who reported themselves to be monolingual Nahuatl speakers, which group represented 32.1% of the total indigenous-speaking population, but over the next century the number of monolingual Nahuatl speakers would decline. By 1930 there were reportedly 355,295 monolingual speakers, and as of the 2000 census there remain only approximately 220,000 monolinguals among the 1.5 million Nahuatl speakers, the vast majority of whom being middle-aged or elderly (Schmal, 2004). At this point, Spanish was well-integrated into most Mexicano communities, and language shift was rapidly occurring among the younger generations.

== Syntactic change ==
As there came to be greater and greater degrees of interaction between Indian and Hispanic communities and with it greater [[bilingualism]] and language contact, the Mexicano language changed typologically to converge with Spanish and ease the incorporation of Spanish material. Through the first few years of language contact, most Spanish influence of Nahuatl consisted in simple lexical borrowings of nouns related to the emergent material exchange between the two cultures. However, where the influence of Nahuatl on Mexican Spanish largely stopped at the level of basic lexical borrowings, Nahuatl continued on to borrow more grammatical words: verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, connective particles, and [[Discourse marker|discourse markers]]. Incorporation of such borrowed materials into the native language made forced some grammatical alterations to accommodate structures that would not be possible within Classical Nahuatl (''Flores Farfán, 2004'').{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} The net effect of such alterations was that “Nahuatl by 1700 or 1720 had become capable in principle of absorbing any Spanish word or construction. The rest has been done by continued, ever growing cultural pressures, bringing in more words and phrases as the two bodies of speakers became more intertwined and bilingualism increased (''Hill &amp; Hill, 1986'').” 

To be more specific, there has been convergence in word order, level of agglutination, and incorporation of Spanish grammatical particles and discourse markers in Nahuatl speech. For instance, whereas Nahuatl had an adjective-noun word order Mexicano follows Spanish in its noun-adjective word order (''Flores Farfán, 2004''). This may be due to the borrowing of phrases from Spanish incorporating the Spanish particle de, in phrases of the form NOUN + de + ADJ, e.g. aretes de oro meaning ‘gold earrings’ (''Hill &amp; Hill, 1986, 239''). Furthermore, the incorporation of de in Nahuatl may have also influenced a parallel shift from modifier-head to head-modifier in possessive constructions. That is, Classical Nahuatl had a possessor-possessum/noun-genitive order, but infiltration of the Spanish particle de may have also driven the shift to possessum-possessor/genitive-noun order. Whereas previously possessive noun clauses in the Nahuatl were markedly introduced by an inflected possessum plus and adjunctor in and a possessor, or unmarkedly simply by an possessor and inflected possessum (that is, the in particle was inserted in front of the displaced element of a marked word order), Nahuatl speakers have analyzed the loan de as functioning in a parallel fashion to native in, and used it to create unmarked possessum/possessor constructions in the manner of Spanish, without genitive inflections. 

So far this change has only spread to constructions with inanimate possessors, but it may extend further to compete with and displace Classical varieties and complete syntactic convergence (''Hill &amp; Hill, 1986, 243''). Parallel incorporation of Spanish prepositions in the previously postpositional language, along with Mexican Spanish discourse markers like pero, este, bueno, and pues have resulted in a modern Mexicano language that can sound strikingly Spanish in terms of its sentence frames, rhythm, and vocabulary (''Brody, 1995'').{{Full citation needed|date=January 2017}} Finally, some [[Agglutination|agglutinative tendencies]] of Nahuatl have faded in contemporary dialects. For instance, in Nahuatl there was a tendency to incorporate nouns into verbs as sorts of adverbial modifiers which is losing productivity (''Hill &amp; Hill, 1986, 259''). One could tortilla-make for instance. Verbs generally were accompanied by a wide variety of objective, instrumental, tense, and aspect markers. One commonly would agglutinatively indicate directional purposivity, for instance, but such constructions are now more commonly made with a periphrastic Spanish calque of the form GO + (bare) INF (a la ir + INF). Such disincorporation of verbal modifiers into periphrastic expressions on analogy with Spanish forms indicates a shift towards a more analytic style characteristic of Hispanic speech.

'''Nukapedia''' is a [[wiki]] about the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' [[fictional universe]]. It covers all of the ''Fallout'' video games, as well as all ''Fallout'' related content. Nukapedia runs on [[MediaWiki]] and is currently part of the [[Wikia]] network.

The site supports many foreign language Fallout wikis that operate independently of the main site, but offer a translation link between them; these languages include [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].

==History and description==
Nukapedia traces its history back to [[The Vault (wiki)|The Vault]], which was founded by [[Paweł Dembowski]]&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; and launched on February 7, 2005, initially hosted by ''Fallout'' fansite Duck and Cover,&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt; as a general source of information about the ''Fallout'' universe, initially focusing mostly on information about the ''Fallout'' world, as depicted in ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' and ''[[Fallout 2]]''. Its purpose was to continue the work started by ''Fallout 2'' developer [[Chris Avellone]] in his ''Fallout Bible'', which was meant to be a reference guide to the ''Fallout'' [[fictional universe]], but was abandoned after Avellone left [[Black Isle Studios]].&lt;ref name="News.com.au" /&gt; Since the launch, the wiki has expanded to include the entire ''Fallout'' series, both in terms of the fictional universe and in terms of gameplay information and help.

In October 2011, The Vault was split by its founder and many of the administrators moved The Vault branding to FalloutWiki.com, and later [http://fallout.gamepedia.com fallout.gamepedia.com], both hosted by Curse, along with a copy of all existing content at that time.&lt;ref name="The Vault" /&gt;  Despite this, much of the community, and traffic, stayed at the original location, and rechristened themselves Nukapedia.  Immediately focusing on growing content, their rolling coverage of the court case between Fallout franchise owner [[Bethesda Softworks]] and former owner [[Interplay Entertainment]] helped to establish their dominance after the split.

The site has continued to grow, launching new features and contests to help keep both regulars and new visitors coming to the site, often seeing as many as 1.1 million hits per day.  These contests have included "Fallout Apprentice", which in one round saw ''[[Fallout 2]]'' and ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' developer [[Chris Avellone]] as guest judge.

Prior to the split, in an interview with [[Eurogamer]], the wiki's founder has stated that it has even been used as a source by developers of recent ''Fallout'' games, citing one example of lore in ''[[Fallout 3]]'' being influenced by The Vault.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer" /&gt;

Nukapedia has also worked to make available several ''Fallout'' music tracks and cut scenes on its [https://www.youtube.com/user/NukapediaWiki YouTube Channel].

The '''Peabody Essex Museum''' ('''PEM''') in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], is a successor to the [[East India Marine Society]], established in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pem.org/about/museum_history PEM website]. "Museum history." Retrieved 2011-02-16&lt;/ref&gt;  It combines the collections of the former [[Peabody Museum of Salem]] (which acquired the Society's collection) and the [[Essex Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;''The manual of museum exhibitions'' by Gail Dexter Lord (Rowman Altamira, 2002) https://books.google.com/books?id=dTKb1kk88McC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pem.org/museum/new_museum.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202175349/http://pem.org/museum/new_museum.php |date=February 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum holds one of the major collections of [[Asian art]] in the United States. Its total holdings include about 1.3 million pieces, as well as twenty-two historic buildings.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ASh5AAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Peabody Essex Museum collections (Peabody Essex Museum, 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peabody Essex ranks among the top 20 art museums in the United States by measures including gallery space and endowment.  Once the Advancement Campaign is complete and the newly expanded museum opens in 2019, PEM will rank in the top 10 North American art museums in terms of gallery square footage, operating budget and endowment.  The PEM holds more than 840,000 works of historical and cultural art covering maritime, American, Asian, Oceanic and African art, Asian export art and two large libraries with over 400,000 books and manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323968304578250103690093908&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the '''[[Peabody Museum of Salem]]''' merged with the '''[[Essex Institute]]''' to form the '''Peabody Essex Museum'''.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Included in the merger was the legacy of the '''[[East India Marine Society]]''', established in 1799 by a group of Salem-based captains and [[supercargo]]es. Members of the Society were required by the society's charter to collect "natural and artificial curiosities" from beyond the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn. They were also required to personally circumnavigate the globe, and share navigational discoveries with other Society members, thereby increasing their chances of returning from their voyages safely.  Due to the institution's age, the items they donated to the collections are significant for their rare combination of age and provenance.  The East India Marine Society built the [[East India Marine Hall]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] now embedded in the museum's facilities, in the 1820s to house its collection.  This collection was acquired by the '''Peabody Academy of Science''' (later renamed the Peabody Museum of Salem) in 1867, along with the building, which continued to serve as a museum space through these mergers and acquisitions.

[[File:2006 PeabodyEssexMuseum Salem 114188713.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The [[East India Marine Hall]] is one of the oldest parts of the museum, built in 1825. The space is used for special events, and for temporary art installations]]
In 2003, the museum completed a massive $100 million renovation and expansion resulting in the Peabody Essex Museum opening a new wing designed by [[Moshe Safdie]], more than doubling the gallery space to 250,000 square feet (23,000 m²); this allowed the display of many items from its extensive holdings, which had previously been unknown to the public due to lack of capability to show them. At this time, the museum also opened to the public the [[Yin Yu Tang House]], an early 19th-century Chinese house from [[Anhui]] Province that had been disassembled in its original village and reconstructed in Salem.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In 2011, the Peabody Essex Museum announced it had raised $550 million, with plans to raise an additional $100 million by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wickedlocal.com/salem/features/x574923897/Peabody-Essex-announces-650-million-campaign Peabody Essex announces $650 million campaign], WickedLocal.com, November 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' reported this was the largest capital campaign in the museum's history, vaulting the Peabody Essex into the top tier of major art museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.boston.com/2011-11-06/ae/30367171_1_vaults-endowment-gallery Peabody Essex vaults into top tier by raising $550 million] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709211359/http://articles.boston.com/2011-11-06/ae/30367171_1_vaults-endowment-gallery |date=2012-07-09 }}, Boston Globe, November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The PEM trustee co-chairs [[CrossHarbor Capital Partners#Sam Byrne|Sam Byrne]] and [[Affiliated Managers Group#Sean M.

In May 2012, the PEM confirmed that its expansion will not be finished until 2019, due the unexpected death of museum architect [[Rick Mather]] in April 2012 and the search for his replacement.  The museum is still adding galleries, education space, and a restaurant, which will bring the total area to {{convert|550,000|sqft}}, making the PEM one of the largest art museums in the country.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} To replace architect Rick Mather, the firm of Ennead Architects was chosen after successfully completing the first phase of the building project, which included master planning and the renovation of the museum's Dodge wing, scheduled to open in November 2013. The museum's expansion project was to start in 2015, and the new wing will open to the public in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/ennead-replaces-rick-mather-on-peabody-essex-museum/8652023.article&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippe Saunier''' (born 1972) is a French [[art historian]] who is chief curator at the Bureau de l'inventaire des collections et de la circulation des biens culturels at [[Ministry of Culture (France)|ministry of culture]]. He was formerly with the [[Musée d'Orsay]] and the [[Musée Picasso]] in Paris. He is the author with Thea Burns of ''L'art du pastel'' (2014) which was translated into English and published by Abbeville Press in 2015 as ''The art of the pastel''.

==Career==
From 2004 to 2006, Saunier was a curator at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris. From 2006 to 2007, he was personal advisor for archeology and museums in the office of [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], a French Minister of Culture and Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://francearchives.fr/findingaid/3306a068ecb2d3bc817b775f72da47b9478870d2|title=Inventaire d'archives: CABINET DE RENAUD DONNEDIEU DE VABRES MINISTRE DE LA CULTURE ET DE LA COMMUNICATION DOSSIERS DE PHILIPPE SAUNIER, CONSEILLER TECHNIQUE CHARGE DES MUSEES ET DE L'ARCHEOLOGIE|work=FranceArchives|access-date=2018-03-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2008, he was a curator at the [[Musée Picasso]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laviedesidees.fr/_Saunier-Philippe_.html Philippe Saunier.] laviedesidees.fr Retrieved 18 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the commissioner of the exhibition ''Picasso and his Collection''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/portuguese/reporterbbc/story/2007/12/071220_picassocolecaopessoalai.shtml Barcelona expõe coleção particular de Picasso; veja fotos.] Anelise Infante, BBCBrasil.com, 21 December 2007. Retrieved 18 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the catalogue for the exhibition with [[Anne Baldassari]] which was published by the [[Queensland Art Gallery]] in Australia in 2008. Later, he was a curator of paintings and pastels at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] .

Saunier is now chief curator at the Bureau de l'inventaire des collections et de la circulation des biens culturels at [[Ministry of Culture (France)|ministry of culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://lannuaire.service-public.fr/gouvernement/administration-centrale-ou-ministere_167453 Bureau de l'inventaire des collections et de la circulation des biens culturels.] Service-Public.fr Retrieved 18 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunier is the author with Thea Burns of ''L'art du pastel'' (2014) which was translated into English and published by Abbeville Press in 2015 as ''The art of the pastel''.

The '''Progressive Socialist Party''' or '''PSP''' ({{lang-ar|الحزب التقدمي الاشتراكي}}, ''al-hizb al-taqadummi al-ishtiraki'', '''{{lang-fr|Parti socialiste progressiste}}''') is a [[List of political parties in Lebanon|political party]] in [[Lebanon]]. Its current leader is [[Walid Jumblatt]]. It is ideologically secular and officially non-sectarian, however, support for the party mainly comes from Lebanon's [[Druze]] community. {{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Origins==
The party was founded on 5 January 1949, and registered on 17 March the same year, under notification N°789. The founders comprised six individuals, all of different backgrounds. The most notable of these was [[Kamal Jumblatt]] (Walid Jumblatt's father). The others were [[Farid Jubran]], [[Albert Adeeb]], [[Abdallah Alayli]], [[Fouad Rizk]], and [[George Hanna (PSP)|George Hanna]].
The PSP held in [[Beirut]] the first conference for the [[Socialist Arab Parties]] in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Iraq]] in 1951. From 1951 through 1972 the party had between three and six deputies in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/krayem/krayem.html|title=Political Parties and Electoral Systems in Lebanon and Israel: Interactive Reinforcement|publisher=[[American University of Beirut]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The PSP in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990)==
Under Kamal Jumblatt's leadership, the PSP was a major element in the [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM) which supported Lebanon's Arab identity and sympathised with the Palestinians. Despite Jumblatt's initial reluctance to engage in paramilitarism, it built its own powerful military wing, the [[People’s Liberation Army (Lebanon)|People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) which proved to be one of the strongest private armies in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975 to 1990. It conquered much of [[Mount Lebanon]] and the [[Chouf District]]. Its main adversaries were the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Christian]] [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist]] [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]] militia, and later the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] militia (which absorbed the Phalangists). The PSP suffered a major setback in 1977, when Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. His son [[Walid Jumblatt|Walid]] succeeded him as leader of the party.

From the Israeli withdrawal from the Chouf in 1983 to the end of the civil war, the PSP ran a highly effective civil administration, the Civil Administration of the Mountain, in the area under its control. Tolls levied at PSP/PLA militia checkpoints provided a major source of income for the administration, which succeeded in providing a high standard of social and public services.

The PSP played an important role in the so-called [[Mountain War (Lebanon)|Mountain War]] under the lead of Walid Jumblatt: after the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) retreated from the [[Chouf District]], important battles took place there between the PSP/PLA and Christian militias. Both the [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist]] [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] militia and the PSP/PLA were accused of committing massacres and atrocities against one another as tit-for-tat (revenge killings). This was a sad hallmark of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] because the innocent people were the ones who paid the highest price.

==The post-war years==
Since the restoration of constitutional rule in 1989 PSP was the major ally of Syria in Lebanon and its leader Walid Jumblatt was in close relations with the Syrian Army and intelligence generals in Lebanon, namely [[Ghazi Kenaan]] and also with the Syrian Vice President [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;article=104563&amp;issueno=8576|title=خدام: مواقف دمشق وجنبلاط واحدة في المحطات الرئيسية وستبقى كذلك, أخبــــــار|newspaper=Asharq Alawsat|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSP participated in a number of governments, but, after the [[Syrian Accountability Act]] and the UN Resolution 1559 and the change of the balance of powers in the region after the occupation of Iraq, joined the opposition and took up a position opposed to the role of Syria in Lebanon's politics. Unlike some opponents of the Syrian presence, he did not oppose the presence of the Syrian army per se, but contended that the Syrian intelligence services were exerting undue influence.

Following the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, calling for a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, Jumblatt was particularly prominent in the opposition. However, he was opposed to the demand that [[Hezbollah]] be disarmed, and insisted on maintaining relations with the [[Shia]] [[Islamist]] party. Later, he has drifted into sharp opposition towards the group, and has decided to support their disarmament, claiming that Syria and Iran are trying to take over Lebanon through Hezbollah. After [[Assassination of Rafic Hariri|the assassination]] of [[Rafik Hariri]] in February 2005, Jumblatt joined the anti-Syria camp despite his long support to Syria.&lt;ref name=are2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudsen|first=Are|title=Precarious peacebuilding: Post-war Lebanon, 1990-2005|journal=CMI Working Paper|year=2005|volume=2|url=http://bora.cmi.no/dspace/bitstream/10202/103/1/Working%20paper%20WP%202005-12.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213221743/http://bora.cmi.no/dspace/bitstream/10202/103/1/Working%20paper%20WP%202005-12.pdf|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being part of [[14 March Alliance|the 14 March alliance]], PSP won 16 seats in [[Lebanese general election, 2005|the general elections]] held in 2005.&lt;ref name=safa06jan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Safa|first=Oussama|title=Lebanon springs forward|journal=Journal of Democracy|date=January 2006|volume=17|issue=1|url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Safa-17-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marwan Hamade called for dismantling of the communications system of Hezbollah on 5 May 2008, which created a huge response from Hezbollah and its allies. Clashes took place on 7 May 2008, as Hezbollah militia occupied Beirut.&lt;ref name="al-jazirah1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com.sa/114145/du16d.htm |title=News |newspaper=Al Jazirah |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214090039/http://www.al-jazirah.com.sa/114145/du16d.htm |archivedate=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict ended after both parties negotiated and reached an agreement at [[Doha]] in [[Qatar]] on 16 May 2008.&lt;ref name="al-jazirah1"/&gt;

In late January 2011, Jumblatt declared that he does not support the disarming of Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/161331.html|title=Nasrallah, Jumblatt talk Lebanon future|newspaper=PressTV|date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently PSP, Hezbollah and several other Lebanese political parties share a "[[Lebanese government of June 2011|national unity government]]" in [[Lebanon]].

==Details==
Richard Oliver Heslop was born 14 March 1842 in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]&lt;ref name=BladeyMisc&gt;{{cite web|title= Conrad Bladey's Beuk O' Newcassel Sangs|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/cbladey/sang/bards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at The Old Grammar School. He was a business man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wor Geordie songwriters|url=http://www.rolyveitch.20m.com/dialect_songwriters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; being joint owner of an Iron Merchants and Engineers, Heslop, Wilson and Budden, of 26 Sandhill and at the Stock Bridge (Stock Bridge, before its demolition, was reasonably close to Sallyport Gate). The company went into administration (or “Liquidation by arrangement or composition with creditors”)
according to the London Gazette of 6 November 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The London Gazette 6 November 1874|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/24148/pages/5275/page.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a great love of literature serving as President of the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne]] from 1914 until 1916. But in particular he loved [[North East England]] and the [[Northumberland]] and [[Geordie]] dialect and use of words.

He compiled several books and wrote numerous papers on the subject. His best known and most popular was “'Northumberland Words' (published in 2 volumes in 1893-4)“, the first real dialect dictionary of [[Geordie dialect words|Geordie]] words and their meanings, and a set of monumental works running to over 800 Pages.&lt;ref name=D&amp;TTDGMisc&gt;{{cite web|title=The Durham &amp; Tyneside Dialect Group|url=http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/durhamdialect/heslop.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dictionary was serialised weekly in the [[Evening Chronicle|Chronicle]] for a good number of months in the 1880s under the heading of “'Northumberland Words".&lt;ref name=D&amp;TTDGMisc/&gt; It was only later that the subtitle “'A glossary of words used in the County of Northumberland ---- etc" was added

He also wrote several poems and songs as a hobby and form of relaxation during his writing of the "Northumberland Words"

During his life, several addresses are given including (in 1874) 93 Gloster Street, and (in 1894) Akenside Hill, Newcastle upon Tyne.

He was awarded the honorary degree of [[Master of Arts]] (MA) from the [[University of Durham]] in September 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Monday |date=30 September 1901 |page_number=4 |issue=36573| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Oliver Heslop died in 1916.

'''Ross v Henderson''' [1977] 2 NZLR 458 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding illegal contracts that were later upheld that the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 had the power to validate (i.e. make legal) despite the fact that another legal enactment "deemed to be unlawful and shall have no effect".&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerbic &amp; Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Commercial Law |edition=5th |last1=Gerbic |first1=Philippa |last2=Lawrence |first2=Martin |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71714-9|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1971, Ross entered into an agreement to a 5-year lease his 345-acre dairy farm to Henderson, with an option to purchase the farm for $65,000.

As leases of 3 years or more are legally required to be registered with the Land Transfer Office, Henderson duly registered the lease, which included the option to purchase.

Unfortunately, the LTO standard declaration form, required under the law, was not designed for such a transaction, and later resulted in Henderson to of breached the law by not registering his purchase, making the sale illegal and of no effect.

In this background, in 1974 Ross's solicitor wrote to Henderson informing him that the sale of the farm had now come to an end.

Henderson filed in court for relief under the Illegal Contracts Act by having the sale agreement validated.

==Held==
The Privy Council ruled that as the law did not specifically rule out validation, then validation was possible, and given that the law was enacted to prevent undue aggregation of land, and that this was not an issue here, the court upheld the out of Appeals earlier decision to validate the sale agreement.

'''Footnote:''' This case is often cited along with the earlier Court of Appeal case of [[Harding v Coburn]] [1976] 2 NZLR 577.

In [[international relations]], the term '''smart power''' refers to the combination of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] strategies.  It is defined by the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] as "an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships, and institutions of all levels to expand one's influence and establish legitimacy of one's action."&lt;ref name="CSIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSIS Commission on Smart Power: A Smarter, More Secure America.|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/071106_csissmartpowerreport.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Nye]], former [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs]] under the [[Clinton administration]] and author of several books on smart power strategy, suggests that the most effective strategies in foreign policy today require a mix of hard and soft power resources.  Employing only hard power or only soft power in a given situation will usually prove inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavel|first=Doug|title=Joseph Nye on Smart Power|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/publications/insight/international/joseph-nye|publisher=Harvard University Kennedy School|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nye utilizes the example of [[terrorism]], arguing that combatting terrorism  demands smart power strategy.  He advises that simply utilizing soft power resources to change the hearts and minds of the Taliban government would be ineffective and requires a hard power component.  In developing relationships with the mainstream Muslim world, however, soft power resources are necessary and the use of hard power would have damaging effects.

According to [[Chester A. Crocker]], smart power "involves the strategic use of diplomacy, persuasion, capacity building, and the projection of power and influence in ways that are cost-effective and have political and social legitimacy"{{spaced ndash}}essentially the engagement of both military force and all forms of diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crocker, Chester A, |author2=Hampson, Fen Osler |author3=Aall, Pamela R.  |title=Leashing the Dogs of War: Conflict Management in a Divided World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8EJHUhAk7kC |publisher= US Institute of Peace Press |year=2007 |ISBN=978-1-929223-97-8 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Nye]]'s book describing the concept of "[[soft power]]"]]

The origin of the term "smart power" is under debate and has been attributed to both [[Suzanne Nossel]] and [[Joseph Nye]].

Suzanne Nossel, Deputy to Ambassador Holbrooke at the United Nations during the Clinton administration, is credited with coining the term in an article in [[Foreign Affairs]] entitled, "Smart Power: Reclaiming Liberal Internationalism", in 2004.&lt;ref name="Nossel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nossel|first=Suzanne|title=Smart Power|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/59716/suzanne-nossel/smart-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article in the CNN, she has criticized the Trump administration for its "tunnel-vision" foreign policy that neglects both soft power and smart power. She writes: "..Trump seems oblivious toward the brand value of what Joseph Nye has called the 'soft power' that comes from projecting appealing aspects of American society and character abroad. He is also indifferent to my own concept of 'smart power,'or the imperative to engage a broad range of tools of statecraft, from diplomacy to aid to private sector engagement to military intervention."&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/05/opinions/trumps-worrying-foreign-policy-nossel-opinion/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Nye]], however, claims that smart power is a term he introduced in 2003 "to counter the misperception that soft power alone can produce effective foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft Power|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65163/joseph-s-nye-jr/get-smart?page=1|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created the term to name an alternative to the hard power-driven foreign policy of the Bush administration.  Nye notes that smart power strategy denotes the ability to combine hard and soft power depending on whether hard or soft power would be more effective in a given situation.  He states that many situations require soft power; however, in stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons program, for instance, hard power might be more effective than soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Wielding Smart Power in World Affairs|url=http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu.node/6279|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of the ''Financial Times'', "to win the peace, therefore, the US will have to show as much skill in exercising soft power as it has in using hard power to win the war."&lt;ref&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Smart power addresses multilateralism and enhances foreign policy.

A successful smart power narrative for the United States in the twenty-first century, Nye argues, will not obsess over power maximization or the preservation of hegemony. Rather, it will find "ways to combine resources into successful strategies in the new context of power diffusion and the 'rise of the rest.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|pages=207–208|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A successful smart power strategy will provide answers to the following questions: 1) What goals or outcomes are preferred?&lt;ref name="Nye The Future of Power 208"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) What resources are available and in which contexts?&lt;ref name="Nye The Future of Power 208" /&gt; 3) What are the positions and preferences of the targets of attempts at influence?&lt;ref name="Nye The Future of Power 208" /&gt; 4) Which forms of power behavior are most likely to succeed?&lt;ref name="Nye Future of Power 209"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5) What is the probability of success?&lt;ref name="Nye Future of Power 209"/&gt;

==History==
===United Kingdom===
{{Further|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}
Since the period of ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (1815–1914) the [[United Kingdom]] has employed a combination of influence and coercion in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sondhaus|first1=Lawrence|title=Soft power, hard power, and the Pax Americana|date=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415545331|pages=204–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujlMly6WVxIC&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term smart power emerged in the past decade, but the concept of smart power has much earlier roots in the history of the United States and is a popular notion in international relations today.

1901:  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaims: "[[Big Stick ideology|Speak softly and carry a big stick]]."

1948:  The United States initiates major peacetime soft power programs under the authority of the [[Smith–Mundt Act|Smith-Mundt Act]], including broadcasting, exchange and information world wide to combat the outreach of the [[Soviet Union]].

1991:  The end of the [[Cold War]] was marked by the collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]], which fell as a result of a combination of hard and soft power.  Throughout the Cold War, hard power was used to deter Soviet aggression and soft power was used to erode faith in Communism.  Joseph Nye said: "When the Berlin Wall finally collapsed, it was destroyed not by artillery barrage but by hammers and bulldozers wielded by those who had lost faith in communism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft Power|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65163/joseph-s-nye-jr/get-smart?page=1|publisher=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004:  Joseph S. Nye introduces the term "smart power" in his book, "Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics".  "Smart power is neither hard nor soft.  It is both," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph|title=Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics|year=2004|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an article in "Foreign Affairs", analyst Suzanne Nossel uses the term "smart power".  For Nossel, "Smart power means knowing that the United States' own hand is not always its best tool: U.S. interests are furthered by enlisting others on behalf of U.S. goals."&lt;ref name="Nossel"/&gt;

2007:  In light of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] was criticized for placing too much emphasis on a hard power strategy.  To counter this hard power strategy, the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] released the "Commission on Smart Power" to introduce the concept of smart power into discussion on which principles should guide the future of U.S. foreign policy in light of 9/11 and the war in Iraq.&lt;ref name="CSIS" /&gt;   The report identifies five critical areas of focus for the U.S.: Alliances, [[Global Development]], [[Public diplomacy|Public Diplomacy]], [[Economic integration|Economic Integration]], and Technology and Innovation.&lt;ref name="CSIS" /&gt;   According to the report, these five goals constitute smart foreign policy and will help the United States achieve the goal of "American preeminence as an agent of good."&lt;ref name="CSIS" /&gt;

2009: [[The Center for Strategic and International Studies]], released a second report, "Investing in a New [[Multilateralism]]", to address the concept of smart power in international releases.  This report addressed the United Nations as an instrument of U.S. smart power.  By collaborating with the UN, the U.S. can lead the way in reinvigorating multilateralism within in the international community in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing in a New Multilateralism|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090128_mendelsonforman_un_smartpower_web.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2009: Under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], smart power became a core principle of his foreign policy strategy.  It was popularized by [[Hillary Clinton]] during her Senate confirmation hearing on January 13, 2009 for the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;We must use what has been called smart power---the full range of tools at our disposal---diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural---picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.  With smart power, diplomacy will be the vanguard of foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|title=Clinton: Use "Smart Power" in Diplomacy|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-4718044.html|publisher=CBSNews|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Both [[Suzanne Nossel]] and [[Joseph Nye]] were supportive of Clinton's encouragement of smart power, since it would popularize the use of smart power in U.S. foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Etheridge|first=Eric|title=How Soft Power got Smart|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/how-soft-power-got-smart/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   That popularization has been accompanied by more frequent use of the term, and [[David Ignatius]] describes it as an "overused and vapid phrase meant to connote the kind of power between hard and soft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ignatius, David|title=In ‘Hard Choices,’ Hillary Clinton opens up about world leaders and what she got right|date=June 19, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-hard-choices-hillary-clinton-opens-up-about-world-leaders-and-what-she-got-right/2014/06/09/b4ecc0d2-efeb-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.html|work=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010:  The "First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR)" entitled, "Leading through Civilian Power", called for the implementation of a smart power strategy through civilian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review: Leading through Civilian Power|url=https://www.state.gov/s/dmr/qddr/|publisher=Department of State|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011: Obama's "2011 May Speech on the Middle East and North Africa" called for a smart power strategy, incorporating development, in addition to defense and diplomacy, as the third pillar of his foreign policy doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama's Speech on the Middle East and North Africa|url=http://www.cfr.org/middle-east/obamas-speech-middle-east-north-africa-may-2011/p25049|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary application==
===United Kingdom===
The UK government [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015]] was based on a combination of hard power and soft power strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf|date=November 2015|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review and its Implications|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-2015-strategic-defence-and-security-review-and-its-implications|publisher=Gresham College|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review — Motion to Take Note|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2015-12-03a.1250.0|publisher=TheyWorkForYou|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker to call for 2015 review to focus more on long-term strategy and 'smart power'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/24/labour-defence-review-cyberwar-threat|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart power in defence|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/2012-03-13-smart-power-in-defence|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]] in 2018, the National Security Review described a "fusion doctrine", that will combine resources from [[British intelligence agencies]], the [[British Armed Forces]], [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|foreign relations]] and economic considerations to defeat the UK's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43562411|title=Security boost over Russia threat and terror|date=2018-03-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/03/27/britain-launch-counter-propaganda-war-against-russia-theresa/|title=Britain to launch counter-propaganda war against Russia as Theresa May unveils 'Fusion Doctrine' defence plan|last=McCann|first=Kate|date=2018-03-27|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-28|last2=Farmer|first2=Ben|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In recent years, some scholars have sought to differentiate smart power further from soft power, while also including military posture and other tools of statecraft as part of a broad smart power philosophy. [[Christian Whiton]], a [[State Department]] official during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], described smart power in a 2013 book, ''[[Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War]]'', as: "the many financial, cultural, rhetorical, economic, espionage-related, and military actions that states can take short of general war to influence political outcomes abroad," adding, "It most crucially should involve a revival of political warfare: the non-violent push of ideas, people, facts, and events with which our adversaries would rather not contend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheDC Interview: Christian Whiton explains ‘smart power’|url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/07/thedc-interview-christian-whiton-explains-smart-power|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiton recalled U.S. political influence activities from the [[Cold War]], including [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed programs like the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], and called for adapting these to contemporary challenges to the U.S. posed by China, Iran, and Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warfare of Ideas’|url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/print/articles/warfare-ideas_756460.html|publisher=The Weekly Standard|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges in the application of smart power==
According to "Dealing with Today's Asymmetric Threat to U.S. and Global Security", a symposium sponsored by [[CACI]], an effective smart power strategy faces multiple challenges in transitioning from smart power as a theory to smart power in practice.  Applying smart power today requires great difficulty, since it operates in an environment of asymmetric threats, ranging from cybersecurity to terrorism.  These threats exist in a dynamic international environment, adding yet another challenge to the application of smart power strategy.  In order to effectively address asymmetric threats arising in a dynamic international environment, the symposium suggests addressing the following factors: [[rule of law]], organizational roadblocks, financing smart power, and strategic communications.&lt;ref name="DwTAT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing with Today's Asymmetric Threat to U.S. and Global Security|url=http://asymmetricthreat.net/docs/asymmetric_threat_3_paper.pdf|publisher=CACI|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule of law===
{{See also|Rule of law}}
In order to implement smart power approaches on both a domestic and international level, the United States must develop a legal framework for the use of smart power capabilities.  Developing a legal foundation for smart power, however, demands a clear concept of these asymmetric threats, which is often difficult. The cyber domain, for instance, presents an extremely nebulous concept.  Hence, the challenge will be conceptualizing asymmetric threats before formulating a legal framework.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

===Organizational roadblocks===

The inability to promote smart power approaches because of organizational failures within agencies presents another obstacle to successful smart power implementation.  Agencies often lack either the appropriate authority or resources to employ smart power.  The only way to give smart power long-term sustainability is to address these organizational failures and promote the coordination and accessibility of hard and soft power resources.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

===Financing smart power===

With the ongoing financial crisis, the dire need for financial resources presents a critical obstacle to the implementation of smart power.  According to Secretary Gates, 'there is a need for a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security---diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and development."  In order to successfully implement smart power, the U.S. budget needs to be rebalanced so that non-military foreign affairs programs receive more funding.  Sacrificing defense spending will, however, be met with stalwart resistance.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

===Strategic communications===

"Asymmetries of perception," according to the report, are a major obstacle to strategic communications.  A long-term smart power strategy will mitigate negative perceptions by discussing the nature of these threats and making a case for action using smart power strategy.  The report states that the central theme of our strategic communications campaign should be education of our nation in our values as a democratic nation and in the nature of the threats our nation faces today.&lt;ref name="DwTAT" /&gt;

==United Nations as an instrument of smart power==
Of all the tools at the disposal of smart power strategists in the United States, experts suggest that the U.N. is the most critical.  The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] issued a report, ''Investing in a New Multilateralism'', in January 2009 to outline the role of the [[United Nations]] as an instrument of U.S. smart power strategy.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism" /&gt;   The report suggests that in an increasingly multipolar world, the UN cannot be discarded as outdated and must be regarded as an essential tool to thinking strategically about the new multilateralism that our nation faces.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism" /&gt;   An effective smart power strategy will align the interests of the U.S. and the UN, thereby effectively addressing threats to peace and security, climate change, global health, and humanitarian operations.&lt;ref name="Multilateralism" /&gt;

==Global perspectives on smart power==

===U.S.-China relations===

As announced by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] in November 2011, the United States will begin to shift its attention to the Asia-Pacific region, making the strategic relationship between the U.S. and China of supreme importance in determining the future of international affairs in the region.  The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], in "Smart Power in U.S.-China Relations," offers recommendations for building a cooperative strategic relationship between the U.S. and China through smart power strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Power Relations in U.S.-China Relations|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090309_mcgiffert_uschinasmartpower_web.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather than relying on unilateral action, the U.S. and China should combine their smart power resources to promote the global good and enhance the peace and security of the region.  The report recommends the following policy objectives: implement an aggressive engagement agenda, launch an action agenda on energy and climate, and institute a new dialogue on finance and economics.  Overall, the report suggests that U.S.-Sino relations should be pursued without the black-and-white view of China as either benign or hostile, but rather, as a partner necessary in serving the interests of the U.S. and the region while promoting the global good.

===U.S-Turkish Relations===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ObamashakeshandswithTurkishPrimeMinister.jpg|thumb|right|Obama shakes hands with Turkish Prime Minister]] --&gt;
The Obama administration continually stresses the importance of smart power strategy in relations with the Middle East and especially [[Turkey]] due to its increasing leadership role as a [[Regional power|regional soft power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fotoui|first=Eleni|title=Smart Power and U.S. Turkish Relations|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_18793-544-2-30.pdf|publisher=Expert Advisory Group (EAG)|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As not only an Islamic democratic nation but also the only Muslim member of [[NATO]], Turkey's leverage in the region could inspire other nations to follow in its footsteps. By establishing a cooperative relationship with Turkey and working to clarify misunderstandings through smart power, Turkey could eventually become the bridge between the East and the West.  A smart power approach to U.S.-Turkish relations will expand the leadership role of Turkey in the region and increases its strategic importance to NATO.

==Debate surrounding smart power==

===Transformational diplomacy versus smart power strategy===

[[Condoleezza Rice]], Bush's Secretary of State, coined the term "[[Transformational Diplomacy]]" to denote Bush's policy to promote democracy through a hard power driven strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimitrova|first=Anna|title=Obama's Foreign Policy: Between Pragmatic Realism and Smart Diplomacy|url=http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/culturaldiplomacynews/participant-papers/academy/Anna-Dimitrova-Obama's-Foreign-Policy-Between-Pragmatic-Realism-and-Smart-Diplomacy.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Transformational diplomacy" stands at odds with "smart power," which utilizes hard and soft power resources based on the situation.  The Obama administration's foreign policy was based on smart power strategy, attempting to strike a balance between defense and diplomacy.

===Smart power as an instrument of American imperialism===

In an interview with the [[Boston Globe]], interviewer Anna Mundow, questioned Joseph Nye over the criticism that smart power is the friendly face of [[American imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mundow|first=Anna|title=Wielding "Smart Power" in World Affairs|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2011/02/06/wielding_smart_power_in_world_affairs/|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By the same token, the [[Bush Doctrine|Bush doctrine]] has also been criticized for being "imperialistic," by focusing on American power over partnerships with the rest of the world.  [[Joseph Nye]] defends smart power by noting that criticism often stems from a misunderstanding of the smart power theory.  Nye himself designed the theory to apply to any nation of any size, not just the United States.  It was meant to be a more sophisticated method of thinking about power in the context of the [[Information Age|information age]] and [[post-9/11]] world.19  President Obama defined his vision for U.S. leadership as "not in the spirit of a patron but the spirit of a partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimitrova|first=Anna|title=Obama's Foreign Policy: Between Pragmatic Realism and Smart Policy?|url=http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/culturaldiplomacynews/participant-papers/academy/Anna-Dimitrova-Obama's-Foreign-Policy-Between-Pragmatic-Realism-and-Smart-Diplomacy.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ineffective use of smart power===

[[Ken Adelman]], in an article entitled "Not-So-Smart Power," argues that there is no correlation between U.S. aid and the ability of America to positively influence events abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adelman|first=Ken|title=Not-So-Smart Power|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/18/not_so_smart_power?page=full|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He points out that the nations who receive the most foreign aid, such as [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]], are no more in tune with American values than those who receive less or no U.S. foreign aid.  Overall, he criticizes the instruments of smart power, such as foreign aid and exchange programs, for being ineffective in achieving American national interests.

===Questioning old institutions and alliances===

In the application of smart power in U.S. strategy, Ted Galen Carpenter, author of the work ''Smart Power''', criticizes U.S. foreign policy for failing to question outdated alliances, such as NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bandow|first=Doug|title=A Prudent Foreign Policy|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0908f.asp|publisher=Freedom Daily|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Carpenter articulated his disapproval of [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]], saying, "America does not need to be — and should not aspire to be — a combination [[global policeman]] and global social worker."  Rather than utilizing antiquated institutions, the U.S. should rethink certain alliances in arriving at a new vision for the future of American foreign policy.  Carpenter fears that America's domestic interests will be sacrificed in favor of global interests through smart power.  Essentially, interventionist foreign policies advocated by U.S. smart power strategies undercut domestic liberties.

'''Social defeat''' refers to losing a confrontation among [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] animals, or any kind of hostile dispute among [[humans]], in either a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] or in a group-individual context, potentially generating very significant practical and [[psychological]] consequences in terms of control over resources, access to mates and social positions.

==Background==

Research on [[social stress]] has accumulated a useful body of knowledge, providing perspective on the effects of detrimental social and environmental interaction on the brain. Research and experimentation suffer from many methodological difficulties: usually a lack of ecological validity (similarity with natural conditions and stressors) or are not amenable to scientific investigation (difficult to test and verify).

Social psychology approaches to human [[aggression]] have developed a multitude of perspectives, based on observations of human phenomena like bullying, mobbing, physical and verbal abuse, relational and indirect aggression, etc. Despite the richness of theories developed, the body of knowledge generated has not satisfied scientific requirements of [[testability]] and [[falsifiability|verifiability]].

Animal studies of within-species aggression developed in 2 main branches: A) approaches based on laboratory experiments, on controlled conditions, allowing the measurement of behavioral, [[endocrine]] and [[neurological]] variables, but with the shortcoming of applying unnatural stressors (such as foot-shocks and restraint stress) in unnatural conditions (laboratory cages rarely approximate native habitats); B) approaches based on observations of animals in naturalistic settings, which avoided artificial environments and unnatural stresses, but usually not allowing the measurement of physiological effects or the manipulation of relevant variables.

In real life situations, animals (including humans) have to cope with [[Stress (biological)|stresses]] generated within their own species, during their interactions with conspecifics, especially due to recurrent struggles over the control of limited resources, mates and [[Social hierarchy|social positions]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003).

Social defeat is a source of chronic [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] in animals and humans, capable of causing significant changes in behaviour, [[brain]] functioning, [[physiology]], [[neurotransmitter]] and [[hormone]] levels, and [[health]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003).

==History==
The social defeat approach was originated from animal experiments, using the "resident-intruder" [[paradigm]], in which an animal was placed in the cage of another animal or group of animals of the same species, in a manner that allowed a non-lethal conflict.

If animals are allowed to fight on a single occasion only, it is usually regarded as a model of acute stress; if they are allowed to fight on several different occasions, on different days, consecutive or not, it is regarded as a model of chronic stress. 
After the defeat or in the interval between fights, the subordinate animal may also be exposed to threats from the dominant one, by having to stay in a cage or compartment beside or nearby the dominant, exposed to its visual or olfactory cues.

Later, the social defeat approach was also applied to observations of animal within-species aggression, in the wild, which suggested that the hypotheses generated on artificial laboratory settings can also be applied in observed in natural settings, confirming the predictions of the model.

==In humans==
It has been proposed that animal models of social conflict may be useful for studying a number of [[mental disorders]], including [[major depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[drug abuse]], aggressive psychopathologies, [[eating disorders]] and [[schizophrenia]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Selten &amp; Cantor-Graae, 2005; Rohde, 2001).

The social defeat model has been extended to include observations of human [[aggression]], [[bullying]], [[relational aggression]], chronic subordination and [[humiliation]].  The social defeat model attempts to extend animal studies to include human behaviour as well, in contrast to the [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] study of aggression, in which comparisons are drawn exclusively from experiments involving humans (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001).

Bullying has interesting parallels with animal models of social defeat, the bully being equivalent to the dominant animal and the victim the subordinate one. At stake are possessions of material objects, money, etc., social position in the group, represented by in-group prestige, and the consequent lack of access to mates, including for socio-sexual behaviors like copulation. Human victims typically experience symptoms like low self-esteem (due to low regard by the group), feelings of depression (due to unworthiness of efforts), social withdrawal (reduced investments in the social environment), anxiety (due to a threatening environment), and they can also be shown to experience a plethora of physiological effects, e.g. increased corticosterone levels, and also a shift towards sympathetic balance in the autonomic nervous system (Bjorkqvist, 2001).

Research about human aggression, usually conducted by psychologists or social psychologists, resembles to a great extent the research about social defeat and animal aggression, usually conducted by biologists or physiological psychologists. However, there is the problem of the use of different terminologies for similar concepts, which hinders communication between the two bodies of knowledge (Bjorkqvist, 2001).

Similarly, research on depression has employed similar constructs, such as [[learned helplessness]], although that theory is focused on the perceived inability to escape any sort of negative stimuli rather than on social factors.

===Behavioral and physiological effects===
Social defeat is a very potent [[Stress (medicine)|stressor]] and can lead to a variety of behavioral effects, like social withdrawal (reduced interactions with conspecifics), lethargy (reduced locomotor activity), reduced exploratory behavior (of both open field and novel objects), anhedonia (reduced reward-related behaviors), decreased socio-sexual behaviors (including decreased attempts to mate and copulate after defeat), various motivational deficits, decreased levels of testosterone (due to a decline in the functionality of the Leydig cells of the testes), increased tendencies to stereotyped behaviours and [[Self medication|self-administration of drugs and alcohol]] (Rygula et alli, 2005; Huhman, 2006).

Research also implicates that the referred behavioral effects are moderated by neuroendocrine phenomena involving [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and in the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]], [[locus ceruleus]] and [[limbic system]]s (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; Selten &amp; Cantor-Graae, 2005; Marinia et alli, 2006; Huhman, 2006).

Both animal and human studies suggest that the social environment has a strong influence on the consequences of stresses. This finding seems to be especially true in the case of social stresses, like social defeat (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; de Jong et alli, 2005).

In animal studies, animals housed collectively showed reduced symptoms after defeat, in comparison with those housed alone; and animals that live in more stable groups (with stable hierarchies, less intra-group aggression) exhibit reduced effects after a defeat, in comparison with those housed in a more unstable group (de Jong et alli, 2005). In separate studies, defeat behaviors can be modulated by acetylcholine (Smith et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=RS|last2=Hu|first2=R|last3=DeSouza|first3=A|last4=Eberly|first4=CL|last5=Krahe|first5=K|last6=Chan|first6=W|last7=Araneda|first7=RC|title=Differential Muscarinic Modulation in the Olfactory Bulb.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=29 July 2015|volume=35|issue=30|pages=10773–85|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0099-15.2015|pmid=26224860|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/30/10773.long|accessdate=6 August 2015|pmc=4518052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In human studies, individuals with greater [[Social support|support]] seem to be protected against excessive neuroendocrine activation, thereby reducing the adverse effects of stresses in general, and especially stresses of social origin. 
  
This apparent confusion, in which social defeat generates behavioral and neuroendocrine effects, both of which depending on social contextual variables, raises the question of how to interpret this data. A useful concept is the concept of “causal chain”, in which recurrent evolutionary events, in this case intra-specific competition, generates [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that last for thousands of generations, influencing a whole species. This way physiological phenomena may evolve, in this case the referred neuro-endocrine phenomena, to facilitate adaptive patterns of action by individuals, in this case the referred behavioral effects. According to this framework, selective pressures generated by intra-specific competition can be considered as the ultimate cause, the neuroendocrine phenomena can be considered to be the proximate causes (sometimes also called mechanisms or moderators) and the observed behavioral alterations are considered the effects (the end events in the causal chain)(Gilbert et alli, 2002; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003; Rygula et alli, 2005).

Some authors, for example [[Randolph Nesse]], warn us that patterns of behavior commonly considered inappropriate or even pathological may well have adaptive value. According to this view, several authors propose that behaviors considered abnormal may be in fact part of an adaptive response to stressors in modern or at least in old environments, for example social stressors from chronic subordination or interpersonal conflicts (Gilbert et alli, 2002; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003). [[Evolutionary psychology]] provides several possible explanations for why humans typically respond to social dynamics in the way that they do, including possible functions of [[self-esteem]] in relation to [[dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]].

The '''St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt Route) Steam Locomotive #336''' is a historic railroad steam locomotive, located at the [[Arkansas Railroad Museum]] in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. It is a Class D3 [[2-6-0]] Mogul-style locomotive, built in 1909 by the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Douglas C.|title=St. Louis Southwestern Ry No. 336|url=http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=34|website=SteamLocomotive.info|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served on the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway]] (aka the Cotton Belt Route) until 1947, and served industrial customers until 1963. It was placed on display in [[Lewisville, Arkansas]] until 1994, when it was donated to the museum. It is the last remaining 330-series locomotive (of ten) used by the Cotton Belt.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National-Register-Listings/PDF/JE0575.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt Route) Steam Locomotive #336|accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Top500_logo.png|thumb|TOP500 project logo]]

The '''TOP500''' project ranks and details the 500 most powerful non-[[distributed computing|distributed]] [[computer]] systems in the world. The project was started in 1993 and publishes an updated list of the [[supercomputer]]s twice a year. The first of these updates always coincides with the [[International Supercomputing Conference]] in June, and the second is presented at the [[ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference]] in November. The project aims to provide a reliable basis for tracking and detecting trends in high-performance computing and bases rankings on HPL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/|title=HPL – A Portable Implementation of the High-Performance Linpack Benchmark for Distributed-Memory Computers &lt;!--Version 2.2--&gt; |work=ICL – UTK Computer Science Department |authors=A. Petitet, R. C. Whaley, J. Dongarra, A. Cleary |date=24 February 2016 |access-date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a portable implementation of the high-performance [[LINPACK]] [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] written in Fortran for distributed-memory computers.

[[China]] currently dominates the list with 229 supercomputers, leading the second place ([[United States]]) by a record margin of 121. Since June 2018, the American [[Summit (supercomputer)|Summit]] is the world's most powerful supercomputer, reaching 143.5 peta[[FLOPS]] on the [[LINPACK benchmarks]].

The TOP500 list is compiled by [[Jack Dongarra]] of the [[University of Tennessee]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], Erich Strohmaier and Horst Simon of the [[National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center]] (NERSC) and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL), and from 1993 until his death in 2014, [[Hans Meuer]] of the [[University of Mannheim]], [[Germany]].

In the early 1990s, a new definition of supercomputer was needed to produce meaningful statistics. After experimenting with metrics based on processor count in 1992, the idea arose at the [[University of Mannheim]] to use a detailed listing of installed systems as the basis. In early 1993, [[Jack Dongarra]] was persuaded to join the project with his [[LINPACK benchmarks]]. A first test version was produced in May 1993, partly based on data available on the Internet, including the following sources:&lt;ref name="hpcwire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/10219.html |title=An Interview with Jack Dongarra by Alan Beck, editor in chief HPCwire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004531/http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/10219.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="netlib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/top500/reports/report93/section2_16_4.html |title=Statistics on Manufacturers and Continents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information from those sources was used for the first two lists. Since June 1993, the TOP500 is produced bi-annually based on site and vendor submissions only.

Since 1993, performance of the {{Numero|1}} ranked position has grown steadily in accordance with [[Moore's law]], doubling roughly every 14 months. {{As of|2018|06}}, ''[[Summit (supercomputer)|Summit]]'' was fastest with an Rpeak&lt;ref&gt;''Rpeak''{{snd}}This is the theoretical peak performance of the system. Measured in PFLOPS.&lt;/ref&gt; of 187.6593&amp;nbsp;P[[FLOPS]]. For comparison, this is over 1,432,513 times faster than the [[Connection Machine]] CM-5/1024 (1,024 cores), which was the fastest system in November 1993 (twenty-five years prior) with an Rpeak of 131.0&amp;nbsp;G[[FLOPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/sublist|title=Sublist Generator|publisher=|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture and operating systems ==
In June 2016, a Chinese computer made the top based on [[SW26010]] processors, a new, radically modified, model in the [[Sunway (processor)|Sunway]] (or ShenWei) line.

{{As of|2018|06}}, TOP500 supercomputers are now all [[64-bit computing|64-bit]], mostly based on [[x86-64]] [[CPU]]s ([[Intel]] [[EMT64]] and [[AMD]] [[AMD64]] [[instruction set architecture]]), with few exceptions (all based on [[reduced instruction set computing]] (RISC) architectures) including 15 supercomputers based on [[Power Architecture]] used by [[IBM POWER microprocessors]], six [[SPARC]] (all with [[Fujitsu]]-designed SPARC-chips, one of which—the [[K computer]]—surprisingly made the top in 2011 without a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], currently ranked 16th, while only dropping to 3rd on the [[HPCG_benchmark|HPCG list]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/hpcg/lists/2018/06/|title=HPCG - June 2018 {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|website=www.top500.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and two, seemingly related, Chinese designs: the [[ShenWei]]-based (ranked 11 in 2011, ranked 158th in November 2016) and [[Sunway (processor)|Sunway SW26010]]-based ranked 1 in 2016, making up the remainder (another non-US design is PEZY-SC, while it is an accelerator paired with Intel's Xeon). Before the ascendance of [[32-bit]] [[x86]] and later [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[x86-64]] in the early 2000s, a variety of RISC processor families made up most TOP500 supercomputers, including RISC architectures such as [[SPARC]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]].

In recent years [[heterogeneous computing]], mostly using [[Nvidia]]'s [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) as [[coprocessor]]s, has become a popular way to reach a better [[performance per watt]] ratio and higher absolute performance; it is almost required for good performance and to make the top (or top 10), with some exceptions, such as the mentioned SPARC computer without any coprocessors. An x86-based coprocessor, [[Xeon Phi]], has also been used.

[[File:Processor families in TOP500 supercomputers.svg|600px|thumb|center|Share of processor architecture families in TOP500 supercomputers by time trend]]

All the fastest supercomputers in the decade since the [[Earth Simulator]] supercomputer have used operating systems based on [[Linux]]. {{As of|2017|11|since=y}}, all the listed supercomputers (100% of the performance share) use an operating system based on the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref name=top500stats&gt;{{cite web|title=Top500 – List Statistics |date=November 2017 |url=https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1|publisher=Top500.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linux Runs All of the World’s Fastest Supercomputers|url=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/linux-runs-all-of-the-worlds-fastest-supercomputers/|publisher=The Linux Foundation|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 2015, no computer on the list runs [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. In November 2014,&lt;!-- may have gotten bigger but not bothered to get reevaluated for list? Would it still make the list? "Faenov" 2012/11: nr.165, 2014/06: nr.434--&gt; [[Windows Azure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/site/50454|title=Microsoft Windows Azure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; cloud computer was no longer on the list of fastest supercomputers (its best rank was 165 in 2012), leaving the [[Shanghai Supercomputer Center|Shanghai Supercomputer Center's]] ''Magic Cube'' as the only Windows-based supercomputer on the list, until it also dropped off the list. It had been ranked 436 in its last appearance on the list released in June 2015, while its best rank was 11 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/system/176118|title=Magic Cube – Dawning 5000A, QC Opteron 1.9&amp;nbsp;GHz, Infiniband, Windows HPC 2008|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been well over a decade since [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]-based systems (meaning used as host CPUs) dropped entirely off the list&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/system/167525|title=ORIGIN 2000 195/250 MHz {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|website=www.top500.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[Gyoukou (supercomputer)|Gyoukou]]'' supercomputer that jumped to 4th place in November 2017 (after a huge upgrade) has MIPS as a small part of the coprocessors. Use of 2,048-core coprocessors (plus 8× 6-core MIPS, for each, that "no longer require to rely on an external Intel Xeon E5 host processor"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/pezy/pezy-scx/pezy-sc2|title=PEZY-SC2 - PEZY|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) make the supercomputer much more energy efficient than the other top 10 (i.e. it is 5th on [[Green500]] and other such ''ZettaScaler-2.2''-based systems take first three spots).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/191/the-2048-core-pezy-sc2-sets-a-green500-record/|title=The 2,048-core PEZY-SC2 sets a Green500 record|date=2017-11-01|work=WikiChip Fuse|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en-US |quote=Powering the ZettaScaler-2.2 is the PEZY-SC2. The SC2 is a second-generation chip featuring twice as many cores{{snd}} i.e., 2,048 cores with 8-way SMT for a total of 16,384 threads. [..] The SC incorporated two ARM926 cores and while that was sufficient for basic management and debugging its processing power was inadequate for much more. The SC2 uses a hexa-core P-Class P6600 MIPS processor which share the same memory address as the PEZY cores, improving performance and reducing data transfer overhead. With the powerful MIPS management cores, it is now also possible to entirely eliminate the Xeon host processor. However, PEZY has not done so yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 19.86 million cores, it is by far the biggest system: almost double that of the best [[manycore processor|manycore]] system in the TOP500, the Chinese [[Sunway TaihuLight]], currently ranked 3rd.

Legend:
* Rank{{snd}}Position within the TOP500 ranking. In the TOP500 list table, the computers are ordered first by their Rmax value. In the case of equal performances (Rmax value) for different computers, the order is by Rpeak. For sites that have the same computer, the order is by memory size and then alphabetically.
* Rmax{{snd}}The highest score measured using the [[LINPACK benchmarks]] suite. This is the number that is used to rank the computers. Measured in [[1000000000000000 (number)|quadrillions]] of [[floating point]] operations per [[second]], i.e., peta[[FLOPS]].
* Rpeak{{snd}}This is the theoretical peak performance of the system. Measured in PFLOPS.
* Name{{snd}}Some supercomputers are unique, at least on its location, and are thus named by their owner.

== New developments in supercomputing ==
In November 2014, it was announced that the United States was developing two new supercomputers to exceed China's Tianhe-2 in its place as world's fastest supercomputer.  The two computers, [[Sierra (supercomputer)|Sierra]] and [[Summit (supercomputer)|Summit]], will each exceed Tianhe-2's 55 peak petaflops.  Summit, the more powerful of the two, will deliver 150–300 peak petaflops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balthasar|first1=Felix|title=US Government Funds $425 million to build two new Supercomputers|url=http://newsmaine.net/21403-us-government-funds-425-million-build-two-new-supercomputers|website=News Maine|access-date=16 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119014606/http://newsmaine.net/21403-us-government-funds-425-million-build-two-new-supercomputers|archivedate=19 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April 2015, US government agencies banned selling chips, from Nvidia, to supercomputing centers in China as "acting contrary to the [[national security]] ... interests of the United States";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/10/technology/security/intel-blocked-nuclear/|title= Nuclear worries stop Intel from selling chips to Chinese supercomputers|date =2015-04-10 |access-date=2016-08-17 |website=[[CNN]] |publisher= |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Intel Corporation from providing Xeon chips to China due to their use, according to the US, in researching nuclear weapons{{snd}}research to which US [[export control]] law bans US companies from contributing{{snd}}"The Department of Commerce refused, saying it was concerned about nuclear research being done with the machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32247532|title= US nuclear fears block Intel China supercomputer update|date= |access-date= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2015, [[President Obama]] signed an executive order creating a [[National Strategic Computing Initiative]] calling for the accelerated development of an [[exascale computing|exascale]] (1000 petaflop) system and funding research into post-semiconductor computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/29/executive-order-creating-national-strategic-computing-initiative |title= Executive Order -- Creating a National Strategic Computing Initiative |publisher= The White House{{snd}} Office of the Press Secretary |type= Executive order |date = 29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Japanese firm Fujitsu announced at the [[International Supercomputing Conference]] that its future [[Exascale computing|exascale]] supercomputer will feature processors of its own design that implement the [[ARMv8]] architecture. The Flagship2020 program, by Fujitsu for RIKEN plans to break the exaflops barrier by 2020 (and "it looks like China and France have a chance to do so and that the United States is content{{snd}}for the moment at least{{snd}}to wait until 2023 to break through the exaflops barrier."&lt;ref name="Flagship2020"/&gt;) These processors will also implement extensions to the ARMv8 architecture equivalent to HPC-ACE2 that Fujitsu is developing with [[ARM Holdings]].&lt;ref name="Flagship2020"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=Timothy Prickett|title=Inside Japan's Future Exascale ARM Supecomputer|url=http://www.nextplatform.com/2016/06/23/inside-japans-future-exaflops-arm-supercomputer/|website=The Next Platform|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inspur]] has been one of the largest HPC system manufacturer based out of [[Jinan]], China. As of May 2017, [[Inspur]] has become the third manufacturer to have manufactured 64-way system{{snd}} a record which has been previously mastered by [[IBM]] and [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HP]]. The company has registered over $10B in revenues and have successfully provided a number of HPC systems to countries outside China such as Sudan, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela. Inspur was also a major technology partner behind both the supercomputers from China, namely [[Tianhe-2]] and [[Sunway TaihuLight|Taihu]] which lead the top 2 positions of Top500 supercomputer list up to November 2017. Inspur and [[Supermicro]] released a few platforms aimed at HPC using GPU such as SR-AI and AGX-2 in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/news/supermicro-inspur-boston-limited-unveil-high-density-gpu-servers/|title=Supermicro, Inspur, Boston Limited Unveil High-Density GPU Servers {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|website=www.top500.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large machines not on the list ==
Some major systems are not listed on the list. The largest example is the NCSA's [[Blue Waters]] which publicly announced the decision not to participate in the list&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.hpcwire.com/2012/11/16/blue_waters_opts_out_of_top500/| title = Blue Waters Opts Out of TOP500 |type = article| date = 16 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because they do not feel it accurately indicates the ability for any system to be able to do useful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Kramer, William |title = Top500 versus Sustained Performance{{snd}} Or the Ten Problems with the TOP500 List{{snd}} And What to Do About Them. 21st International Conference On Parallel Architectures And Compilation Techniques (PACT12), 19–23 September 2012, Minneapolis, MN, US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations decide not to list systems for security and/or commercial competitiveness reasons. Additional purpose-built machines that are not capable or do not run the benchmark were not included, such as [[RIKEN MDGRAPE-3]] and [[MDGRAPE-4]].

=== Computers and architectures that have dropped off the list ===

Although [[Itanium]]-based systems reached second rank in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://top500.org/system/173300|title=Thunder – Intel Itanium2 Tiger4 1.4GHz – Quadrics|publisher=|access-date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top500.org/system/175560|title=Columbia – SGI Altix 1.5/1.6/1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz, Voltaire Infiniband|publisher=|access-date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; none now remain.

Similarly (non-[[SIMD]]-style) [[vector processor]]s (NEC-based such as the [[Earth simulator]] that was fastest in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top500.org/site/49318|title=Japan Agency for Marine -Earth Science and Technology|publisher=|access-date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have also fallen off the list.  Also the [[Sun Starfire]] computers that occupied many spots in the past now no longer appear.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Enchanted World''''' was a series of twenty-one books published in the 1980s. Each book focused on different aspects of [[mythology]] or [[folklore]], and all were released by [[Time-Life Books|Time Life Books]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pjtss.net/library/batsy/timelife.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013173024/http://www.pjtss.net/library/batsy/timelife.htm |date=October 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their overall editor was Ellen Phillips and their primary consultant was Tristram Potter Coffin, a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] Award-winning [[University of Pennsylvania]] Professor Emeritus of English.

==Overview==
The volumes in the series were known for their art and the extensive research used in their stories. The books often overlap; for example, while [[King Arthur]] and his knights only have one book completely devoted to them, ''Fall of [[Camelot]],'' they often appear in other books. Half of ''Legends of Valor'' is about them, and they appear in ''Wizards and Witches,'' ''Fairies and Elves,'' ''Dwarfs,'' ''Spells and Bindings,'' and ''Giants and Ogres.''

A unique part of the series was that its books were written as stories, taking place from an "in the universe" perspective, presenting its subjects as real people, places, and things. Related to such things having once been real, a common thread through several of them was its documentation of the alleged decline of magical things from "when the world was young" to the modern day. The subjects—dragons, dwarfs, giants—are presented as being potent and strong at the dawn of time, but magical creatures grow weaker and eventually disappear as humans spread and demystify the world, though there is always the promise that the magic will return once again.

[[Christianity|Christendom]] is often related to the decline. Though ''The Enchanted World'' describes it as humankind's greatest shield against those magics and beings of magic that would prove hostile to it, it proved detrimental even to good magic as people ceased to believe in the old gods in favor of Christ. According to the series, this was because Christianity was centered around a god of reason and that it promised a clearly defined universe of order and stability, a universe where there could be only one god. Magic could hardly thrive under such circumstances. It continued to exist either in opposition to Christianity or, more often, in connection to in-between places and in-between things. The series states that magic had always had a strong connection to things that were neither one thing nor another because as neither one thing nor another, such things could escape definition and be more than what they appeared.

The popularity of the ''Enchanted World'' series was followed by the ''[[Mysteries of the Unknown]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grundhauser|first1=E.|title=The 1980s Book Series That Literally Claimed It Had To Be Read To Be Believed|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-1980s-book-series-that-literally-claimed-it-had-to-be-read-to-be-believed|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=11 February 2017|language=en|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Series==

''In order of publication:''

===''Wizards and Witches''===
[[Brendan Lehane]]'s book opens stating that in the earliest days the world was not yet fully ordered and the process of creation not yet completed. Since reality was fluid, it was relatively easy for mighty [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] such as Finland's [[Väinämöinen]], [[Taliesin]], [[Manannán mac Lir]], [[Math fab Mathonwy|Math the Ancient]] and [[Gwydion]] to cast their magic. Magic in those days was almost instinctual and inborn; it was an art. Those days ended with [[Merlin]], the last and greatest of the old wizards. Famous for his aiding King Arthur and the realm of Camelot when he withdrew from the world, magic itself began to withdraw and the wizards retreated from human sight.

As a result of Christianity clearly setting and defining the world, the use of magic became much more difficult and even dangerous. It was difficult because it was no longer an art to be understood instinctively but a science that required years of study. It was dangerous because to challenge the order of reality was to challenge God the author of that reality, and, more often than not, the only being willing to aid a wizard in such an effort was Satan himself. Some wizards earned their powers legitimately and used them responsibly; [[Roger Bacon]] is one example, [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay|as revealed in one tale]]. Others, such as [[Michael Scot]], gambled their souls by attending the [[Scholomance]], the school of black magic. Still others, such as [[Faust|Faustus]], took the quick and easy way and made [[deal with the Devil|deals with the Devil]], always with grisly results.

Concurrent with the scholar wizards were their more humble cousins, the [[witches]]. Unlike their male counterparts, their magic retained links to the natural world. Some witches were good and were called [[white witch]]es, [[cunning folk]], and fairy doctors. They tended to be good Christians and they used their powers for good; their spells were often indistinguishable from prayers. The [[White Paternoster]] is just one example. They were needed to counterbalance and oppose their evil sisters who used their powers for the sake of greed, revenge, or even just cruel pleasure. They more often than not placed themselves in the service of the devil and served as his perfect followers. The [[Witches' Sabbath]] was their chief pleasure.

Lehane closes that as time marched on and witches retreated from humankind, their magic was forgotten and relegated to stories for scaring children. Even so, their ancestors, the sleeping wizards, are still alive and waiting for the time to awaken.

The book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following three chapters, which each contain sub-chapters and side bar stories.

===''Dragons''===
''Dragons'' opens recounting the legends of [[Apep]], [[Tiamat]], [[Jörmungandr]], [[Nidhoggr]], and [[Typhon]]. Born before time began, these creatures were sons of chaos, and so the gods did battle with them, for only when they were beaten could order prevail and the universe be born. Across various cultures, the same told was told with [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and [[Ra]], [[Marduk]], [[Thor]], and [[Zeus]] playing the same role. The gods ultimately did prevail and these cosmic dragons were destroyed but the fight was not yet over because they left descendants with whom mortals would do battle. [[Cadmus]]'s dragon was one example.

[[Chinese dragons]] and other Asian dragons were an exception to all this; unlike their [[European dragon|western cousins]], they never lost their semi-divine status and, again unlike them, they were mostly benevolent. The creator goddess [[Nu Kua]] was herself partly dragon, and the Emperor of China sat on the [[Dragon Throne]]. The [[Dragon King]]s governed wind and water and for the rain they sent the Chinese people loved them.

No such love was present for [[European dragon]]s. While not always evil as seen with the [[The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh|Laidly Worm]], dragons were nearly always a threat, and even when they were not, they guarded treasures that man sought, whether gold or water or something else. They had to be destroyed and Christianity, "the hammer of the dragon race," proved one of the most powerful weapons against them because it promised a world in which dragons, creatures of appetite, could have no place. Some saints killed their dragons, such as [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], while other saints, such as [[Carantoc]], tamed theirs. Regardless of the good intentions of men like Carantoc, however, peaceful coexistence between man and dragon was almost impossible as the tale of [[Martha|Saint Martha]] and [[Tarasque]] shows. The [[dragonslayers]] rose up to destroy them as well. [[Saint George]] is the most famous example. A dragonslayer could expect to win gold, women, and everlasting glory, but it was usually a quest for survival. In the end, humans civilized the world and drove dragons to extinction.

===''Fairies and Elves''===
Unlike other books in the series, this text does not concentrate on the decline of magic, though it does state that in the beginning, beings of pure magic (not exactly gods but more than mortal) freely intermingled with mortals (the friendship of [[Arawn]] and [[Pwyll]] is one example) only to separate themselves later on. They were known to the Norse as the Alfar or [[elves]] in English and sometimes as [[fairies]], a word that derives from the Latin fatum/fate and fatare/enchant. Fairie correctly refers to their lands or magic. In contrast to mortals, beings who sought order, these magical beings were said to be very fickle and unpredictable. Even members of the usually good [[Classifications of fairies#Seelie and Unseelie Courts|Seelie Court]] were prone to mischief.

The chief classifications were the [[trooping and solitary fairies]] the aristocrats and peasants of their kind. Among the Trooping fairies are mentioned the [[Sidhe]], the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and the children of [[the Dagda]]. Though friendly enough to their mortal counterparts, they eventually withdrew from their sight and were replaced in mortal interactions by their smaller cousins. [[Leshy]], [[polevik]], and other nature spirits continued to haunt the wilds of the world. They were all very unpredictable; some were friendly to humans and used their powers to help them with their household chores while others were cruel and delighted in tormenting mortals.

Inevitably, the fairies weakened in the wake of humanity. This was in [[changeling]]s; a fairy mother would exchange her child with a human child, perhaps to add the vigor of humanity to a weakening race. Also, the friendly meetings which had characterized their relationship with mortals grew increasingly rare. Husbands of [[swan maiden]]s often won their wives only through deceit. True love was possible between fairies and mortals but, as in the case of [[Melusine]], the love failed when the mortal husband broke the wife's trust.

===''Ghosts''===
This book about [[ghost]]s opens starting with one of the many ghost stories contained throughout the book. A short excerpt, "Late one spring night in the last century, a certain Englishman found himself, to his astonishment, standing in the garden outside his house. It was quite bewildering. He remembered falling asleep in his bed, but he had no memory of waking and walking out the door. Yet here he was, shivering in the chill, his bare feet buried in rain-soaked grass. Another surprise awaited him: when he tried the door, it proved to be locked."

*'''Chapter One:''' Guises of the Reaper (pg.6)
**Song of the Sorrowing Harp (pg.32)
*'''Chapter Two:''' Invasions by the Angry Dead (pg. 38)

**The Hooded Congregation (illustrated by [[Chris Van Allsburg]]) (pg.100)
*'''Chapter Four:''' Hands Across the Void (pg.108)
**Glam's Tale (pg.132)

===''Legends of Valor''===
Written by [[Brendan Lehane]], ''Legends of Valor'' centers primarily on [[Cúchulainn]] and the world of the [[Ulster Cycle]], and later on [[King Arthur]] and the [[Matter of Britain]]. Other [[hero]]es briefly mentioned are [[Perseus]], [[Sigurd]], and [[Roland]] from [[Greek myth]], [[Volsunga saga]], and the [[Matter of France]]/[[Song of Roland]], respectively.

In detailing the life of Cuchulain, Lehane writes that in the early world, tribes needed champions to protect them and lead them in battle. The king could not risk his life, so in his place a hero fought and were the jewels in a king's crown. It emphasizes that heroes were often born to gods and mortal Queens—it was not given to peasants to sire or spawn heroes. Such men were warriors and were expected to be fierce and savage. Their lives were short, bound to vows of vengeance and the "cruel demands of honor." The life of Irish hero Cuchulain is retold, and with it, how while there were other men of the [[Red Branch]], he proved himself the greatest champion of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], King of Ulster. Cuchulain, the son of [[Lugh]] fought bravely for his king and became a warrior without peer, although he was killed by [[Queen Maeve|Maeve]] who tricked him into breaking his various vows or [[geis]]. After Cuculain's death, Ireland was plunged into chaos, though later, as the [[Fenian cycle]] told, order was restored. Leading men milder and more civilized, but just as valiant, [[High King]] [[Cormac Mac Art]] and his [[Fianna]] protected Ireland from invasion. Even there conflicting vows could speel doom as when [[Grianne]] betrayed her husband the king by sleeping with his champion [[Diarmuid]].

The rest of the story centers on the "Brotherhood of the [[Round Table]]." Heroes still lived but they were different from their forebears, most notably in the moralizing effects of [[chivalry]]. A knight was expected to be kind to women, to show mercy to defeated foes, and to refuse no plea for help. Horses also gave men greater mobility. Under the salvific influence of [[Christianity]], Arthur and his men were the finest heroes in all [[Christendom]] and beyond. Despite the Christian kingdom of [[Camelot]] being at peace, such men were needed as giants, dragons, and witches made Britain a place of wonder and danger. Some magical beings, such as the [[Lady of the Lake]], proved friends. However, those who would harm the innocent were kept at bay due to Arthur's Knights, chief among them [[Lancelot]], the Lady's son. Unfortunately, Lancelot's love for [[Guinevere]], Arthur's Queen, would bring down Camelot which was already grievously exhausted by the Grail Quest. In searching for the [[Holy Grail]], the Knights of the Round Table did prove themselves the very best heroes of all times but the loss of so many good men in the quest crippled Camelot and left it vulnerable to decay from within. Arthur's bastard son [[Mordred]], in the end, destroyed the perfect world his father tried to create, though it is promised that one day, [[King Arthur's messianic return|Arthur will return]].

The book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.

===''Night Creatures''===
This book opens with one of many stories in the book about creatures of the night. The first story is an old Danish tale. Following is an excerpt, "Within this hall, hearths and torches blazed warm and bright, and drinking horns passed freely among the warriors of the Scylding clan; bards intoned the praises of their chieftain, Hrothgar, the valorous King; harpists sang of warmth and light. Outside the hall, however, solitary in the cold and dark, another kind of being walked. Although manlike, that being was no man. Huge and hairy, it shambled through the night mists of fell and fen, its claws scrabbling from time to time in the dirt as it tore at its hapless prey - hares, ferrets and other small beasts."

The book contains 141 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.

*'''Chapter Four:''' The Way of the Werebeast (pg.108)
**The Fox Maiden (pg.132)

===''Water Spirits''===
''Water Spirits'' opens with the story of man who saved the life of a [[mermaid]] who promptly blessed him with the power to heal and to break witchcraft and cursed him so that every generation one man from his family would drown. This was done to illustrate people's fear of the sea as a mysterious and fickle place that could from one moment give life and in the other death. Water was hailed as the source of life; the Hindus worshipped the Ganges under the name of [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]], [[Mimir]]'s well gave [[Odin]] his wisdom, the [[Nile]] and the [[Jordan River]] built civilizations, and everywhere people sought the [[Fountain of Youth]]. ''Water Spirits'' then points out that the creation myths of many cultures imagine the universe coming out of the watery deep and that many cultures recalled a time when the world was washed clean of sinners by the [[Great Flood]].

Humans began taking the initiative in sea quests, however, as seen with [[Jason]] and his [[Argonauts]]. He was faithful to the gods and led a crew of heroes across the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas. Regardless of his initial faithfulness to the gods, those same gods destroyed Jason but turned the Argo into a constellation. That was a testimony to how fickle the gods could be, because sea gods were viewed in relation to their seas. [[Poseidon]], for example, was as arbitrary as the enchanted seas and magic islands he ruled. On the contrary, the kinder [[Enki|Ea]] came from the calmer [[Persian Gulf]] to teach men civilization and agriculture whilst the consistently cruel [[Rán]] ruled the volatile [[North Sea]]. The gods would lose their strength, however.

In Christian times, sailors no longer worshipped the sea gods but still lived in fear of the sea's power. For example, ships were still launched on [[Wednesday|Woden's Day/Wednesday]] and not, for example, on [[Thursday|Thor's Day]] for fear of storms and thunder. [[Figurehead (object)|Figureheads]] replaced the ''oculi,'' or eyes, of Greek [[Trireme]]s, but the function remained the same; keep a lookout for evil. Anointing a ship with wine replaced the pagan custom on smearing ships with animal and even human blood. There were limits, as seen with how Christian priests were rarely let on board for fear of angering the old gods.

Lakes and rivers held their powers too in the form of [[Neck (water spirit)|Nix]]es and [[Ondine (mythology)|Undines]]. The Japanese told of [[Urashima Tarō|Urashima]] and Europeans of [[selkies]] and mermaids; daughters of foam-born Aphrodite, they were carved on churches as warning against lust.

The book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.

===''Magical Beasts''===
''Magical Beasts'' opens with a recounting of how early in humanity's existence the world was locked in an Ice Age. Humans feared the animals and worshipped the [[cave bear]]. Time passed and the cave bear perished, but other beast gods remained such as [[Cernunnos]]. The [[gods of Egypt]] were [[Theriocephaly|beast men]] and the Greeks spoke of their gods disguising themselves as animals. There are other examples such as [[Chiron]]; a centaur, he was hailed as the divine beast. There came the day, however, that [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the goat god, died and the beast gods's decline began. This was seen in how animalistic [[Fomorians]] of Ireland had lost their magic and were forced to ruling with brute force. They and [[Balor]], their king, were routed by his grandson [[Lugh of the Long Hand]], champion of the ascendant [[Tuatha de Danaan]]. Magic was dying as Europe was Christianized, but there were other places in the world such as Asia where magic yet held sway and [[Cynocephaly|dog men]], [[monopods]], and [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyes]].

It also recounts that many flying animals, both mundane and magical, commanded respect for reason that they were able to escape the mundane world by flight. [[Pegasus]], the [[Roc (mythology)|roc]], [[simurgh]]s, [[firebird (Slavic folklore)|firebirds]], the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and even ordinary birds like the [[raven|raven in mythology]] and the [[European robin#Cultural depictions|robin]] were revered. Other flying animals were also known such as [[griffin]]s, [[harpies]] and [[tengu]]s.

Of all magical beasts, however, the [[unicorn]] was the most respected. It epitomised beauty and purity but courage as well because it would never let itself be taken alive. Its cousins included China’s [[ki-lin]] and the Persian [[karkadann]] which, unlike their European counterpart, respectively embodied only gentility or ferocity. All, however, could be tamed by maidens. [[Unicorn horn]]s also had the power to cure poison and disease; in their desire to obtain the horns, humans drove unicorns to extinction.

The text mentions other beasts such as the [[manticore]], [[Myrmecoleon|mermecolion]], [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|barometz]], [[basilisk]], and [[peryton]].

===''Dwarfs''===
[[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]] (actual spelling used in book - this is the traditional spelling - "dwarves" comes from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' author [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and was an intentional change of spelling) opens with the ''[[Prose Edda|Younger ("Prose") Edda]],'' a narration of [[Norse mythology]]. It opens with [[Norse dwarves]] and tells how the race began soon after [[Odin]] and his [[Aesir]] killed [[Ymir]], using his flesh to make the earth. The maggots that crawled from the flesh became dwarfs. Corpse grey and subterranean [[caveman|troglodyte]]s, the gods tended to look down on them but the dwarfs, brash and brazen, knew that when Aesir needed weapons or wanted luxuries that the dwarfs by their magical craftsmanship alone could provide what was needed. While author [[Tim Appenzeller]] admits that such tales contain much fiction, they still contain a grain of truth.

However, in time the dwarfs lost the ability, or the will, to stand as equals to the gods and walked among mortals. With the pagan gods dead and ''the'' God and His Church dominant, a new world had dawned. Even so, the dwarf kings such as [[Herla]] or Laurin of the [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]'s Mountains were not afraid and outshone their cavedwelling ancestors in splendor. The dwarfs adapted well to Christian Europe, befriending mortals; [[Alberich]], for example, was famous for befriending King [[Otnit]] of Lombardy and going with him to [[Syria]] to help him win an exotic pagan princess for a bride. The tale of [[Elidor]] is also recounted.

The dwarfs' decline is further explored with the dwarfish peasantry. They were friendly towards mortal peasants with whom they shared parallel lives and they often helped each other just as their respective kings did. However, as humans grew stronger, forming centralized states, large cities, roads, and factories, and as the dwarfs's own magic began to fail them, the fragile ties of friendship began to unravel and most dwarfs left the mortal world. Those that remained, abandoned by their fellows suffered a diaspora and placed themselves at mortals's mercy. They went on to become household spirits slavishly serving as domestic help of their particular mortals, though even there they would go into retreat. The last sightings of dwarfs concerned the [[Knocker (folklore)|Knockers]], beings that lived in mines and watched over miners. While, the text says, miners would give them food and drink; these were offerings, not rewards. [[Tim Appenzeller]] goes on to speculate that knockers are just the most visible members of hidden dwarf kingdoms. While some of them might be recent dwarf refugees from the outside world, some of them might have always lived there, "awaiting the day when their earth-shaping skills will once again dazzle mortals and gods alike."

===''Giants and Ogres''===
''Giants and Ogres'' opens by stating that at the dawn of time, the [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] were the mightiest of beings, creatures whom even the gods feared. It cites the legends of [[Og]], [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], [[Cronus]], and [[Ymir]], and shows that in those earliest of days, giants were indeed wielders of incredible size and strength. However, these "princes of the cosmos" were also superior to the gods (their children) in authority, wisdom, and magic. In fact, it was from the giants that the [[Greek gods|Greek]] and [[Norse gods]] had to wrest their dominion. Even after, as was seen in the Northlands where the giants held to their power the longest, the gods looked to the giants as equals, beings to whom they would turn in search of wisdom.

However, as the "first world" ended and they lost their equality with the gods, giants assimilated into mortal society. Some, such as [[Bran the Blessed]], went on to become kings and heroes, worthy heirs of their ancestors. Others befriended and watched over the peasantry; some [[giantess]]es even used their magic as midwives for their tiny neighbors. However, as the giants's decline accelerated, they grew increasingly hostile to humans. They became enemies of humanity, using their superior strength and their magic to attack the younger race that was taking over their world. Their cousins, the [[troll]]s and the [[ogre]]s, became outright predators raping human women and eating human men. Examples such as [[The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body|the giant who had no heart in his body]] or of the giant who faced [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack atop the beanstalk]] (illustrated by the talented [[Barry Moser]], and his company, [[Pennyroyal Press]]) are cited.

By the end of their existence, when men like [[King Arthur]] and [[Charlemagne]] ruled, the giants were totally defeated. While there remained a few wise and noble giants such as [[Ferraù|Ferragus]], who battled [[Roland]], they were the exceptions. Most had shrunk in size to the point that they were only slightly larger than humans. Worse, the giants—beings whose wisdom even the gods had once envied—became degenerate cretins, who could be bested by mere children's tricks. Though the giants disappeared, the common folk never forgot them, they remembered the great monuments they had built, such as [[Giant's Causeway]], and the [[Long Man of Wilmington]], as illustrated by [[Willi Glasauer]].

===''Book of Christmas''===
[[Brendan Lehane]]'s ''Book of Christmas'' opens with a brief retelling of the [[Nativity of Jesus|
Nativity story]] told in the [[Gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]. It recounts [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] going to [[Bethlehem]] and the birth of [[Jesus Christ]] but states that the pattern was already set. The fact that the birth of Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, is celebrated in December is no accident. There are [[List of winter festivals|many winter festivals]]. Most people worshipped the sun as a god and so were afraid when winter came and it seemed that the lifegiving sun grew weak; thus they celebrated the [[Solstice]], the winter day when the weakening sun regained its strength. In fact, many [[Christmas]] traditions have their roots in pre-Christian traditions but it was the birth of Jesus that made a season of fear into a season of hope.

Such fears are mentioned in tales of [[animal sacrifice|animal]] and even [[human sacrifice]] meant to appease the pagan gods such as Odin in hopes of surviving winter. Christmas was also said to be the time of the dead; as it was the time when the whole world seemed to die and was an undefined in between time, it was only right the ghosts and monsters rise up against mortals. Similarly, the [[Wild Hunt]] and its various leaders are recounted, various heathen deities such as [[Berchta]] and [[Gwyn ap Nudd]] being cast out by their former worshippers in favor of the Christian God whose mortal birth those worshippers celebrated.

However, while winter could be terrifying, Lehane asserts that most Christians were not afraid. They celebrated a topsy-turvy [[Christmastide]] with [[mummers]] and plays and feasts led by the [[Abbot of Misrule]]. Christmas was a time filled with old magic when animals could talk and nature spirits abounded, but followers of the new religion saw nothing strange in keeping their ancestors' pagan traditions alive. Their faith was not the abolition, but rather the fulfillment, of their old rituals because with Jesus, the rituals meant to hold back winter's darkness were vindicated. Lehane states, "In the Child born at Bethlehem, they had the promise of spring in the heart of midwinter, the divine gift of a bright, cleansing flame to drive away the dark."

===''Fall of Camelot''===
The book is 143 pages long. It is divided into seven chapters. Each chapter deals with a different person in the life of [[King Arthur]].

'''1. Arthur''' (pg.8)

Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon sees Igraine, the beautiful wife of Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. He desires her and asks for help from the Wizard, Prophet and Enchanter Merlin. Merlin promises to do this in exchange for any child that may be conceived from the union. Merlin enchants Uther to look like Gorlois and Uther has his way with Igraine. Nine months later, Arthur is born and taken away by Merlin. He is raised in secret in Wales until the age of fifteen. During a tournament in London, Arthur, acting as a squire, while searching for a sword for the knight he serves, finds the Sword in the Stone in a church courtyard and pulls it out, thereby proving to the world that he is the rightful heir to the throne of England. Even with this heavenly mandate, Arthur still is forced to defeat many other armies in battle in order to win the throne.

'''2. Morgause''' (pg.20)

Igraine and Lord Gorlois had had three daughters before Lord Gorlois died. These daughters knew that Arthur was their half-brother. Arthur, though, was unaware. The eldest of the three daughters, Morgause, travelled to Camelot, where Arthur fell in love with her. Merlin prophesied that if Arthur slept with Morgause that the child that would come of it would destroy England and kill Arthur. Arthur ignored this counsel and took Morgause anyway. She then became pregnant and left before Arthur was aware of it. The child that he fathered that evening was Mordred.

'''3. Guinevere''' (pg.36)

Guinevere was the daughter of Lord Leodegrain. Arthur fell in love with her and married her. During the wedding feast, Guinevere asked Merlin to perform some magic for her and the guests as entertainment. At first he declined, but then later created an illusion that entertained, but also upset many. After the spell was complete, Merlin told all that his act of casting magic had alerted the Old Ones who were now looking at and paying attention to King Arthur and his court. Having the attention of the Old Ones is something that is not preferred. It can bring a lot of pain.

'''4. Morgan''' (pg.56)

All of Gorlois and Igraine's three daughters hated Arthur, but Morgan, the youngest, hated him the most. But she hid her hate well. Arthur knew neither that she was his sister nor that she hated him. She and her husband came to live with Arthur in Camelot, where her husband worked as one of Arthur's knights. Morgan, though, was very beautiful, and many of the knights chose to be close to her. One day, Arthur was kidnapped by a knight who was having an affair with Morgan. Before the fight, Morgan had stolen Arthur's sword Caliburn and had given it to her lover. She then also gave Arthur a cursed copy of his own sword. During the fight, the cursed sword slowed Arthur down and took away enough of his strength that he was about to lose the fight. But the Lady of the Lake arrived, magically pulled the sword from the hand of his enemy, and returned it to Arthur. Arthur, who won the fight, also became aware of Morgan's hate for him. Nevertheless, Morgan tried to kill Arthur several other times, unsuccessfully.

'''5. Lancelot''' (pg.74)

At birth, Lancelot's name was Galahad, but after his father was killed and his father's castle destroyed, he was taken and raised by the Lady of the Lake. This was where he received the name Lancelot. He is also sometimes referred to as the "Fair Foundling" and "Lancelot du Lac." He was the greatest of all knights. No one was his equal.

He was presented to Arthur when he was eighteen by the faeries. Arthur took him in and trained him to be a knight. Lancelot and Guinevere though fell in love at first sight and they had a secret affair that lasted for years. Morgan, Arthur's half-sister, found out about this affair and informed the King about it.

Lancelot had a son with another woman and gave him the name Galahad, which had been his own birth name.

'''6. Mordred''' (pg.90)

Mordred was unaware for a long time that his father was Arthur. He came with his mother Morgause and lived in Camelot, where he eventually became one of Arthur's knights. During one travel, Mordred and Lancelot met an old man who prophesied to Mordred that he would kill his own father, Arthur, destroy the knights of the round table, and kill the old man as well, but that his father, Arthur, would also kill him. This is how Mordred found out that Arthur was his father. Mordred grew so angry that he drew his sword and killed the old man instantly. Lancelot felt like killing Mordred for his cruelty, but chose not to.

Mordred eventually found out about the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere, and thus, he followed Lancelot and Guinevere and found a place where they were sleeping. In consequence, Mordred brought many knights there to act as witnesses of the affair. Lancelot fought his way out and left Camelot, but Guinevere was taken and arrested. Arthur was law-bound to punish his wife and the law demanded that she be burned at the stake.

The next day, many knights had left Camelot, as everyone had loved Guinevere, and her execution sentence seemed so unjust that the round table was broken. Many knights abandoned their brotherhood. The two knights who were ordered to tie her to the stake and burn her refused to wear their armor to do it. They did not agree with the sentence either, and refused to obey it as knights. But as the fires were lit, a band of rebel knights, led by Lancelot, burst into Camelot, killed the men who had been ordered to execute Guinevere, and took Guinevere away to safety.

'''7. Gawain''' (pg.118)

The brother of the two knights slain by Lancelot was Gawain. He had been a knight to King Arthur for years and was one of Arthur's most trusted allies. Gawain's anger for Lancelot was deep and insatiable. Nothing would end his anger except the death of Lancelot. Arthur, who now controlled many fewer knights than before, could not risk losing his greatest ally, so, Arthur and his remaining troops camped around the stronghold where Lancelot now lived in France. Guinevere had long since been returned to Camelot after Lancelot vowed to all that no affair had ever taken place. Guinevere was safe because of Lancelot's lie, but Gawain's anger was still demanded that Lancelot die. The siege lasted weeks. During the siege, Arthur received a note that said that Mordred had told the people that Arthur had died in battle and that Mordred was now King. The note also said that Mordred had vowed to take Guinevere as his wife.

Arthur immediately returned to Camelot with all of his forces. There was a great battle in which Gawain, Arthur and Mordred were slain. Mordred killed Arthur and as he died, Arthur's stroke also killed his son Mordred.

==How the series was advertised==
''The Enchanted World'' was advertised with a series of commercials transmitted either in first-run syndication or during late-night television programming. The first of these known to be transmitted featured four people who described themselves as being in touch with the Enchanted World:&lt;br/&gt;
1. '''[[Susan Hammett]],''' who called herself an '''authentic witch.''' She began the first commercial by saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"People think that witches only exist in fairy tales. I'm living proof that we're real--and still around today! In fact...I'm from a ''long line'' of witches."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
2. '''[[Litany Burns]],''' a self-styled '''[[clairvoyant]].''' Her statement was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ever since I was a child, I've been able to see things that aren't visible to ordinary senses. So ghosts are nothing new to me. I've seen them many times."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
3. '''[[Olga Hayes]],''' a '''[[tarot]] card reader.''' According to her statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The tarot cards are over five hundred years old. With them, I can tell a person's future. I can also tell what they were--in another life."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And&lt;br/&gt;
4. '''[[Wayne Weiseman]],''' a self-styled '''[[psychic]]''' and the only male participant in the commercial. As he phrased his contacts with the Enchanted World:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are times when I find myself in another world. (He here faced the camera more directly.) I'm actually there. A lot of people have this power. They just have to develop it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least two of the later commercials featured actor [[Vincent Price]], well known for his frequent roles in horror films.&lt;br/&gt;
The first of these, which featured a series of animals—first a rabbit, then a crow or a raven, then a frog, then a cat—transforming into each from the last through special photographic effects, had him, as the narrator, exhorting viewers, "Enter 'The Enchanted World.'" At the end of this commercial, the cat transformed—again, through special photographic effects—into a human; specifically, self-styled authentic witch Susan Hammett from the previous commercial, who pointed out, "After all, how can you be ''sure'' witches don't exist--if you don't know what one ''looks'' like?"&lt;br/&gt;
In the second, Price was shown on camera promoting the series and reading at least one of the books by candlelight. At one point, a gust of wind from an open window blew out the candle, which Price re-lit with a match. Then, through lighting trickery, his skin turned glowing green.

All the commercials ended with announcer [[Ted Alexander]] providing a toll-free telephone number for viewers to call, together with a mailing address where payment for each book in the series could be sent after a ten-day trial.

'''''The Xfm Top 1000 Songs of All Time''''' is a musical reference book edited by various DJ's, of the now defunct radio station ''[[Xfm]]'', which was published by Elliott &amp; Thompson Limited in 2010. The only edition comprises a list of [[music single|singles]] and popular album tracks released between 1965 and 2009. The book is arranged alphabetically rather than in the form of a chart, while [[Brandon Flowers]] of [[The Killers]] provides a foreword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=XFM|title=The Xfm Top 1000 Songs of All Time|date=8 October 2010|publisher=Elliott &amp; Thompson Limited|isbn=978-1904027966|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list was determined by listener votes of the radio station voting on their website, opinions from DJ's and radio play requests on the station's flagship show ''The X-List''. The station formerly broadcast to [[London]] and [[Manchester]] on digital DAB radio, and online to the rest of the world, with nearly 1 million listeners. The station also had a close relationship with Australian station ''[[Triple J]]''. Each entry in the list is accompanied by a short [[essay]] written by a DJ. The entries are accompanied by pictures, quotes, and additional information. As mentioned before, the list not only included singles, but also album-only tracks that entered public knowledge, with [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Comfortably Numb]]" being examples.

Although the book mostly keeps to alternative rock acts of the present day, as well as classic bands such as [[The Beatles]] while the most recent singles in the book take up most of the list, many artists who appeared expressed their achievement as a highlight of their career, with a small number writing on the ''Xfm'' official site and also in the book itself.

[[Image:Traitors-Gate.jpg|thumb|Traitors' Gate, 2007]]
[[Image:Traitors gate 2008.jpg|thumb|Traitors' Gate]]
The '''Traitor's Gate''' is an entrance through which many prisoners of the [[Tudor period|Tudors]] arrived at the [[Tower of London]]. The gate was built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], to provide a [[water gate]] entrance to the Tower, part of St. Thomas's Tower, which was designed to provide additional accommodation for the [[British Royal Family|royal family]].

In the pool behind Traitors' Gate was an engine that was used for raising water to a cistern on the roof of the White Tower.  The engine worked originally by the force of the tide or by horsepower and eventually by steam.  In 1724–6, it was adapted to drive machinery for boring gun barrels.  It was removed in the 1860s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The name Traitors' Gate has been used since before 1544, when that name is used on [[Anton van den Wyngaerde]]'s panorama of London.&lt;ref&gt;The Sutherland Collection, Ashmolean Library&lt;/ref&gt;  Prisoners were brought by barge along the [[River Thames|Thames]], passing under [[London Bridge]], where the heads of recently executed prisoners were displayed on pikes. Notable prisoners such as [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] entered the Tower by Traitors' Gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xP52XwckpUC&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=thomas%20more%20traitors%20gate&amp;pg=PT80#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20traitors%20gate&amp;f=false | title=London Sights: A Travel Guide to the Top 60 Attractions in London, England, UK | publisher=MobileReference | year=2010 | accessdate=8 December 2013 | author=MobileReference | pages=contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Anne Boleyn|Queen Anne Boleyn]] is often reported to have passed through the Traitors' Gate after her arrest, the historian [[Eric Ives]] suggested that it was more likely she entered via the Court Gate in the Byward Tower.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

It was founded in 1919 in [[Bratislava]]. Today, it is the largest and most visited library in the [[Slovak republic]] and it´s a universal state research library. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/partners/ | title=About the World Digital Library: Partners | publisher=www.wdl.org | accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wedeworth1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Wedeworth|title=World Encyclopedia of library and information services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA245|accessdate=30 May 2013|year=1993|publisher=American Library Association|isbn=978-0-8389-0609-5|pages=245–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fasade of the University Library in Bratislava.jpg|thumb|View of the Library from the street in Bratislava´s historical centre. One of three library buildings.]]
==History==
The library was one of the first cultural and educational institutions set up in the newly founded [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovak Republic]] after [[WWI]] at the territory of Slovakia to support the emerging university education, science and library system. Its origin in 1919 was closely connected with the newly founded [[Comenius University|Comenius Czechol-slovak State University]] where the name of the university was reflected in the Library´s name. The library has never become an integral part of university, although relations between the two institutions were based on collaboration and close contact. The Library keeps its name because it refers to the original close contact towards the university and at the same time reflects the universal character of its collections. 
As the time passed by the authorities set further goals and competences for ULB within the national and international framework. ULB has become the first library entitled to the [[legal deposit]] from the territory of [[Slovakia]], and it is the only one which has kept this tradition since 1919 until today. Library´s historical book collections also have the character of a depository collection. Until 1954 ULB in fact fulfilled the tasks of the national library in Slovakia. Since then it has the statute of a universal state research library. 
Throughout its history two clear directions can be identified : a solid leading place in the national library system and active participation in international library cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Univerzitna kniznica v Bratislave 1919 – 2009. Ed. Tibor Trgina. First edition. Produced by University Library in Bratislava. Bratislava : University Library in Bratislava, 2009. p. 6-11. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction of the historical buildings of the Library==
The main objective was to renew buildings which are protected as cultural monuments, to modernize decaying library premises, to solve the lack of stacks and eliminated the danger of stagnation in the field of library services. Realization of the investment project "Multifunctional Cultural and Library Centre" led to a vast renewal and revitalization, it allowed the library users to utilize not only the refurbished premises, which they had already known, but also those parts of the historical buildings, which until that time the public did not have access to. New library stacks have been built, number of working stations has increased. Conditions for the protection of historical library collections significantly improved, including so called Bašagić Collection af Arabic, Turkish and Persian manuscripts inscribed on the UNESCO world heritage list "Memory of the World". The traditional library has transformed to a mediatheque and a portal to the virtual world of information. The profile of the Library was enlarged to fulfill multicunctional cultural and social functions. 
The project of the reconstruction resulted in a synthesis of old and new : a modern library equipped with technologies of 21st century in a restored, originally baroque interior, supplemented by new exhibition, concert, conference and social premises. &lt;ref&gt;Univerzitna kniznica v Bratislave 1919 – 2009. Ed. Tibor Trgina. First edition. Produced by University Library in Bratislava. Bratislava : University Library in Bratislava, 2009. p. 6-11. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Library as a geographic point ==
Since its beginning in 1919 the Library has its seat downtown Bratislava, in the heart of the historical centre of the Slovak capital. In comparison with other libraries in the town or in some Slovak regional towns, this unique location means advantage - Bratislava is and will be the political, economic, educational, scientific, cultural and social centre of the country. 
Paradoxically - to point out several facts imposing limitations on its further development - one of the most limiting factors is the seat of the Library in a most attractive city location as well as the historical character of its main buildings. Both aspects practically exclude further expansion in space, better transport access, prevent further enhancement of infrastructure and services.&lt;ref&gt;Univerzitna kniznica v Bratislave 1919 – 2009. Ed. Tibor Trgina. First edition. Produced by University Library in Bratislava. Bratislava : University Library in Bratislava, 2009. p. 6-24. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Present days==
At present ULB is by all means a consolidated institution with a highly developed infrastructure and relevant professional and human petential. The Libray as a multifunctional cultural and library centre visited by approx. 300 thousand visitors and virtually via internet it is sought for assistance by further 700 thousand users a year.

'''Watermark''' describes an object of a predefined format which provides a point of reference for two systems/datasets attempting to establish delta/incremental [[data synchronization|synchronization]]; any object in the queried data source which was created, modified/changed, and/or deleted after the watermark value was established will be qualified as "above watermark" and could/should be returned to a delta-querying partner

==Methodology==
'''Watermark''' term is often used in Directory Synchronization software development projects. For example, products such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], [[Active Directory]], [[Active Directory Application Mode]] (ADAM), and [[Microsoft Identity Integration Server]] 2003/ Microsoft [[Identity Lifecycle Manager Server]] 2007, as well as [[Cisco Unified Communications Manager]] or [[Sun Microsystems]] [[IPlanet]] and other [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]-based directory products are using DirSync and consequently will consume "watermark" object to provide efficient synchronization between directories. Watermark object sometimes can be referred as "cookie".
DirSync control implementation can differ from product to product, however concept of watermark will allow any product to read changes in the directory incrementally.

{{Quotation|The DirSync control is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server extension that enables a program to search an Active Directory partition for objects that have changed. When a program performs a DirSync search, the program creates a cookie that identifies the directory state at the time of an earlier DirSync query. With the first search, the program creates an empty cookie and Active Directory returns all objects that satisfy the query. Active Directory also returns an updated cookie that can be passed to the next search to obtain changes that are made since the first search. This process is repeated for each search. |MSDN||from "How to poll for object attribute changes in Active Directory on Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003'' May 23, 2007}}

He served as Mayor of the City of [[Ventura, California]], from 2009 to 2011 and later as the Planning Director for the [[City of San Diego]]. In October 2014 he became the head of the [[Kinder Institute for Urban Research]] at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. He is considered a leading advocate of the "[[Smart Growth]]" movement in [[urban planning]]. In 2009, he was named to [[Planetizen]]'s list of "Top 100 Urban Thinkers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/topthinkers "Planetizen's Top 100 Urban Thinkers," September 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder and publisher of the ''California Planning &amp; Development Report''.&lt;ref&gt;cp-dr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Fulton was raised in [[Auburn, New York]], located in the [[Finger Lakes]] region of [[Upstate New York]]. He received journalism degrees from [[St. Bonaventure University]] and [[The American University]] in Washington, D.C. His ancestors moved to Auburn from [[Scotland]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to work in textile mills there.

In 1981, after attending university in Washington, D.C., he moved to Los Angeles and worked as a journalist. He subsequently earned a master's degree in urban planning at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Urban Planning at UCLA is part of the Luskin School of Public Affairs.[http://www.spa.ucla.edu/dept.cfm?d=up&amp;s=home&amp;f=upintrohome.cfm] which in 2011 was named the No. 9 graduate program in urban planning in the nation by [[Planetizen]].[http://www.planetizen.com/topschools]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban planner and author in California==

Fulton is best known as a commentator and expert on urban planning in California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofventura.net/city_council/bios/fulton City Council biography, City of Ventura]&lt;/ref&gt; writing hundreds of articles on the topic, including more than 40 Sunday Opinion pieces in the [[Los Angeles Times]] between 1982 and 2009. He is the author of several books, including ''Guide To California Planning'', the standard textbook on urban planning in California. The fourth edition of ''Guide to California Planning'' was published in 2012 and the fifth edition is scheduled for publication in 2017.

His book ''The Reluctant Metropolis: The Politics of Urban Growth in Los Angeles'' was a [[Los Angeles Times]] best-seller upon its publication in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Best-Seller List, ''Los Angeles Times'' Book Review, August 3, 1997 [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/13317416.html?dids=13317416:13317416&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+3%2C+1997&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=11&amp;desc=BESTSELLERS].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave the book a starred review, calling it "a surprisingly lively case study of the battles and alliances of politics, business and people that formed – or deformed – a great American city."&lt;ref&gt;''Publishers Weekly'', April 7, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 15 years later, Christopher Hawthorne, the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times, writing in the newspaper's "Culture Monster" blog, called ''The Reluctant Metropolis'' "highly relevant" and said Fulton is "one of the most level-headed analysts of the built environment to emerge in Southern California in at least two generations."&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, Christopher, "Reading L.A.: Growth, mega-projects, and Freud," December 29, 2011. http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/&lt;/ref&gt;

He also co-authored ''The Regional City: Planning for the End of Sprawl'' with architect [[Peter Calthorpe]], a founder of the [[New Urbanism]] movement, as well as ''California: Land and Legacy,'' an appreciation of California's natural environment and how it has been manipulated for human use. He is a longtime contributor on economic development issues to [[Governing Magazine|''Governing'' Magazine]]; many of his columns dealt with the [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] of his native Upstate New York. In 2010 Fulton published his fifth book, a collection of columns from Governing titled ''Romancing The Smokestack.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.createspace.com/3477293&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2008, Fulton ran Solimar Research Group, a consulting firm and think tank dealing with land use issues. Among his most prominent Solimar works was "Who Sprawls Most,"&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, William, Rolf Pendall, Mai Nguyen, and Alicia Harrison, "Who Sprawls Most: How Growth Patterns Differ Across the U.S. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Center for Urban and Metropolitan Policy, 2001. [http://www.knowledgeplex.org/kp/facts_and_figures/facts_and_figures/relfiles/bi_fulton_sprawls.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; a 2001 study for the [[Brookings Institution]] Center for Urban &amp; Metropolitan Policy (now Metropolitan Policy Program) that debunked myths about sprawl in metropolitan areas around the nation. Among other things, "Who Sprawls Most" concluded that the West is growing densely while other parts of the nation have serious sprawl problems. For many years, "Who Sprawls Most?" was among Brookings' most downloaded publications.

In 2008, Solimar was merged into the Berkeley-based planning consulting firm Design, Community &amp; Environment, where Fulton became a Principal and Shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;McLain, Jim, "Ventura Land Use Consulting Firm Sold," ''Ventura County Star,'' May 14, 2008, [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/may/14/ventura-land-use-consulting-firm-sold/]&lt;/ref&gt; DC&amp;E subsequently merged with The Planning Center to become The Planning Center / DC&amp;E, where Fulton served as a Principal and Shareholder from 2011 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constructiondigital.com/news_archive/tags/mergers/planning-center-and-dc-e-announce-merger&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulton also served as a Senior Fellow at the [[USC Sol Price School of Public Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/sppd/faculty/ Faculty List, School of Planning, Policy, &amp; Development, USC]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Southern California]] from 2004 to 2014, where he taught land use policy and smart growth.&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, USC was named the No. 7 graduate program in urban planning in the nation by [[Planetizen]]. [http://www.planetizen.com/topschools]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the longtime publisher of the periodical ''California Planning &amp; Development Report'', an online platform covering planning news throughout California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cp-dr.com California Planning and Development Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

Fulton has long been active in local politics. In the 1980s, he was a [[planning commissioner]] in the then-new City of [[West Hollywood]], California. In 2003, following his involvement in a campaign to defeat a ballot initiative that would have permitted a large hillside development project, he ran for the city council in Ventura.&lt;ref&gt;Murillo, Sandra, "Urban Planner Enters Ventura Race," ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 4, 2003 [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/04/local/me-fulton4]&lt;/ref&gt; In the election, he received more votes than any other candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Tracey, and Fred Alvarez, "2 New Faces on Ventura City Council," ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 5, 2003.[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/437843451.html?dids=437843451:437843451&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+5%2C+2003&amp;author=Tracy+Wilson+and+Fred+Alvarez&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.1&amp;desc=2+New+Faces+on+Ventura+Council%3B+In+addition+to+the+newcomers%2C+Carl+Morehouse+is+reelected.+Voter+turnout+is+light%2C+owing+in+part+to+the+low-profile+campaign.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Fulton sought re-election as a thoughtful moderate.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, Kevin, "Candidate Prefers Careful Consensus Approach to Issues, ''Ventura County Star,'' October 18, 2007 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/oct/18/candidate-prefers-careful-consensus-approach-to/]&lt;/ref&gt; After a successful re-election campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, Kevin, "Low Turnout May Have Helped Incumbents," ''Ventura County Star,'' November 8, 2007 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/nov/08/ventura-re-elects-incumbents/]&lt;/ref&gt; Fulton was selected deputy mayor by his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, Kevin, "Ventura Councilwoman Newest Mayor," ''Ventura County Star,''December 4, 2007.[http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/dec/04/ventura-councilwoman-newest-mayor/]
&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, Fulton was said to be considering running in 2010 to represent [[California's 35th State Assembly district]], a seat being vacated by the term-limited [[Pedro Nava (politician)|Pedro Nava]].&lt;ref&gt;Herdt, Timm, "Oil Drilling Deal Splits Democrats," ''Ventura County Star,'' March 11, 2009 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/mar/11/oil-drilling-deal-splits-democrats-fracture-the/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he chose not to run for the Assembly seat, which was eventually won by [[Das Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Bill, "I'm Committed to Serving Ventura," Bill Fulton Blog, June 8, 2009 [http://fulton4ventura.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-committed-to-serving-ventura.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Fulton instead was selected as mayor by his city council colleagues in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, Kevin, "Fulton New Ventura Mayor, Tracy Is Deputy," ''Ventura County Star,'' December 8, 2009 [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/dec/07/fulton-new-ventura-mayor-tracy-is-deputy/]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as mayor until his term on the city council ended in December 2011 and did not seek re-election.

During his career as a city councilmember and mayor, Fulton emphasized both urban planning and economic development issues. In 2004, Ventura hired as its city manager [[Rick Cole]], a former mayor of [[Pasadena, California]] who is well known for his leadership on urban planning issues. Two years later Cole was selected by [[Governing Magazine]] as one of its "Public Officials of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.governing.com/poy/2006-Public-Officials-of-the-Year.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Ventura adopted one of the first all-[[infill]] General Plans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, Kevin, "Ventura approves an updated general plan," Ventura County ''Star'', August 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Cole served as a Deputy Mayor for Los Angeles Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] and in 2015 was named City Manager of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = City of Santa Monica - Santa Monica City Council Names Rick Cole as New City Manager|url = https://www.smgov.net/Main/News_Tab/Santa_Monica_City_Council_Names_Rick_Cole_as_New_City_Manager.aspx|website = www.smgov.net|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mayor, Fulton played a major role in promoting Ventura's [[creative economy]], especially the growing arts and culture scene&lt;ref&gt;Kallas, Anne, "Ceremony Celebrates Ventura Art Community," Ventura County Star, November 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the city's innovative high-tech incubator and venture capital efforts, bringing national attention to the city's work in both these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Michael, "Ventura Mayor Tells Other Cities To Nurture Businesses," Ventura County Star, March 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime devotee and former student of UCLA "parking guru" [[Donald Shoup]],&lt;ref&gt;Groves, Martha, "He Puts Parking in His Place," Los Angeles Times, October 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Fulton championed the introduction of Ventura's widely hailed downtown parking management system, which included some paid on-street parking, while he was mayor in 2010. Though the parking system achieved its goal of encouraging more efficient use of parking spaces downtown immediately,&lt;ref&gt;"Parking Management That Actually Manages Parking," September 16, 2010, "http://fulton4ventura.blogspot.com/2010/09/parking-management-that-actually.html&lt;/ref&gt; it incurred the wrath of local [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] activists, who excoriated Fulton on the right-wing [[John and Ken]] talk radio show in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Ingemunson, Eric, "Is John &amp; Ken's 'Head on a Stick' Campaign Coming to Ventura County?", Ingemusings blog, Ventura County Star, December 21, 2010 http://blogs.venturacountystar.com/ingemusings/archives/2010/10/is-john-and-ken.html&lt;/ref&gt; Tea Party activists subsequently qualified an initiative for the Ventura ballot to remove the parking meters. However, the measure was removed from the ballot by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;Clerici, Kevin, "Judge orders parking meters initiative removed from ballot," Ventura County Star, August 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent election, the Tea Party candidate for City Council fared poorly and Fulton's endorsed candidate was elected to succeed him on the council.&lt;ref&gt;Biasotti, Tony, "Favorites win three seats on Ventura City Council," Ventura County Star, November 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, Fulton stepped into California's heated debate over the future of [[redevelopment]] when he was the only mayor in the state who came out in favor of Gov. [[Jerry Brown]]'s proposal to eliminate [[redevelopment agencies]], the longstanding urban revitalization tool. At a speech in Sacramento, Fulton, a longtime advocate of redevelopment reform, said he believed redevelopment should be replaced with a more targeted and effective tool for revitalization. California cities, he said, "should not confuse the job we have to do with the tool we've been accustomed to using."&lt;ref&gt;Herdt, Timm, "Ventura Mayor: Cities Should Prepare for the End of Redevelopment," Ventura County Star, March 24, 2011. http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/mar/24/ventura-mayor-cities-should-prepare-for-end-of/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smart Growth America==
Shortly before leaving office, Fulton announced that he would relocate to Washington, D.C., to become Vice President of [[Smart Growth America]], a nationwide advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;Biasotti, Tony, "Ventura Mayor Plans To Move To D.C. After Leaving Office," Ventura County Star, December 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was making the move to work on a national level, to be closer to his family, and to live in an urban environment that did not require him to drive as much given his visual impairment. However, he said he would continue to be affiliated with The Planning Center | DC&amp;E and the USC Price School and would return to Los Angeles and Ventura frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Chawkins, Steve, "A New Challenge For This Politician," Los Angeles Times, December 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 18 months, Fulton toured the country for Smart Growth America, advocating for a smart growth approach to building cities and assisting local governments with their urban planning efforts. He focused especially on making the argument that smart growth is a better fiscal deal for taxpayers than sprawl, which often requires costly taxpayer subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;Marsteller, Duane, "Growth Planner Urges Less Sprawl For Nashville," ''The Tennessean'', April 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Diego==
In June 2013, then-San Diego Mayor [[Bob Filner]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; made the surprising announcement that Fulton had agreed to return to California to serve as the city's planning director. San Diego's Planning Department had been dismantled under Filner's predecessor, [[Jerry Sanders (politician)|Jerry Sanders]]. Local observers hailed Filner's appointment of Fulton as an inspired choice to restore San Diego's former eminence in the field of urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;Keatts, Andrew, "Four Things To Know About San Diego's New Planning Director," ''Voice of San Diego'', June 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 2013 interview, Fulton called for a "21st-century reinvention" of the city and assured San Diegans, "You have a way better city than you think you do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/business/growth-and-development/|title=Bill Fulton: City makeover-in-chief|last=Showley|first=Rober|date=September 2, 2013|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mayor Filner resigned only seven weeks after Fulton arrived, Acting Mayor [[Todd Gloria]] reaffirmed his faith in Fulton, saying, "He has really been inspiring and improving the morale of the staff."&lt;ref&gt;Calbreath, Dean, "Planner stays calm, carries on with 'smart growth ideas," ''San Diego Daily Transcript'', August 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in San Diego, Fulton re-established the Planning Department, won City Council approval for a city Economic Development Strategy (the first in almost 15 years) and three Community Plan Updates (after five years of delay), and followed through on Filner's promise to create a Civic Innovation Lab. However, new Mayor [[Kevin Faulconer]], who was elected in February 2014 to fill out the remainder of Filner's term, created a separate Economic Development Department and shut down the Civic Innovation Lab. Faulconer had also opposed the Fulton-endorsed [[Barrio Logan]] Community Plan Update, which passed the City Council but was subsequently overturned by voters in an industry-led citywide referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/aug/02/tp-fulton-leaving-city-planner-post/|title=Fulton leaving city planner post|last=Showley|first=Roger|date=August 2, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1, 2014, it was announced Fulton would leave the city effective August 30 to become head of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/west_university/news/nationally-recognized-urban-planner-william-fulton-named-director-of-rice/article_3da1ca64-413a-5ac8-95d3-6e8a6a2e7f0f.html "Nationally recognized urban planner William Fulton named director of Rice University's Kinder Institute for Urban Research"] (August 1, 2014) ''[[Your Houston News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulton said he left for a better opportunity and praised Faulconer's support of Community Plans Updates.&lt;ref&gt;http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/08/01/why-bill-fultons-resignation-isnt-shocking/&lt;/ref&gt; But many local commentators suggested he had been squeezed out by Faulconer. [[San Diego CityBeat]] said: "It began to look like Faulconer’s plan was to make life miserable for Fulton." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13285-face-palm-bill-fulton-is-quitting.html&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy over Fulton's approach lingered long after his departure as the San Diego political community continued to debate the wisdom of a more urban approach to growth in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/12/29/urbanism-took-a-beating-in-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinder Institute at Rice University==
In August 2014 Fulton was named the Director of [[Rice University]]'s Kinder Institute for Urban Research in Houston, TX.&lt;ref&gt;https://kinder.rice.edu/content.aspx?id=2147485438&amp;blogid=306&lt;/ref&gt; Endowed in 2010 by [[Richard Kinder]] and his wife Nancy, leading Houston philanthropists, the Institute was previously best known for the Houston Area Survey, the longest-running continuous public opinion survey in any American city, which was directed by Fulton's predecessor, Rice sociology professor Stephen Klineberg. Klineberg still directs the survey and serves as Director Emeritus of the Kinder Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Homepage : Kinder Institute for Urban Research|url = https://kinder.rice.edu/has/|website = kinder.rice.edu|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Houston, Fulton jumped into the fray, saying the Kinder Institute would use Houston as a laboratory to deal with urban issues and become the leading urban policy institute in the Sunbelt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Rice-s-expanding-Kinder-Institute-to-use-Houston-5980020.php#/0&lt;/ref&gt; Although he declined to say much publicly about urban growth in Houston as he prepared the Kinder Institute's "game plan" in late 2014 and early 2015, he did say that growing debate over densification inside the 610 Loop suggested that Houston has reached a critical moment in "growing up" into a more urban place. Mr. Fulton's management style is to delegate all of his work to other employees, and then promote them to make them feel as though they are equals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonmatters.org/segments/segment-a/2014/12/11/is-gentrification-of-houston-neighborhoods-a-good-or-bad-thing&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, [[Houston Endowment Inc.|Houston Endowment Inc]]. announced a three-year, $7 million grant to the Kinder Institute to build a computerized "Urban Data Platform" and launch three new programs Fulton had created—Urban &amp; Metropolitan Governance; Urban Development, Transportation &amp; Placemaking; and Urban Disparity &amp; Opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kinder grant seeks solutions to 'complex issues'|url = http://www.chron.com/local/education/campus-chronicles/article/Kinder-Institute-grant-aimed-at-helping-find-6798143.php|website = Houston Chronicle|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and family==
In early 2010, Fulton publicly announced that he had been diagnosed with [[retinitis pigmentosa]], a degenerative retinal condition that gradually robs those who have it of their [[peripheral vision]] and [[night vision]] and often leads to complete blindness.&lt;ref&gt;http://fulton4ventura.blogspot.com/2010/02/keeping-vision-alive.html&lt;/ref&gt; Fulton's nephew, Eric Fulton, who is also affected by RP, is active in the Washington, D.C. area in raising funds for the [[Foundation Fighting Blindness]] to find treatments and a cure.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Aaron, "Eric Fulton Fights Blindness For His Family," Rockville ''Patch,'' August 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Brooke Ezra Torf-Fulton, is a recent planning and history graduate of [[Sonoma State University]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and lived in Tel Aviv with her husband, Tzachi, where she has worked with the [[Hiddush]] to advocate for more liberal marriage laws in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Regev, Uri, "Why Is It So Difficult For Jews To Marry in Israel," Huffington Post, May 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They now live in San Francisco.

In the [[Hindu]] epic [[Mahabharata]], '''''Yudhishthira''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: युधिष्ठिर, [[IAST]]: ''Yudhiṣṭhira'') was the eldest son of King [[Pandu]] and Queen [[Kunti]] and the king of [[Indraprastha]] and later of [[Hastinapura]] (Kuru). He was the leader of the successful [[Pandava]] side in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. At the end of the epic, he [[Entering Heaven alive|ascended to heaven]]. He was also blessed with the spiritual vision of second sight by a celestial [[Rishi]] as a boon.

[[File:Pandu Shoots the Ascetic Kindama.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Pandu Shoots the Ascetic Kindama]]

Once a Brahmin rishi, [[Kindama]] and his wife were making love in the forest when Yudhishthira's father [[Pandu]] accidentally shot at them, mistaking them for deer. Before dying, Kindama cursed the king to die when he engages in intercourse with any woman. Due to this curse, Pandu was unable to father children. As an additional penance for the murder, Pandu abdicated the throne of [[Hastinapura]], and his blind brother [[Dhritarashtra]] took over the reins of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lochtefeld|first=James G.|title=The illustrated encyclopedia of Hinduism.|year=2002|publisher=Rosen|location=New York|isbn=9780823931798|pages=194–196|edition=1st.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After knowing the curse of Pandu, Kunti told him that he could be the father of child and told her boon of sage Durvasa. Then Pandu requested Kunti to apply her boon and suggested to call Dharma to get a truthful, knowledgeable and justice knowing son who can rule Hastinapur. On the full moon of May (Sanskrit: Jyeshth mah) first and eldest Pandavas Yudhishthira born.

Yudhishthira's four younger brothers were [[Bhima]], (born by invoking [[Vayu]]); [[Arjuna]], (born by invoking [[Indra]]); and the twins [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]], (born to Pandu's second wife [[Madri]] by invoking the [[Ashwini Gods]]). If [[Karna]], the son of Kunti born before her marriage by invoking [[Surya]] is counted, Yudhishthira would be the second-eldest of Kunti's children.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/831317|title=The Mahābhārata.

Yudhishthira was trained in religion, science, administration and military arts by the Kuru preceptors, [[Kripa]] and [[Drona]]. Specifically, he became a master in using the spear and war chariot. It is said that his spear was so strong that it could penetrate a stone wall as though it were a piece of paper. His chariot always flew at a 4 finger distance above the ground due to his piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mittal|first=J.P.|title=History of ancient India : a new version|year=2006|publisher=Atlantic|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788126906161|pages=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage &amp; Children==

Yudhishthira had two wives, Devika and [[Draupadi]]. Devika was his first wife. Devika married Yudhishthira in her swayamwara. When Yudhishthira was the crown prince of Hastinapur then Yudhishthira attained Devika's Swayamvara and then Devika chose him. Devika was the daughter of King Shivi. It also said in some tales that Devika used to love Yudhishthira and Devika was his first love. After the Lakshyagriha episode, the [[Pandavas]] disguised as Brahmins went to the kingdom of [[Panchala]]. Here, they attended the Swayamwara of [[Draupadi]], who was the princess of Panchala and the daughter of King [[Drupada]]. [[Arjuna]], the younger brother of Yudhishthira, participated in her swayamwara and succeeded in winning her hand in marriage. After the swayamvara, [[Arjuna]] along with his brothers, treaded towards the hut where their mother [[Kunti]] was waiting for them. As soon as they reached the hut, [[Arjuna]] called his mother in delight and said, “Look what we have got as alms”. Kunti who was praying at that moment, without looking what exactly it was, commanded “Whatever [[Arjuna]] has received as alms should be equally distributed amongst the five brothers.”  Hence Draupadi was married off to all the five brothers, making her the common wife of the [[Pandavas]]. But, Mahabharata indirectly shows the love and attraction between five Pandavas and Draupadi. Yudhishthira's first love and wife, his empress was [[Draupadi]].

==Indraprastha==

===Performing The Rajasuya===

[[File:King Yudhisthira Performs the Rajasuya Sacrifice.png|thumb|left|300px|King Yudhishthira Performs the Rajasuya Sacrifice]]

After the coronation at Indraprastha, Yudhishthira set out to perform the [[Rajasuya]] yagna.

[[Arjuna]], [[Bhima]], [[Nakula]], and [[Sahadeva]] led armies across the four corners of the world to obtain tributes from all kingdoms for Yudhishthira's sacrifice. The non-compliant [[Magadha]] king, [[Jarasandha]] was defeated by [[Bhima]] and Krishna. At his sacrifice, Yudhishthira chose Krishna as his honoured guest.

==Losing Kingdom &amp; Exile==

Yudhishthira succumbed to [[Shakuni]]'s challenge in the [[Pachisi]] (game of dice). He lost his kingdom, his brothers and Draupadi. While playing for second time, he lost all his kingdom in the game and was forced into exile for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.

[[File:Yudhisthira answer to yaksha.jpg|thumb|250px|Yudhisthira answering the questions of Yaksha]]


During their exile, the four other Pandavas happened upon a lake, which was haunted by a [[Yaksha]]. The Yaksha challenged the brothers to answer his moral questions before drinking the water; the four Pandavas laughed and drank the water anyway. As a result, they choked on the water and died. Yudhishthira went in last, answered many questions put forth to him by the Yaksha and revived his brothers. This story is often cited as an example of Yudhishthira's upright principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|year=1999|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788176250641|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yaksha later identified himself as Yudhishthira's father, Dharma and pointed them to the kingdom of [[Matsya]] to spend their last year in exile anonymously.

Along with his brothers, Yudhishthira spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of Matsya. He disguised himself as a [[Brahmin]] named Kank (among themselves Pandavas called him Jaya) and taught the game of dice to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kishore|first=B.

==Return To Indraprastha &amp; Kurukshetra War==

When the period of exile was completed, [[Duryodhana]] refused to return Yudhishthira's kingdom. Yudhishthira made numerous diplomatic efforts to retrieve his kingdom peacefully but in vain. He was convinced by Krishna to wage war.

The flag of Yudhishthira's chariot bore the image of a golden moon with planets around it. Two large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were tied to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/dutt/maha09.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07023.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=edited by Subodh|title=The Indian encyclopaedia : biographical, historical, religious, administrative, ethnological, commercial and scientific|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788177552713|pages=4462|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war started, Yudhisthitra sep down of his chariot to take blessings firm his grand sire [[Bhishma]], teachers [[Drona]] and [[Kripa]] and uncle [[Shalya]], who all were in his opposite side in the war showing his respect towards his elders.

Yudhishthira had to bend numerous rules of Dharma during the course of the war. Krishna made him trick [[Drona]] about the news of the death of [[Ashwathama]]. Yudhishthira also had to slay a number of warriors, including his own uncle, [[Shalya]] in a spear fight and his another uncle, Shalya's younger brother he killed them both on the 18th day of the war when Shalya was the commander-in-chief.

==Retirement &amp; Ascent To Heaven==

[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|Yudhishthira and His Dog, Ascending]]

After the war, Yudhisthira was crowned as the Emperor of [[Hastinapura]] for 36 years. He performed [[Ashwamedha]] Yagya on [[Krishna]]'s insistence and established Bharat Varsh as one country under his rule. Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson, [[Parikshit]]. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]]. Among the Pandavas and Draupadi, one-by-one died on the way to reach the top, starting from Draupadi. Finally, it was Yudhisthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him.

===Dog Test===

On reaching the top, [[Indra]] asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as a reason. Indra said he let his family die, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their death's, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin.It turned out that the dog was his god-mother Dharma Devatha in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agarwal|first=Satya P.|title=Selections from the Mahabharata : re-affirming Gita's call for the god of all|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120818743|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test of Patience In Hell===

{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Dark and difficult was the Road.jpg|thumb|Dark and difficult was the Road]]
Upon reaching heaven, Yudhishthira did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead, he only saw Duryodhana and his allies. The Gods told him that his brothers were in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (one of the vedic hells), atoning for their sins.

Yudhishthira loyally went to Naraka to meet his brothers, but the sight of gore and blood horrified him. After hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery, he remained. Yudhishthira ordered the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven with his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him and also to enable him to atone for his sin of deceiving his guru during the war where he half-lied to [[Drona]] about [[Ashwatthama|Ashwatthama's]] death. Thereafter, [[Indra]] and Krishna appeared before him and told him that his brothers (including [[Karna]]) were already in heaven but so were his enemies.

===Yudhishthira's Curse===

After he was made aware that [[Karna]] was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets. Had Yudhishthira's mother [[Kunti]] not kept that fact a secret, the war might have been averted, with millions spared. This is written by Author Pampa in his Pampa Bharata and is not mentioned in [[Mahabharata]] of [[Vyasa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=transl.|title=Book 11. The book of the women.|year=2004|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=9780226252506|editor=Buitenen, J.A.B. van}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==

He was said to be very good at spear-fighting and at chariot racing. Yudhishthira was a polyglot, knowing unusual languages. He was known for his honesty, justice, sagacity, tolerance, good behavior and discernment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01142.htm|title=Mahabharata Text|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dhritarashtra]] said to Sanjaya "The son of [[Kunti]] and [[Pandu]], Yudhishthira, is virtuous and brave and eschews deeds that bring on shame. Endued with great energy, he hath been wronged by Duryodhana. If he were not high-minded, they would in wrath burn the Dhritarashtras. I do not so much dread Arjuna or [[Bhima]] or Krishna or the twin brothers as I dread the wrath of the king, O [[Sūta|Suta]], when his wrath is excited. His austerities are great; he is devoted to ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' practices. His heart's wishes will certainly be fulfilled. When I think of his wrath, O [[Sanjaya]], and consider how just it is, I am filled with alarm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05022.htm|title=Mahabharata SECTION XXII|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Yudhishthira acquired deep spiritual knowledge from Lord Shiva and many prominent sages including [[Vyasa]], [[Parashurama]], [[Bhrigu]], [[Savarni Manu]], [[Narada]], [[Markandeya]], [[Asita Devala]] and [[Dhaumya]]. (Mahabharata Sabha Parva Section 77).

==In The media==

Being a character in Indian [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] and an important person in [[Mahabharata]], this role has been enacted by various actors over the years. Two most famous actors to have played this role are [[Gajendra Chauhan]] in the [[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)]], and Rohit Bharadwaj in the [[Mahabharat (2013 TV series)]]. Both were offered the role of Lord Krishna first and then Yudhishthira. [[Manoj Bajpayee]] has also voiced the character in the animated [[Mahabharat (2013 film)]]. In 2015 series [[Suryaputra Karn]], [[Kanan Malhotra]] played the role.
There is a red dragon in the [[Iron Realms Entertainment]] game [[Aetolia, The Midnight Age]] named Yudhishthira.
