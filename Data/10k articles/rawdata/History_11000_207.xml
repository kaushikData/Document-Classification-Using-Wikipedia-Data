The '''1973 Chilean coup d'état''' was a watershed moment in both the [[history of Chile]] and the [[Cold War]]. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled [[Congress of Chile]] and the [[Socialist Party (Chile)|socialist]] [[President of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]], as well as [[economic warfare]] ordered by [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Richard Nixon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8i.htm|title=Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973|author=Peter Kornbluh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1211/p00s01-woam.html "Controversial legacy of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet ...Gen.

His had been the first democratically elected Marxist government in Latin America..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The military deposed Allende's [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] government and later established a ''junta'' that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the Communist and socialist parties and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR). Allende's appointed army chief, [[Augusto Pinochet]], rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late-1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Genaro Arriagada Herrera|title=Pinochet: The Politics of Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7F8VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA36|year=1988|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-0-04-497061-3|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup,&lt;ref name="Winn 2010 239–275"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Winn|first=Peter|editor-first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|editor-last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|editor-link=|encyclopedia=|title=A Century of Revolution|language=|edition=|date=|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=|location=|isbn=|pages=239–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kornbluh]] (11 September 2013).

Before the coup, Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability for decades; whilst the rest of [[South America]] had been plagued by military juntas and [[Caudillismo]]. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|last=Weimer|first=Tim|publisher=Doubleday|year=2007|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Peter Winn]] characterised the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in the [[history of Chile]].&lt;ref name="Winn 2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Winn|first=Peter|authorlink=|editor-first=Greg &amp; Gilbert|editor-last=Grandin &amp; Joseph|editor-link=|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution: Insurgent and Counterinsurgent Violence during Latin America’s Long Cold War|title=Furies of the Andes|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/content/a-century-of-revolution|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=0-8223-9285-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YJ7ZBGy0wsIC&amp;pg=PA259 259]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weak insurgent movement against the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet regime]] was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government. An internationally supported [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|plebiscite in 1988]] held under the auspices of the military government was followed by a peaceful [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to an elected civilian government]].

==Political background==
{{History of Chile}}
{{Main|Presidency of Salvador Allende}}
Allende contested the [[1970 Chilean presidential election]] with [[Jorge Alessandri|Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez]] of the National Party and [[Radomiro Tomic]] of the Christian Democratic Party. Allende received 36.6% of the vote. Alessandri was a very close second with 35.3%, and Tomic third with 28.1%.&lt;ref name="Jobet"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Partido Socialista de Chile Tomo II|work=Julio César Jobet|language=Spanish|url=http://es.geocities.com/omerocl/partidosoc2.pdf|page=120|accessdate=2009-06-05|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://es.geocities.com/omerocl/partidosoc2.pdf&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:25:06|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Allende received the highest number of votes, according to the Chilean constitution and since none of the candidates won by an absolute majority, the National Congress had to decide among the candidates.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II'', p259 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean constitution did not allow a person to sit as president for two consecutive terms. Therefore, the incumbent president, [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], was ineligible as a candidate. The [[CIA]]'s "Track I" operation was a plan to influence the Congress to choose Alessandri, who would resign after a short time in office, forcing a second election. Frei would then be eligible to run.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/chile/index.html|title=CIA Activities in Chile|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|quote=The political action program under consideration called for the Embassy and Station to influence the Chilean Congress as it took up the matter. This involved encouraging Congress to vote for Alessandri for President in spite of the fact Allende received a slightly higher popular vote. (Allende won 36.3 percent of the vote on 4 September—a plurality, not the majority required by the Constitution to avoid Congressional reaffirmation of the victory.) The Station and the Embassy, working through intermediaries, urged Frei to use his influence with Congress to convince non-leftist forces to vote for Alessandri. The scenario was to have Congress elect Alessandri as President; he would then resign, thereby allowing Frei to run as a candidate against Allende in a new election.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandri announced on 9 September that if Congress chose him, he would resign. Congress then decided on Allende. Soon after hearing news of his win, Allende signed a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees, which stated that he would follow the constitution during his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Régis Debray |title=The Chilean Revolution: Conversations with Allende |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. feared the example of a "well-functioning socialist experiment" on the region and exerted diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure upon Chile's elected socialist government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRdTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|title=Post-Ethical Society: The Iraq War, Abu Ghraib, and the Moral Failure of the Secular|first1=Douglas V.|last1=Porpora|first2=Alexander G.|last2=Nikolaev|first3=Julia Hagemann|last3=May|first4=Alexander|last4=Jenkins|date=7 September 2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://santiagotimes.cl/2014/05/26/new-declassified-files-shed-light-us-role-ousting-allende/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009185456/http://santiagotimes.cl/2014/05/26/new-declassified-files-shed-light-us-role-ousting-allende/ |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIA_website&gt;Kristian C.

In 1972, economics minister [[Pedro Vuskovic]] adopted [[monetary]] policies that increased the amount of circulating currency and devalued the [[Chilean escudo|escudo]], which increased inflation to 140 percent in 1972 and engendered a [[black market]] economy.&lt;ref name=Tercera_Problemas&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.latercera.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070802230054/http://www.latercera.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-02 |title=Comienzan los problemas }}, part of series "Icarito &gt; Enciclopedia Virtual &gt; Historia &gt; Historia de Chile &gt; Del gobierno militar a la democracia" on LaTercera.cl.

In October 1972, Chile suffered the first of many strikes. Among the participants were small-scale businessmen, some professional unions, and student groups. Its leaders – Vilarín, [[Jaime Guzmán]], Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton, Eduardo Arriagada – expected to depose the elected government. Other than damaging the national economy, the principal effect of the 24-day strike was drawing Army head, Gen. [[Carlos Prats]], into the government as Interior Minister, an appeasement to the right wing.&lt;ref name=Tercera_Problemas/&gt; (Gen. Prats had succeeded Army head Gen. [[René Schneider]] after his assassination on 24 October 1970 by a group led by Gen. [[Roberto Viaux]], whom the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had not attempted to discourage.) Gen. Prats supported the legalist [[Schneider Doctrine]] and refused military involvement in a [[coup d'état]] against President Allende.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/05/22/mun6.html |title=mun6 |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the declining economy, President Allende's [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition increased its vote to 43.2% in the March 1973 parliamentary elections; but, by then, the informal alliance between Popular Unity and the Christian Democrats ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830–1973], United States [[Library of Congress Country Studies]]: Chile.

Allende began to fear his opponents, convinced they were plotting his assassination. Using his daughter as a messenger, he explained the situation to [[Fidel Castro]]. Castro gave four pieces of advice: convince technicians to stay in Chile, only sell copper for US dollars, avoid extreme revolutionary acts which would give opponents an excuse to wreck or control the economy, and maintain a proper relationship with the Chilean military until local militias could be established and consolidated. Allende attempted to follow Castro's advice, but the latter two recommendations proved difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Jerome R.|title=Liberators, patriots, and leaders of Latin America 32 biographies|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780786455522|pages=213–214|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The military prior to the coup===
Prior to the coup, the Chilean military had undergone a process of de-politicization since the 1920s, when military personnel participated in government positions. Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded, having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g. [[country club]]s) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society, being to some degree an [[Endogamy|endogamous]] group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers had also relatives in the military.&lt;ref name=privada/&gt; In 1969 elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the [[Tacnazo]]. The Tacnazo was not a proper coup, but a protest against under-funding.&lt;ref&gt;González 2013, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect General [[Carlos Prats]] considered that [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrats]] who were in power in 1969 committed the error of not taking the military's grievances seriously.&lt;ref&gt;González 2013, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments of [[Argentina]] ([[Argentine Revolution|1966]]), [[Bolivia]] ([[Alfredo Ovando Candía|1969]]), [[Brazil]] ([[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964]]) and [[Peru]] ([[Juan Velasco Alvarado|1968]]) were all overthrown in coups and replaced by military governments.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez35&gt;González 2013, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1973 Uruguay [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'état|joined]] the coup d'état wave that swept through the region.&lt;ref name=estado&gt;{{Cite book |last = Lessa |first = Alfonso |title =  Estado de guerra - de la gestación del golpe del 73 a la caída de Bordaberry |year = 1996 |publisher = Editorial Fin de Siglo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor conditions of the Chilean military contrasted with the change of fortune the military of neighboring countries experienced as they came to power in coups.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez35/&gt;

During the decades previous to the coup, the military became influenced by the United States' [[anti-communist]] [[ideology]] in the context of various cooperation programs including the [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|US Army School of the Americas]].&lt;ref name=privada&gt;{{Citation

==Crisis==
{{See also|Tanquetazo}}

On 29 June 1973, Colonel [[Roberto Souper]] surrounded the La Moneda presidential palace with his tank regiment and failed to depose the Allende Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literature.rebelyouth.ca/educhile_1970s/tanquetazo.html |title=Second coup attempt: ''El Tanquetazo'' (the tank attack) |accessdate=2004-10-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013002715/http://literature.rebelyouth.ca/educhile_1970s/tanquetazo.html |archivedate=13 October 2004 |df=dmy }}, originally on RebelYouth.ca. Unsigned, but with citations. Archived on [[Internet Archive]] 13 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; That failed ''coup d’état'' – known as the ''[[Tanquetazo]]'' tank putsch – had been organized by the nationalist "[[Fatherland and Liberty]]" paramilitary group.

In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]] publicly complained about the government's inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.&lt;ref name="Se desata la crisis"/&gt;

For months, the government had feared calling upon the ''[[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]]'' national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. He was forced to resign both as defence minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the [[Alejandrina Cox incident]] and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.&lt;ref name="Se desata la crisis"/&gt; In late August 1973, 100,000{{disputed inline|date=September 2013}} Chilean women congregated at Plaza de la Constitución to protest against the government for the rising cost and increasing shortages of food and fuels, but they were dispersed with tear gas.&lt;ref name="Dream"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/C%20Disk/CIA%20Chile/Item%20030.pdf |title=The Bloody End of a Marxist Dream|work=Time |date=24 September 1973 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber of Deputies' resolution===
On 22 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81–47 a resolution that asked "the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces"&lt;ref&gt;"el Presidente de la República y a los señores Ministros de Estado y miembros de las Fuerzas Armadas y del Cuerpo de Carabineros" [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Acuerdo_de_la_C%C3%A1mara_de_Diputados_sobre_el_grave_quebrantamiento_del_orden_constitucional_y_legal_de_la_Rep%C3%BAblica Acuerdo de la Cámara de Diputados]).&lt;/ref&gt; to "put an immediate end" to "breach[es of] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans."

The resolution declared that the Allende Government sought ". . . to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State . . . [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system", claiming it had made "violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct." Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the ''creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces''. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as ''notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks''.

It can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows "...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

===President Allende's response===
Two days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress' declaration as "destined to damage the country’s prestige abroad and create internal confusion", predicting "It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors". He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority "constitutionally required" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress was "invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government" and "subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will".&lt;ref name="La respuesta del Presidente Allende"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifiesto_al_pa%C3%ADs_de_Salvador_Allende,_respondiendo_al_acuerdo_de_la_camara_de_diputados La respuesta del Presidente Allende] on Wikisource. {{en icon}} [[wikisource:Salvador Allende's Last Speech|English translation]] on Wikisource. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet "at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism". In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d’état'' or a civil war with a declaration "full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand" and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.

President Allende wrote: "Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives".

Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means—having already "paralyzed" the State—they sought to "destroy" it. He concluded by calling upon "the workers, all democrats and patriots" to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the "revolutionary process".&lt;ref name="La respuesta del Presidente Allende"/&gt;

In one particular conversation about the news of Allende's overthrow, Kissinger complains about the lack of recognition of the American role in the overthrow of a "communist" government, upon which Nixon remarked, "Well, we didn't – as you know – our hand doesn't show on this one.".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A later CIA report contended that US agents maintained close ties with the Chilean military to collect intelligence but no effort was made to assist them and "under no circumstances attempted to influence them."&lt;ref name="CIA 2000_12" /&gt;

Historian [[Peter Winn]] found "extensive evidence" of United States complicity in the coup. He states that its covert support was crucial to engineering the coup, as well as for the consolidation of power by the Pinochet regime following the takeover. Winn documents an extensive CIA operation to fabricate reports of a coup against Allende, as justification for the imposition of military rule.&lt;ref name="Winn 2010 239–275"/&gt; Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the coup, citing documents declassified by the [[Clinton administration]].&lt;ref name="The Pinochet File" /&gt; Other authors point to the involvement of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], agents of which allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard the [[La Moneda Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sun Axelsson|Axelsson, Sun]] ''Chili, le Dossier Noir. (Chile: The Black File)'' [[Paris]], [[France]]: [[Éditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], 1974, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Government's hostility to the election of Allende in Chile was substantiated in documents declassified during the Clinton administration, which show that CIA covert operatives were inserted in Chile in order to prevent a Marxist government from arising and for the purpose of spreading anti-Allende propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Memorandum for Mr. Henry Kissinger| publisher=United States Department of State| author=Ad Hoc Interagency Working Group on Chile| date=4 December 1970| url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch20-01.htm| accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the Church Committee report, the CIA was involved in multiple plots designed to remove Allende and then let the Chileans vote in a new election where he would not be a candidate. The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]] approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the [[40 Committee]], attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm [[Jorge Alessandri]] as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections.

The other approach of the CIA, also known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]] approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country. [[False flag]] operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen.&lt;ref name="The Pinochet File"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for [[black propaganda]] against Allende, channeled mostly through ''[[El Mercurio]]''. Financial assistance was also given to Allende's political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company [[ITT Corporation]] owned 70% of Chitelco (the Chilean Telephone Company), and also funded ''El Mercurio''. The CIA used ITT as a means of disguising the source of the illegitimate funding Allende's opponents received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp#17 |title=U.S. Dept. of State FOIA Electronic Reading Room – Hinchey Report (CIA Activities in Chile) |publisher=Foia.state.gov |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/world/edward-korry-81-is-dead-falsely-tied-to-chile-coup.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|title=Edward Korry, 81, Is Dead; Falsely Tied to Chile Coup|first= David|last=Stout|date=30 January 2003|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2013/9/10/the_pinochet_file_how_us_politicians_banks_corporations_aided_chilean_coup_dictatorship The Pinochet File: How U.S. Politicians, Banks and Corporations Aided Chilean Coup, Dictatorship].

==Australian involvement==

An [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS) station was established in Chile out of the Australian embassy in July 1971 at the request of the CIA and authorised by then Liberal Party Foreign Minister [[William McMahon]]. Newly-elected Labor Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] was informed of the operation in February 1973 and signed a document ordering the closure of the operation several weeks later. It appears, however, the last ASIS agent did not leave Chile until October 1973, one month after the CIA-backed coup d'état had brought down the Allende Government. There were also two officers of [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), Australia's internal security service, who were based in Santiago working as migration officers during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forty years after the military coup which brought down Chilean President Salvador Allende, refugees in Australia are still raising questions about the country's involvement in the affair.|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/09/11/questions-over-australian-involvement-chile-coup|publisher=SBS|date=11 September 2013|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASIS and ASIO in Chile|url=https://www.academia.edu/23060812/ASIS_and_ASIO_in_Chile_Transparency_and_Double_Standards_Four_Decades_after_the_Coup_in_40_Years_Are_Nothing_History_and_Memory_of_the_1973_Coups_Dètat_in_Uruguay_and_Chile._2014-15|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|author=Florencia Melgar and Pablo Leighton|accessdate=30 October 2016}} pp78-92, 2015 in ''40 Years are Nothing: History and memory of the 1973 coups d’état in Uruguay and Chile'' Edited by Pablo Leighton and Fernando López, {{ISBN|1443876429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of timely closure of Australia's covert operations was one of the reasons for the sacking of the Director of ASIS on 21 October 1975.

==Military action==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--first 3 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
By 7:00&amp;nbsp;am on the 11th of September 1973, a date chosen to match the historical [[Government Junta of Chile (1924)|coup of September 11th, 1924]], the Navy captured [[Valparaíso]], strategically stationing ships and marine infantry in the central coast and closed radio and television networks. The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the [[La Moneda|presidential palace]] with his bodyguards, the "Group of Personal Friends" (GAP). By 8:00&amp;nbsp;am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.

President Allende and Defence minister [[Orlando Letelier]] were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the ''coup d’état'', to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to [[José Toribio Merino]], planner of the ''coup d’état'' and executive officer to Adm. Montero. [[Augusto Pinochet]], General of the Army, and [[Gustavo Leigh]], General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the ''Carabineros'' (uniformed police), [[José María Sepúlveda]], and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), [[Alfredo Joignant]] answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. [[Patricio Carvajal]], he was arrested as the first prisoner of the ''coup d’état''.

Despite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the ''coup d’état'' leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30&amp;nbsp;am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.

At approx. 9:00 the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros of the La Moneda]] left the building.&lt;ref&gt;

By 9:00&amp;nbsp;am, the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago. Allende refused to surrender, despite the military's declaring they would bomb the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace if he resisted being deposed. The Socialist Party along with his Cuban advisors proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaquín industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-''coup d’état''; the president rejected the proposition.  According to Tanya Harmer, Allende's refusal to lead an insurgency against the coup is evidence of his unrelenting desire to bring about change through non-violent methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allende's Chile and the Inter-American Cold War|last=Harmer|first=Tanya|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8078-3495-4|editor-last=Odd Arne Westad|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military attempted negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office. Finally, Allende gave a [[wikisource:Salvador Allende's Last Speech|farewell speech]], telling the nation of the ''coup d’état'' and his refusal to resign his elected office under threat.

Leigh ordered the presidential palace bombed, but was told the Air Force's [[Hawker Hunter]] jet aircraft would take forty minutes to arrive. Pinochet ordered an armoured and infantry force under General Sergio Arellano to advance upon the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace. When the troops moved forward, they were forced to retreat after coming under fire from GAP snipers perched on rooftops. General Arellano called for helicopter gunship support from the commander of the Chilean Army Puma helicopter squadron and the troops were able to advance again.&lt;ref&gt;La misión era matar: el juicio a la caravana Pinochet-Arellano, By Jorge Escalante Hidalgo, Page 43, [[LOM Ediciones]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean Air Force aircraft soon arrived to provide close air support for the assault (by bombing the Palace), but the defenders did not surrender until nearly 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FewtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IDMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7165,1410181&amp;dq |title=ROME NEWS TRIBUNE Sep 11, 1973 |publisher=Google |date=11 September 1973 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; First reports said the 65-year-old president had died fighting troops, but later police sources reported he had committed suicide.

==Casualties==
{{Main|Forced disappearance#Chile}}
In the first months after the ''coup d’état,'' the military killed thousands of Chilean leftists, both real and suspected, or forced their "[[forced disappearance|disappearance]]". The military imprisoned 40,000 political enemies in the [[Estadio Nacional de Chile|National Stadium of Chile]]; among the tortured and killed ''[[desaparecidos]]'' (disappeared) were the U.S. citizens [[Charles Horman]], and [[Frank Teruggi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Evans |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB33/index.html |title=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 33 |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1973, the Chilean songwriter [[Víctor Jara]], and 70 other political killings were perpetrated by the death squad, [[Caravan of Death]] (''Caravana de la Muerte'').

After Gen. Pinochet lost the election in the 1988 plebiscite, the [[Rettig Commission]], a multi-partisan truth commission, in 1991 reported the location of [[torture]] and [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] centers, among others, [[Colonia Dignidad]], the tall ship [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|''Esmeralda'']] and Víctor Jara Stadium. Later, in November 2004, the [[Valech Report]] confirmed the number as less than 3,000 killed, and reduced the number of cases of forced disappearance; but some 28,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and tortured.
Sixty individuals died as a direct result of fighting on 11 September, although the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] and GAP continued to fight the following day. In all, 46 of Allende's guard (the GAP, ''Grupo de Amigos Personales'') were killed, some of them in combat with the soldiers that took the Moneda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/165/29585.html |title=Pinochet Stripped of Legal Immunity |agency=Associated Press |date=11 January 2006 |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allende's Cuban-trained guard would have had about 300 elite commando-trained GAP fighters at the time of the coup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Haslam|title=The Nixon Administration and the Death of Allende's Chile: A Case of Assisted Suicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBcDJ34AJGMC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2005|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-84467-030-7|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of brute military force, especially the use of Hawker Hunters, may have handicapped many GAP fighters from further action.&lt;ref name="ferrada-noli.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferrada |first=Marcello |url=http://ferrada-noli.blogspot.com/2008_09_13_archive.html |title=Marcello Ferrada-Noli.

According to official reports prepared after the return of democracy, at La Moneda only two people died: President Allende and the journalist Augusto Olivares (both by suicide). Two more were injured, Antonio Aguirre and Osvaldo Ramos, both members of President Allende's entourage; they would later be allegedly kidnapped from the hospital and disappeared. In November 2006, the Associated Press noted that more than 15 [[bodyguard]]s and aides were taken from the palace during the coup and are still unaccounted for; in 2006 Augusto Pinochet was indicted for two of their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://news.bostonherald.com/international/view.bg?articleid=169298 Pinochet indicted for deaths of Allende bodyguards, put under house arrest], 27 November 2006.

On the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army [[sergeant]]s, three army [[corporal]]s, four [[Private (rank)|army privates]], 2 navy lieutenants, 1 navy corporal, 4 naval cadets, 3 navy conscripts and 15 carabineros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Martires y Victimas de la Unidad Popular |first=Juan Alvaro |last=Arce |url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/1687/History_Chile_1970-73/martires.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5khC56EoN?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/1687/History_Chile_1970-73/martires.html |archivedate=21 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all |access-date=15 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mopping-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet said: ''"sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nRMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=96EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2709,16507&amp;dq |title=Chile wars armed civilians. |work=The Montreal Gazette. |date=17 September 1973 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A press photographer also died in the crossfire while attempting to cover the event.

While fatalities in the battle during the coup might have been relatively small, the Chilean security forces sustained 162 dead in the three following months as a result of continued resistance,&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert L.

Retrieved 11 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the plans for the coup called for the arrest of every man, woman and child on the streets the morning of 11 September. Of these approximately 40,000 to 50,000 perfunctory arrests, several hundred individuals would later be detained, questioned, tortured, and in some cases murdered.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} While these deaths did not occur before the surrender of Allende's forces, they occurred as a direct result of arrests and round-ups during the coup's military action.

==Allende's death==
{{Main|Death of Salvador Allende}}
President Allende died in La Moneda during the coup. The junta officially declared that he committed suicide with a rifle given to him by Fidel Castro, two doctors from the infirmary of La Moneda stated that they witnessed the suicide,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hilton, [http://wais.stanford.edu/Chile/chile_conflict.html Chile: The Continuing Historical Conflict], World Association of International Studies, 22 December 1997. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and an autopsy labelled Allende's death a suicide. Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, one of the primary instigators of the coup, claimed that "Allende committed suicide and is dead now."{{citequote|date = September 2013}} Patricio Guijon, one of the president's doctors, had testified to witnessing Allende shoot himself under the chin with the rifle while seated on a sofa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carroll |first1=Rory |title=Exhumation fails to end mystery over death of Salvador Allende |url=https://advance-lexis-com.ezproxy.hofstra.edu/api/document?collection=news&amp;id=urn:contentItem:531F-86C1-JCDH-0208-00000-00&amp;context=1516831 |accessdate=25 September 2018 |publisher=The Observer |date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, few of Allende's supporters believed the explanation that Allende had killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Róbinson Rojas, [http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/murder.htm ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''], originally published by Harper and Row, New York, 1975,1976-Fitzhenry&amp;Whiteside Ltd., Toronto, Canada, 1975. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Allende's body was exhumed in May 2011. The exhumation was requested by members of the Allende family, including his daughter Isabel who viewed the question of her father's death as "an insult to scientific intelligence." A scientific autopsy was performed and the autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding on 19 July 2011 that Allende committed suicide using an [[AK-47]] rifle.&lt;ref name="ak-47"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/20/salvador-allende-committed-suicide-autopsy Chilean president Salvador Allende committed suicide, autopsy confirms] ''The Guardian'', 2011-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was composed of international forensic experts to assure an independent evaluation.

However, on 31 May 2011, Chile's state television station reported that a top-secret military account of Allende's death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was only found when the house was destroyed in the [[2010 Chile earthquake|2010 Chilean earthquake]]. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told [[Televisión Nacional de Chile]] "that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/science/articles/2011/05/31/chile_tv_secret_report_suggests_allende_murdered/|title=Chile TV: Secret report suggests Allende murdered|last=Vegara|first=Eva|date=31 May 2011|work=boston.com|access-date=2018-08-03|publisher=Associated Press|last2=Warren|first2=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two forensics experts said they believed he was shot with a small-calibre weapon prior to the AK-47.

On 13 September, the Junta dissolved Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/chile/story/0,,1033575,00.html Junta general names himself as new President of Chile]. ''The Guardian,'' Friday, 14 September 1973&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it outlawed the parties that had been part of the Popular Unity coalition, and all political activity was declared "in recess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/countries/Chile/profile.cfm?folder=History+in+brief|title=Economist.com – Country Briefings: Chile|date=2 July 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702045239/http://www.economist.com/countries/Chile/profile.cfm?folder=History+in+brief|archivedate=2 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military government took control of all media including the radio broadcasting that Allende attempted to use to give his final speech to the nation. It is not known how many Chileans actually heard the last words of Allende as he spoke them, but a transcript and audio of the speech survived the military government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1973/september/11.htm|title=Salvador Allende: Last speech|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Prensa Chilena En La Encrucijada: Entre La Voz Monocorde Y La Revolución Digital|last=M.

Initially, there were four leaders of the junta: In addition to General Augusto Pinochet, from the Army, there were General Gustavo Leigh Guzmán, of the Air Force; Admiral José Toribio Merino Castro, of the Navy (who replaced Constitutionalist Admiral [[Raúl Montero]]); and General Director [[César Mendoza|César Mendoza Durán]], of the National Police (''Carabineros de Chile'') (who replaced Constitutionalist General Director José María Sepúlveda). Coup leaders soon decided against a rotating presidency and named General Pinochet permanent head of the junta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp#18 Hinchey Report on CIA Activities in Chile] 18 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months that followed the coup, the ''junta'', with authoring work by historian [[Gonzalo Vial Correa|Gonzalo Vial]] and admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled ''El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile'' (commonly known as ''El Libro Blanco'', "The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile"), where they attempted to justify the coup by claiming that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged ''[[Plan Zeta]]'', or Plan Z) that Allende's government or its associates were purportedly preparing. Historian [[Peter Winn]] states that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] had an extensive part to play in fabricating the conspiracy and in selling it to the press, both in Chile and internationally.&lt;ref name="Winn 2010 239–275"/&gt; Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda,&lt;ref name="Valech1"&gt;[http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/comision_valech/pdf/Capitulo3.pdf Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura CAPÍTULO III Contexto].&lt;/ref&gt; some Chilean historians pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Vial Correa|first=Gonzalo|title=Carlos Altamirano, el Plan Z y la "Operación Blanqueo" |publisher=La Segunda|date=23 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued violence===
{{See also|Armed resistance in Chile (1973–90)}}
[[File:Desaparecidos Chile 1973.JPG|thumb|Pictures of persons missing after the 1973 Chilean coup]]
The newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' published on its front page a photograph showing prisoners at the [[Quiriquina Island]] Camp who had been captured during the fighting in [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. The photograph's caption stated that some of the detained were local leaders of the "[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Unidad Popular]]" while others were "extremists who had attacked the armed forces with firearms". The photo is reproduced in Docuscanner.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docscanner.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/prisoner-of-pinochet-at-quiriquina-island-2/ |title=Prisoner of Pinochet at Quiriquina Island |accessdate=14 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with reports in newspapers and broadcasts in Concepción about the activities of the Armed Forces, which mentioned clashes with "extremists" on several occasions from 11 to 14 September. Nocturnal skirmishes took place around the Hotel Alonso De Ercilla in Colo Colo and San Martino Street, one block away from the Army and military police administrative headquarters. A recently published testimony about the clashes in Concepcion offers several plausible explanations for the reticence of witnesses to these actions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Ferrada-Noli.

Besides political leaders and participants, the coup also affected many everyday Chilean citizens.  Thousands were killed, went missing, and were injured.  Because of the political instability in their country, many relocated elsewhere.  Canada, among other countries, became a main point of refuge for many Chilean citizens.  Through an operation known as “Special Movement Chile”, more than 7,000 Chileans were relocated to Canada in the months following September 11, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=John|last2=Carty|first2=Bob|title=Chile's 1972 Coup, 40 Years Later: Observances, Part 2|url=http://opencanada.org/branch-news/chiles-1973-coup-40-years-later-observances-part-two/|website=Opencanada.org|publisher=Canadian International Council|accessdate=18 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627071325/http://opencanada.org/branch-news/chiles-1973-coup-40-years-later-observances-part-two/|archivedate=27 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These refugees are now known as [[Chilean Canadian]] people and have a population of over 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=1118296&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=0&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0|title=unknown|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. view of the coup continues to spark controversy. Beginning in late 2014 in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin,  [[United States Southern Command]] (USSOUTHCOM) [[William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies]] (CHDS), located at the [[National Defense University]] in Washington, D.C., has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints included that the Center knowingly protected a CHDS professor from Chile who was a former top advisor to Pinochet after belonging to the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional]] / [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] state terrorist organization (whose attack against a former Chilean foreign minister in 1976 in Washington, D.C. resulted in two deaths, including that of an American). “Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive,” said [[Patrick Leahy|Sen. Patrick Leahy,]] D-Vermont, the author of the “Leahy Law” prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Edwin Andersen [https://www.academia.edu/25856284/Unpunished_U.S._Southern_Command_role_in_09_Honduran_military_coup Unpunished U.S. Southern Command role in '09 Honduran military coup] May 24, 2016, Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marisa Taylor and Kevin G.

Roberto Theime, the military leader of [[Fatherland and Liberty]], who was imprisoned on September 11 was shocked to hear about the degree of violence the coup was carried out with. Despite being an arduous opponent of Unidad Popular he had expected a cleaner coup.&lt;ref&gt;González 2013, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction===
President of Argentina [[Juan Domingo Perón]] condemned the coup calling it a "fatality for the continent". Before the coup Perón had warned the more radical of his followers to stay calm and "not do as Allende".&lt;ref name=Ortega2014&gt;{{cite journal|first=José|last=Ortega|url=http://www.encrucijadaamericana.cl/articulos/a6_n2/4_peron_y_chile.pdf|title=Perón y Chile|journal=Encucijada Americana|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine students protested the coup at the Chilean embassy in Buenos Aires, where part of them chanted that they were "available to cross the Andes" (''dispuestos a cruzar la cordillera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl9n3X5AqIQ|title=DiFilm – Protesta de estudiantes en la Embajada de Chile 1973|first=|last=DiFilm|date=10 March 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
The commemoration of the coup is associated to competing narratives on its cause and effects.&lt;ref name=Waldman2014/&gt; The coup has been commemorated by detractors and supporters in various ways.

On September 11 of 1975 Pinochet lit the [[Llama de la Libertad]] (lit. Flame of Liberty) to commemorate the coup. This flame was extinguished in 2004.&lt;ref name=EMOLbachelet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2003/10/08/125557/ministerio-de-defensa-pagara-el-gas-de-la-llama-de-la-libertad.html |title=Ministerio de Defensa pagará el gas de la llama de la libertad |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Emol |publisher=[[El Mercurio]] |access-date=February 3, 2016|quote=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archivo.abc.com.py/2004-10-19/articulos/140158/apagan-la-llama-eterna-de-la-libertad-encendida-por-pinochet | website=[[ABC Color]] | title=Apagan la "Llama Eterna de la Libertad" encendida por Pinochet |date=19 October 2004 |access-date=22 February 2013 |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avenida Nueva Providencia]] in [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]], Santiago, was renamed Avenida 11 de Septiembre in 1980.&lt;ref name=24hrsMUNI&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.24horas.cl/nacional/comienza-cambio-de-senaletica-por-nueva-providencia-744252|title = Municipio cambia de señalética de avenida por "Nueva Providencia"|date = 14 July 2013|access-date = 15 July 2013|website = 24 Horas |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 30th anniversary of the coup President [[Ricardo Lagos]] inaugurated the Morandé 80 entrance to [[La Moneda]]. This entrance to the presidential palace had been erased during the repairs the dictatorship did to the building after the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lanacion.cl/2003/09/11/la-moneda-abrio-su-puerta-a-la-memoria/|title=La Moneda abrió su puerta a la memoria|first=|last=Historico|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===40th anniversary===
The 40th anniversary of the coup in 2013 was particularly intense.&lt;ref name=Waldman2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldman |first1=Gilda |date=2014 |title=A cuarenta años del golpe militar en Chile.

The centre-left opposition refused to attend the commemoration event organized by [[Sebastián Piñera]]'s right-wing government organizing instead a separate event.&lt;ref name=Elpaisuy40/&gt; [[Osvaldo Andrade]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] explained that attendance was not viable as Piñera's government was "packed with passive accomplices" of the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=September 1, 2013 |title=Chile: oposición no asistirá al acto del Gobierno de conmemoración del golpe militar |url=https://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/chile-oposicion-no-asistira-al-acto-del-gobierno-de-conmemoracion-del-gol |work=América Economía |location= |access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some right-wing politicians also declined the invitation.&lt;ref name=planton&gt;{{cite news |last=Barreno |first=Jorge |date=September 9, 2013 |title=Plantón a Piñera en el acto de conmemoración del golpe militar |url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2013/09/09/noticias/1378742753.html|access-date=December 3, 2017 |work=El Mundo |location= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; President candidate [[Michelle Bachelet]] planned to spend the day visiting [[ Museum of Memory and Human Rights]] and commented that "it is not fair to talk about the coup as something unavoidable".&lt;ref name=planton/&gt; President Piñera held an unusual speech in which he denounced "passive accomplices" like news reporters who deliberately changed or omitted the truth and judges who rejected [[recurso de amparo|recursos de amparos]] that could have saved lives. People who knew things or could have known things but decided to stay quiet were also criticized as passive accomplices in Piñera's speech.&lt;ref name=Waldman2014/&gt;

A number of new films, theatre plays, and photography expositions were held to cast light on the abuses and censorship of the dictatorship.&lt;ref name=Elpaisuy40&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/protesta-aniversario-golpe-chile.html|title=Protesta a 40 años del golpe en Chile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of new books published on the subject in 2013 was such that it constituted an editorial boom.&lt;ref name=Waldman2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elpaisuy40/&gt; The Museum of Memory and Human Rights also displayed a collection of declassified CIA, FBI, Defense Department, and White House records illustrating the U.S. role in the dictatorship and the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile: Secrets of State|editor=Peter Kornbluh|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/chile/2017-09-11/chile-secrets-state|accessdate=August 6, 2018|date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences and seminaries on the subject of coup were also held. Various series and interviews with politicians on the subject of the coup and the dictatorship were aired on Chilean TV in 2013.&lt;ref name=Waldman2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20881">The '''World Monuments Watch''' is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) and [[American Express]] aimed at identifying and [[Historic preservation|preserving]] the world’s most important endangered cultural landmarks.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = American Express Company Gift Launches International Program to List and Protect Sites | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/pubs_Milestones1995Fall.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It targets selected sites for immediate action, to call attention to the need for innovative approaches to protect threatened sites throughout the world.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release /&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, the program publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, private organizations active in the field of heritage conservation, and concerned individuals.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then convene to evaluate and select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the urgency of its situation, the viability of proposed remedies, and the site's overall significance.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release /&gt; WMF and American Express award grants to sites included on the Watch List through the WMF Fund, which is composed of donations from corporate, individual and foundation sponsors.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release /&gt; These grants are meant to support activities such as strategic planning, emergency and technical assistance, educational and local fund raising programs, and conservation treatment.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release /&gt;

==1996 Watch List==
The 1996 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on August 4, 1995.&lt;ref name=1996_press_release /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20988">The '''2nd World Congress of the Comintern''' was a gathering of approximately 220 voting and non-voting representatives of [[Communism|Communist]] and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] political parties from around the world, held in [[Petrograd]] and [[Moscow]] from July 19 to August 7, 1920. The 2nd Congress is best remembered for formulating and implementing the [[Twenty-one Conditions|21 Conditions]] for membership in the [[Communist International]].
[[File:2nd World Congress of the Comintern Lenin Zinoviev Bukharin Gorky.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Delegates II Congress of the Comintern: [[Lev Karakhan]] (second from left), [[Karl Radek]] (third, smoking), [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (fifth), [[Mikhail Lashevich]] (seventh, form), [[Maxim Gorky]] (ninth, shaved), [[Vladimir Lenin]] (tenth, hands in pockets), [[Sergey Zorin]] (eleventh in the Hat), [[Grigory Zinoviev]] (thirteenth, hands behind his back), [[Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova]] (nineteen white blouse) and [[Abram Belenky]] (in a hat).]]

==Overview==
The 2nd World Congress of the Communist International, held in the summer of 1920, has been regarded by scholars as "the first authentic international meeting of the new organization's members and supporters," owing to the [[ad hoc]] nature of the [[Founding Convention of the Comintern|1919 Founding Convention]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D271"&gt;Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, ''Lenin and the Comintern: Volume 1.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1972; pg. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering is also significant for the level of participation of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], who participated in the affairs of the gathering more intensely than at any other, preparing a host of key documents and actively helping to chart the gathering's course.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D271" /&gt;

The 2nd World Congress took place at a time of heated world political passion, as British historian [[E. H. Carr|E.H. Carr]] later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The second congress marked the crowning moment in the history of the Comintern as an international force, the moment when the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] seemed most certainly on the point of transforming itself into a European revolution, with the destinies of the [[RSFSR]] merged in those of some broader European unit."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923: Volume 3.'' London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas in 1919 no mass Socialist party had participated in the activities of the Founding Convention, the 1920 gathering saw the inclusion of credentialed delegates from several large European groups, including the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), and the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D272"&gt;Lazitch and Drachkovitch, ''Lenin and the Comintern,'' pg. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolsheviks denied permission to attend to the recently formed (January 1920) Ukrainian Communist Party (CPU). 

It was at the 2nd World Congress that the nature of Communist parties was decided upon, the conditions for their admission to the Communist International set, and the relationship of the national organizations to their international directing center formally established for the first time.

==Delegate composition==
[[File:20-lenin-infantilesickness.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The first English edition of Lenin's ''"Left Wing" Communism,'' as distributed to delegates to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern.]]
The official records of the 2nd World Congress indicate that a total of 218 delegates participated in the proceedings, including 54 representatives of [[Socialism|Socialist]], [[Social Democracy|Social Democratic]], and other non-Communist political parties and 12 representatives of youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-8"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; At least 30 delegates were representatives of the various nationalities of [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-9"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates were housed in Moscow at the Delevoi Dvor, a hotel a short walk from the Congress's sessions held at the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-11"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; With food in short supply, fare provided to the delegates was poor, with some delegates forced to rely to some extent upon stores brought into the country with them.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-11" /&gt;

Upon arriving at their hotel rooms, delegates were provided with an assortment of written reports, draft resolutions, and copies of two recently published books — ''[[Terrorism and Communism]]'' by [[Leon Trotsky]] and ''"[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' by [[V.I. Lenin]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-12"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates participated a wide range of events, touring the country, attending shop meetings, watching theatrical performances, and participating in a [[subbotnik]] loading [[railroad ties]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-12"/&gt;

==Background==

On April 22, 1920, the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) voted to hold a 2nd World Congress of its member parties at some indefinite date in the near future.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-6"&gt;John Riddell (editor and translator), ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!: Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920.'' In two volumes. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1991; vol. 1, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed on June 14, 1920, by the formal publication by ECCI of a call for a 2nd World Congress to be held in Moscow one month hence.&lt;ref&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Political parties pledging allegiance to the organization were urged to send delegations at once.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-6" /&gt;

During this period [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was subject to an armed [[blockade]] by land and sea, making travel extremely difficult. Legal passage was possible only through the [[Estonia]]n port of Revel (known today as [[Tallinn]]), but even this means was difficult due to the systematic denial of [[passport|travel passports]] to radicals intending on traveling to [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-6" /&gt;

[[Polish–Soviet War|War between Soviet Russia and Poland]] raged in the summer of 1920 and wrecked locomotives and derailed freight cars lined the tracks, further complicating the transportation situation.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-10"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some delegates were forced by circumstances to use false passports and identity documents or to travel without any legal documentation whatsoever, such as by [[stowaway|stowing away]] on a ship.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-7"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[France|French]] delegates lost their lives in transit, when a small fishing boat setting sail from [[Murmansk]] in an attempt to run the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] blockade went down in stormy weather.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-7" /&gt;

The Congress was scheduled to open on July 15, but owing to rampant transit difficulties, many delegates had not arrived in Soviet Russia by that date. ECCI decided to postpone the first working sessions by one week.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-14"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a meal in the Great Hall of [[Smolny Institute|Smolny]], the delegates, accompanied by thousands of Petrograd workers, marched to the [[Tauride Palace|Uritsky Theater]] where they heard a [[keynote speech|keynote address]] on the international situation and the tasks of the Comintern delivered by Lenin.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-14" /&gt; Afterwards the delegates participated in a mass demonstration before gathering at the former stock exchange to see a costume drama called "Spectacle of the Two Worlds" performed by a cast of 3,000.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-14" /&gt;

Following the opening festivities in Petrograd, a three-day break followed, after which the Congress reconvened in Moscow in the former Vladimir Throne Room of the Kremlin.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-15"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Four official languages were used at the convention — English, French, German, and Russian — with secretaries typing convention documents in each.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-15" /&gt; The primary languages spoken on the floor were French and German, with simultaneous translations taking place in various corners of the room.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-15" /&gt;

The Congress elected a Bureau (governing committee) to make decisions about [[parliamentary procedure|procedure]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-15" /&gt; All delegates had the right to submit resolution proposals to the Congress and the privilege was not an empty one, as a number of such proposals were submitted.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-16"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Voting delegates were provided with red cards, non-voting "consultative" delegates blue cards, and guests green cards, with votes taken by means of counting cards.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-16" /&gt; Voting strength of each delegation was based upon the relative importance of each national party to the international communist movement rather than the actual size of the membership of these groups.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-16" /&gt; At no point in the Congress was a [[recorded vote|roll call vote]] taken; rather, a simple counting of cards raised on the floor determined all outcomes.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-16" /&gt;

===Notable Topics and Decisions Discussed===

====The 21 Conditions====
[[File:Grigorii Zinovieff 1920.jpg|thumb|righjt|200px|Comintern Chairman Grigorii Zinoviev.]]
The 2nd World Congress began its actual work on July 23, 1920.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-42"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Two sessions were dedicated to discussion of the structure and role of Communist parties, with a summary report and theses delivered to the body by Comintern Chairman [[Grigorii Zinoviev]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-42" /&gt; After Zinoviev's theses on the matter were unanimously adopted by the assembled delegates, debate moved to conditions for admission to the Communist International, a discussion which ultimately produced a document known as the [[Twenty-one conditions|21 Conditions]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-42" /&gt;

Ever since the founding of the Comintern in 1919, a number of political parties in the Social Democratic tradition — including the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) — had sought admission into the ranks of the international organization.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-42" /&gt; To the Comintern leadership, the electoral orientation and [[pacifism]] of such organizations marked them as fundamentally different from the Communist movement and its orientation towards armed struggle and saw the Comintern as a mechanism for the centralized coordination of such efforts around the world.

Such so-called "Centrist" parties, with the German USPD in the first rank, sought a more inclusive and advisory role for the Comintern, in line with the model utilized by the ill-fated [[Second International]]. The four delegates of the USPD remained united before the session of the 2nd Congress's Commission on Conditions for Admission.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-43"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, the Commission on Conditions for Admission voted 5-3 on a proposal by Lenin that only parties with a clear majority on their governing Central Committee favoring affiliation to the Comintern prior to the 2nd World Congress would be permitted membership in that organization.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-43" /&gt; Subsequent debate by the Congress itself on July 29 and 30 urged against any concessions to so-called "Centrist" leaders.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-43" /&gt; Following extended commission discussions, a set of 21 Conditions for admission to the Comintern was proposed.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-44"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The trade union question====

The 2nd World Congress dealt extensively with the relationship between the [[trade union]] movement and the emerging international communist movement. [[Left communism|Left-wing communists]] were scornful of the "conservative" nature of the established union movement in many counties, exemplified by the [[American Federation of Labor]] in the United States and the [[reformism|reformist]] [[International Federation of Trade Unions]], based in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-46"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The limited horizons of such organizations, limited to matters of daily concern as wages, hours, and working conditions, were seen as a manifestation of [[class collaboration]] and an impediment to the revolutionary transformation of society.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-46" /&gt;

The left-wing communists argued that these unions were a by-product of [[capitalism]] and that they, like the political parties of the [[Second International]], had betrayed the working class by supporting their national governments in [[World War I]] — seen as a war of [[imperialism|imperial]] conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 3, pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Such unions were worthy only of expeditious destruction, the left-wing communists believed.

Lenin and other Comintern leaders disagreed sharply with the demand of the left-wing communists that new explicitly revolutionary [[dual union]]s should be established and supported, arguing the 25 million workers participating in unions affiliated with the Amsterdam International had already made their basic organizational decision.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-46" /&gt; Instead, Lenin and his co-thinkers argued, radical workers should remain within these established unions and to attempt to work from within to move them onto a revolutionary course.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-46" /&gt;

At the same time the Comintern leadership had already been working to establish a new revolutionary international union organization to compete with the Amsterdam International — a goal which the left-wing communists saw as contradictory with the policy of remaining within the established "conservative" unions.&lt;ref&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings between Comintern officials and trade union leaders in Moscow in the summer of 1920 had led to the establishment of the [[International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions]] (Mezhsovprof), forerunner of the [[Red International of Labor Unions]] (Profintern) that was established the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The union question remained a matter of heated contention at the 2nd World Congress, with the representatives of the British [[shop stewards' movement]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] delegates from Germany and the United States refusing to abandon their hostility to the strategy of "[[boring from within]]" the established unions.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-48"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the majority of the 2nd World Congress moved to support Lenin's policy, detailed at length in his recently published book ''"Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder.''&lt;ref&gt;The title of the Russian original of Lenin's polemic against the left-wing communists, ''Детская болезнь "левизны" в коммунизме,'' actually translates as "The Childhood Illness of 'Leftism' in Communism."&lt;/ref&gt;

====The colonial question====

The 2nd World Congress also for the first time paid serious attention to the national [[liberation movement]]s of the [[colony|colonies]] of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-51"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Theses on colonial issues were presented to the Congress by [[India]]n radical [[M. N. Roy|M.N. Roy]], formally a delegate from the fledgling [[Communist Party of Mexico]], [[Avetis Sultan-Zade]] of [[Persia]], and [[Pak Chin-sun]] of [[Korea]].&lt;ref name="Riddell1-51" /&gt;

The final resolution of the Congress directed communists in colonial countries to support the "national-revolutionary" movement in each, without regard to the fact that non-communist and non-[[working class]] elements such as the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[peasantry]] might be dominant.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-52"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular attention was paid to formulating an alliance with the rural poor as a means of winning and holding power in a revolution.&lt;ref name="Riddell1-55"&gt;Riddell, ''Workers of the World and Oppressed Peoples, Unite!'' vol. 1, pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and sports activities==
There were several cultural and sports activities arranged to accompany the second congress:
*a [[soccer]] match between Moscow and an International XI. Willie Gallagher captained the International XI which included John Reed. However they lost heavily to Moscow in front of a crowd of 18,000 in the Red Stadium, located in the former Moscow River Yacht Club.&lt;ref name="Riordan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riordan|first1=Jim|title=The Strange Story of Nikolai Starostin, Football and Lavrentii Beria|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|date=1994|volume=46|issue=No. 4, Soviet and East European History (1994)|pages=681– 690|url=https://libcom.org/files/The%20Strange%20Story%20of%20Nikolai%20Starostin,%20Football%20and%20Lavrentii%20Beria.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legacy==
[[File:Kustodiev - Congress of Comintern.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Boris Kustodiyev. Festival of the II Congress of Comintern on the Uritsky Square (former Palace square) in Petrograd]]

Historian E.H. Carr has argued that the 2nd World Congress — to some extent unintentionally and unconsciously — was the first to "establish Russian leadership of Comintern on an impregnable basis."&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 3, pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the esteem accorded the Russians as practitioners of the first successful Marxist revolution, Carr noted that the Russian delegation "invariably spoke with a united voice," in sharp contrast to the contentious and divided delegations from Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 3, pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "the Communist International which would make the world revolution was created in the image of the party which had made the Russian revolution," Carr observed.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia,'' vol. 3, pp. 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''access economy''' is a business model where goods and services are traded on the basis of access rather than ownership: it refers to renting things temporarily rather than selling them permanently. The term arose as a correction to the term [[sharing economy]], because major players in the sharing economy, such as [[Airbnb]], [[Zipcar]], and [[Uber (company)|Uber]], are commercial enterprises whose businesses do not involve any sharing.&lt;ref name=Ouishare &gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/ouishare-connecting-the-collaborative-economy/is-there-a-better-name-for-the-sharing-economy-2d7489e1f56d  |title= What is the right name for the "sharing-economy"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AccessOrSharing&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intelligenthq.com/social-business-2/the-access-economy-or-the-sharing-economy|title= The Access Economy Or The Sharing Economy?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HBR1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-sharing-economy-isnt-about-sharing-at-all|title= The Sharing Economy Isn't About Sharing at All|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perfectklik.com/en/blog/post/1/the-perfectklik-way|title=The PerfectKLIK Way - Blog - PerfectKLIK|last=PerfectKLIK|website=www.perfectklik.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model uses a technology platform, often accessed via mobile phone, to connect suppliers willing to rent assets (e.g., apartments for rent or cars for transportation services) with consumers. This movement was worth around $26 billion a year in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137376176#aboutBook|title=The Business of Sharing Making it in the New Sharing Economy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of persons involved in the access economy is not easily measured. The "access economy" or "on-demand economy" poses regulatory and political challenges, such as: defining the nature of the employment relationship; designing regulations to safeguard parties to these transactions; the loss of taxes and corporate access that results from moving away from small locally owned companies to large remote technology companies; and the bypassing of local regulations (such as the requirement for taxi drivers to provide wheelchair vans or provide drivers 24-7).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21637393-rise-demand-economy-poses-difficult-questions-workers-companies-and The Economist-Workers on Tap-January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic model==
Companies such as Uber and Airbnb provide technology that connects suppliers willing to rent their assets to consumers interested in temporarily using those assets. For example, owners of real estate may offer an apartment or bedroom for rent on a weekly basis, or the owner of a car may offer taxi-like services.  [[Mobile phone applications]] are the typical platform that connects the consumers and suppliers.

As an economic model, the access economy suggests that&lt;!--(access independent of time, location, situation and with a lower financial burden)--&gt; "access" to goods and services may become more desirable than "ownership" of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Access Economy|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/topic/access-economy/|website=triplepundit.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Denning notes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denning|first1=Steve|title=Three Strategies For Managing The Economy Of Access|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/05/02/economic-game-change-from-ownership-to-access/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=13 July 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third thing that the [[Internet]] did was social. It created a generation of people who began doing something that cut to the heart of the way society has been organized for several hundred years. These people—mainly young—began preferring access to ownership. Instead of planning their lives on the premise of acquiring and owning more [[private property]], this new generation began finding meaning and satisfaction in having access to things and interacting with other people in the process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Business strategy==
The ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' has argued that it's important for businesses in this space to think of themselves as being in an access economy. In a 2015 article called "The Sharing Economy Isn't About Sharing at All", authors Giana M. Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi write,&lt;ref name=HBR1 /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;This insight − that it is an access economy rather than a sharing economy – has important implications for how companies in this space compete. It implies that consumers are more interested in lower costs and convenience than they are in fostering social relationships with the company or other consumers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The article goes on to argue that a major difference between [[Uber (company)|Uber]] and its competitor [[Lyft]] is that Uber understands the difference: "Uber positions itself squarely around its pricing, reliability, and convenience" with their tagline as being "Better, faster and cheaper than a taxi",&lt;ref name=HBR1 /&gt; while the tagline of the much-less-successful Lyft is, "We're your friend with a car."&lt;ref name=HBR1 /&gt;
In essence, Eckhardt and Bardhi concludes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The access economy is changing the structure of a variety of industries, and a new understanding of the consumer is needed to drive successful business models. A successful business model in the access economy will not be based on community, however, as a sharing orientation does not accurately depict the benefits consumers hope to receive. It is important to highlight the benefits that access provides in contrast to the disadvantages of ownership and sharing.&lt;ref name=HBR1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Employment model==
The business model of companies situated in the [[gig economy]] introduces a different employment concept compared to traditional employment structures. While in traditional industries workers enjoy the benefits of unionisation, healthcare provision, and employee rights with regard to minimum wage, contract termination and working hours, employees within the access economy are perceived as freelancers. These people do not receive pension benefits or other employee rights and benefits and are often not paid on an hourly basis.

A 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute concluded that, across America and England, there were a total of 162 million people that were involved in some type of independent work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/employment-and-growth/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy|title=Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, their payment scheme is linked to the gigs they perform, which could be deliveries, rentals or other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=B. Wilson|title=Employment dynamics|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38930048|accessdate=21 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent legal rulings indicated that there is an emerging trend to classify full-time freelancers working for a single main employer of the gig economy as workers and to award them regular worker rights and protection. A popular example is the ruling against Uber in October 2016, which supported the claim of two Uber drivers to be classified as workers and to receive the related worker rights and benefits. However, Uber was granted the right to appeal this claim and a final ruling is expected to be drawn in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=M. Gingell|title=Uber lawsuit|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gig-economy-workers-rights-change-zero-hour-contracts-permanent-staff-a7719831.html|accessdate=21 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to distinguish employment in the access economy from employment through [[zero-hour contract]]s. Employment in the gig economy entails receiving compensation for one key performance indicator, which, for example, is defined as parcels delivered or taxi lifts conducted. Another feature is that employees can opt to refuse taking an order. Although employers do not have to guarantee employment or employees can also refuse to take an order under a zero-hour contract, workers under such a contract are paid by the hour and not directly through business-related indicators as in the case of the gig economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguishing employment under zero-hour contracts and the gig economy|url=https://fullfact.org/economy/what-gig-economy/|accessdate=21 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
{{Original research section|date=March 2018}}
The access economy has affected both genders of the population in numerous ways (some negative, some positive).  For women, the access economy provides flexibility. This has led women to have quickly outnumbered the number of men in this economy. This career path has allowed mothers to continue with their families while having the ability to work. For men, one effect that was found was that the gig economy gave them more advantages. Men have gained power in the sense that even in the access economy they are still hired more, paid higher wages, and treated better than women in the workplace.  Sexism gives men the advantage, allowing them to acquire customers who are more understanding and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/the-gig-economy-may-strengthen-the-invisible-advantage-men-have-at-work-86444|title=The gig economy may strengthen the 'invisible advantage' men have at work|last=Galperin|first=Hernán|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/282693|title=How the Gig Economy Is Changing Work for Women|last=Galluzzo|first=Jenny|date=2016-10-12|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Looks to be written by an Entrepreneur contributor, not staff|date=March 2018}}

== Elderly ==
The elderly have also found pros and cons to the access economy. The future of retirement savings are being endangered by the gig-economy. An article by CNBC states that only 16% of independent workers have a retirement savings plan. On the flip side, there are seniors who are earning, according to JPMorgan Chase Institute, an average of $40,000. The percentage of seniors has increased throughout the years from 20.7 percent in 2009 to 23.1 percent in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-seniors-are-tapping-the-gig-economy/|title=How seniors are tapping the gig economy|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate names==
There are many related concepts and alternate names currently being used for the access economy. They include:&lt;ref name=Ouishare /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dollars&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2014/0314friedman.html|title= The Rise of the Gig Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collaborative&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/2014/11/27/collaborative-economy-a-transformative-lens-not-a-start-up-trend/|title= Collaborative Economy: A Transformative Lens, not a Start-up Trend}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sharing economy
* On-demand economy
* Circular economy

* [[Uberisation]]
* [[Gig economy]]
* [[Social peer-to-peer processes|Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]] economy
* [[Reputation]] economy
* Trust economy

The validity of the term "sharing economy" is disputed. For example, both Uber and taxi companies provide access to cars that are not owned by the passenger; the real difference is that taxis are a mature industry that pay living wages and abide by local regulations (such as to ensure that there is always a wheelchair van available), while Uber and its ilk are a new industry that is exploiting the lack of regulations that affect it. [[Michael Bauwens]] notes that companies such as Uber aren't operating by a peer-to-peer structure, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bauwens|first1=Michael|title=The sharing economy is a lie: Uber, Ayn Rand and the truth about tech and libertarians|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/02/01/the_sharing_economy_is_a_lie_uber_ayn_rand_and_the_truth_about_tech_and_libertarians/|website=salon.com|accessdate=14 July 2015|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A "sharing economy," by definition, is lateral in structure. It is a peer-to-peer economy. But Uber, as its name suggests, is hierarchical in structure. It monitors and controls its drivers, demanding that they purchase services from it while guiding their movements and determining their level of earnings. And its pricing mechanisms impose unpredictable costs on its customers, extracting greater amounts whenever the data suggests customers can be compelled to pay them. This is a top-down economy, not a "shared" one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economic effects==

===Overview===
The impacts of the access economy in terms of costs, wages and employment are not easily measured and appear to be growing.&lt;ref name="FedBrainard1"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Gig Economy: Implications of the Growth of Contingent Work|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20161117a.htm|website=Federalreserve.gov|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various estimates indicate that 30-40% of the U.S. workforce is self-employed, part-time, temporary or freelancers. However, the exact percentage of those performing short-term tasks or projects found via technology platforms was not effectively measured as of 2015 by government sources.&lt;ref name="Bloomfox1"&gt;{{cite web |title= Gig Economy Hasn't Taken Over |url= http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-08-26/gig-economy-hasn-t-taken-over-job-market-yet |work=Bloomberg.com |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., one private industry survey placed the number of "full-time independent workers" at 17.8 million in 2015, roughly the same as 2014. Another survey estimated the number of workers who do at least some freelance work at 53.7 million in 2015, roughly 34% of the workforce and up slightly from 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-01/gig-economy-is-growing-but-not-growing-up Bloomberg-Justin Fox-Gig Economy is Growing, But Not Growing Up-October 2, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Krueger]] wrote in March 2016 that there is a trend towards more workers in alternative (part-time or contract) work arrangements rather than full-time; the percentage of workers in such arrangements rose from 10.1% in 2005 to 15.8% in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-02/gigonomics-the-dismal-science-behind-today-s-on-demand-jobs Bloomberg-Stilwell and McGregor- Gigonomics The Dismal Science Behind Today's On-Demand Jobs-June 2, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Katz and Krueger defined alternative work arrangements as "temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract company workers, and independent contractors or free-lancers".&lt;ref name="krueger.princeton.edu"&gt;[https://krueger.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/akrueger/files/katz_krueger_cws_-_march_29_20165.pdf Katz &amp; Kruger-Princeton-The Rise and Nature of Alternative Work Arrangements in the United States 1995-2015-Retrieved June 2, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; They also estimated that approximately 0.5% of all workers identify customers through an online intermediary; this was consistent with two others studies that estimated the amount at 0.4% and 0.6%.&lt;ref name="krueger.princeton.edu"/&gt;

At the individual transaction level, the removal of a higher overhead business  intermediary (say a taxi company) with a lower cost technology platform helps reduce the cost of the transaction for the customer while also providing an opportunity for additional suppliers to compete for the business, further reducing costs.&lt;ref name="Bloomfox1"/&gt; Consumers can then spend more on other goods and services, stimulating demand and production in other parts of the economy. Classical economics argues that innovation that lowers the cost of goods and services represents a net economic benefit overall. However, like many new technologies and business innovations, this trend is disruptive to existing business models and presents challenges for governments and regulators.&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 1979"&gt;{{cite book

For example, should the companies providing the technology platform be liable for the actions of the suppliers in their network? Should persons in their network be treated as employees, receiving benefits such as healthcare and retirement plans? If consumers tend to be higher income persons while the suppliers are lower-income persons, will the lower cost of the services (and therefore lower compensation of the suppliers) worsen income inequality?  These are among the many questions the on-demand economy presents.&lt;ref name = "Bloomfox1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/669766.pdf GAO-Contingent Workforce: Size, Characteristics, Earnings, Benefits-April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on particular industries===
[[File:Yellow cabs 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Yellow cabs in [[Manhattan]] have experienced decreased [[demand]] due to [[Uber (company)|Uber]]]]
One study indicated that ride-sharing company [[Uber (company)|Uber]] is significantly replacing [[taxi]] services in parts of [[New York City]]; comparing the April to June periods in 2014 versus 2015, Uber pickups  rose by 6 million (from 2 million to 8 million), while [[Boro taxi|Green cab]] pickups rose by 1 million and [[Yellow cab]] pickups fell by 4 million. Uber's impact was the most significant in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fivethirtyeight.com [http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uber-is-taking-millions-of-manhattan-rides-away-from-taxis/  Fischer-Baum and Bialik-Uber is Taking Millions of Manhattan Rides Away from Taxis] October 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pros===
* Flexible and Convenient: Access economy allows workers to set their own hours of work. An Uber driver explains, "the flexibility extends far beyond the hours you choose to work on any given week. Since you don’t have to make any sort of commitment, you can easily take time off for the big moments in your life as well, such as vacations, a wedding, the birth of a child, and more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Holly|title=How to Make Money Driving for Uber|url=http://www.thesimpledollar.com/how-to-make-money-driving-for-uber/|website=The Simple Dollar|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are able to accept or reject additional work based on their needs while using the commodities they already possess to make money. 
* Low Barriers to Entry: Depending on their schedules and resources, workers can provide services in more than one area with different companies. This allows workers to relocate and continue earning income. Also, by working for access economy companies, the transaction costs associated with occupational licences are significantly lowered.  For example, in New York City, taxi drivers must have a special driver's license and undergo training and background checks,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drivers.com/article/1162/ How to become a New York Taxi Driver]&lt;/ref&gt; while Uber contractors can offer "their services for little more than a background check."&lt;ref name="marketschange"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Given|first1=Casey|title=Uber Economics: How Markets are Changing in the Sharing Economy|url=https://www.atlasnetwork.org/news/article/uber-economics-how-markets-are-changing-in-the-sharing-economy|website=Atlas Network|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Maximum Benefit for Sellers and Buyers:  Enables users to improve living standards by eliminating the emotional, physical, and social burdens of ownership.  Without the need to maintain a large inventory, deadweight loss is reduced, prices are kept low, all while remaining competitive in the markets.&lt;ref name=HBR1 /&gt;
* Environmental Benefit: Access economies allow the reuse and repurpose of already existing commodities. Under this business model, private owners share the assets they already possess when not in use.&lt;ref name="proscons"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lombardo|first1=Crystal|title=Pros and Cons of Sharing Economy|url=http://visionlaunch.com/pros-and-cons-of-sharing-economy/#|website=Vision Launch|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breaking of Monopolies: In [[Zimbabwe]], [[Airbnb]], along with other businesses of this type, has led to a rise in consumer benefits stemming from good prices and quality. This model also allows for more opportunities for those that are self employed.

===Cons===
* Lack of employee benefits: Since access economy companies rely on independent contractors, they are not offered the same protections as that of full-time salary employees in terms of workers comp, retirement plans, sick leave, and unemployment.&lt;ref name="Forbes_Uber"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huet|first1=Ellen|title=What Happens to Uber Drivers And Other Sharing Economy Workers Injured On The Job?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/01/06/workers-compensation-uber-drivers-sharing-economy/#64f84eef42c7|website=Forbes|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quality discrepancies: Since access economy companies rely on independent workers, the quality of service can differ between workers in the same company.  Despite [[Airbnb]] CEO [[Brian Chesky]] efforts to have a gold standard for safety and fire hazards, Steven Hill from the [[New America Foundation]] cited his experience signing up to become a host on [[Airbnb]] as simple as uploading a few photos to the website "and within 15 minutes my place was “live” as an Airbnb rental. No background check, no verifying my ID, no confirming my personal details, no questions asked. Not even any contact with a real human from their trust and safety team. Nothing."&lt;ref name="2airbnb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Steven|title=The two faces of Airbnb|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-two-faces-of-airbnb-2015-10|website=Business Insider|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, due to the reputation service model, customers are provided with a peer-reviewed rating of the contractor and are given a choice of whether to proceed with the transaction. There is no information, choice or feedback service in the traditional model - and thus also may suffer from quality discrepancies.  
* Liability: Though some companies offer liability guarantees such as Airbnb's "Host Guarantee" that promises to pay up to 1 million in damages, it is extremely difficult to prove fault.&lt;ref name="Airbnb_banned"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bort|first1=Julie|title=Airbnb Banned From Condo Complex After Guest Caused $10,000 Of Damage|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-guest-caused-10000-of-damage-2014-10|website=Business Insider|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ownership and usage:This economic model blurs the difference between ownership and usage without establishing a regulation of supervision over either. This allows for the abuse or neglect of absent policies that are not in place given the distinct nature of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/165dfa2b8ee04210|title=Log in to NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Replacement of small local companies with large international tech companies. For example, taxi companies tend to be locally-owned and operated, while Uber is California-based.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.uber.com/en-CA/newsroom/company-info// Uber newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, taxi company profits tend to stay local, while access economy profits, the majority of the money goes to the local driver, a portion of the profits flow out of the local community.

==Regulations and Legislation==
[[File:Uber's legal issues 2015-02-06.jpg|thumb|Uber's legal issues 2015-02-06]]

===Uber===
The [[taxi]] unions in the United States are in full support of strict [[ride sharing]] regulations. However, the taxi industry argues that all transportation companies are needed to create a fair competitive environment. 
 
* In [[Michigan]], new legislation requires [[Uber (company)|Uber]] and [[Lyft]] drivers to apply for licenses and carry the same [[liability insurance]] as those of taxi drivers.  In addition, Bill HB 4637 requires access economy companies  to run [[background checks]] on all drivers. Uber, Lyft, taxis and other [[transportation]] services will be equally regulated under the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawler|first1=Emily|title=Michigan House passes bills changing Uber, Lyft, taxi regulations|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/michigan_house_passes_bills_ch.html|website=M Live|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[New Jersey]], the "[[Transportation Network Company]] Safety and Regulatory Act," instructs companies and drivers to meet insurance coverage standards and criminal background checks, according to the Bill A3695. Nonetheless, sharing ride companies such as Uber and Lyft must pay $25,000 to register with the state. Drivers will be banned from work if they had been convicted of [[homicide]], driving under the influence of [[drugs]], or [[sexual assault]]. Accidents that occur during a service and which results in injuries to a passenger, will be the financial responsibility of the drivers or the company. Drivers and company may be liable for up to $1.5 million of [[medical bills]] of the injured passengers. Uber’s spokesman, Craig Ewer said concerning the bill “We look forward to working constructively with the administration as we implement the new law.”  Under New Jersey’s law, vehicles must pass the [[state inspection]] and companies have to maintain six years worth of records. The New Jersey Uber general manager, Ana Mahony told the committee “if the rules of the bill don’t get changed Uber will have to leave the state”. "This bill would make it impossible for Uber to continue operating, not because we don't want to, but because it includes poison pills that have driven us out of other markets and would drive us out of New Jersey."Meanwhile, the taxi and [[limousine]] industry urged lawmakers to require ride sharing companies to meet the same regulations imposed on them, such as the requirement that taxi and limo drivers must be fingerprinted and pass a [[drug test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lagana|first1=Joseph|title=State of New Jersey 217th Legislature|journal=Assembly Substitute for Assembly, No.3695|date=September 29, 2016|pages=1–20|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A4000/3695_R1a.PDF|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the state of [[Florida]],  lawmakers passed a law demanding drivers to carry insurance of $25,000 for the property, $100,000 for death and bodily injury per incident, and $50,000 for death and bodily injury per person. In addition, background checks on all the drivers are required. Uber South Florida General Manager Kasra Moshkani said in a statement, “Ride sharing has changed the way residents and more than 110 million visitors travel around Florida communities.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweeney|first1=Dan|title=House passes regulations for Uber, Lyft|url=http://www.sunsentinel.com/news/politics/florida-politics-blog/fl-reg-uber-lyft-florida-legislature-20170405-story.html|website=SunSentinel|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uber now has 2,000 Saudi drivers, with a target of reaching 100,000 over the next five years. The reason argument made in allowing Uber in [[Saudi Arabia]] is that it would provide more jobs for its citizens. Al Madina's newspaper reported, quoting Mr. Gore-Coty spokesman from the kingdom's General Directorate of Traffic, “we are bringing accessibility to employment and entrepreneurialism to cities.”
* In the [[United Kingdom]], Uber requested an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in contest of the tribunal which ruled that its drivers merited workers rights such as minimum wage, but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-britain/uber-loses-bid-to-appeal-driver-case-to-uk-supreme-court-idUSKBN1DZ04F|title=Uber loses bid to appeal driver case to UK Supreme Court|date=December 4, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Quebec]], Uber was requested to follow new regulations from the Ministry of Transportation for Uber drivers to be required to have 35 hours of training and criminal background checks by the local police. In response to these new regulations, Uber management concluded operations in Quebec on October 14, 2017 and resulted in 10,000 drivers and 50 office employees losing their jobs through Uber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-quebec/uber-to-withdraw-from-quebec-cbc-news-idUSKCN1C11PR|title=Uber says it will pull out of Canada's Quebec province|date=September 26, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airbnb===
[[File:AirbnbToronto5.jpg|thumb|AirbnbToronto5]]
City, municipal and state laws such as acquiring business licenses, complying with building, city and zoning standards have been implemented in an effort to regulate [[Airbnb]]. Airbnb encourages hosts to research their local government’s laws and regulations before becoming a host. In some cities, Airbnb will provide occupancy tax calculations to make it easier for hosts to fulfill their tax obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What legal and regulatory issues should I consider before hosting on Airbnb?|url=https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/376/what-legal-and-regulatory-issues-should-i-consider-before-hosting-on-airbnb|website=Airbnb|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The governor of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Andrew Cuomo]], recently signed a legislation penalizing Airbnb hosts who do not follow property rental limits. Hosts cannot rent their property for less than 30 consecutive days unless they are currently living in the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dobbins|first1=James|title=How to Host on Airbnb Legally|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/realestate/how-to-host-on-airbnb-legally.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[California]], lawmakers are actively attempting to pass legislation regulating Airbnb. [[Mike McGuire (politician)|Mike McGuire]]’s bill (SB 593) would mandate short-term vacation rentals to charge occupancy taxes in addition to requiring data reporting by the renter, and obedience of local laws that restrict short-term rentals. The bill mainly focuses on the collection of taxes on rented properties. This comes after many complaints from the hotel industry, who has seen major declines in bookings in recent years. The bill was not approved after almost 20,000 emails were sent to the Senator against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dillon|first1=Liam|title=California lawmakers can't figure out what to do with Airbnb. Here's why|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-airbnb-laws-california-legislature-20170203-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Berlin]], lawmakers have banned hosts from renting their property short-term without first requesting permission from authorities. Under this new legislation, hosts can be required to pay a fine of up to 100,000 euros if they rent more than 50% of their property space. Landlords can still rent individual rooms with the condition that they live in most of the property. Prior to this [[legislation]], 20,000 apartments were posted on Airbnb in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oltermann|first1=Philip|title=Berlin ban on Airbnb short-term rentals upheld by city court|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/08/berlin-ban-airbnb-short-term-rentals-upheld-city-court|website=theguardian|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lawmakers in [[Barcelona]] are also creating legislations to limit listings in the area. Rapid growth in the number of tourists forced authorities to implement laws to regulate home rentals in Barcelona. This occurred after Airbnb experienced double the rental listings from 2014 to 2015. It is estimated that in 2015, 900,000 tourists used Airbnb to book their lodging. Barcelona’s officials penalized Airbnb with a $644,160 fine in November 2016 for advertising unlicensed room rentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweeney|first1=Dan|title=House passes regulations for Uber, Lyft|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/florida-politics-blog/fl-reg-uber-lyft-florida-legislature-20170405-story.html|website=SunSentinel|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Taylor Review===

As a response to the fast-changing nature of working practices in the modern economy, especially the [[Gig economy]], The UK Government has carried out a review and issued guidelines in an attempt to address these issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-work-the-taylor-review-of-modern-working-practices&lt;/ref&gt; The report was published on the 11th July 2017 and the overriding conclusion was that the UK’s economy should be “fair and decent”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chronologic.co.uk/good-work-taylor-review-modern-working-practices/ Chronologic - Good work: the Taylor review of modern working practices]&lt;/ref&gt; A 7-point plan&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/627671/good-work-taylor-review-modern-working-practices-rg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was suggested to improve working conditions and security. In addition, The Taylor Review  outlines demands asking the distribution of power be distributed at a more equal level. It asks for workers of these, [[gig economy]] businesses be labeled as "dependent contractors with extra benefits". Other demands include, better corporate management, skill development efforts, fostering of a positive workplace,and financial representation provided by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40566079|title=The Taylor review: At-a-glance guide|date=2017-07-11|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">{{For|19/20th-century Moroccan statesman|Muhammad al-Muqri}}

'''Abu-l-'Abbas Ahmad ibn Mohammed al-Maqqari''' (or '''Al-Makkari''') ({{circa|1578}}–1632) was an Algerian scholar who was born in [[Tlemcen]] in 1577 from a prominent intellectual family that traced its origin to the village of [[Magra, Algeria|Maqqara]], near [[M'Sila, Algeria|M'sila]].&lt;ref name="Meri2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef W. Meri|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFZsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA478|date=31 October 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-45603-0|pages=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an early training in [[Tlemcen]], al-Maqqari moved to [[Fes]] in [[Morocco]] and then to [[Marrakech]], following the court of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], to whom he dedicated his ''Rawdat al-As'' (The garden of Myrtle) about the [[ulema]]s of Marrakech and Fes. After al- Mansur's death in 1603, al-Maqqari established himself in [[Fes]], where he was appointed both as mufti and as the imam of the [[Qarawiyyin]] mosque by al-Mansour's successor [[Zidan Abu Maali]]. In 1617, he left for the East, possibly because of a quarrel with the local ruler, and took his residence in Cairo, where he composed his best known work, ''Nafḥ al-ṭīb''.&lt;ref name="Meri2005" /&gt;

In 1620 he visited [[Jerusalem]] and [[Damascus]], and during the next six years made the pilgrimage five times. In 1628 he was again in Damascus, where he gave a course of lectures on [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]'s collection of ''Traditions'', spoke much of the glories of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]], and received the impulse to write his work on this subject later. In the same year he returned to Cairo, where he spent a year in writing his history. He was just making preparations to settle definitely in Damascus when he died in 1632.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Maqqarī|volume=17|pages=664-665 |first=Griffithes Wheeler |last=Thatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His greatest work, ''The Breath of Perfume from the Branch of Green Andalusia and Memorials of its Vizier Lisan ud-Din ibn ul-Khattib'', consists of two parts. The first is a compilation from many authors on the description and history of Muslim Iberia; it was published by [[William Wright (Orientalist)|William Wright]], [[Christoph Krehl]], [[Reinhart Dozy]] and [[Gustave Dugat]] as ''Analectes sur l'histoire et la littérature des Arabes d'Espagne'' (1855–1861),&lt;ref&gt;Online: {{ar icon}} {{cite book

'''Eduard Albert Meier''' (born February 3, 1937) is a Swiss citizen who is the source of many photographs of alleged [[unidentified flying object]]s (UFOs), which he presents in support of his claim that he is in contact with [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] beings. He also presented other material during the 1970s such as metal samples, sound recordings and film footage. Meier reports regular contacts with extraterrestrials he calls the Plejaren.&lt;ref name="ProtheroCALLAHAN2017" /&gt; Meier claims to be the seventh reincarnation after six prophets common to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Elijah]], [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Jesus|Jmmanuel (Jesus)]], and [[Muhammad|Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyfly.com/articles/Clarification_of_a_Defamatory_Claim.html|title=Clarification of a Defamatory Claim|author=Hans Georg Lanzendorfer|website=TheyFly.com|access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier has been widely characterized as a fraud by [[skepticism|skeptics]] and [[ufology|ufologists]], who suggest that he used models to [[hoax]] photos claimed to show alien spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Lewis2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R.

== Background ==
[[File:Billy Meier UFO 66.jpg|thumb|One of Meier's photographs of "a beamship floating beside a tree".]]
Born in the town of [[Bülach]] in the [[Zürcher Unterland]], Meier joined the [[French Foreign Legion]] in his teens, but says he soon left and returned home. In 1965, he lost his left arm in a bus accident in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="ProtheroCALLAHAN2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald R. Prothero|author2=Timothy D. Callahan|title=UFOs, Chemtrails, and Aliens: What Science Says|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DI8uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=Billy+Meier+bus+accident&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NPGMixdY0Z&amp;sig=iFcl9CyOwJgcaHEGYm1edfXLO-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL4NPexpnZAhVPXKwKHQxDBYs4ChDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Billy%20Meier%20bus%20accident&amp;f=false|date=2 August 2017|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-02706-1|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, he met and married a Greek woman, Kalliope Zafiriou, with whom he had three children. The nickname "Billy" came by way of an American friend who thought Meier's cowboy style of dress reminded her of "[[Billy the Kid]]." This anecdote was told by Meier in an interview with Bob Zanotti of Swiss Radio International in June, 1982.&lt;ref name="billythekid"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Zanotti, Bob (Interviewer) |date=June 1982 |title=Billy Meier – UFO Contactee |medium=Audio recording |website=Switzerland in Sound |url=http://www.switzerlandinsound.com/audiotext32/ufo.mp3 |access-date=October 12, 2013 |format = [[MP3]] |time=0:17:35 |publisher=Bob Zanotti |location=Biglen, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged extraterrestrial contacts ==
Meier claims his extraterrestrial encounters began in 1942, at the age of five, when he met an elderly Plejaren man named "Sfath".&lt;ref name="Sfath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.figu.org/ch/ufologie/die-plejaren/portraits-der-kontaktpersonen |title=''Portraits der Kontaktpersonen'' |website=FIGU Switzerland |publisher=FIGU |location=Schmidrüti, Switzerland |access-date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Sfath's death in 1953, Meier said, he began communicating with an extraterrestrial woman (though not a Plejaren) called "Asket".  All contacts ceased in 1964, he said, then resumed on January 28, 1975, when he met "Semjase",&lt;ref name="Sfath" /&gt; the granddaughter of Sfath, and shortly thereafter another Plejaren man called "Ptaah".  Other Plejarens, including a woman named "Nera", have since allegedly joined the dialog as well.  Photographs of these two women were later proved to have been faked.&lt;ref name="ProtheroCALLAHAN2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BMUR"&gt;[http://www.billymeieruforesearch.com/photos-and-videos/outer-space-pictures-asket-nera-semjase/outer-space-pictures-asket-nera-semjase-summary/ Outer Space Pictures – Asket-Nera-Semjase – Summary] billymeieruforesearch.com, retrieved March 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier founded a religious movement based on his alleged contacts with Semjase, called the "Freie Interessengemeinschaft für Grenz- und Geisteswissenschaften und Ufologiestudien" (Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies) in the late 1970s and established his "Semjase Silver Star Center". The movement's headquarters is in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Chryssides2012"&gt;George D. Chryssides.

== Photographs, films ==
Meier's photographs and films are claimed by him to show alien spacecraft floating above the Swiss countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.figu.org/ch/ufologie/strahlschiffe |title=''Strahlschiffe (UFOs)'' |website=FIGU Switzerland |publisher=FIGU |location=Schmidrüti, Switzerland |access-date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls the alleged [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]s "beamships" from Plejaren. According to Meier, the Plejaren gave him permission to photograph and film their beamships so that he could produce evidence of their extraterrestrial visitations. Some of Meier's photos are claimed by him to  show prehistoric Earth scenes, extraterrestrials, and celestial objects from an alleged non-Earthly vantage point. Meier's claims are widely characterized as fraudulent by scientists, skeptics, and most [[ufology|ufologists]], who say that his photographs and films are hoaxes.&lt;ref name="ProtheroCALLAHAN2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulyas2013"&gt;Aaron John Gulyas.

In 1997, Meier's ex-wife, Kalliope, told interviewers that his photos were of spaceship models he crafted with items like trash can lids, carpet tacks and other household objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clingbine|first1=Dr Graham|title=Disclosure: The Future is Now|date=30 October 2015|publisher=Troubador|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the stories he told of his adventures with the aliens were similarly fictitious. She also said that photos of purported extraterrestrial women "Asket" and "Nera" were really photos of Michelle DellaFave and Susan Lund, members of the singing and dancing troupe [[The Golddiggers]].&lt;ref name="BMUR" /&gt; It was later confirmed that the women in the photographs were members of The Golddiggers performing on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''.&lt;ref name="ProtheroCALLAHAN2017" /&gt;

[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Borders of Israel]]

The current '''borders of the State of Israel''' are the result both of war and of diplomatic agreements among [[Israel]], her neighbors, and colonial powers. Uniquely, only two of Israel's five potential land borders are internationally recognized while the other three are disputed.&lt;ref name="WilsonDonnan2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=David|authorlink=David Newman (political geographer)|editor=Thomas M. Wilson and Hastings Donnan|title=A Companion to Border Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yu4kFC_vNokC&amp;pg=PA252|date=28 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-25525-4|pages=252–|chapter=Borders and Conflict Resolution|quote=Unique to states in the contemporary world, only two of Israel's five potential land borders have the status of internationally recognized boundaries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's borders with Egypt and Jordan have now been formally recognized and confirmed as part of the peace treaties with those countries. The borders with Syria ([[Golan Heights]]), Lebanon ([[Shebaa farms]]) and the [[Palestinian territories]] (declared as the [[State of Palestine]]) are still in dispute.&lt;ref name="Sela"&gt;Sela, Avraham. "Israel." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 444-474&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], Israel borders [[Lebanon]] in the north, the [[Golan Heights]] and [[Syria]] in the northeast, the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordan]] in the east, the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Egypt]] in the southwest. The border with Egypt is the [[international border]] demarcated in 1906 between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], confirmed in the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]], and the border with Jordan is based on the border defined in the 1922 [[Trans-Jordan memorandum]], confirmed in the 1994 [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]].

==Early background==
[[File:Sykes-Picot-1916.gif|thumb|Zones of French and British influence and control proposed in the Sykes–Picot Agreement]]
The [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of 1916 secretly divided the Ottoman Empire lands of Middle East between British and French [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. They agreed that "Palestine" was to be designated as an "international enclave".&lt;ref&gt;Pappe, Ilan. ''The Making of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1947–1951'', I. B. Tauris; New Ed edition (August 15, 1994), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement was revised by Britain and France in 1919. It was agreed that Palestine and the [[Vilayet of Mosul]] in modern-day [[Iraq]] would be part of the British sphere in exchange for British support of French influence in Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Pappe, p. 3–4.  Pappe suggests the French concessions were made to guarantee British support for French aims at the post-war peace conference concerning Germany and Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historian Ilan Pappe,&lt;blockquote&gt;"The borders of mandatory Palestine, first drawn up in the Sykes-Picot Agreement, were given their definitive shape during lengthy and tedious negotiations by British and French officials between 1919 and 1922 ... In October 1919 the British envisaged the area that is today southern Lebanon and most of southern Syria as being part of British mandatory Palestine ... In the East, matters were more complicated...[Transjordan] was part of the Ottoman province of Damascus which in the Sykes-Picot agreement had been allocated to the French."&lt;ref&gt;Pappe, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; At the [[Sanremo conference|San Remo Conference]] (19–26 April 1920) the Allied Supreme Council granted the mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia to Britain without precisely defining the boundaries of the mandated territories.&lt;ref&gt;Biger, 2005, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaim Weizmann]], subsequently reported to his colleagues in London: "There are still important details outstanding, such as the actual terms of the mandate and the question of the boundaries in Palestine. There is the [[boundary delimitation]] of the boundary between French Syria and Palestine, which will constitute the northern frontier and the eastern line of demarcation, adjoining Arab Syria. The latter is not likely to be fixed until the Emir Feisal attends the Peace Conference, probably in Paris." See: 'Zionist Aspirations: Dr Weizmann on the Future of Palestine', ''The Times'', Saturday, 8 May 1920; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receipt of this cable informal consultation took place between the Colonial Office legal adviser and the assistant legal adviser to the Foreign Office. Their suggestion, on the 25th by Shuckburgh, was that... a clause be inserted in each of the mandates... [Footnote:] The first draft of Article 25 was originally worded "to postpone the application of such provisions," but was altered at Shuckburgh's initiative since "'postpone' means, or may be taken to mean, that we are going to apply them eventually""{{sfn|Klieman|1970|p=123}}}}

}}
In March 1921, the Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] visited Jerusalem and following a discussion with [[Emir Abdullah]], it was agreed that Transjordan was to be added to the proposed Palestine Mandate, but that the [[Jewish National Home]] objective for the proposed [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine Mandate]] would not apply to the territory.

In July 1922, the [[League of Nations]] approved the Palestine Mandate, which came into effect in 1923 after a dispute between France and Italy over the Syria Mandate was settled. The Mandate stated that Britain could ‘postpone or withhold’ application of the provisions dealing with the 'Jewish National Home' in the territory east of the [[Jordan River]], then called [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]].  In September 1922, following Abdullah's probation period,&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Robins|title=A History of Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw_D0_WP-hQC&amp;pg=PA16|date=9 February 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59895-8|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British government [[Transjordan memorandum|presented a memorandum]] to the League of Nations defining the border of Transjordan and confirming its exclusion from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement.

Britain administered the part west of the Jordan as Palestine, and the part east of the Jordan as Transjordan, with the border being the Jordan River.  Palestine comprised 23% of the Mandate territory and Transjordan comprised 77%. Technically they were one mandate but most official documents referred to them as two separate mandates. Transjordan remained under British control until 1946, when it gained independence.&lt;ref&gt;"Mandates." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. Avraham Sela.

On 29 November 1947, the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] adopted a resolution recommending ''the adoption and implementation'' of a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|plan to partition Palestine]] into "Independent Arab and Jewish States" and a "Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem" administered by the United Nations (Resolution 181 (II)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=Resolution 181 (II).

On 14 May 1948, [[David Ben-Gurion]], in a ceremony in [[Tel Aviv]], declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in [[Eretz-Israel]], to be known as the State of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: 14 May 1948: Retrieved 22 March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliahu Epstein, Agent, Provisional Government of Israel said in a letter to President Truman seeking recognition from the U.S government, sent immediately after the Declaration of 14 May 1948, "that the state of Israel has been proclaimed as an independent republic within frontiers approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution of November 29, 1947."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/israel/large/documents/newPDF/49.pdf#zoom=100: Letter From the Agent of the Provisional Government of Israel to the President of the United States: May 15, 1948: Harry S.

===Subsequent events===
In 1988, Palestine [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] without specifying its borders. Jordan [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|extended recognition]] to Palestine and ceded its claim to the [[West Bank]] to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, which had been previously designated by the Arab League as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWhgIe3Hq98C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1987-1988 |editor=Anis F.

The [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] was signed on October 26, 1994. The treaty resolved territorial and border issues that were ongoing since the 1948 war. The treaty specified and fully recognized the international border between Israel and Jordan. Upon its signing, the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] and [[Yarmouk River]]s, the [[Dead Sea]], the [[Arabah|Emek Ha'arva/Wadi Araba]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] were officially designated as the borders between Israel and Jordan and between Jordan and the territory occupied by Israel in 1967.&lt;ref name="Jordan Treaty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/jordan_treaty.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Treaty of Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan}} {{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/jordan_treaty_annex1.asp|title=Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty Annex I|date={{date|1994-10-26}}|publisher=Yale Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the latter, the agreement requires that the demarcation use a different presentation, and that it carry the following disclaimer: &lt;blockquote&gt; "This line is the administrative boundary between Jordan and the territory which came under Israeli military government control in 1967.

In 2011, Palestine submitted an application for membership to the United Nations, using the borders for military administration that existed before 1967.&lt;ref name="UN Multimedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2011/09/palestinian-authority-applies-for-full-un-membership/|title=Palestinian Authority applies for full UN membership|access-date={{date|2015-03-27}}|publisher=United Nations Radio|date={{date|2011-09-23}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Israel does not recognize the [[State of Palestine]], Jordan's borders with Israel remain unclear.

==Border with Syria and Lebanon==
===French Mandate: Paulet–Newcombe Agreement===
The [[Paulet–Newcombe Agreement]], a series of agreements between 1920–23, contained the principles for the boundary between the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] of [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine]] and [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], attributed to Great Britain, and the Mandate of [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and the [[French mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]], attributed to France.

A 1920 agreement defined the boundary between the forthcoming British and French mandates in broad terms,&lt;ref name="treaty1920"&gt;Text available in ''American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 16, No. 3, 1922, 122–126.&lt;/ref&gt;  and placed the bulk of the Golan Heights in the French sphere. The agreement also established a joint commission to settle the border and mark it on the ground.&lt;ref name="treaty1920"/&gt; The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, and it was approved with some caveats by the British and French governments on 7 March 1923,&lt;ref name="1923Agreement"&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/20/29/00039450.pdf Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government respecting the Boundary Line between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hámmé, Treaty Series No. 13 (1923), Cmd. 1910.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909201308/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/20/29/00039450.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }} Also Louis, 1969, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923.&lt;ref name="FSU Law"&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS075.pdf FSU Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916035757/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS075.pdf |date=16 September 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the same process, a nearby parcel of land that included the ancient site of [[Tel Dan|Dan]] was transferred from Syria to Palestine early in 1924. In this way the Golan Heights became part of the [[French Mandate of Syria]]. When the French Mandate of Syria ended in 1944, the Golan Heights remained part of the newly independent state of Syria.

In 1923, an agreement between the United Kingdom and France, known as the [[Paulet–Newcombe Agreement]], established the border between the soon-to-be formalised [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and the [[French Mandate of Syria]].&lt;ref name="1923Agreement" /&gt; The British handed over the southern Golan Heights to the French in return for the northern [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. The border was drawn so that both sides of the [[Jordan River]] and the whole of the [[Sea of Galilee]], including a 10-metre-wide strip along the northeastern shore, were part of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caabu.org/press/focus/gee.html CAABU :: The Council for Arab-British Understanding&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609222925/http://www.caabu.org/press/focus/gee.html |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The boundaries of modern Palestine, 1840–1947'', (2004), by Gideon Biger.

===Syria: subsequent changes===
The [[1947 UN Partition Plan]] allocated this territory to the Jewish state. Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Syria seized some land that had been allocated to the Jewish state and under the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] with Israel retained 66 square kilometers of that territory in the Jordan Valley that lay west of the 1923 Palestinian Mandate border (marked green in the map on right).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Missing Peace|The Missing Peace - The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace]]'' (2004), by [[Dennis Ross]]. {{ISBN|0-374-52980-9}}. pp 584-585&lt;/ref&gt; These territories were designated [[demilitarized zone]]s (DMZs) and remained under Syrian control (marked as DMZs on second map). It was emphasised that the armistice line was "not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements." (Article V)

During the [[Six-Day War]] (1967), Israel captured the territory as well as the rest of the Golan Heights, and subsequently repelled a Syrian attempt to recapture it during the [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973). Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 with the [[Golan Heights Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bard |first=Mitchell G |authorlink=Mitchell Bard |title=Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israeli Conflict |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]] |isbn=0-9712945-4-2 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths2/myths2006.pdf |format=PDF |edition=3rd |date=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel began building [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] throughout the Golan Heights, and offered the Druze and Circassian residents citizenship, which most turned down. Today, Israel regards the Golan Heights as its sovereign territory, and a strategic necessity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The [[Purple Line (ceasefire line)|Purple Line]] marks the boundary between Israel and Syria. Israel's unilateral annexation has not been internationally recognized, and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] refers to the area as [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]].

During the 1990s, there were constant negotiations between Israel and Syria regarding a mediation of conflicts and an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights but a peace treaty did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Pressman, “Mediation, Domestic Politics, and the Israeli-Syrian Negotiations, 1991–2000,” ''Security Studies'' 16, no. 3 (July–September, 2007), pp. 350–381.&lt;/ref&gt; The main stumbling block seems to involve the 66 square kilometers of territory that Syria retained under the 1949 armistice agreement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Missing Peace|The Missing Peace - The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace]]'' (2004), by [[Dennis Ross]]. {{ISBN|0-374-52980-9}}. pp 584-585&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arab people|Arab]] countries support Syria's position in the formula which calls on Israel "to return to the 1967 borders". (See 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]])

===Lebanon conflict===
[[File:BlueLine.jpg|thumb|400px|The Blue Line covers the Lebanese–Israeli border; an extension covers the Lebanese–Golan Heights boundary.]]

On March 14, 1978, Israel launched [[Operation Litani]], occupying the area south of the [[Litani River]], excepting [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] (see map). In response to the invasion, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 425|Council Resolution 425]] and Resolution 426 calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978, but turned over their positions inside Lebanon to their ally, the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA).

The United Nations in June 2000 was called upon to decide the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] border&lt;!-- UNSC Res 425 "Calls for strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries" --&gt; to determine whether Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon in compliance with [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]]. This line came to be called the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]]. At the same time, the United Nations did not have to consider the legality of the boundary between Lebanon and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, as that was not required for the purpose of Council Resolution 425. Accordingly, the Armistice Demarcation Line between Lebanon and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights is expressly not to be called the Blue Line.

The Blue Line, which the UN had to determine was the line of deployment of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] before March 14, 1978, when Israel invaded Lebanon. In effect that line was recognised by both Lebanon and by Israel as the international border, and not just as the Armistice Demarcation Line of 1949{{Citation needed|reason=Some document needs to be cited.  UNSC Res 425 "Calls for strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries" it doesn't mention Israeli sovereignty over territories acquired in the 1948 war|date=November 2011}} (what is commonly called the Green Line) following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].

On April 17, 2000, Israel announced that it would withdraw its forces from Lebanon. The Lebanese government refused to take part in marking the border. The UN thus conducted its own survey based on the line for the purpose of Council Resolution 425, which called for "strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries".

From May 24 to June 7, 2000, the [[UN Special Envoy]] heard views in Israel, Lebanon and Syria. The United Nations cartographer and his team, assisted by UNIFIL, worked on the ground to identify a line to be adopted for the practical purposes of confirming the Israeli withdrawal. While it was agreed that this would not be a formal border demarcation, the aim was to identify a line on the ground closely conforming to the internationally recognized boundaries of Lebanon, based on the best available cartographic and other documentary evidence.  On May 25, 2000, Israel notified the [[UN Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] that it had redeployed its forces in compliance with Council Resolution 425, that is to the Internationally recognized Lebanese border.  On June 7, the completed map showing the withdrawal line was formally transmitted by the force commander of UNIFIL to his Lebanese and Israeli counterparts. Notwithstanding their reservations about the line, the governments of Israel and Lebanon confirmed that identifying this line was solely the responsibility of the United Nations and that they would respect the line as identified.

On June 8, UNIFIL teams commenced the work of verifying the Israeli withdrawal behind the line.

===The Blue Line===
The [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]] identified by the United Nations in 2000 as the border of Lebanon, from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Hasbani River]], closely approximates the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] set under the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 armistice agreement]] between Lebanon and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS075.pdf International Boundary Study - Israel-Lebanon Boundary, 15 February 1967] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916035757/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS075.pdf |date=16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area east of the Hasbani River, is considered part of Syria and included in the Golan Heights.

The armistice agreement between Lebanon and Israel was signed on March 23, 1949. The main points were:
* The terms of the agreement were ''dictated exclusively by military considerations''
* The armistice line (i.e. "Green Line") was the international border, which corresponds to the 1923 Mandate border between the Lebanon and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (see: [[Treaty of Sèvres]]).
* Unlike the other Green Line agreements, it contains no clause disclaiming this line as an international border, and was thereafter treated as it had been previously, as the [[de jure]] international border of Lebanon.
* Israel withdrew its forces from 13 villages in Lebanese territory, which were occupied during the war.

In 1923, 38 boundary markers were placed along the 49-mile (78&amp;nbsp;km) boundary and a detailed text description was published.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080924211639/http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/numericalibs-template.html]  The 2000 Blue Line differs in about a half dozen short stretches from the 1949 line, though never by more than 475 meters.{{Citation needed|reason=Mar, 2008|date=March 2008}}

Between 1950 and 1967, Israeli and Lebanese surveyors managed to complete 25 non-contiguous kilometers and mark (but not sign) another quarter of the international border.

On June 16, the [[UN Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] reported to the [[Security Council]] that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with Council Resolution 425 and met the requirements defined in his report of May 22, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html|title=SECURITY COUNCIL ENDORSES SECRETARY-GENERAL"S CONCLUSION ON ISR"LI WITHDRAWAL FROM LEBANON AS OF 16 JUNE - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal line has been termed the Blue Line in all official UN communications since.

===Conflict over the Shebaa Farms===
[[File:Shebaa Farms.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Shebaa Farms]]
The Shebaa Farms conflict stems from Israel's occupation and annexation of the Golan Heights, with respect to that territory's border with Lebanon. Both Lebanon and Syria were within the French Mandate Territory between 1920 and the end of the French Mandate in 1946.  The dispute over the sovereignty over the [[Shebaa Farms]] resulted in part from the failure of French [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]] administrations, and subsequently from the failure of the Lebanon and Syria to properly demarcate the border between them.

Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that some local inhabitants regarded themselves as part of Lebanon, for example paying taxes to the Lebanese government. But French officials at times expressed confusion as to the actual location of the border.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-pij"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Understanding the Sheeba Farms dispute |url=http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=9 |first=Asher |last=Kaufman |journal=Palestine-Israel Journal |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2004 |accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One French official in 1939 expressed the belief that the uncertainty was sure to cause trouble in the future.

The region continued to be represented in the 1930s and 1940s as Syrian territory, under the French Mandate.  Detailed maps showing the border were produced by the French in 1933, and again in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Beyrouth]]" 1:200,000 sheet NI36-XII available in the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] and French archives.&lt;/ref&gt; They clearly showed the region to be in Syria.

After the French Mandate ended in 1946, the land was administered by Syria, and represented as such in all maps of the time.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Who owns the Shebaa Farms? Chronicle of a territorial dispute | first=Asher | last=Kaufman | journal=[[Middle East Journal]] | publisher=[[Middle East Institute]] | volume=56 | issue=4 | date=Autumn 2002 | pages=576–596}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maps of the 1949 armistice agreement between Syria and Israel also designated the area as Syrian.

Border disputes arose at times, however.  Shebaa Farms was not unique; several other border villages had similar discrepancies of borders versus land ownership.  Syria and Lebanon formed a joint Syrian–Lebanese border committee in the late 1950s to determine a proper border between the two nations.  In 1964, concluding its work, the committee suggested to the two governments that the area be deemed the property of Lebanon, and recommended that the international border be reestablished consistent with its suggestion.  However, neither Syria nor Lebanon adopted the committee's suggestion, and neither country took any action along the suggested lines.  Thus, maps of the area continued to reflect the Farms as being in Syria.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt;  Even maps of both the Syrian and Lebanese armies continued to demarcate the region within Syrian territory (see map).&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt;

A number of local residents regarded themselves as Lebanese, however. The Lebanese government showed little interest in their views.  The Syrian government administered the region, and on the eve of the 1967 war, the region was under effective Syrian control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 1967, most Shebaa Farms landowners and (Lebanese) farmers lived outside the Syrian-controlled region, across the Lebanon-Syrian border, in the Lebanese village of Shebaa.  During the Six Day War in 1967, Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria, including the Shebaa Farms area.  As a consequence, the Lebanese landowners were no longer able to farm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The key to Shebaa |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/717FD283-592E-44BA-8A22-9D46B441C304.htm |date=2005-04-25 |last=Nasser |first=Cilina |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=2006-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813193722/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/717FD283-592E-44BA-8A22-9D46B441C304.htm |archivedate=13 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Border with Egypt==
[[File:Egypt Ottoman border 1906.jpg|thumb|Egypt Ottoman border 1906, as depicted in the 1907 Survey of Egypt]]
[[File:Israel-Egypt-Gaza border region.jpg|thumb|260px|A clearly visible line marks about 80 kilometers (~50 mi) of the international border between Egypt and Israel in this photograph from the [[International Space Station]]. The reason for the color difference is likely a higher level of grazing by the Bedouin-tended animal herds on the Egyptian side of the border.]]

The international border between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and British controlled Egypt was drawn in the Ottoman–British agreement of 1 October 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/areportondelimi00craigoog#page/n7/mode/1up]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the personal documents of the British colonel Wilfed A. Jennings Bramley, who influenced the negotiations, the border mainly served British military interests—it furthered the Ottomans as much as possible from the [[Suez Canal]], and gave Britain complete control over both [[Red Sea]] gulfs—Suez and Aqaba, including the [[Straits of Tiran]]. At the time, the [[Aqaba]] branch of the [[Hejaz railway]] had not been built, and the Ottomans therefore had no simple access to the Red Sea. The British were also interested in making the border as short and patrollable as possible, and did not take into account the needs of the local residents in the negotiations.&lt;ref name="negev"&gt;Gardus and Shmueli (1979), pp. 369–370&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1949 armistice agreement between Israel and Egypt was ratified on February 24, 1949. The armistice line between these countries followed the international border except along the Gaza Strip, which remained under Egyptian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Sela. "Arab–Israeli Conflict." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 58–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]], signed on March 26, 1979, created an officially recognized international border along the 1906 line, with Egypt renouncing all claims to the Gaza Strip. A dispute arose over the marking of the border line at its southernmost point, in [[Taba, Egypt|Taba]]. Taba was on the Egyptian side of the armistice line of 1949, but Israel claimed that Taba had been on the Ottoman side of a border agreed between the Ottomans and British Egypt in 1906, and that there had previously been an error in marking the line. The issue was submitted to an international commission composed of one Israeli, one Egyptian, and three outsiders. In 1988, the commission ruled in Egypt's favor, and Israel withdrew from Taba later that year.

==Borders with Palestine==
On 29 November 1947, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a resolution recommending ''to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union'' as [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181 (II)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d United Nations: General Assembly A/RES/181(II): 29 November 1047: Resolution 181(II): ''Future government of Palestine'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan contained a proposal to terminate the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] and partition Palestine into ''Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem''. The Jewish community of Mandate Palestine accepted the plan, despite its misgivings. With a few exceptions, the Arab leaders and governments rejected the plan of partition in the resolution and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition. On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the Mandate for Palestine, [[David Ben-Gurion]], on behalf of the Jewish community, declared ''the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment of a Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel|Eretz-Israel]], to be known as the [[State of Israel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs: ''Israel Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: 14 May 1948'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Israel green lines.png|right|thumb|upright|Israel's 1949 Green Line (green thin line) and demilitarized zones (green thick line/areas)]]
On the next day, the Arab armies marched their forces into what had been the British Mandate for Palestine. This intervention/invasion from all sides turned the [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] into the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The tide of battle soon turned against the Arabs, and Israel then launched a series of military offensives, greatly expanding its territorial holdings. On September 22, 1948, during a truce in the war, the [[Provisional State Council]] of Israel passed a law annexing all land that Israel had captured in that war, and declaring that from then on, any part of Palestine taken by the Israeli army would automatically be annexed to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/israellaws/fulltext/areajurisdictionpowersord.htm|title=Area of Jurisdiction and Powers Ordinance (1948)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the war saw the [[Lausanne Conference of 1949]]. Following internationally supervised Arab-Israeli negotiations, a boundary based on the cease-fire lines of the war with minor territorial adjustments, commonly referred to as the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], was agreed upon in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]. The Green Line was expressly declared in the Armistice Agreements as a temporary [[demarcation line]], rather than a permanent border, and the Armistice Agreements relegated the issue of permanent borders to future negotiations. The area to the west of the Jordan River came to be called the West Bank, and was annexed by Jordan in 1950;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Act of Union'', 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gaza Strip was controlled by Egypt. During the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan, Gaza Strip and Sinai peninsula from Egypt, and Golan Heights from Syria, and placed these territories under [[military occupation]].

Israel and the Palestinian territories now lay entirely within the boundaries of former British Mandate Palestine. By the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979, Egypt renounced all claims to the Gaza Strip. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/world/hussein-surrenders-claims-west-bank-plo-us-peace-plan-jeopardy-internal-tensions.html|title=U.S. PEACE PLAN IN JEOPARDY; Internal Tensions|date=August 1, 1988|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was made official in the [[Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace]] of 1994. The Green Line is Israel's contested boundary with the Palestinian territories. 

The boundaries of a future Palestinian State, vis-a-vis Israel, are subject to ongoing negotiations in the [[Israel–Palestinian peace process]]. Israel's [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank Wall]], which encompasses almost all [[Israeli settlement]]s, including all three major cities, and only a minor Palestinian population, was declared by Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] as running roughly along the future borders of Israel{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] proposed that the Arab-Israeli border region known as the [[Triangle (Israel)|Triangle]] be removed from Israeli sovereignty and transferred to the Palestinian Authority, in exchange for the border settlement blocs. The [[Palestinian Authority]] claims all of these territories (including East Jerusalem) for a future [[Palestinian State]], and its position is supported by the Arab League in the 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]] which calls for the return by Israel to "the 1967 borders". While Israel has expressed desire to annex the border settlement blocs and keep East Jerusalem, its border with Gaza has largely been solidified, especially following [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's withdrawal]] in 2005. Israel has not made claims to any portion Gazan territory and offered the entire area to Palestinians as part of the [[2000 Camp David Summit]].

At the same time, Israel has continued to claim a nominal strip on the border between the West Bank and Jordan, and between Gaza and Egypt as its border with those countries. This is viewed as a legalistic device to enable Israel to control the entry of people and materials into the Palestinian territories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Status of Jerusalem===
[[File:JerusalemEastAndWest.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Jerusalem municipal area]]
The [[Status of Jerusalem|status and boundary of Jerusalem]] continue to be in dispute. 

Israel took control of [[West Jerusalem]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], while [[Jordan]] took control of [[East Jerusalem]] (including the walled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] in which most holy places are located). During the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, Israel gained control of East Jerusalem, and shortly after extended Jerusalem’s municipality [[city limits]] and applied its laws, jurisdiction, and administration to East Jerusalem and the surrounding area. In 1980, the [[Knesset]] passed the [[Jerusalem Law]], declaring Jerusalem to be the "complete and united" capital of Israel. The Israeli government offered the Palestinian residents citizenship, most of whom refused, and are treated today as [[permanent residency|permanent residents]] under Israeli law. According to the Israeli rights organisation Hamoked, if these Palestinians live abroad for seven years, or gain citizenship or residency elsewhere, they lose their Israeli residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8390717.stm |title=Jerusalem residency losses rise|date=December 2, 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korman, Sharon (2005). The right to conquest: the acquisition of territory by force in international law and practice. Oxford University Press US. pp. 250–260. {{ISBN|978-0-19-828007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported annexation of East Jerusalem was criticised by Palestinian, Arab and other leaders. The annexation was declared by the United Nations Security Council as "a violation of international law" and "null and void" in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478|Resolution 478]] and has not been recognized by the international community, and all countries have moved their embassies from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.science.co.il/Embassies.php|title=Foreign Embassies in Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/embassy.htm|title=What's the Difference Between An Embassy and a Consulate?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and significance==
{{Life timeline}}
{{main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by [[William Buckland]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"&gt;{{cite book| author=Buckland, W. |authorlink=William Buckland| year=1841| title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural Theology| publisher=Lea &amp; Blanchard| isbn=1-147-86894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] discussed the then inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"&gt;{{cite book| title=On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection| author=Darwin, C| authorlink=Charles Darwin| year=1859| pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=324&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 202, 306–308]| publisher=Murray| location=London| isbn=1-60206-144-0| oclc=176630493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian [[fauna]], seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

The first discovered Cambrian fossils were [[trilobites]], described by [[Edward Lhuyd]], the curator of [[Oxford Museum]], in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liñán |first1=E.|last2=Gonzalo |first2=R|editor1-last=Rábano |editor1-first=I.|editor2-last=Gozalo|editor2-first=R.|editor3-last=García-Bellido |editor3-first=D.|title=Advances in Trilobite Research|year=2008|publisher=Instituto Geológico y Minero de España |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7840-759-0 |page=240 |chapter=Cryptopalaeontology: Magical descriptions of trilobites about two thousand years before scientific references}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their evolutionary importance was not known, on the basis of their old age, William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record had occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"/&gt; Nineteenth-century geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] used the fossils for dating rock strata, specifically for establishing the [[Cambrian]] and [[Silurian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Mark |title=Fossil Focus: Trilobites |journal=Palaeontology Online |year=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2013/fossil-focus-trilobites/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison, were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others, including [[Charles Lyell]], differed. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] considered this sudden appearance of a solitary group of trilobites, with no apparent antecedents, and absence of other fossils, to be "undoubtedly of the gravest nature" among the difficulties in his theory of natural selection. He reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"/&gt; In the sixth edition of his book, he stressed his problem further as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles R. |title=The origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection |date=1876 |page=286 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.}}

American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], who studied the [[Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale fauna]], proposed that an interval of time, the "Lipalian", was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Charles Doolittle Walcott | title=Cambrian Geology and Paleontology |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume=57 |page=14 |author=Walcott, C.D. |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier fossil evidence has since been found. The earliest claim is that the history of life on earth goes back {{Ma|3850|million years}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Heinrich D. Holland |title=Evidence for life on earth more than 3850 million years ago |journal=Science |author=Holland, Heinrich D |date= January 3, 1997 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.38 |volume=275 |pmid=11536783 |issue=5296 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of that age at [[Warrawoona, Australia]], were claimed to contain fossil [[stromatolite]]s, stubby pillars formed by colonies of [[microorganism]]s. Fossils (''[[Grypania]]'') of more complex [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, from which all animals, plants, and fungi are built, have been found in rocks from {{Ma|1400}}, in [[China]] and [[Montana]]. Rocks dating from {{Ma|580|543}} contain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]], organisms so large that they are likely multicelled, but very unlike any modern organism.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt; In 1948, [[Preston Cloud]] argued that a period of "eruptive" evolution occurred in the Early Cambrian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cloud, P.E. | year=1948 |title=Some problems and patterns of evolution exemplified by fossil invertebrates | journal=Evolution | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=322–350 | doi=10.2307/2405523 | pmid=18122310 | jstor=2405523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as recently as the 1970s, no sign was seen of how the 'relatively' modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late [[Cambrian]] arose.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;

[[File:Opabinia BW2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Opabinia]]'' made the largest single contribution to modern interest in the Cambrian explosion.]]

The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of [[Harry B. Whittington]] and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, reanalysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale and concluded that several were as complex as, but different from, any living animals.&lt;ref name="Whittington1979Lawn"&gt;Whittington, H. B. (1979). Early arthropods, their appendages and relationships. In M. R. House (Ed.), The origin of major invertebrate groups (pp. 253–268). The Systematics Association Special Volume, 12. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Burgess Shale | author=Whittington, H.B. | authorlink=Harry B. Whittington |author2=Geological Survey of Canada | year=1985 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-660-11901-3 | oclc=15630217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common organism, ''[[Marrella]]'', was clearly an [[arthropod]], but not a member of any known arthropod [[class (biology)|class]]. Organisms such as the five-eyed ''[[Opabinia]]'' and spiny slug-like ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, seemingly unrelated to anything known today. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s popular 1989 account of this work, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'',&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"&gt;{{cite book| title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History
| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn=0-393-02705-8| oclc=185746546
}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the matter into the public eye and raised questions about what the explosion represented. While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared almost simultaneously in a rather short span of geological period. This view led to the modernization of Darwin's tree of life and the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which [[Niles Eldredge|Eldredge]] and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004EarlySkeletalFossils"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | chapter=Early skeletal fossils

Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwramikStromatoliteDiversityMetazoanAppearance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinWaggoner1997KimberellaMollusc"/&gt;

===Dating the Cambrian===
[[radiometric dating|Radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only recently become available, and for only a few regions.

Relative dating (''A'' was before ''B'') is often assumed sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this, too, has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="DatingProblems"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal| last = Gehling| first = James| last2 = Jensen| first2 = Sören| last3 = Droser| first3 = Mary
| last4 = Myrow| first4 = Paul| last5 = Narbonne| first5 = Guy| title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland| journal = Geological Magazine| volume = 138| issue = 2| pages = 213–218|date=March 2001| url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=74669| doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X| bibcode = 2001GeoM..138..213G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.

===Body fossils===
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by [[erosion]] or [[metamorphism]] before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered.

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[Lagerstätte]] are.]]
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of [[lagerstätte]]n, which preserve soft tissues. These allow [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shale]] beds of Chengjiang ([[Yunnan]], [[China]]) and [[Sirius Passet]] ([[Greenland]]);&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1979"&gt;

While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt; In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.

The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[Signor–Lipps effect]].&lt;ref name="Signor1982"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Signor |first1=P.W. |last2=Lipps|first2=J.H. |chapter=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in the fossil record |editor-last=Silver|editor-first=L.T.|editor2-last=Schulz|editor2-first=P.H. |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the earth |id=A 84–25651 10–42|pages=291–296 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0813721903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such changes may reflect a cause of the Cambrian explosion, although they may also have resulted from an increased level of biological activity&amp;nbsp;– a possible result of the explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt; Despite these uncertainties, the geochemical evidence helps by making scientists focus on theories that are consistent with at least one of the likely environmental changes.

===Phylogenetic techniques===
[[Cladistics]] is a technique for working out the "family tree" of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of [[clade]]s&amp;nbsp;– groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.

From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. about how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived &amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Phylum===
A [[phylum]] is the highest level in the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system for classifying organisms]]. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Valentine
| first = James W. | year = 2004 | title = On the Origin of Phyla | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-226-84548-6 | page = 7
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Classifications of organisms in hierarchical systems were in use by the 17th and 18th centuries. Usually, organisms were grouped according to their morphological similarities as perceived by those early workers, and those groups were then grouped according to their similarities, and so on, to form a hierarchy.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = In the blink of an eye: How vision kick-started the big bang of evolution

| pages = 1–4
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Evolutionary biologists often make sense of the conflicting diversity of form&amp;nbsp;– not always does a relationship between internal and external parts. Early in the history of the subject, it became obvious that internal organisations were generally more important to the higher classification of animals than are external shapes. The internal organisation puts general restrictions on how an animal can exchange gases, obtain nutrients, and reproduce.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite their obvious differences, [[spider]]s and [[barnacle]]s both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but [[earthworm]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.  As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification system]] created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jefferies1979OriginOfChordates"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1979 | title=The origin of chordates&amp;nbsp;– a methodological essay | editor=House, M.R. | series=The origin of major invertebrate groups | pages=443–477 | publisher=Academic Press | location=London }} summarised in {{cite journal | author=Budd, G.E. | title=The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=157–165 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/157 | year=2003 | pmid=21680420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem group===
The concept of [[stem group]]s was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups, and have been hypothesized based on this scientific theory. A [[crown group]] is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example [[tardigrade]]s are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.&lt;ref name="CraskeJefferies1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Craske, A.J. | author2=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1989 | title=A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion | journal=Palaeontology | volume=32 | pages=69–99 | url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824010939/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf# | archive-date=2011-08-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Groups that cannot easily be placed in an existing phylum are considered to be [[stem group]]s. A stem group annelid, for instance, is any group that was closely related to, but not within, the crown group "annelida". The stem group split off from the lineage that would lead to annelids, and eventually became extinct.

===Triploblastic===
The term ''[[Triploblastic]]'' means consisting of three layers, which are formed in the [[embryo]], quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the [[digestive tract]] (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic&amp;nbsp;– the best-known exceptions are [[Porifera]] (sponges) and [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).

===Bilaterian===
The [[bilateria]]ns are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life histories. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living [[echinoderm]]s ([[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]], etc.) 'look' radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paired gill slits in a fossil with a calcite skeleton | journal=Nature | issue=6891 | pages=841–844 |date=June 2002 | doi=10.1038/nature00805 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6891/abs/nature00805.html |author1=Dominguez, P. |author2=Jacobson, A.G. |author3=Jefferies, R.P.S. | volume=417 | pmid=12075349 | issn=0028-0836 |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, not bilaterian, and not triploblastic.

===Coelomate===
The term ''[[Coelomate]]'' means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, [[annelid]] worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and [[chordate]]s&amp;nbsp;– the noncoelomate [[priapulid]]s are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom&amp;nbsp;– for example [[flatworm]]s, whose organs are surrounded by [[parenchyma|unspecialized tissues]].

==Precambrian life==
Understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&amp;nbsp;– did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?

[[Phylogenetic analysis]] has been used to support the view that during the Cambrian explosion, metazoans (multi-celled animals) evolved [[monophyly|monophyletically]] from a single common ancestor: flagellated colonial [[protists]] similar to modern [[choanoflagellates]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago ===
:''For further information, see [[Acritarch]] and [[Stromatolite]]''

[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|Modern stromatolites in [[Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve]], Western Australia]]

Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of [[microorganism]]s, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about {{Ma|2700}}, but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about {{Ma|1250}}. This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals"&gt;

Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as [[acritarch]]s. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small [[animal|metazoans]] to resting [[cyst]]s of many different kinds of [[chlorophyta|green algae]]. After appearing around {{Ma|2000}}, acritarchs underwent a boom around {{Ma|1000}}, increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the [[Neoproterozoic]] era also show signs of antipredator defenses.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;

Around the start of the Cambrian (about {{Ma|542}}), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard [[exoskeleton]]s, although they were not necessarily mineralised.&lt;ref name="Jensen2003" /&gt;

Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.{{Citation needed|reason=try Budd|date=June 2008}} They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"/&gt;

This new habit changed the seafloor's geochemistry, and led to decreased oxygen in the ocean and increased CO2-levels in the seas and the atmosphere, resulting in global warming for tens of millions years, and could be responsible for mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/46647-global-warming-animals-cambrian-carbon-dioxide Early Global Warming Was Unexpectedly Caused by a Burst of Tiny Life Forms - Inverse]&lt;/ref&gt; But as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own,&lt;!--this is carefully worded so as not to imply that was neither a part of the Cambrian explosion, or necessarily different from it&amp;nbsp;– please take this into account when rewording!--&gt; for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them&amp;nbsp;– creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, Adolf |author2=Luis A.

If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).

===Beck Spring Dolomite===
Paul Knauth, a geologist at [[Arizona State University]], maintains that photosynthesizing organisms such as algae may have grown over a 750- to 800-million-year-old formation in [[Death Valley]] known as the Beck Spring Dolomite. In the early 1990s, samples from this 1,000-foot thick layer of dolomite revealed that the region housed flourishing mats of photosynthesizing, unicellular life forms which antedated the Cambrian explosion.

Microfossils have been unearthed from holes riddling the otherwise barren surface of the dolomite. These geochemical and microfossil findings support the idea that during the Precambrian period, complex life evolved both in the oceans and on land. Knauth contends that animals may well have had their origins in freshwater lakes and streams, and not in the oceans.

Some 30 years later, a number of studies have documented an abundance of geochemical and microfossil evidence showing that life covered the continents as far back as 2.2 billion years ago. Many paleobiologists now accept the idea that simple life forms existed on land during the Precambrian, but are opposed to the more radical idea that multicellular life thrived on land more than 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-valleys-first-life-came-in-by-land-not-by-sea/ "Scientific American" April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambrian life==
=== Trace fossils ===
Trace fossils (burrows, etc.) are a reliable indicator of what life was around, and indicate a diversification of life around the start of the Cambrian, with the freshwater realm colonized by animals almost as quickly as the oceans.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kennedy | first1 = M.

===Small shelly fauna===
{{Main|Small shelly fauna}}
Fossils known as "[[small shelly fauna]]" have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the [[Nemakit-Daldynian]] and [[Tommotian]] ages; see [[#Timeline|timeline]]). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, [[archeocyathid]]s (sponge-like animals), and small shells very like those of [[brachiopod]]s and snail-like molluscs&amp;nbsp;– but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstätten: a period of time otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.

===Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms===
[[File:Olenoides serratus oblique with antennas.jpg|thumb|A fossilized trilobite, an ancient type of [[arthropod]]: This specimen, from the Burgess Shale, preserves "soft parts"&amp;nbsp;– the antennae and legs. ]]

The fossil record of trilobites began with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.

The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late [[Atdabanian]]; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.&lt;ref name="DornbosBottjer2000Helicoplacoids"&gt;{{cite journal

These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.

===Burgess Shale type faunas===
{{main|Burgess Shale type preservation}}
The Burgess Shale and similar lagerstätten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provide a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft-bodied, hence absent from the rest of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large part of the ecosystem is preserved, the ecology of the community can also be tentatively reconstructed.{{Verify source|Caron 2006 needs incorporating&amp;nbsp;– see talk page|date=July 2008}}
However, the assemblages may represent a "museum": a deep-water ecosystem that is evolutionarily "behind" the rapidly diversifying fauna of shallower waters.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris2008"&gt;{{cite journal

Because the lagerstätten provide a mode and quality of preservation that is virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, many organisms appear completely different from anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from [[stem group|lineages]] before they established the phyla known today{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&amp;nbsp;– slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.

The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life&amp;nbsp;– perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.&lt;ref name="Xiao2002"&gt;{{cite journal

===Early Cambrian crustaceans===
{{Details|Orsten}}
Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian. Convincing crustaceans were once thought to be common in Burgess Shale-type biotas, but none of these individuals can be shown to fall into the crown group of "true crustaceans".&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambrian record of crown-group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish [[Orsten]] horizons contain later Cambrian crustaceans, but only organisms smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.

A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the [[Mount Cap formation]], Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage ({{Ma|510|515}}) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;{{PalAss2007|title=The ecology and phylogeny of Cambrian pancrustaceans|author=Harvey, T.P.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"/&gt;

===Early Ordovician radiation===
{{Main|Ordovician radiation}}
After an [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event|extinction]] at the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary, another radiation occurred, which established the taxa that would dominate the Palaeozoic.&lt;ref name="Droser2003"/&gt;

Different authors break the explosion down into stages in different ways.

Ed Landing recognizes three stages: Stage 1, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, corresponds to a diversification of biomineralizing animals and of deep and complex burrows; Stage 2, corresponding to the radiation of molluscs and stem-group [[Brachiopod]]s ([[hyolith]]s and [[tommotiid]]s), which apparently arose in intertidal waters; and Stage 3, seeing the Atdabanian diversification of trilobites in deeper waters, but little change in the intertidal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landing | first1=E. | last2=Kouchinsky | first2=A.

Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a "Tube world", lasting from {{Ma|550|536}}, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a "Sclerite world", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3.&lt;ref name="Budd, G.E. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Budd | first1=G.E. | last2=Jackson | first2=I.S.C. | year=2016 | title=Ecological innovations in the Cambrian and the origins of the crown group phyla | journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B | volume=371 |  page=20150287 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary to the shelly fossil record, trace fossils can be divided into five subdivisions: "Flat world" (late Ediacaran), with traces restricted to the sediment surface; Protreozoic III (after Jensen), with increasing complexity; ''pedum'' world, initiated at the base of the Cambrian with the base of the ''T.pedum'' zone (see discussion at [[Cambrian#Dating the Cambrian]]); ''Rusophycus'' world, spanning {{Ma|536|521}} and thus corresponding exactly to the periods of Sclerite World and Brachiopod World under the SSF paradigm; and ''Cruziana'' world, with an obvious correspondence to Trilobite World.

Some say that the evolutionary change was accelerated by an [[order of magnitude]],{{refn |group=note |As defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;}} but the presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion; not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their [[evolutionary radiation]] ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought.

Ecological complexity among marine animals increased in the Cambrian, as well later in the Ordovician.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007" /&gt; However, recent research has overthrown the once-popular idea that disparity was exceptionally high throughout the Cambrian, before subsequently decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Erwin, D.H. | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00614.x | title = Disparity: Morphological Pattern And Developmental Context | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, disparity remains relatively low throughout the Cambrian, with modern levels of disparity only attained after the early Ordovician radiation.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007"/&gt;

===The Cambrian explosion as survivorship bias===

[[Graham Budd|Budd]] and Mann&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276-229 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cambrian explosion was the result of a type of [[survivorship bias]] called the "[[Push of the past]]". As groups at their origin tend to go extinct, it follows that any long-lived group would have experienced an unusually rapid rate of diversification early on, creating the illusion of a general speed-up in diversification rates. However, rates of diversification could remain at background levels and still generate this sort of effect in the surviving lineages.

==Possible causes==
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals ([[triploblastic]] [[bilateria]]ns) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain both the timing and magnitude of the explosion.

===Changes in the environment===
====Increase in oxygen levels====
[[Earth's atmosphere#Evolution of Earth's atmosphere|Earth's earliest atmosphere]] contained no free [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schirrmeister|first1=B.E.|last2=deVos|first2=J.M|last3=Antonelli|first3=A.|last4=Bagherri|first4=H.C.|title=Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1791–1796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209927110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1791S|pmid=23319632|pmc=3562814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canfield|first1=D.E.|last2=Poulton|first2=S.W.|last3=Narbonne|first3=G.M.|title=Late-Neoproterozoic Deep-Ocean Oxygenation and the Rise of Animal Life|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|doi=10.1126/science.1135013|pmid=17158290|issue=5808|pages=92–5|bibcode=2007Sci...315...92C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a saturation point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekker|first1=A.|last2=Holland|first2=H.D.|last3=Wang|first3=P.I.|last4=Rumble, III|first4=D.|last5=Stein|first5=H.J.|last6=Hannah|first6=J.L.|last7=Coetzee|first7=L.L.|last8=Beukes|first8=H.J.|title=Dating the rise of atmospheric oxygen|journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=427|issue=6970|pages=117–120|doi=10.1038/nature02260|pmid=14712267|bibcode=2004Natur.427..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general trend, the [[concentration]] of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt;

Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in eukaryotes well before the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parfrey|first1=L.W.|last2=Lahr|first2=D.J.G.|last3=Knoll|first3=A.H.|last4=Katz|first4=L.A.|title=Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks|journal=PNAS|date=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13624–13629|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110633108|pmid=21810989|pmc=3158185|bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813624P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around 800 million years ago, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Before the spike in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with mitochondrial function in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to drive metabolism. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

====Ozone formation====
The amount of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) required to shield Earth from biologically lethal UV radiation, wavelengths from 200 to 300 nanometers (nm), is believed to have been in existence around the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keese| first1=Bob|title=Ozone| url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozone.htm|website=www.albany.edu |publisher=University at Albany| access-date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the [[ozone layer]] may have enabled the development of complex life and life on land, as opposed to life being restricted to the water.

====Snowball Earth====
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
In the late [[Neoproterozoic]] (extending into the early [[Ediacaran]] period), the Earth suffered [[Snowball Earth|massive glaciations]] in which most of its surface was covered by ice. This may have caused a mass extinction, creating a genetic bottleneck; the resulting diversification may have given rise to the [[Ediacara biota]], which appears soon after the last "Snowball Earth" episode.&lt;ref name="HoffmanKaufman1998NeoproterozoicSnowball"&gt;{{cite journal

However, the snowball episodes occurred a long time before the start of the Cambrian, and it is hard to see how so much diversity could have been caused by even a series of bottlenecks;&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; the cold periods may even have ''delayed'' the evolution of large size organisms.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt;

====Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater====
Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/novel-evolutionary-theory-for-the-explosion-of-life/ Novel Evolutionary Theory For The Explosion Of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's [[Great Unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = S.

An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the [[East African Orogeny|Transgondwanan Supermountain]] that existed at the time the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day [[East Africa]] as an [[orogeny|orogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Developmental explanations===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor [[Evolutionary developmental biology|modifications to animals' development]] as they grow from [[embryo]] to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The [[Hox gene]]s, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain ''Hox'' gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; combines with molecular data&lt;ref name="deRosa1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Rosa, R. |author2=Grenier, J.K. |author3=Andreeva, T. |author4=Cook, C.E. |author5=Adoutte, A. |author6=Akam, M. |author7=Carroll, S.B. |author8=Balavoine, G. |date=June 1999 | doi = 10.1038/21631 | journal = Nature | volume = 399 |title=Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids and protostome evolution | pmid = 10391241  | issue = 6738 | issn = 0028-0836 | pages = 772–6|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..772D }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the [[physics]] of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, S.A.  |author2=Bhat, R. |date=April 2008 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015008| journal = Physical Biology | volume = 5 | page = 0150580|title=Dynamical patterning modules: physico-genetic determinants of morphological development and evolution | pmid = 18403826  | issue = 1 | issn = 1478-3967|bibcode = 2008PhBio...5a5008N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horizontal gene transfer]] has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Macis|first2=Luciana|last3=Reitner|first3=Joachim|last4=Wörheide|first4=Gert|title=A horizontal gene transfer supported the evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization strategy|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=12 August 2011|volume=11|page=238|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-238|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/238|access-date=10 September 2014|pmid=21838889|pmc=3163562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanations===
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the [[food chain]]; some suggest [[Evolutionary arms race|arms races]] between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of [[coevolution]]. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====End-Ediacaran mass extinction====
{{main|End-Ediacaran extinction}}
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as ''Cloudina'', and the accompanying perturbation in the {{d13c|link}} record.

Mass extinctions are often followed by [[adaptive radiation]]s as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt;

====Evolution of eyes====
{{main|Evolution of the eye}}
[[Andrew Parker (zoologist)|Andrew Parker]] has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs&amp;nbsp;– smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Parker, Andrew | title=In the Blink of an Eye |publisher= Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | isbn=0-7382-0607-5 | oclc=52074044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion.

====Arms races between predators and prey====
The ability to avoid or recover from [[predation]] often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of [[natural selection]]. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.&lt;ref name="DawkinsKrebs1979ArmsRaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Arms races between and within species| volume=205| issue=1161| pages=489–511| date=September 21, 1979| jstor=77442 |author1=Dawkins, R. |author2=Krebs, R.J.| doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081
| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| pmid=42057| bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in ''Cloudina'' shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the ''appearance'' of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |author=McMenamin, M.

Thus the role of predators as triggerers of diversification may have been limited to the very beginning of the "Cambrian explosion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals====
[[Geochemical]] evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of [[plankton]] has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their [[drag (physics)|drag]] was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by [[scavenger]]s or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens [[Filter feeder|filtered]] microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some [[carbon]] out of [[Carbon cycle|circulation]], resulting in an increase in the [[concentration]] of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily [[Chemical compound|combines]] with oxygen).&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt;

The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001ECR"&gt;{{Cite book

Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt; This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;

===Ecosystem engineering===
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The [[Devonian]] [[Colonization of the land|colonization of land]] had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the [[Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]]. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.&lt;ref name="Erwin2011a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

===Complexity threshold===
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.&lt;ref name="SoléFernándezKauffman2003AdaptiveWalks"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic threshold may have a correlation to the amount of oxygen available to organisms. Using oxygen for metabolism produces much more energy than anaerobic processes. Organisms that use more oxygen have the opportunity to produce more complex proteins, providing a template for further evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These proteins translate into larger, more complex structures that allow organisms better to adapt to their environments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperling|first1=E.A.|last2=Frieder|first2=C.A.|last3=Raman|first3=A.V.|last4=Girguis|first4=P.R.|last5=Levin|first5=L.A.|last6=Knoll|first6=A.H.|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=33|pages=13446–13451|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110|pmid=23898193|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S|pmc=3746845}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of oxygen, genes that code for these proteins could contribute to the expression of [[complex traits]] more efficiently. Access to a wider range of structures and functions would allow organisms to evolve in different directions, increasing the number of niches that could be inhabited. Furthermore, organisms had the opportunity to become more specialized in their own niches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Uniqueness of the explosion==
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a [[coevolution]]ary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| year = 2007| title = Macroevolution and macroecology through deep time| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| issue = 1| pages = 41–55| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan [[clade]]s of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiations]], such as those of [[fish]] in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, involved fewer [[taxon|taxa]], mainly with very similar body plans.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Although the recovery from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic extinction]] started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D.H. |author2=Valentine, J.W. |author3=Sepkoski, J.J. |date=November 1987| title=A Comparative Study of Diversification Events: The Early Paleozoic Versus the Mesozoic |journal=Evolution |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1186 |doi=10.2307/2409086 |pmid=11542112|jstor=2409086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable [[ecological niche]]s. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and [[wikt:incumbent|incumbent]]s usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different [[phylum|phyla]]; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.&lt;ref name="Valentine1995WhyNoNewPhyla"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why No New Phyla after the Cambrian? Genome and Ecospace Hypotheses Revisited | author=Valentine, J.W. | journal=PALAIOS | issue=2 |date=April 1995 | pages=190–194 | doi=10.2307/3515182 | volume=10 | type=abstract | jstor=3515182
| bibcode=1995Palai..10..190V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two similar explosions in the [[Evolutionary history of plants#Colonisation of land|evolution of land plants]]: after a cryptic history beginning about {{Ma|450}}, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Furthermore, Angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

== Origin ==

[[File:Laurak_bat.svg|thumb|The ''Laurak Bat'' coat of arms used by the Basque Government until 1985]]
[[End of Basque home rule (Spain)|After the end of home rule]] in 1839-1841, the Basque governments started a mutual approach out of common concerns in face of their exposure to Spanish centralism. The movement intensified after 1866, and a motto was coined, the "Laurac bat", 'the four make one', echoing the "Irurac bat" of the [[Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country|Royal Basque Company]], which in turn crystallized in a coat of arms including the four historic Basque districts in Spain (called variously [[Southern Basque Country|the ''Sister Provinces'']], the Chartered Territories, the Basque Country, the Basque-Navarrese Country, etc.), to represent their common bonds, as claimed during that period by the chartered provincial governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/78155#6 |title=LAURAK BAT |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Auñamendi Entziklopedia |publisher=EuskoMedia Fundazioa |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [http://atzoatzokoa.gipuzkoakultura.net/c22f3/index.php 1931 draft Statute of the Basque Country].
  
In 1936, the Provisional Government of Euzkadi, presided over by the first president, [[José Antonio Aguirre (politician)|José 
Antonio Aguirre]], adopted the shield with the arms of the three provinces of Álava, Gipuzkoa, Biscay comprised in the 1936 Statute (the ''Basque Provinces'', as established in [[1833 territorial division of Spain|the 1833 administrative design]]), and Navarre. The president of the government affirmed in the preamble to the Decree of 19 October 1936, and thereby approved, the emblem and flag that was to be used by the Basque Country. Thus the shield of the Government of Euzkadi contained the arms of Álava, Gipuzkoa, Biscay and Navarre in a single blazon of four quarters surrounded by a crown of oak leaves. The Provisional Government of Euzkadi stated that "the flag must be that which gathers Basque unity and which the use, ever more frequent in the Basque lands, has sanctioned as such symbol of their unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/es)pv.html|title=Coat-of-Arms (Basque Country, Spain)|accessdate=2007-10-15|last=Santiago|first=Dotor|publisher=CRW Flags|date=1998-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an official shield, like the 1936 Basque Autonomous Community, disappeared after the [[Spain under Franco|pro-Franco]] victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]], but the coat of arms continued in unofficial use, it was even used in its flag by the rightist pro-rebel newspaper from Donostia ''[[El Diario Vasco]]'' during wartime (data for 2 May 1937). On 2 November 1978, the ''Consejo General del País Vasco'' (General Council of the Basque Country), restored the republican shield, albeit modified as follows:

# The '''Álava''' quarter lost the motto "''En aumento de la justicia contra malhechores''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.geocities.com/aingast/index233.htm |title=Armas de la Hermandad de Álava |accessdate=2007-09-29 |last= |first= |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612025124/http://es.geocities.com/aingast/index233.htm|archivedate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the designs of the castle and of the arm with sword were changed. The castle is now on top of a grey rock and the arm and sword are light blue in colour.

# The fourth quarter once contained the linked chains of '''Navarre'''; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] forced the Basque government to remove the chains of Navarre, leaving the red background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/2000/10/06/espana/6N0076.html |title=Ajuria Enea retira las cadenas de Navarra de su escudo |accessdate=2007-09-29 |last= |first= |publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the Basque Government standardised the colours used in the shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/ver_c?CMD=VERDOC&amp;BASE=B03J&amp;DOCN=000011646&amp;CONF=/config/k54/bopv_c.cnf |title=DECRETO 690/1991, de 17 de diciembre, por el que se regulan las especificaciones técnicas y la utilización de los elementos gráficos de identidad visual del Gobierno Vasco. |accessdate=2007-09-29 |last= |first= |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]]s, but not only, have used an unofficially recognised Basque coat of arms, the [[Zazpiak Bat]]. It has been argued that it differs from the original one by being divided into six squares and by including the coat of arms of the Basque regions in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ilr/emblems/mlittpdf/eta.pdf|title=A Picture Speaks A Thousand Words: An Analysis of Terrorist Emblems|accessdate=2007-09-29|last=Lee Rasmussen |first=Irene|publisher=University of Saint Andrews|page=4|format=PDF|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414082446/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ilr/emblems/mlittpdf/eta.pdf |archivedate = April 14, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto "Zazpiak bat" was coined by [[Antoine-Thomson d'Abbadie]] in the late 19th century.

'''''Contemptus mundi''''', the "contempt of the [[world (theology)|world]]" and worldly concerns, is a theme in the intellectual life of both [[Classical Antiquity]] and of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi]&lt;/ref&gt; both in its mystical vein and its ambivalence towards secular life, that figures largely in the Western world's [[history of ideas]]. In inculcating a turn of mind that would lead to a state of serenity untrammeled by distracting material appetites and feverish emotional connections, which the Greek philosophers called ''[[ataraxia]]'', it drew upon the assumptions of [[Stoicism]] and a [[neoplatonism]] that was distrustful of deceptive and spurious appearances. In the familiar rhetorical polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and the contemplative life, which Christians, who expressly rejected "the World, [[Flesh (theology)|the Flesh]] and the Devil",&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is late (the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' but the triad draws on "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world." (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt; might exemplify as the way of [[Martha]] and the way of [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]], ''contemptus mundi'' assumed that only the contemplative life was of lasting value and the world an empty shell, a [[vanity]].

==In classical antiquity==
In the classical canon, [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', essays on achieving [[Stoicism|Stoic]] stability of emotions, with rhetorical subjects such as "Contempt of death", was taken up definitively by [[Boethius]] in his ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|Consolations of Philosophy]]'', during the troubled closing phase of [[Late Antiquity]]. The Latin tradition of dispraise of the public world adapted by Christian moralists, focused especially on the [[Fortuna|fickleness of Fortune]], and the evils exposed in the Latin [[satire]] became a mainstay of Christian penitential literature.

==In the Patristic tradition==
Among early Christians, [[Eucherius of Lyon]], an aristocratic and high-ranking ecclesiastic in the fifth-century Christian Church of Gaul, wrote to his kinsman a widely read letter ''de contemptu mundi'', an expression of the despair for the present and future of the world in [[End time|its last throes]]. Contempt for the world provided intellectual underpinnings for the retreat into [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]]: when [[Saint Florentina]], of the prominent Christian family of Hispania, founded her convent, her rule written by her brother [[Leander of Seville]] explicitly cited contempt for the world: ''Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem''.

==Medieval ''contemptus mundi''==
The medieval ''[[Trope (literature)|trope]]'' of ''contemptus mundi'', drawing upon these converging traditions, pagan philosophy and Christian [[Asceticism|ascetic theology]],&lt;ref&gt;Noted by John V. Fleming, "The best line in Ovid and the woest", in Robert G. Benson, Susan Janet Ridyard, eds. ''New Readings of Chaucer's Poetry'', 2003:56.&lt;/ref&gt; was fundamental to a medieval education.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bultot, "La Cartula et l'enseignement du mépris du monde dans les écoles et les universités médiévale", ''Studi Medievali'' ser. iii '''8''' (1967:787-834); Bultot's full-length study ''La doctrine du mépris du monde: Christianisme et valeur humaine: I.  [[Peter Damian|Pierre Damien]]'' (1963) was criticised in Francesco Lazzari, "S. Pierre Damien]et le 'contemptus mundi' à propos d'un livre récent", ''Revue d'ascétique et de mystique'' '''40''' (1964:185-96).&lt;/ref&gt; A classic Christian expression is [[Bernard of Cluny]]'s bitter 12th-century satire ''[[De contemptu mundi]]'', founded in a deep sense of the transitory nature of secular joys and the abiding  permanency of the spiritual life. His text made one of the ''[[Auctores octo morales]]'', the "eight moral authors" that formed the central texts of medieval pedagogy.

In the early 12th century, when [[Adelard of Bath]] (c. 1080 - 1152) allegorized two contrasting figures to dispute ''De eodem et diverso''; they were ''Philosophia'' and ''Philocosmia'', "love of wisdom" and the "love of the world".&lt;ref&gt;It is noteworthy that while Fleming's interpretation comes from his view that ''contemptus mundi'' was an embedded practice in the study of medieval literature, Bridget K. Balint in her ''Ordering Chaos: The Self and the Cosmos in Twelfth-Century Latin Prosimetrum'' (2009) argues that Adelard in fact does not despise the world per se, see p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Adelard's contemporary, [[Henry of Huntington]], in the dedicatory letter to his ''Historia Anglorum'' referred in passing to "those who taught the contempt of the world in schools".&lt;ref&gt;Adelard ("very elegant but also commonplace") and Henry of Huntinton are both noted in Fleming 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An aspect of contempt for this world reflects upon the ephemerality of all life, expressed in the literary rhetorical question of ''[[ubi sunt]]''. Even as worldly a pope as [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] could write an essay "On the Misery of the Human Condition",  ''De miseria humanae conditionis'', which [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is reputed to have rendered in English, in a translation now lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Companion''.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme had political ramifications within the Roman Church, as it was inextricably bound up with questions of  [[apostolic poverty]]&lt;ref&gt;Jan G. J. van den Eijnden discusses the controversial wealth of the Church in [[Thomas Aquinas]]' day, ''Poverty on the Way to God: Thomas Aquinas on evangelical poverty'' 1994:8 ff ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was roundly condemned, in the instance of the [[Humiliati]], as [[Heresy|heretical]].

The waning of the dominant attitude of ''contemptus mundi'' that had informed elite culture, a development that gathered impetus during the second half of the 14th century, was a precursor to the emergence of the modern secular ethos, encouraging men to study material things with greater lucidity than before, as [[Georges Duby]] has observed, noting the turn taken in painting and sculpture toward the [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] delineation of aspects of material life.&lt;ref&gt;Duby, "Preface" in ''A History of Private Life: II.Revelations of the Medieval World'' (1988:x).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern culture==
The theme of ''contemptus mundi'' continued to inform European poetry into the [[Early Modern]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Facts on File Companion to British Poetry before 1600'', Volume 1 (2008) ''s.v.'' "Contemptus mundi"; the theme is the subject of Mary Evelina McSorley, ''The 'Contemptus mundi' motif in Elizabethan Poetry'', 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contemptus mundi'' is a running theme in the poetry of [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref&gt;William L. Furstenburg, ''Contemptus mundi in William Drummond of Hawthornden'', 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and Burton's ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' and the devotional verse of [[Jeremy Taylor]] would serve as further examples. The recurrence of [[bubonic plague]] offered a concrete visitation of the frailty of this life for devotional texts, as early as [[John Donne]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest B. Gilman, ''Plague Writing in Early Modern England'', 2009:201&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times ''contemptus mundi'' has been criticized as a ''pastoral of fear'' by the historian [[Jean Delumeau]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions]&lt;/ref&gt; and M. B. Pranger found the ''trope'' "Speaking of God after Auschwitz" to function as a "modern form of ''contemptus mundi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pranger, ''The Artificiality of Christianity: Essays on the Poetics of Monasticism'' 2003:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Corpus separatum''''' is a [[Latin]] term referring to a city or region which is given a special legal and political status different from its environment, but which falls short of being sovereign, or an independent [[city state]]. The term may refer to:

* [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)]], the 1947 UN proposal for Jerusalem
* [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)]], the historical status of Fiume (today's Rijeka, Croatia) between 1776 and 1918
* [[Pordenone]], a ''corpus separatum'' between 1378 and 1514
* [[Novi Pazar]], a ''corpus separatum'' between 1878 and 1912

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5253">[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Criterion of multiple attestation:  [[Last Supper]]]]
The '''criterion of multiple attestation''' or ''independent attestation'' is a tool used by [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] to help determine whether certain actions or sayings by [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]] are from [[Historical Jesus]]. Simply put, the more independent witnesses that report an event or saying, the better. See [[Criteria of authenticity and the Historical Jesus]].

== Examples of its use ==
The gospels are not always independent of each other. Matthew and Luke, for example, are likely dependent on Mark. The ''criterion of multiple attestation''  focuses on the sayings or deeds of Jesus that are attested to in more than one independent literary source such as [[Apostle Paul]], [[Josephus]], [[Q source|Q]] and/or the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]. The force of this criterion is increased if a given motif or theme is also found in  different literary forms such as parables, dispute stories, miracle stories, prophecy, and/or aphorism.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine M. Murphy, ''The Historical Jesus For Dummies'', For Dummies Pub., 2007. p 14, 61-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew'', Yale University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple attestation has a certain kind of objectivity. Given the ''independence'' of the sources, satisfaction of the criterion makes it harder to maintain that it was an invention of the Church. Still, this criterion, however useful, is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the [[criterion of discontinuity]] and the [[criterion of embarrassment]], along with the [[historical method]].

For example the "[[Kingdom of God]]" ''motif'' appears in "Mark, Q, the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', special Lucan tradition, and John, with echoes in Paul, despite the fact that 'Kingdom of God' is not Paul's preferred way of speaking." It also appears in an array of literary genres.
The ''words'' attributed to Jesus on the bread and wine during the [[Last Supper]] (found in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], the [[Didache]] and arguably in [[Gospel of John|John]]) and on divorce (found in Mark and Paul) are examples of sayings that are multiply attested.
An example of an ''event'' that is multiply attested is Jesus's meeting with [[John the Baptist]] (found in Mark and John). &lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman, ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]],'' Oxford, 1999. pp  90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'',  Doubleday, 1991. v. 1, pp 174–175, 317&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stanley E. Porter, ''The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals'' Sheffield Academic Press,  2000.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Gerd Thiessen|Thiessen, &amp; Dagmar Winter.  ''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
This criterion cannot be used for sources that are not independent. For example, a saying that occurs in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] may only represent one source. Under the [[two-source hypothesis]], both the authors of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] used the Gospel of Mark in their writings; therefore, triple-tradition material represents only a single source, Mark. (The [[Augustinian hypothesis]] posits that Mark and Luke used Matthew, so once again triple-tradition material would have originated in a single source). Another limitation is that some sayings or deeds attributed to Jesus could have originated in the first Christian communities early enough in the tradition to be attested to by a number of independent sources, thus not representing the [[historical Jesus]]. Finally, there are some sayings or deeds of Jesus that only appear in one form or source that scholars still consider historically probable. Multiple attestation is not always a requisite for historicity, nor is it enough to determine accuracy by itself. 

The criterion is one of a number of factors that have been developed by scholars to assess whether a tradition is likely to be historical; the widely-recognized criteria were distinguished by Stanley E. Porter as [[Criterion of dissimilarity|dissimilarity]], [[Criterion of coherence|coherence]], multiple attestation, least distinctiveness and Aramaic linguistic background. Porter suggests three new criteria in the search for the words of the [[Historicity of Jesus|historical Jesus]] (Porter 2000), which have not yet found broad acceptance: a criterion of Greek language, of Greek textual variance and of "discourse features" at variance with the text's usual style. Of the criterion of multiple attestations, Porter makes the point, which has been expressed before, that multiple attestations identify common motifs rather than absolute wording, and speak only to the independence of documents and not their reliability (Porter 2000:86).

'''Richard “Dick” Glyn Kimber AM''' (born 1939) is an Australian historian and author who has written extensively on the history, art, culture and wildlife of Central Australia. He has published several books, the best known of which is ''Man From Arltunga: Walter Smith, Australian Bushman'' as well as more than 100 articles and essays.

==Early life==

Kimber was born at [[Freeling, South Australia|Freeling]] in [[South Australia]] in 1939. He went to school in the Riverland area and Brighton and then attended [[Adelaide University]] and Adelaide Teacher’s College.&lt;ref name="CDU" /&gt;

Kimber moved to [[Alice Springs]] in 1970 and taught English, history, social science and Aboriginal Studies at Alice Springs High School. In 1974 he became the first Sacred Sites Officer in the Northern Territory for the Sacred Sites Authority, before returning to teaching. From 1976 to 1978 he was the Papunya Tula Artists Coordinator and devised Aboriginal Studies materials for schools, after which he again returned to teaching. Beginning in 1976 Kimber undertook research and prepared submissions for land rights and [[Native title in Australia|native title claims]] for over twenty years, in a private capacity and for the [[Central Land Council]] and Ngaanyatjarra Council. During this time he also undertook research for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Studies, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Australian Heritage Commission and the [[Strehlow Research Centre]], regarding locations of Aboriginal homelands and their needs, settlement history, and ownership of sacred objects. He researched the historical records of extinct and rare native fauna for the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory and provided advice regarding the development of the Alice Springs Desert Park and issues relating to Aboriginal land ownership of various parks and reserves.&lt;ref name="Alice news"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finnane|first1=Finnane|title=Dick Kimber: premier scholar of Central Australia|url=http://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/2017/05/12/dick-kimber-premier-scholar-of-central-australia/|accessdate=29 May 2017|agency=Alice Springs News online|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dingling''' ({{zh|c=丁零}}) were an ancient people mentioned in [[Chinese historiography]] in the context of the 1st century BCE. 
They are assumed to have been an early Proto-[[Turkic peoples|Turkic-speaking people]],&lt;ref&gt;

whose original constituents mainly assimilated into the [[Xiongnu]] and [[Xianbei]] groups.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
They originally lived on the bank of the [[Lena River]] in the area west of [[Lake Baikal]], gradually moving southward to [[Mongolia]] and northern China. They were a huge independent horde for centuries, but later been defeated and temporary became subject of the [[Xiongnu]] Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Lu (1996), pp. 111, 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li (2003), pp. 110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus presumably related to the invaders known as [[Huns]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Haywood, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YKPaLi1d1O4C Siberia: A Cultural History], Oxford University Press, 2010, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the 3rd century they were assimilated into the [[Tiele people|Tiele]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8-OilJCX1moC&amp;q=Tingling+Turkic#v=snippet&amp;q=Tingling%20Turkic&amp;f=false Contact And Exchange in the Ancient World]. University of Hawaii Press, 2006. p.140&lt;/ref&gt; also named  Di (翟)， DiLi (狄历)， Gaoche (高車) or Chile (敕勒), who gradually expanded westward into [[Central Asia]], expelled from [[Mongolia]] by the [[Rouran]] and establishing a state  [[Turpan]] in the 5th century.
The  Tiele were a collection of  [[Turkic peoples|early Turkic]]  tribes, largely descended from the Chile.

== Origin and migration ==
The Dingling were a warlike group of hunters, fishers, and gatherers of the southern Siberian mountain taiga region from Lake Baikal to northern [[Mongolia]]. Chinese records do not mention the physical appearance of the Dingling, suggesting general homogeneity with people of the Asiatic region, and their name appears rarely, such as Di (翟), a example of the family name that been translated based on their group name or the last name of the top Ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Xue (1992), pp. 54-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lu (1996), pp. 305-320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988) pp. 35-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

They might have been correlated with the [[Guifang]], a northern tribe that appears in the [[oracle bone]] inscriptions from [[Yinxu]].&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988) pp. 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''History of the Gaoche'' of [[Wei Shou]] (6th century), the origin of the Dingling can be traced to the Chidi or Red Di (赤狄), who lived in northern China during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The ''[[Mozi]]'' mentions a total of eight Di groups related to the Chidi, of whom only the Chidi and two others were known.&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988), pp. 1-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suribadalaha (1986), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north of the [[Xiongnu]] empire and Dingling territories, at the headwaters of the [[Yenisei]] around [[Tannu Uriankhai]], lived the ''Gekun'' (鬲昆), also known as the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] in later records. Further to the west near the [[Irtysh]] river lived the Hujie (呼揭). Other tribes living north of the Xiongnu, such as the Hunyu (浑庾), Qushe (屈射), and Xinli (薪犁), are only mentioned once in Chinese records, and their exact location is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Lu (1996), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shen (1998), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2nd century BCE, the Dingling became subjects of [[Modu Chanyu]] along with 26 other tribes, including the [[Yuezhi]] and [[Wusun]].&lt;ref&gt;Li (2003), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dingling and Xiongnu===

The Dingling were first subjugated by the [[Xiongnu]], but these gradually weakened. In 71 BCE, after numerous conflicts between the Chinese and the Xiongnu, the Dingling, with help from neighboring tribes, took the opportunity to revolt. From 63 to 60 BCE, during a split within the Xiongnu ruling clan of Luanti (挛鞮), the Dingling attacked the Xiongnu, together with the [[Wusun]], supported by the Chinese, from the west and the [[Wuhuan]] from the southeast.&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988) pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 51 BCE, they were, together with the Hujie and Gekun, defeated by the Xiongnu under [[Zhizhi Chanyu]], on his way to [[Kangju]]. Over the next century there may have been more uprisings, but the only recorded one was in the year 85, when together with the [[Xianbei]] they made their final attack on the Xiongnu.&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988) pp. 101-103.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the Dingling were assimilated into the remaining northern Xiongnu and the [[Tuoba]] under the confederacy of Xianbei chief [[Tanshihuai]] (檀石槐). After his death in 181, the Xianbei moved south and the Dingling took their place on the steppe.

=== Assimilation===

Between the short-lived [[Xianbei]] confederacy in 181 and the foundation of the [[Rouran]] Qaghanate in 402, there was a long period without a tribal confederacy on the steppe. During this period, a part of the Dingling were assimilated to the northern Xiongnu by permanently settling further to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988) pp. 111-113.&lt;/ref&gt; Another group, documented as about 450,000, moved southeast and merged into the Xianbei.

After the defeat of [[Northern Shanyu (1st century)]], deduced from the number of casualties and immigrants, an estimated figure of 200,000 is given for the Xiongnu still remaining on the northern steppe. Remnants of the Xiongnu managed to keep their identity until the early 5th century, living on the [[Orkhon River]] under the tribal name  ''Bayeqi'' (拔也稽) before being eliminated by the [[Rouran]].&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988), pp. 118-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups of Dingling settled in China during [[Wang Mang]]'s reign. According to the ''[[Weilüe]]'', another group of Dingling escaped to the western steppe in Kazakhstan, which beeb called the West Dingling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/weilue/weilue.html#section28 Hill (2004), Section 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 3rd century, Dinglings living in China began to adopt family names such as Zhai(翟)or Di, Xianyu (鲜于), Luo (洛) and Yan (严).&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988), pp. 137-142, 152-158.&lt;/ref&gt; These Dingling became part of the southern Xiongnu tribes known as '''[[Tiele people|Chile]]''' (赤勒) during the 3rd century, from which the name Chile (敕勒) originated.

During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period the West Dingling Khan Zhai Bin(翟斌) lead his hordes, migrate from Kazakhstan into Central China, serveing the Chinese Dynasty Qian Qin(前秦)， after series of betrayed and Chinese plotting against him, Zhai Bin revolted against the QianQin Dynasty. MuRongChui 慕容垂， a XianBei noble who was appointed the high command of QianQin army to take down the revolt, but ZhaiBin successfully persuade him to start mutiny against QianQin, then later with the support of other XianBei nobles, ZhaiBin supported MuRongChui to be the leader of the Anti-Qin leagues. End of the same year, MuRongChui self appointed King of Yan Dynasty(燕王), left ZhaiBin in a dilemma of war, murder ZhaiBin and his three sons. His nephew Zhaizhen(翟真) inherited the hordes, seeking for revenge, but later assassinated by his military advisor XianYuQi (鲜于乞), the DingLing soldiers executed XianYuQi, then elected ZhaiZhen's cousin ZhaiCheng(翟成) as the new Leader, but later also been murdered by XianBei, then ZhaiLiao 翟辽, became the new leader of the hordes, with the support, he founded the [[Wei (Dingling)|Wei state]], a DingLing Dynasty in China in modern HeNan Province.&lt;ref&gt;Duan (1988), pp. 148-152.&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of people descended from the Tiele in central Asia, mixing with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people, would later emerge as the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] group.

About one-quarter of the Tuoba clans show similar names as found among the later Gaoche and Tiele tribes. Among them, the Hegu (紇骨) and Yizhan (乙旃) clans kept their high status and were forbidden to intermarry with the rest.

Between the 4th and 7th centuries, the name "Dingling" slowly disappeared from Chinese records.

==Yeniseian theory==
In ''Zur jenissejisch-indianischen Urverwandtschaft (Concerning Yeniseian-Indian Primal Relationship)'', the German scholar, Heinrich Werner developed a new language family which he termed ''Baikal–Siberic''. By extension, he groups together the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] peoples ([[Arin language|Arin]], [[Assan language|Assan]], [[Yugh language|Yugh]], [[Ket language|Ket]], [[Kott language|Kott]], and [[Pumpokol language|Pumpokol]]), the [[Na-Dene]] Indians, and the Dingling of Chinese chronicles to ''Proto-Dingling''. The linguistic comparison of Na-Dene and Yeniseian shows that the quantity and character of the correspondences points to a possible common origin. According to Russian linguistic experts, they likely spoke a [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] or [[synthetic language]] with an [[active language|active]] form of [[morphosyntactic alignment]], exhibiting a linguistically and culturally unified community.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The name Dingling can be seen to resemble both:
* the Yeniseian word *dzheng ''people'' &gt; Ket de?ng, Yug dyeng, Kott cheang
* the Na-Dene word *ling or *hling ''people'', i.e. as manifested in the name of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] (properly hling-git ''son of man, child of the people'').

Although the [[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]] language family is now a widely known proposal, his inclusion of the Dingling is not widely accepted.

[[Gold as an investment|Gold]] prices spiked upwards, from $215.50 to $287 an ounce in London trading.&lt;ref name="norris"/&gt;  [[Price of oil|Oil prices]] also spiked upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Financial World Is Left Reeling by Attack |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 12, 2001 |author=Stevenson, Richard W., Stephen Labaton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas prices in the United States also briefly shot up, though the spike in prices lasted only about one week.&lt;ref name="crs-2"/&gt;

[[Currency]] trading continued, with the [[United States dollar]] falling sharply against the [[Euro]], [[Pound sterling|British pound]], and [[Japanese yen]].&lt;ref name="norris"/&gt;  The next day, European stock markets fell sharply, including declines of 4.6% in [[Spain]], 8.5% in [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="norris"/&gt; and 5.7% on the London Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ft/20080121/bs_ft/fto012120081205391251 |title=Shares suffer biggest fall since September 11, 2001}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stocks in the [[Latin America]]n markets also plunged, with a 9.2% drop in [[Brazil]], 5.2% drop in [[Argentina]], and 5.6% decline in Mexico, before trading was halted.&lt;ref name="norris"/&gt;

==Economic sectors==
In international and domestic markets, stocks of companies in some sectors were hit particularly hard.  Travel and entertainment stocks fell, while communications, pharmaceutical and military/defense stocks rose. Online travel agencies particularly suffered, as they cater to leisure travel.

===Insurance===
Insurance losses due to 9/11 were more than one and a half times greater than what was previously the largest disaster ([[Hurricane Andrew]]) in terms of losses.  The losses included business interruption ($11.0 billion), property ($9.6 billion), [[liability (accounting)|liability]] ($7.5 billion), [[workers compensation]] ($1.8 billion), and others ($2.5 billion).  The firms with the largest losses included [[Berkshire Hathaway]], [[Lloyd's]], [[Swiss Re]], and [[Munich Re]], all of which are reinsurers, with more than $2 billion in losses for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Economic Effects Of Federal Participation In Terrorism Risk |journal=Risk Management &amp; Insurance Review |year=2005 |author1=Hubbard, R Glenn |author2=Bruce Deal |author3=Peter Hess |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6296.2005.00056.x |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shares of major [[reinsurer]]s, including [[Swiss Re]] and [[Baloise Insurance Group]] dropped by more than 10%, while shares of [[Swiss Life]] dropped 7.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reinsurance Companies Wait to Sort Out Cost of Damages |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 12, 2001 |author=Sorkin, Trimi Slade, Simon Romero}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the insurance industry held reserves that covered the 9/11 attacks, insurance companies were reluctant to continue providing coverage for future terrorist attacks.  Only a few insurers continue to offer such coverage.

===Airlines and aviation===
Flights were grounded in various places across the United States and [[Canada]] that did not necessarily have the operational support in place, such as dedicated ground crews.  A large number of transatlantic flights landed in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], with the logistics handled by [[Transport Canada]] in [[Operation Yellow Ribbon]].  To help with immediate needs for victims' families, [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] both provided initial payments of $25,000.&lt;ref name="zuckerman"&gt;{{cite news |title=For the First Time, the Nation's Entire Airspace Is Shut Down |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 12, 2001 |author=Zuckerman, Laurence}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The airlines were also required to refund ticket purchases for anyone unable to fly.&lt;ref name="zuckerman"/&gt;

The 9/11 attacks compounded financial troubles that the airline industry already was experiencing before the attacks.  Share prices of airlines and airplane manufacturers plummeted after the attacks.  [[Midway Airlines (1993–2003)|Midway Airlines]], already on the brink of bankruptcy, shut down operations almost immediately afterwards. Other airlines were threatened with bankruptcy, and tens of thousands of layoffs were announced in the week following the attacks.  To help the industry, the federal government provided an aid package to the industry, including $10 billion in [[loan guarantee]]s, along with $5 billion for short-term assistance.&lt;ref name="crs-4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31617.pdf |title=The Economic Effects of 9/11: A Retrospective Assessment |author=Makinen, Gail |date=September 27, 2002 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |pages=CRS–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction on air travel demand caused by the attack is also seen as a contributory reason to the retirement of the only supersonic aircraft in service at the time, [[Concorde]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been commented that the lack of demand for the Concorde after its service resumption in 2001 could be caused by the death of many regular Concorde travellers resulted from this attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108568698.html 9/11 'grounded Concorde'.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
Tourism in [[New York City]] plummeted, causing massive losses in a sector which employed 280,000 people and generated $25 billion per year. In the week following the attack, hotel occupancy fell below 40%, and 3,000 employees were laid off. [[Tourism]], hotel occupancy and air travel also fell drastically across the nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The reluctance to fly may have been due to increased fear of a repeat attack. Suzanne Thompson, Professor of Psychology at Pomona College, [[California]] conducted [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927161530/http://collegenews.org/news/2003/study-on-effects-of-911-attacks-show-most-americans-feel-more-vulnerable.html interviews of 501 people who were not direct victims of 9/11]. From this, she concluded that "Most participants felt more distress (65 percent) and a stronger fear of flying (55 percent) immediately after the event than they did before the attacks."

===Security===
Since the 9/11 attacks, substantial resources have been put towards improving security, in the areas of [[homeland security]], [[defense (military)|national defense]], and in the private sector.&lt;ref name="crs-2"/&gt;

==New York City==
In New York City, approximately 430,000 jobs were lost and there were $2.8 billion in lost wages over the three months following the 9/11 attacks. The economic effects were mainly focused on the city's [[export]] economy sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dolfman, Michael L., Solidelle F. Wasser |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=127 |year=2004 |title=9/11 and the New York City Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[GDP]] for New York City was estimated to have declined by $30.3 billion over the last three months of 2001 and all of 2002.  The Federal government provided $11.2 billion in immediate assistance to the [[Government of New York City]] in September 2001, and $10.5 billion in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs.&lt;ref name="crs-5"/&gt;

The 9/11 attacks also had great impact on small businesses in [[Lower Manhattan]], located near the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].  Approximately 18,000 [[small business]]es were destroyed or displaced after the attacks.  The [[Small Business Administration]] provided loans as assistance, while Community Development Block Grants and Economic Injury Disaster Loans were other also used by the Federal Government to provide assistance to small business affected by the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name="crs-5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31617.pdf |title=The Economic Effects of 9/11: A Retrospective Assessment |author=Makinen, Gail |date=September 27, 2002 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |pages=CRS–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other effects==
The September 11 attacks also led directly to the U.S. war in Afghanistan, as well as additional homeland security spending. The attacks were also cited as a [[rationale for the Iraq war]]. 
The cost of the two wars so far has surpassed $5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/osama-bin-laden-didnt-win-but-he-was-enormously-successful/2011/05/02/AFexZjbF_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Suzy | last=Khimm | date=May 3, 2011 | title=Osama bin Laden didn't win, but he was ‘enormously successful'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/bin-ladens-war-against-the-us-economy/2011/04/27/AFDOPjfF_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | date=May 3, 2011 | first=Thomas | last=Heath | title=Bin Laden's war against the U.S. economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">'''Elizabeth Cooper''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1865–1874) was an English historian and biographer of the mid-Victorian period, known for three publications on the history of America, on [[Lady Arbella Stuart]], and on [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]].

==Biography==
Little appears to be known of Cooper apart from her publications, and a few reviews and commentaries relating to them; she appears to have been unmarried, at least during the period in which she was published.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=46555|title=Cooper, Elizabeth (fl. 1865–1874), historian|first=Rosemary|last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 she published ''A Popular History of America'', subtitled '' From the Discovery by Columbus to the Establishment of the Federal Republic of the United States In Three Periods: I. The Discovery and Conquest of the West Indies and South America II. The Colonization of the United States III. The War of Independence and the Establishment of the Federal Government''. The history, covering both the north and south of the continent, runs to 527 pages and includes two fold-out maps.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-antique-books.com/book-34423-A-Popular-History-of-America-Antique-Book-w-Maps-1865|title=A Popular History of America Antique Book w/ Maps 1865|website=All Antique Books|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, 1866, she published a two-volume ''The Life and Letters of Lady Arabella Stuart'', based on her studies of Stuart-related papers held by [[Thomas Phillipps]], [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton]], [[George Digby Wingfield Digby]] and others.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Letters of Lady Arbella Stuart |first=Elizabeth |last=Cooper |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jJIEAAAAYAAJ|date=1866|pages=vii-viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review'' described the work as a carefully painted portrait, built on 'numerous original and hitherto unpublished documents', and written with 'quiet taste and sober treatment'.&lt;ref name="FQWR"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review|title=Contemporary Literature|volume=30|date=1 July 1866|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HvFTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA257|pages=257–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She next published ''The Life of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Stafford'' in 1874; the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] speculates that the gap between this and the ''Arabella Stuart'' might arise out of illness; her dedication in ''Stafford'' is to Edward Lane, a medical doctor and [[Hydrotherapy|hydrotherapist]] who ran establishments at [[Moor Park, Farnham]] and [[Sudbrook Park, Petersham]]; Cooper evidently believed he had rescued her from certain death.&lt;ref name="Stafford1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life of Thomas Wentworth Earl of Strafford &amp; Lord- Lieutenant ..., Volume 1|first=Elizabeth|last=Cooper|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KL1gAAAAcAAJ|date=1874|page=Dedication}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-volume ''Stafford'' was the first scholarly treatise on Wentworth, and was received with generally good reviews.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

There were many events leading to the 1982 '''[[Falklands War]]''' (''Guerra de Malvinas'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] over possession of the [[Falkland Islands]] (''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] (''Georgia del Sur'').

==Background==
{{Main|Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands}}

The Falkland Islands had been the subject of a sovereignty dispute almost since they were first settled in 1764, between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the later [[United Kingdom]] on one side, and successively [[France]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] (later Argentina) on the other. A settlement was successfully established on the islands in 1828 by the German merchant of Huguenot ancestry [[Luis Vernet]], (although there had been British, French and Spanish settlements before then). Vernet had acquired permission for his venture from both the Government of the United Provinces and the British Consulate.

Vernet provided regular reports to the British and had requested their protection for his settlement should they return. Britain made diplomatic protests when Vernet was appointed Governor by the United Provinces and both Britain and the United States made diplomatic protests over the attempt to curtail rights to sealing on the islands. After Vernet seized American ships sealing in the islands and confiscated their catch, the United States [[Falklands Expedition|dispatched]] a warship to the islands, resulting in the abandonment of [[Puerto Soledad]] and the voluntary repatriation of many of the settlers.

Subsequently, the United Provinces tried to re-establish the settlement at Puerto Soledad as a penal colony, but a mutiny resulted in the murder of one Governor. Shortly after that mutiny had been quelled, in January 1833, a British naval task force arrived charged with the [[Re-establishment of British rule on the Falklands (1833)|re-establishment of British rule on the islands]]. The British requested that the Argentine administration leave the islands, who complied with that request without a shot being fired. Contrary to popular belief, the settlers on the island were not expelled at the same time, but were encouraged by the British to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowell S.

International Affairs, Vol 44 (1968), pp. 463–481."Much is made in successive presentations of the Argentine case of the next episode in the history of the islands: the supposed fact that Great Britain 'brutally' and 'forcefully' expelled the Argentine garrison in 1833. The record is not nearly so dramatic. After the commander of the Lexington had declared, in December 1831, the Falklands 'free of all government', they remained without any visible authority. However, in September 1832, the Buenos Aires Government appointed, in place of Vernet, an interim commandant, Juan Mestivier. The British representative immediately lodged a protest, but Mes- tivier sailed on the Sarandi at the end of the year to take charge of a penal settlement at San Carlos, his Government's reserve on East Falkland. There was a mutiny, led by a sergeant of the garrison, and Mestivier was murdered. At this juncture, on January 11, 1833, H.M. sloop Clio arrived at Puerto de la Soledad when Pinedo, the commander of the Sarandi and 25 soldiers were attempting to re-establish order. The so called 'brutal' eviction is laconically recorded in Captain Onslow's log: Tuesday 1 Jany. 1833. P.M. Mod. with rain 12.20 shortened sails and came to Port Louis (Soledad), Berkeley Sound ... found here a Buenos Ayrean flag flying on shore. 2.30 out boats. 3 furled sails. 5.30 Moored ship . . . Wednesday Jany. 2. Moored at Port Louis A.M. Mod. cloudy ... loosed sails and landed a party of marines and seamen and hoisted the Union Jack and hauled down the Buenos Ayrean flag and sent it on board the schooner to the Commandante. Sailmaker repairing the Main top Gallant sails.... In the interval between these two entries, Onslow had 'civilly' (his report) told Pinedo that he had come 'to exercise the right of sovereignty' on the islands and asked him to haul down his flag on shore. Pinedo protested, but said that if the Buenos Aires flag were allowed to fly until January 5, he would leave with his soldiers and anyone else who wished to go. When Onslow proved adamant, Pinedo agreed to embark his soldiers, but he left his flag flying on shore. This was why Onslow sent it to him by one of the Clio's officers. Pinedo sailed on January 4 and was later punished by the Buenos Aires Government for failing to offer any resistance"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurio Hedelvio Destéfani|title=The Malvinas, the South Georgias, and the South Sandwich Islands, the conflict with Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGAJSfxqd7oC|year=1982|publisher=Edipress|isbn=978-950-01-6904-2|page=91|quote=Before Pinedo sailed from the Malvinas he appointed Political and Military Commander of the Islands, a Frenchman name Juan Simon who had been Vernet's trusted foreman in charge of his gauchos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands remained continuously in British possession from then until 1982.

During the period 1976–1983, Argentina was under the control of a [[military dictatorship]], and in the midst of a devastating [[economics|economic]] crisis. The [[National Reorganization Process]], as the junta was known, had killed thousands of Argentine citizens for their political opposition to the government. The era was known as the [[Dirty War]]. 

The military staged a coup against the government of President [[Isabel Perón]] and put General [[Jorge Rafael Videla|Jorge Videla]] in power. He was succeeded by General [[Roberto Eduardo Viola|Roberto Viola]] and then General Leopoldo Galtieri for a short while. Before he started the Falklands War, Galtieri was subject to growing opposition from the people. The actual rule of General Galtieri lasted eighteen months. In the course of 1981, Argentina saw inflation climb to over 600%, and [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] fall by 11.4%, [[manufacturing]] output by 22.9% and real [[wages]] by 19.2%. The trades unions were gaining more support for a general strike every day; popular opposition to the junta was growing rapidly.

President Galtieri, as head of the junta, aimed to counter public concern over economic and [[human rights]] issues by means of a speedy victory over the Falklands which would appeal to popular nationalistic sentiment. Argentine intelligence officers had been working with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to help fund the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]], and the Argentine government believed it might be rewarded for this activity by non-interference on the part of the [[Foreign relations of the United States|United States]] if it invaded the Falklands. The Argentine leadership had noticed that during the [[Suez crisis]] in 1956, the US had objected to the British use of force, that in 1981 the UK [[Lancaster House Agreement|reached agreement]] with the former colony Rhodesia and that the [[1961 Indian Annexation of Goa]] was initially condemned by the international community and then accepted as a ''[[fait accompli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Mares, "Violent Peace", 2001, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-11186-X}}, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 

Argentina exerted pressure at the [[United Nations]] by raising hints of a possible invasion, but the British either missed or ignored this threat and did not react. The Argentines assumed that the British would not use force if the islands were [[invasion|invaded]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|es|Que tenía que ver con despertar el orgullo nacional y con otra cosa. La junta—Galtieri me lo dijo—nunca creyó que los británicos darían pelea. Él creía que Occidente se había corrompido. Que los británicos no tenían Dios, que Estados Unidos se había corrompido... Nunca lo pude convencer de que ellos no sólo iban a pelear, que además iban a ganar.}}" ("This was neither about national pride nor anything else.

According to British sources,&lt;ref name="FreedmanGamba-Stonehouse2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence Freedman|author2=Virginia Gamba-Stonehouse|title=Signals of War: The Falklands Conflict of 1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mygABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6158-3|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Argentines interpreted the failure of the British to react as a lack of interest in the Falklands due to the planned withdrawal (as part of a general reduction in size of the [[Royal Navy]] in 1981), including the last of the Antarctic Supply vessels, [[HMS Endurance (1967)|HMS ''Endurance'']], and by the [[British Nationality Act 1981|British Nationality Act of 1981]], which replaced the full British [[citizenship]] of [[Falkland Islanders]] with a more limited version.

Operation ''Sol'' in 1976, secretly landed a force of 50 men from the Argentine military under the command of Captain César Trombetta on the unoccupied [[Southern Thule]], which belonged to the British [[South Sandwich Islands]], where they established the military outpost of [[Corbeta Uruguay]]. This led to a formal protest from the United Kingdom, and an effort to resolve the issue through diplomatic rather than military means. [[Operation Journeyman|Operation ''Journeyman'']], the dispatching of a small military force to the South Atlantic by [[James Callaghan]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, may have helped avert further action and subsequent reports from the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (UK)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC) in 1977, 1979 and 1981 which suggested that "as long as Argentina calculated that the British Government were prepared to negotiate seriously on sovereignty, it was unlikely to resort to force." However, if "... negotiations broke down, or if Argentina concluded from them that there was no prospect of real progress towards a negotiated transfer of sovereignty, there would be a high risk of its then resorting to more forceful measures, including direct military action." &lt;ref name="Falklands War"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.malvinasonline.com.ar/g82/artic/part.php?recordID=50 |title=How Frank was Franks? |access-date=15 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106043545/http://www.malvinasonline.com.ar/g82/artic/part.php?recordID=50 |archive-date=6 November 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==

===First moves===
At a lunch between [[Jorge Anaya|Admiral Jorge Isaac Anaya]] (another member of the junta) and General Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri on 9 December 1981, in the main army barracks at Campo de Mayo, the two discussed how and when to overthrow President Roberto Viola. Anaya offered the navy's support on the understanding that the navy would be allowed to occupy the Falkland Islands and South Georgia.&lt;ref name="Jimmy Burns 1987"&gt;Jimmy Burns: ''The land that lost its heroes'', 1987, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galtieri appears to have hoped that public opinion would reward a successful occupation by affording him power for at least ten years. They believed that the flying of the Argentine flag in Port Stanley on the 150th anniversary of Britain's "''illegal usurpation of Las Malvinas''" would lead to a neo-[[Juan Perón|Perónist]] era of national pride.

On Tuesday 15 December, Anaya flew from Buenos Aires to the main Argentine naval base at Puerto Belgrano. He travelled there to install Vice-Admiral Juan Lombardo officially as the new Chief of Naval Operations. After the ceremony, Anaya surprised Lombardo by telling him to prepare a plan for the occupation of the Falkland Islands. Lombardo later told the author Martin Middlebrook in an interview that Anaya told him to "take them but not necessarily to keep them". The conversation between Anaya and Lombardo was short and concluded with Anaya stressing the need for absolute secrecy.

Shortly after this initial order, Lombardo flew to Buenos Aires to ask Anaya for clarification of his orders. Lombardo recalled later: "I set out my questions in a handwritten document to make sure they were on the record, but no copies were made. I asked these questions: Was the operation to be purely naval, or joint with other services? Was the intention to take and keep the islands, or take them and then hand them over to someone else, and, if so, would this be an Argentine force or a world force, that is, the United Nations. Could he guarantee that the secret nature of the planning be maintained? These were the answers I was given: It was to be a joint operation, but nobody else had yet been informed. I didn't know at the time whether Galtieri and'' {{sic}} ''[[Basilio Lami Dozo|Lami Dozo]] were aware of Admiral Anaya's orders to me, but it was confirmed a few days later that they were. I was to plan a take-over; but not to prepare the defence of the islands afterwards. About secrecy, he said that I would only be working with three other Admirals - Allara, Busser of the Marines and Garcia Bol of the Naval Air Arm; these were all near me at Puerto Belgrano. I started talks with those three, and they all asked the same or similar questions."

"So I went back to Buenos Aires to insist that, if the operation was to be joint, co-operation with the other services would be essential. Anaya agreed that General Garcia of the Army was in mind but had not yet been informed. He repeated that it was a Navy task to take over the Malvinas; what followed was for the junta to decide. They did not think there would be any military reaction from the British." &lt;ref&gt;Martin Middlebrook: ''The Fight For The Malvinas - The Argentine Forces in the Falklands War'', 1989, Viking, {{ISBN|0-670-82106-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Force's Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo was not informed of the decision before 29 December&lt;ref name="Jimmy Burns 1987"/&gt; and even Foreign Minister [[Nicanor Costa Méndez|Costa Méndez]] was unaware of the planning while he prepared his diplomatic initiative in January 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter three: Deadlock Again, page 23 in Freedman, Lawrence: ''Signals of war'', 1990, Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-14144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning===
Detailed planning began in early January 1982. It was headed by Vice Admiral Juan José Lombardo (Commander-in-Chief Fleet) and included General Osvald Garcia (commander of the Fifth Army Corps) and Brigadier Sigfrido Plessel, (member of the Air Force Staff). The operation would be an amphibious landing of 3,000 troops ''en masse'' to minimise bloodshed. The contingent of [[Royal Marines]], British civil service officials and the more anti-Argentine among the [[Falklanders]] would be deported and the bulk of the invasion force would return to their bases within 48 hours. A military [[governor]] and a gendarmerie of about 500 would be left to keep the Falklanders in line. Anaya's draft planned to replace the entire island population with Argentine settlers, but Lombardo believed that such a step would outrage the international community. Instead the Falklanders should be offered financial compensation if they wished to emigrate.

Commissioned by the British, an Argentine firm had constructed a temporary runway near Stanley in advance of the building of a main runway at Stanley airport. The military ''[[LADE|Líneas Aéreas del Estado]]'' (LADE) airline flew regularly to the Falkland Islands. LADE was represented by Vice-Commodore Hector Gilobert in Port Stanley and he had been gathering intelligence for four years. The cargo ship ARA ''Isla de los Estados'' was hired for commercial purposes by the island administration, and her captain Capaglio had detailed information on the Falkland coast, beaches and inner waters.

In an atmosphere of arms selling, the United Kingdom was very forthcoming to the Argentine naval [[attaché]] in London, Rear-Admiral Walter Allara. He was invited on board HMS ''Invincible'' and had conversations with British naval personnel about the shortcomings of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name="Jimmy Burns 1987"/&gt;

In January 1982, diplomatic talks over sovereignty ceased&lt;!-- Editor's note: I was going to put this in, but it's nought but weasel words. There's no need for party politics, I don't think. The reader may draw his own conclusions, the governments' allegiances are noted already. ///, arguably in part due to the now-incumbent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government placing less import on the JIC's reports than the previous administration/// --&gt;. Although it is often thought that the Falklands invasion was a long-planned action, it became clear after the war that the subsequent defence of the islands had been largely improvised; for example, [[sea mine]]s were not deployed at strategic landing locations, and a large part of the [[infantry]] forces sent to the Falklands consisted of the current intake of conscripts, who had only begun their training in  January/February of that year. Arguments that the war was a last-minute decision are bolstered by the fact that the Argentine Navy would have received, at the end of the year, additional French [[Exocet]] airborne anti-ship missiles, Super Étendards (French fighter aircraft capable of carrying the Exocet) and new ships being built in [[West Germany]].

===Argentine intentions===
The Argentine Navy possessed modern British-built [[Type 42 destroyer|Type 42]] air-defence [[destroyer]]s of the type forming the bulk of the British Task Force's anti-air umbrella. Training attacks on these revealed that over half of Argentine aircraft might be lost in the process of destroying only a few British [[warships]] if they attacked at the medium to high altitudes at which the [[Sea Dart missile]] was designed to engage; hence the Argentine Air Force's employment of low-level stand-off Exocet attacks in [[Blue-water navy|blue-water]] combat, and over-land approaches when in the littoral.

The overall lack of readiness for the Falklands adventure was likely to have been due to the invasion being a last-minute decision taken as a consequence of the South Georgia crisis. Furthermore, for several years, Argentina had been on the brink of war with [[Chile]]. Argentina's military strategists feared that Chile would take advantage of the Falklands crisis and attempt to seize part of Argentine [[Patagonia]]. In 2009 Basilio Lami Dozo, the commander-in-chief of the Argentine Air Force during the war, disclosed that Leopoldo Galtieri announced to him that Chile would be the next invasion target.&lt;ref name="perfil-22.11.2009"&gt;{{Citation

Consequently, a significant part of Argentina's limited forces and equipment were kept on the mainland - and during the war, Chile, perhaps suspecting an Argentine invasion,&lt;ref name="elpais-11.04.1982"&gt;Article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/ISLAS_MALVINAS/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/REINO_UNIDO/GUERRA_DE_LAS_MALVINAS_/1982/Chile/teme/Argentina/pueda/repetir/accion/fuerza/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820411elpepiint_5/Tes Chile teme que Argentina pueda repetir una acción de fuerza en el canal de Beagle] in the spanish newspaper "[[El País]]" on 11 April 1982 written by Rafael Urbina in [[Santiago de Chile]], retrieved on 26 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; did indeed deploy forces in border regions in what looked like mobilization for a possible invasion (it is still unclear whether this was defensive, offensive or merely a diversion prompted by its British allies).

Argentina's original intention was to mount a quick, symbolic [[Military occupation|occupation]], followed rapidly by a [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]], leaving only a small garrison to support the new military governor. This strategy was based on the Argentinian assumption that the British would never respond militarily. Argentine assault units were indeed withdrawn to the mainland in the days following the invasion, but strong popular support and the rapid British reaction forced the Junta to change their objectives and reinforce the islands, since they could not politically afford to lose the islands once the British came out to fight. The junta misjudged the political climate in Britain, believing that [[democracies]] were weak, indecisive and averse to risk, and did not anticipate that the British would move their fleet halfway across the globe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Landings on South Georgia==
{{See also|1982 invasion of South Georgia}}
In 1980, Admiral Edgardo Otero (formerly the notorious commander of the [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics]], where hundreds of the 'disappeared' were tortured and executed), was the head of the navy's Antarctic operations and sought to repeat Operation ''Sol'' in South Georgia by establishing a military base (Operation ''Alpha''). Admiral Lombardo feared that Operation ''Alpha'' would jeopardise the secret preparations for the Falkland landings, but Admiral Otero had close links to Admiral Anaya who approved Operation ''Alpha'' despite promising Admiral Lombardo he would cancel the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland White, ''Vulcan 607'', London, Bantam Press, p30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine entrepreneur, Constantino Davidoff, had a two-year-old contract regarding scrapping an old whaling station on South Georgia. In December 1981, he was transported by the icebreaker ARA ''Almirante Irizar'', commanded by Captain Trombetta, to South Georgia for an initial survey of the work. The party was landed without the customary call to the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) base at [[Grytviken]], which led to formal diplomatic protests by the British Government.

Davidoff personally called the British Embassy in Buenos Aires to apologise, and promised that his men would follow the correct protocols on landing in future. He received permission to continue with his venture, and on 11 March the naval transport [[ARA Bahía Buen Suceso|ARA ''Bahía Buen Suceso'']] set sail, carrying Davidoff's party of scrap workers. The party was, however, infiltrated by Argentine marines posing as civilian scientists.  Operation ''Alpha'' had begun.&lt;ref&gt;"'''infiltrated on board, pretending to be scientists, were members of an Argentine naval special forces unit'''" Nick van der Bijl, ''Nine Battles to Stanley'', London, Leo Cooper P.8 as reported in Lawrence Freemdman, ''The Official History of the Falklands Campaign: Vol I The Origins of the Falklands War''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'''''Bahia Buen Suceso'' set sail for South Georgia on 11 March carrying Argentine Marines'''" Rowland White, ''Vulcan 607'', London, Bantam Press, p30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving on 19 March, the party failed once again to follow the correct protocol&lt;ref&gt;"'''The Argentine Navy certainly knew the rules for the islands; these were part of the navigation code'''" Lawrence Freedmand and Virginia Gamba-Stonehouse, ''Signals of War'', London, Faber and Faber P.47.&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded directly to [[Leith Harbour]]. The BAS party sent to investigate found that the Argentinian [[scrap metal]] workers had established a camp, defaced British signs, broken into the BAS hut and removed emergency rations, and had shot reindeer in contravention of local conservancy measures (landing with firearms without permission was of itself illegal). The BAS party also reported a number of men in military uniform and that the Argentine flag had been raised.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/19/newsid_2543000/2543639.stm BBC: 19 March 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMS-Endurance-MDQ-1982.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Endurance'' at [[Mar del Plata]] naval base, during her trip to the Falklands on February 1982]]
A series of diplomatic exchanges then took place. The Falkland Islands Governor and subsequently the Foreign Office passed a message back to the BAS team for passing to the captain of the ARA ''Bahia Buen Suceso''. This was to the effect that the Argentine flag must be taken down and that they must report to the British administrator (Mr Stephen Martin, commander of the British Antarctic Survey Base) at Grytviken, to have their passports stamped (which they refused to do since it would acknowledge British [[sovereignty]] over the islands).  Although the flag was lowered and the ''Bahía Buen Suceso'' departed, a party of men were left behind. On 21 March, HMS ''Endurance'' set sail with a party of 22 Royal Marines to expel the men who remained at Leith but to avoid further tensions, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) ordered ''Endurance'' to hold off.

Taking advantage of the British pause, the Argentine Junta then ordered the ARA ''Bahía Paraíso'' to land a party of [[Buzos Tacticos]] (special forces) led by Lieutenant [[Alfredo Astiz]] ("the blond angel of death"). Rather than force a confrontation, the Royal Marines were ordered to set up an observation post to monitor the situation at Leith. The full party of Royal Marines was not landed until 31 March when it became apparent that Argentine forces intended to seize the Falkland Islands. The Grytviken Base was actually assaulted the day after the Falklands, since bad weather prevented an attack on the same day.

==Failed diplomacy==
During the conflict, there were no formal [[diplomatic relations]] between the United Kingdom and Argentina, so negotiations were carried out in a rather indirect way, via third parties who spoke with one then with the other belligerent ("[[shuttle diplomacy]]"). The [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] of [[Peru]], announced that his efforts in favour of peace were futile.

Although Peru (which represented Argentina's diplomatic interests in Britain) and [[Switzerland]] (which represented Britain's diplomatic interests in Argentina) exerted great diplomatic pressure to avoid war, they were unable to resolve the conflict, and a [[conflict resolution|peace plan]] proposed by [[President of Peru|Peruvian president]] [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]], although accepted by Britain, was rejected by Argentina.

==Invasion==
{{Main|1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands}}
The [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] warned [[Rex Masterman Hunt|Rex Hunt]], the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]], of a possible Argentine invasion on 1 April. Hunt then organised a defence, and gave military command to Major Mike Norman RM, who managed to muster a small force of Royal Marines. The Argentine [[Lieutenant-Commander]] in charge of the invasion, Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots, landed his special forces at [[Mullet Creek]].

He proceeded to attack the buildings in and around [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]], including Government House and the Moody Brook Barracks until the Falkland Islands government at Government House surrendered on 2 April. One Argentine was killed in the main invasion; a further three Argentines died in the fighting to take control of South Georgia.

==Task force==
[[File:FalklandsTaskForceKeyLogisticsPointsMap.jpg|thumb|250px|The key locations in the Task Force's logistics chain]]
The British were quick to organise diplomatic pressure against Argentina. Because of the long distance to the Falklands, Britain had to rely on a naval [[task force]] for military action. The overall naval force was commanded by the [[Commander-in-Chief Fleet]], [[Admiral]] [[John Fieldhouse, Baron Fieldhouse|Sir John Fieldhouse]], who was designated Commander Task Force 317, and had three to four subordinate task groups, depending on the stage of the war. [[Sandy Woodward|Rear Admiral John “Sandy” Woodward’s]] Task Group 317.8 was centred around the [[aircraft carrier]]s [[HMS Hermes (R12)|HMS ''Hermes'']] and the newly commissioned [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']] carrying only 20 [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) [[Sea Harrier]]s  between them for defence against the combined Argentinian air force and naval air arm. The task force would have to be self-reliant and able to project its force across the [[littoral]] area of the Islands.

A second component was the Amphibious Group, Task Group 317.0, commanded by Commodore Michael Clapp RN.&lt;ref name="fn_3"&gt;Michael Clapp, Amphibious Assault Falklands. {{ISBN|0-7528-1109-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The embarked force, the Landing Group or Task Group 317.1, comprised [[3 Commando Brigade]], Royal Marines (including units attached from the [[British Army]]’s [[The Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and a number of units under the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] cap badge (The Blues and Royals)), under the command of Brigadier [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]] RM to bring it up to its wartime strength. Most of this force was aboard the hastily commandeered cruise liner [[SS Canberra|''Canberra'']].

A third was Submarine Group (TG 320.9) of three to four submarines under Flag Officer Submarines. The UK declared a 'total exclusion zone' of {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} around the Falkland Islands before commencing operations, excluding all nations' vessels.

Throughout the operation, 43 British [[merchant ship]]s (ships taken up from trade, or [[STUFT]]), served with or supplied the task force. Cargo vessels and [[tanker (ship)|tankers]] for fuel and water formed an {{convert|8000|mi|km|adj=on}} [[logistics]] chain between Britain and the South Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/25/newsid_2502000/2502995.stm | work=BBC News | title=1982: Dozens killed as Argentines hit British ships | date=25 May 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the journey and up to the war beginning on 1 May, the Task Force was shadowed by [[Boeing 707]] aircraft of the Argentine Air Force. One of these flights was intercepted outside the exclusion zone by a Sea Harrier, but the unarmed 707 was not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the British had not yet decided to commit themselves to war.

[[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], then [[Line of succession to the British throne|second in line to the British throne]], served as a [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter co-pilot for No.820 Naval Air Squadron on HMS ''Invincible'' during the war, flying antisubmarine and anti-surface patrols. His helicopter also acted as an improvised [[airborne early warning]] platform, helped in casualty evacuation, transport and [[search and rescue]].

The British called their counter-invasion [[Operation Corporate|Operation ''Corporate'']]. When the task force sailed from Britain, the American news magazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover headline proclaimed "[[headline|The Empire Strikes Back]]", which was the name of a recent [[The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'' film]], a humorous reference to the old [[British Empire]].

==Public opinion==
The public mood in the United Kingdom was to support an attempt to reclaim the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow University Media Group, 1985: p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; International opinion was divided. To some, Britain was a former [[colonialism|colonial]] power seeking to reclaim a lost colony from a local power, and this was a message that the Argentines initially used to garner support. Others supported Britain under the premise that it was a stable democracy invaded by a military dictatorship, along with the concept of the [[self-determination]] of the islanders, who wished to remain British. Whilst remaining diplomatically neutral, most European countries, members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], and the United States, supported Britain.

==The United Nations==
British diplomacy centred on arguing that the Falkland Islanders were entitled to use the [[United Nations]] (UN) principle of self-determination and on showing a willingness to compromise. The UN Secretary-General said that he was amazed at the compromise that the British had offered. Nevertheless, Argentina rejected it, the Junta being encouraged by massive popular support for the invasion at home and unable to backtrack; they based their arguments on rights to territory based on actions before 1945 and the creation of the UN.

Many UN members realised that if [[Land claims|territorial claims]] as old as this could be pursued by force, and invasions of territory allowed unchallenged, then their own [[border]]s were not safe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} On 3 April, the [[UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502|Resolution 502]], calling for the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the islands and the cessation of hostilities. On 10 April, the [[European Community]] approved [[trade sanctions]] against Argentina. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United States’ administration did not issue direct diplomatic condemnations, instead providing [[Military intelligence|intelligence support]] to the British armed forces.

==Shuttle diplomacy and US involvement==
At first glance, it appeared that the US had military [[treaty]] obligations to both parties in the war, bound to the UK as a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and to Argentina by the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (the "Rio Pact"). However, the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] only obliges the signatories to give support if the attack occurs in [[Europe]] or [[North America]] north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and the Rio Pact only obliges the US to intervene if one of the adherents to the treaty is attacked—the UK never attacked Argentina.

In March, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Alexander Haig]], directed the [[US Ambassador to Argentina]] [[Harry W. Shlaudeman]], to warn the Argentine government away from any invasion. President Reagan requested assurances from Galtieri against an invasion and offered the services of his Vice-President, [[George H.W. Bush]], as [[Mediation|mediator]], but was refused.

In fact, the [[Reagan Administration]] was sharply divided on the issue. Meeting on 5 April, Haig and Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs [[Lawrence Eagleburger]] favoured backing Britain, concerned that equivocation would undermine the NATO alliance. [[Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs]] [[Thomas O. Enders|Thomas Enders]], however, feared that supporting Britain would undermine US [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] efforts in [[Latin America]]. He received the firm backing of [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|UN Ambassador]] [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], Haig's nominal subordinate and political rival. Kirkpatrick was guest of honour at a dinner held by the Argentine ambassador to the United States, on the day that the Argentine armed forces landed on the islands.

The [[White House]] continued its [[Neutral country|neutrality]]; Reagan famously declared at the time that he could not understand why two allies were arguing over "that little ice-cold bunch of land down there". But he assented to Haig and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Caspar Weinberger's position. Haig briefly (8–30 April) headed a "shuttle diplomacy" mission between [[London]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. According to a BBC documentary titled "The Falklands War and the White House",&lt;ref name="bbc_doc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/documentary_archive/6591267.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Programmes - Documentary Archive - The Falklands and the White House|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caspar Weinberger's Department of Defense began a number of non-public actions to support and supply the British military while Haig's shuttle diplomacy was still ongoing. Haig's message to the Argentines was that the British would indeed fight, and that the US would support Britain, but at the time he was not aware that America was already providing support.

==The US officially comes down on the side of the British==

At the end of the month, Reagan blamed Argentina for the failure of the mediation, declared US support for Britain, and announced the imposition of [[economic sanctions]] against Argentina.

In a notorious episode in June, [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], cast a second [[veto]] of a Security Council resolution calling for an immediate [[cease-fire]], then announced minutes later that she had received instructions to [[abstain]]. The situation was blamed on a delay in communications but it was perceived by many to be part of an ongoing power struggle between Haig and Kirkpatrick.

Galtieri and a fair proportion of his government thought that the UK would not react. Margaret Thatcher declared that the democratic rights of the Falkland Islanders had been assaulted and would not surrender the islands to the Argentinian "[[jackboot]]". This stance was aided, at least domestically, by the mostly supportive British [[Mass media|press]].

[[File:Caspar Weinberger official photo.jpg|thumb|[[Caspar Weinberger]], [[United States Secretary of Defense]] between 1981 and 1987]]
The Argentine junta felt that the United States would, even in a worst-case scenario, remain completely neutral in the conflict (based upon the support that Argentina had given to the Reagan administration in [[Central America]], training [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]). This assumption demonstrated a clear blindness to the reality of the US-UK [[Special Relationship (US-UK)|special relationship]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

To some extent, the Argentine military junta was misled by its own opinion of democracies as being weak, inefficient talking-shops, afraid of taking risks. Indeed, in Britain there was much debate about the rights and wrongs of war. However, regardless of their own policies and opinions, opposition parties firmly backed the government during the crisis, in order to present a single united front.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

An American fear of the perceived threat of the [[Soviet Union]] and the spread of [[communism]], along with the certainty that Britain could handle the matter on its own, may have influenced the US to take a position of non-interference. During the Cold War, with the performance of forces being watched closely by the Soviet Union, it was considered preferable for the UK to handle without assistance a conflict within its capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

American non-interference was vital to the US-British relationship. [[Ascension Island]], a British possession, was vital to the long term supply of the Task Force South; however, the airbase stationed on it was run and operated by the US. The American commander of the base was ordered to assist the British in any way and for a brief period Ascension Air Field was one of the busiest airports in the world.

The most important NATO contributions were intelligence information and the rescheduled supply of the latest model of [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] [[all-aspect]] infra-red seeking missiles, which allowed existing British stocks to be employed.

Margaret Thatcher stated that "without the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Harrier]] jets and their immense manoeuvrability, equipped as they were with the latest version of the Sidewinder missile, supplied to us by US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, we could never have got back the Falklands." This is not only politically but militarily questionable, however, as all the Fleet Air Arm Sidewinder engagements proved to be from the rear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In early May, Caspar Weinberger offered the use of an American aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name="fn_2"&gt;D. George Boyce, The Falklands War, Palgrave MacMillan, (2005). page 92. Also see Richardson, L., When Allies Differ: Anglo-American relations during the Suez and Falklands Crises, London, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; This seemingly extremely generous offer was seen by some as vital: it was noted by Rear Admiral Woodward that the loss of ''Invincible'' would have been a severe setback, but the loss of ''Hermes'' would have meant an end to the whole operation. Weinberger admitted &lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;[http://webstorage3.mcpa.virginia.edu/poh/falklands/transcripts/falklands_2003_0515.pdf Ronald Reagan Oral History Project, Final Edited Transcript, The Falklands Roundtable, 15-16 May 2003, Washington D.C.]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that there would have been many problems if a request had ever been made; not least, it would have meant US personnel becoming directly involved in the conflict, as training British forces to crew the vessel would have taken years.

Both Weinberger and Reagan were later awarded the British honour of [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE)]]. American critics of the US role claimed that, by failing to side with Argentina, the US violated its own [[Monroe Doctrine]].

In September 2001, the [[President of Mexico]], [[Vicente Fox]], cited the conflict as proof of the failure of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance since the treaty provides for mutual defence. However, in this conflict, Argentina was the aggressor.

==Soviet non-involvement==
[[File:AntDotMap Livingston.png|thumb|300px|Location of the Soviet [[Bellingshausen Station]] in the [[South Shetlands]], relative to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and Argentina]]
In general, the Soviet Union stayed aloof from the situation. Both NATO member UK and the proactively [[anti-Communism|anti-Communist]] regime in Argentina at the time were enemies of the [[USSR]]. However, the Soviet Union did have several interests in the South Atlantic/Antarctic region.

[[Angola]] had recently become independent, in a war in which the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) received support from the Soviet Union and its allies,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/264094.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Obituary: Jonas Savimbi, Unita's local boy|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was considered a highly important [[Cold War]] conflict, especially in regard to the south Atlantic. In fact, the Falklands War occurred at a point when the Cold War had re-escalated, with the election of Ronald Reagan in the USA in the previous year, and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in full swing. According to Hugh Bicheno:

:The Argentines saw [Reagan's] lifting of Carter['s weapons] embargo as a victory for their hard-nosed line on Human Rights, but their obsessions led them to overrate their importance to US policy makers. ... they based their self-delusion on the war across the South Atlantic in Angola, where some 36,000 Cuban troops, acting as proxies for the Soviet Union, maintained an avowedly Marxist-Leninist government, in the face of two groups of insurgents backed respectively by South Africa and the USA. Soviet objectives were to gain preferential access to Angolan natural resources and to create a base from which their naval forces could threaten the western jugular ... whereas the view from Washington was that their bases at the British islands of Ascension in the Atlantic ... were more than sufficient, and that the US Navy could protect the sea lanes without additional shore facilities. The Cape Route was indeed a vital US geopolitical concern, but the Argentines failed to realise that they counted for less than a couple of little British islands in the equation.&lt;ref name="Bicheno, Hugh 2006"&gt;Bicheno, Hugh (2006) ''Razor's Edge: The Unofficial History of the Falklands War''. London. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|978-0-7538-2186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the USSR maintained a number of Antarctic bases, some not far from the area of conflict, such as [[Bellingshausen Station]] in the [[South Shetlands]], an area claimed by both Argentina and the UK. The USSR had just opened a new Antarctic base two years before — [[Russkaya Station]] — albeit on the other side of Antarctica. [[Warsaw Pact]] member [[Poland]] also operated the [[Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station|Henryk Arctowski base]] not far from Bellinghausen. In addition, the USSR had a number of fishing boats and "research vessels" in the region which were "multipurpose".

Hugh Bicheno continues that after Argentina, the UK and the USA:

:"There was a fourth party involved — the Soviet electronic intelligence ships that maintained constant surveillance of the [British] task force. US goodwill did not extend to giving the Soviets insight into NSA eavesdropping capability, or a windfall mass of encrypted traffic for their super-computers to play with."&lt;ref name="Bicheno, Hugh 2006"/&gt;

There was great Soviet interest in how good the UK battle capability was when thrown back on its own resources. Traditionally, the Soviet Union had portrayed the UK as a US satellite, incapable of operating on its own.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==European support==
The [[European Economic Community|European Community]], of which the United Kingdom is a member, fully supported the UK's position and opposed the invasion of the Falklands, the community also supported the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502|United Nations Resolution]] requesting that Argentina withdraw from the islands. When Argentina refused, the community announced sanctions against Argentina. Today, the present [[European Union]] recognises the UK's sovereignty as the only legitimate claim and this is recognised in the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], with [[Member States of the European Union|all member states]] (apart from [[Spain]] which is Neutral), individually recognising it.

===French involvement===
The [[President of France]], [[François Mitterrand]], gave full support to the UK in the Falklands war. Sir [[John Nott]], who was [[Secretary of State for Defence]] during the conflict, has acknowledged in his memoirs that "in so many ways Mitterrand and the French were our greatest allies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F03%2F13%2Fnot13.xml|title=News|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of Argentina's military equipment was French-made, so French support was crucial. Sir John has revealed that France provided [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] and [[Super Etendard|Etendard]] aircraft, identical to the ones that the country had supplied to Argentina, for British [[Aviator|pilots]] to train against. It is also disclosed in Sir John's memoirs that France provided intelligence to help fight the Exocet [[missile]]s that she had sold to Argentina, including details of special electronic countermeasures that at the time were only known to the French armed forces. In her memoirs, Margaret Thatcher says of Mitterrand that "I never forgot the debt we owed him for his personal support...throughout the Falklands Crisis". As France had recently sold Super Etendard aircraft and Exocet missiles to the Argentine Navy, there was still a French team in Argentina helping to fit out the Exocets and aircraft for Argentine use at the beginning of the war. Argentina claims that the team left for France soon after the 2 April invasion, but according to
Dr. [[James Corum]], the French team apparently continued to assist the Argentines throughout the war in spite of the NATO embargo and official French government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/fal02/corum.html|title=Argentine Airpower in the Falklands War: An Operational View|work=af.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin American involvement==
Argentina received military assistance only from Peru — despite receiving cursory support from the [[Organisation of American States]] in a [http://www.oas.org/consejo/sp/RC/Actas/Acta%2020.pdf resolution] supporting Argentina's sovereignty and deploring European Community sanctions (with Chile, [[Foreign relations of Colombia|Colombia]], [[Foreign relations of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad &amp; Tobago]], and the United States attending but abstaining), and [[president of Peru|Peruvian president]] [[Belaunde]] announced that his country was "ready to support Argentina with all the resources it needed." This came in the form of aircraft supplies, such as long range air fuel (drop) tanks and spare parts.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Military of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[Military of Bolivia|Bolivia]] offered ground troops, but their offers were seen as political [[propaganda|posturing]] and not accepted. At this point in time, Cuba was also heavily involved in the war in Angola across the South Atlantic, and had 36,000 troops there.&lt;ref name="Bicheno, Hugh 2006"/&gt;

K.J. Holsti presents a different sight of the South American dilemma:&lt;ref&gt;K.J.Holsti, ''The state, the war, and the state of war'', University of Cambridge Press, {{ISBN|0-521-57790-X}} (pbk), first published 1996, page176:&lt;/ref&gt; "While South American governments (except Chile and Colombia) publicly supported Argentina in its conflict with Great Britain, in private many governments were pleased with the outcome of the war. Argentina's bellicosity against Chile over the Beagle Channel problem ... [its] foreign intervention ([in] Bolivia and Nicaragua) ... and [its] propounded geopolitical doctrines that were seen in other countries as threatening to them."

===Chilean involvement===
{{see also|Beagle conflict}}
Neighbouring Chile, under [[Augusto Pinochet|General Pinochet]]'s regime, became one of the major Latin American countries (the other being Colombia), to support Britain (and then only indirectly) by providing a military and naval diversion. In 1978 Argentina initiated [[Operation Soberania|Operation ''Soberania'']] in order to invade the islands around [[Cape Horn]], but stopped the operation a few hours later for military and political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See Alejandro Luis Corbacho in http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016843 ''"Predicting the probability of war during brinkmanship crisis: The Beagle and the Malvinas conflicts"''] about the reasons of the call off that (p.45): ''The newspaper [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] explained some years later that such caution was based, in part, on military concerns. In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.'' and in cite 46: ''According to Clarín, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalisation of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decision makers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine government planned to seize the disputed Beagle Channel islands after the occupation of the Falklands. Basilio Lami Dozo disclosed that Leopoldo Galtieri announced to him that ''"[Chile] have to know that what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.''&lt;ref name="perfil-22.11.2009"/&gt; Also [[Óscar Camilión]], the last Argentine Foreign Minister before the war (29. March 1981 to 11. December 1981) stated that ''"The military planning was, after the solution of the Falklands case, to invade the disputed islands in the Beagle. That was the determination of the Argentine Navy"''&lt;ref&gt;Óscar Camilión, „Memorias Políticas", Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281:''„Los planes militares eran, en la hipótesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle. Esa era la decisión de la Armada&amp;nbsp;...“''&lt;/ref&gt;

Such preparations were made public. On 2 June 1982 an article was published in the Buenos Aires newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' concerning Manfred Schönfeld's answer to the question as to what to do after the expected Argentine victory in the Falklands : ''"The war will not be finished for us, because after the defeat of our enemies in the Falklands, they must be blown away from [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands]], and all Argentine Austral archipelagos."''&lt;ref&gt;Spanish original from „La Guerra Austral":
:''"Para nosotros no lo estará [terminada la guerra], porque, inmediatamente después de barrido el enemigo de las Malvinas, debe serlo de las Georgias, Sandwich del Sur y de todos los demás archipiélagos australes argentinos,"''
All articles of Manfred Schönfeld published by „La Prensa" from 10. January 1982 to 2. August 1982, are compiled in ''„La Guerra Austral“'', Manfred Schönfeld, Desafío Editores S.A., 1982, {{ISBN|950-02-0500-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This intention was probably known by the Chilean government&lt;ref name="elpais-11.04.1982"/&gt; that provided the United Kingdom with 'limited, but significant information'.

In her book ''Statecraft'', Margaret Thatcher claims that General Pinochet gave Britain "vital" support during the war, most notably in intelligence, which saved British lives. Thatcher claims that the [[Chilean Air Force]] often provided Britain with early warning of impending [[Argentine Air Force]] attacks. When, at one point, the Chilean long-range radar was switched off for 24 hours for maintenance work, the Argentinian Air Force was able to bomb the Royal Navy ships ''[[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|Sir Galahad]]'' and ''[[RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)|Sir Tristram]]'', causing many casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Thatcher, ''Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World'' (HarperCollins, 2002), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.spyflight.co.uk/chile.htm ''Chilean Connection''] is described in detail by Sir Lawrence Freedman in his book ''The Official History of the Falklands Campaign''.

===Colombian support===
Although retaining positive relations with Argentina, Colombia sided with the United Kingdom. At the Organisation of American States' [http://www.oas.org/consejo/sp/RC/Actas/Acta%2020.pdf resolution] supporting Argentina's claim, it cast an abstaining vote, along with fellow American countries Chile, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States.

==Commonwealth support==
The [[Commonwealth of Nations]], closely linked to the United Kingdom (which is also a member) condemned the Invasion of the Falklands and publicly supported the UK, which they recognised as the rightful owner of the islands. Of the Commonwealth nations, [[New Zealand]] made available the frigates [[HMNZS Canterbury (F-421)|HMNZS Canterbury]] and [[HMNZS Waikato (F-55)|HMNZS Waikato]] as replacements for British ships in the [[Indian Ocean]], freeing British vessels for deployment to the Falklands. In addition, New Zealand and [[South Africa]] severed diplomatic relations with Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;See Lieutenant Colonel Luis Andarcia in http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA157369 ''"Falklands War: Strategic, Intelligence and Diplomatic Failures"''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] and New Zealand imposed economic sanctions against Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Falklands War: Britain Versus the Past in the South Atlantic|page=92|author=Daniel K.

[[File:Galley-knightshospitaller.jpg|thumb|250px|A model of a Maltese design typical of the 16th century, the last great era of the war galley]] A '''galley''' is a type of ship that is propelled mainly by [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]]. The galley is characterized by its long, slender hull, shallow [[draft (hull)|draft]] and low freeboard (clearance between sea and railing). Virtually all types of galleys had sails that could be used in favorable winds, but human strength was always the primary method of propulsion. This allowed galleys to navigate independently of winds and currents. The galley originated among the seafaring civilizations around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the late second millennium BC and remained in use in various forms until the early 19th century in [[naval warfare|warfare]], [[trade]] and [[piracy]].

Galleys were the warships used by the early Mediterranean naval powers, including the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. They remained the dominant types of vessels used for war and piracy in the Mediterranean Sea until the last decades of the 16th century. As warships, galleys carried various types of weapons throughout their long existence, including [[naval ram|rams]], [[catapult]]s and [[cannon]]s, but also relied on their large crews to overpower enemy vessels in boarding actions. They were the first ships to effectively use heavy [[cannon]]s as anti-ship weapons. As highly efficient gun platforms they forced changes in the design of medieval seaside fortresses as well as refinement of sailing warships.

The zenith of galley usage in warfare came in the late 16th century with battles like that at [[battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] in 1571, one of the largest naval battles ever fought. By the 17th century, however, sailing ships and hybrid ships like the [[xebec]] displaced galleys in naval warfare. They were the most common warships in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] during the Middle Ages, and later saw limited use in the [[Caribbean]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the [[early modern period]], mostly as patrol craft to combat [[pirate]]s. From the mid-16th century galleys were in intermittent use in the [[Baltic Sea]], with its short distances and extensive [[archipelago]]es. There was a minor revival of galley warfare in the 18th century in the wars among [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]].

==Definition and terminology==
The term "galley" derives from the [[medieval Greek]] ''galea'', a smaller version of the [[dromon]], the prime warship of the [[Byzantine navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;86–87; Anderson (1962), pp.&amp;nbsp;37–39&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the Greek word is unclear but could possibly be related to ''galeos'', [[dogfish shark]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell &amp; Robert Scott [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgaleo%2Fs Galeos], ''A Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; The word "galley" has been attested in English from c. 1300&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989), "galley"&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used in most European languages from around 1500 both as a general term for oared warships, and from the Middle Ages and onwards more specifically for the Mediterranean-style vessel.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'', "''[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/82/88.html galeja]''" or "''[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/82/205.html galär ]''" and ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'', "[http://www.wnt.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=MNW&amp;id=10095&amp;lemmodern=galei galeye]"&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only from the 16th century that a unified galley concept came in use. Before that, particularly in antiquity, there was a wide variety of terms used for different types of galleys. In modern historical literature, "galley" is occasionally used as a general term for various types of oared vessels larger than boats, though the "true" galley is defined as the ships belonging to the Mediterranean tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1962), pp. 1, 42; Lehmann (1984), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Charles Galley-Willem van de Velde the Younger-2.jpg|thumb|left|The English-built ''[[Charles Galley]]'', a "galley frigate" built in the 1670s. It was not a "true" galley, but the term still became part of its name due to its oars.]]
Ancient galleys were named according to the number of oars, the number of banks of oars or lines of rowers. The terms are based on contemporary language use combined with more recent compounds of Greek and Latin words. The earliest Greek single-banked galleys are called [[triaconter]]s (from ''triakontoroi'', "thirty-oars") and [[penteconter]]s (''pentēkontoroi'', "fifty-oars").&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1971), pp. 53—56&lt;/ref&gt; For later galleys with more than one row of oars, the terminology is based on Latin numerals with the [[suffix]] ''-reme'' from ''rēmus'', "oar". A ''monoreme'' has one bank of oars, a ''[[bireme]]'' two and a ''[[trireme]]'' three. Since the maximum banks of oars was three, any expansion above that did not refer to additional banks of oars, but of additional rowers for every oar. ''Quinquereme'' (''quintus'' + ''rēmus'') was literally a "five-oar", but actually meant that there were several rowers to certain banks of oars which made up five lines of oar handlers. For simplicity, they have by many modern scholars been referred to as "fives", "sixes", "eights", "elevens", etc. Anything above six or seven rows of rowers was not common, though even a very exceptional "[[tessarakonteres|forty]]" is attested in contemporary source. Any galley with more than three or four lines of rowers is often referred to as a "polyreme".&lt;ref&gt;Murray (2012), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist [[Lionel Casson]] has used the term "galley" to describe all North European shipping in the early and high Middle Ages, including [[Viking]] merchants and even their famous [[longship]]s, though this is rare.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Oared military vessels built on the British Isles in the 11th to 13th centuries were based on Scandinavian designs, but were nevertheless referred to as "galleys". Many of them were similar to [[birlinn]]s, close relatives of longship types like the ''[[longship#snekkja|snekkja]]''. By the 14th century, they were replaced with [[balinger]]s in southern Britain while longship-type "[[Irish galley]]s" remained in use throughout the Middle Ages in northern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1997), pp. 66—68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valcour canadianarchive c013202k.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of United States ships at the [[battle of Valcour Island]], depicting several "[[row galley]]s"; similar function, but based on very different designs than Mediterranean galleys.]]
Medieval and early modern galleys used a different terminology than their ancient predecessors. Names were based on the changing designs that evolved after the ancient rowing schemes were forgotten. Among the most important is the Byzantine [[dromon]], the predecessor to the Italian ''galea sottila''. This was the first step toward the final form of the Mediterranean war galley. As galleys became an integral part of an advanced, early modern system of warfare and state administration, they were divided into a number of ranked grades based on the size of the vessel and the number of its crew. The most basic types were the following: large commander "lantern galleys", half-galleys, [[galiot]]s, [[fusta]]s, [[brigantine]]s and ''[[frigate#Origins|fregatas]]''. Naval historian [[Jan Glete]] has described as a sort of predecessor of the later [[rating system of the Royal Navy]] and other sailing fleets in Northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Glete 1993 81"&gt;Glete (1993), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French navy]] and the British [[Royal Navy]] built a series of "galley frigates" from c. 1670–1690 that were small two-decked sailing cruisers with a set of oarports on the lower deck. The three British galley frigates also had distinctive names - [[HMS James Galley (1676)|''James Galley'']], [[HMS Charles Galley (1676)|''Charles Galley'']] and [[HMS Mary Galley (1687)|''Mary Galley'']].&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (2009), pp. 116—118&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, the term "galley" was in some contexts used to describe minor oared gun-armed vessels which did not fit into the category of the classic Mediterranean type. In North America, during [[American Revolutionary War]], and other wars with France and Britain, the early [[US Navy]] and other navies built vessels that were called "galleys" or "[[row galley]]s", though they were actually [[brigantine]]s or Baltic [[gunboat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heinz Marquardt, "The Fore and Aft Rigged Warship" in Gardiner &amp; Lavery (1992), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; This type of description was more a characterization of their military role, and was in part due to technicalities in administration and naval financing.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney (1969), p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Among the earliest known watercraft were [[canoe]]s made from hollowed-out logs, the earliest ancestors of galleys. Their narrow hulls required them to be [[paddle]]d in a fixed sitting position facing forwards, a less efficient form of propulsion than rowing with proper [[oar]]s, facing backwards. Seagoing paddled craft have been attested by finds of terracotta sculptures and lead models in the region of the [[Aegean Sea]] from the 3rd millennium BC. However, archaeologists believe that the [[Stone Age]] colonization of islands in the Mediterranean around 8,000 BC required fairly large, seaworthy vessels that were paddled and possibly even equipped with sails.&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmann (1995), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first evidence of more complex craft that are considered to prototypes for later galleys comes from [[Ancient Egypt]] during the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2700–2200 BC). Under the rule of pharaoh [[Pepi I]] (2332–2283 BC) these vessels were used to transport troops to raid settlements along the [[Levant]]ine coast and to ship back slaves and timber.&lt;ref name="Wachsmann 1995, p. 11-12"&gt;Wachsmann (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;11–12&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Hatshepsut]] (c. 1479–57 BC), Egyptian galleys traded in luxuries on the [[Red Sea]] with the enigmatic [[Land of Punt]], as recorded on wall paintings at the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]].&lt;ref name="Wachsmann 1995, pp. 21-23"&gt;Wachsmann (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AssyrianWarship.jpg|thumb|left|[[Assyria]]n warship, a [[bireme]] with pointed bow. 700 BC]]
Shipbuilders, probably [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]], a seafaring people who lived on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, were the first to create the two-level galley that would be widely known under its Greek name, ''diērēs'', or [[bireme]].&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;57–58&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the [[Phoenicians]] were among the most important naval civilizations in early [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], little detailed evidence have been found concerning the types of ships they used. The best depictions found so far have been small, highly stylized images on seals which depict crescent-shape vessels equipped with one mast and banks of oars. Colorful frescoes on the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] settlement on [[Santorini]] (c. 1600 BC) show more detailed pictures of vessels with ceremonial tents on deck in a procession. Some of these are rowed, but others are paddled with men laboriously bent over the railings. This has been interpreted as a possible ritual reenactment of more ancient types of vessels, alluding to a time before rowing was invented, but little is otherwise known about the use and design of Minoan ships.&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmann (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;13–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest days of the galley, there was no clear distinction between ships of trade and war other than their actual usage. River boats plied the waterways of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2700–2200 BC) and seagoing galley-like vessels were recorded bringing back luxuries from across the Red Sea in the reign of pharaoh Hatshepsut. Fitting rams to the bows of vessels sometime around the 8th century BC resulted in a distinct split in the design of warships, and set trade vessels apart, at least when it came to use in naval warfare. The Phoenicians used galleys for transports that were less elongated, carried fewer oars and relied more on sails. Carthaginian galley wrecks found off Sicily that date to the 3rd or 2nd century BC had a length to breadth ratio of 6:1, proportions that fell between the 4:1 of sailing merchant ships and the 8:1 or 10:1 of war galleys. Merchant galleys in the ancient Mediterranean were intended as carriers of valuable cargo or perishable goods that needed to be moved as safely and quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;117–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Greek galleys appeared around the second half of the 2nd millennium BC. In the epic poem, the ''[[Iliad]]'', set in the 12th century BC, galleys with a single row of oarsmen were used primarily to transport soldiers to and from various land battles.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov (2000), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded naval battle, the [[battle of the Delta]] between Egyptian forces under [[Ramesses III]] and the enigmatic alliance known as the [[Sea Peoples]], occurred as early as 1175 BC. It is the first known engagement between organized armed forces, using sea vessels as weapons of war, though primarily as fighting platforms. It was distinguished by being fought against an anchored fleet close to shore with land-based archer support.&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmann (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;28–34&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true Mediterranean galleys usually had between 15 and 25 pairs of oars and were called [[triaconter]]s or [[penteconter (ship)|penteconter]]s, literally "thirty-" and "fifty-oared", respectively. Not long after they appeared, a third row of oars was added by the addition to a bireme of an [[outrigger]], a projecting construction that gave more room for the projecting oars. These new galleys were called ''triērēs'' ("three-fitted") in Greek. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later called this design the ''triremis'', [[trireme]], the name it is today best known under. It has been hypothesized that early types of triremes existed as early as 700 BC, but the earliest conclusive literary reference dates to 542 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–35&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of triremes, penteconters disappeared altogether. Triaconters were still used, but only for scouting and express dispatches.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1991), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first warships===
[[File:Greek Galleys.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of an ancient Greek galley squadron based on images of modern replica ''[[Olympias (trireme)|Olympias]]'']]
The earliest use for galleys in warfare was to ferry fighters from one place to another, and until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC had no real distinction from merchant freighters. Around the 14th century BC, the first dedicated fighting ships were developed, sleeker and with cleaner lines than the bulkier merchants. They were used for raiding, capturing merchants and for dispatches.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1991), pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; During this early period, raiding became the most important form of organized violence in the Mediterranean region. Maritime classicist historian [[Lionel Casson]] used the example of [[Homer]]'s works to show that seaborne raiding was considered a common and legitimate occupation among ancient maritime peoples. The later [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] historian [[Thucydides]] described it as having been "without stigma" before his time.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1991), pp. 44–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[naval ram|ram]] sometime before the 8th century BC changed the nature of naval warfare, which had until then been a matter of boarding and hand-to-hand fighting. With a heavy projection at the foot of the [[bow (ship)|bow]], sheathed with metal, usually [[bronze]], a ship could incapacitate an enemy ship by punching a hole in its planking. The relative speed and nimbleness of ships became important, since a slower ship could be outmaneuvered and disabled by a faster one. The earliest designs had only one row of rowers that sat in undecked hulls, rowing against [[thole]]s, or oarports, that were placed directly along the railings. The practical upper limit for wooden constructions fast and maneuverable enough for warfare was around 25-30 oars per side. By adding another level of oars, a development that occurred no later than c. 750 BC, the galley could be made shorter with as many rowers, while making them strong enough to be effective ramming weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov, (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of more advanced states and intensified competition between them spurred on the development of advanced galleys with multiple banks of rowers. During the middle of the first millennium BC, the Mediterranean powers developed successively larger and more complex vessels, the most advanced being the classical [[trireme]] with up to 170 rowers. Triremes fought several important engagements in the naval battles of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (502–449 BC) and the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431-404 BC), including the [[battle of Aegospotami]] in 405 BC, which sealed the defeat of [[Athenian Empire|Athens]] by [[Sparta]] and its allies. The trireme was an advanced ship that was expensive to build and to maintain due its large crew. By the 5th century, advanced war galleys had been developed that required sizable states with an advanced economy to build and maintain. It was associated with the latest in warship technology around the 4th century BC and could only be employed by an advanced state with an advanced economy and administration. They required considerable skill to row and oarsmen were mostly free citizens who had years of experience at the oar.&lt;ref name="Morrison, Coates 2000 pp. 38-41"&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;38–41&lt;/ref&gt;

As civilizations around the Mediterranean grew in size and complexity, both their navies and the galleys that made up their numbers became successively larger. The basic design of two or three rows of oars remained the same, but more rowers were added to each oar. The exact reasons are not known, but are believed to have been caused by addition of more troops and the use of more advanced ranged weapons on ships, such as [[catapult]]s. The size of the new naval forces also made it difficult to find enough skilled rowers for the one-man-per-oar system of the earliest [[trireme]]s. With more than one man per oar, a single rower could set the pace for the others to follow, meaning that more unskilled rowers could be employed.&lt;ref name="Morrison, Coates 2000 pp. 48-49"&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

The successor states of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire built galleys that were like triremes or biremes in oar layout, but manned with additional rowers for each oar. The ruler [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] (ca. 432–367 BC) is credited with pioneering the "five" and "six", meaning five or six rows of rowers plying two or three rows of oars. [[Ptolemy II]] (283-46 BC) is known to have built a large fleet of very large galleys with several experimental designs rowed by everything from 12 up to 40 rows of rowers, though most of these are considered to have been quite impractical. Fleets with large galleys were put in action in conflicts such as the [[Punic Wars]] (246-146) between the [[Roman republic]] and [[Carthage]], which included massive naval battles with hundreds of vessels and tens of thousands of soldiers, seamen and rowers.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the surviving documentary evidence comes from Greek and Roman shipping, though it is likely that merchant galleys all over the Mediterranean were highly similar. In Greek they were referred to as ''histiokopos'' ("sail-oar-er") to reflect that they relied on both types of propulsion. In Latin they were called ''actuaria (navis)'' ("ship that moves") in Latin, stressing that they were capable of making progress regardless of weather conditions. As an example of the speed and reliability, during an instance of the famous "[[Carthago delenda est]]"-speech, [[Cato the Elder]] demonstrated the close proximity of the Roman arch enemy Carthage by displaying a fresh fig to his audience that he claimed had been picked in North Africa only three days past. Other cargoes carried by galleys were honey, cheese, meat and live animals intended for [[gladiator]] combat. The Romans had several types of merchant galleys that specialized in various tasks, out of which the ''actuaria'' with up to 50 rowers was the most versatile, including the ''phaselus'' (lit. "bean pod") for passenger transport and the ''lembus'', a small-scale express carrier. Many of these designs continued to be used until the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;119–23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Imperial era===
[[File:058 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel LVIII.jpg|thumb|left|Depictions of two compact liburnians used by the Romans in their [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|campaigns against the Dacians]] in the early 2nd century AD; reliefs from [[Trajan's Column]], c. 113 AD.]]
The [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC between the forces of [[Augustus]] and [[Mark Antony]] marked the peak of the Roman fleet arm. After Augustus' victory at Actium, most of the Roman fleet was dismantled and burned. The [[Roman civil wars]] were fought mostly by land forces, and from the 160s until the 4th century AD, no major fleet actions were recorded. During this time, most of the galley crews were disbanded or employed for entertainment purposes in [[naumachia|mock battles]] or in handling the sail-like sun-screens in the larger Roman arenas. What fleets remained were treated as auxiliaries of the land forces, and galley crewmen themselves called themselves ''milites'', "soldiers", rather than ''nautae'', "sailors".&lt;ref&gt;Rankov (1995), pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman galley fleets were turned into provincial patrol forces that were smaller and relied largely on ''[[liburna|liburnians]]'', compact biremes with 25 pairs of oars. These were named after an [[Liburnian|Illyrian tribe]] known by Romans for their sea roving practices, and these smaller craft were based on, or inspired by, their vessels of choice. The liburnians and other small galleys patrolled the rivers of continental Europe and reached as far as the Baltic, where they were used to fight local uprisings and assist in checking foreign invasions. The Romans maintained numerous bases around the empire: along the rivers of Central Europe, chains of forts along the northern European coasts and the British Isles, Mesopotamia and North Africa, including [[Trabzon]], Vienna, Belgrade, Dover, [[Seleucia]] and [[Alexandria]]. Few actual galley battles in the provinces are found in records. One action in 70 AD at the unspecified location of the "Island of the Batavians" during the [[Batavian Rebellion]] was recorded, and included a trireme as the Roman flagship.&lt;ref&gt;Rankov (1995), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The last provincial fleet, the ''classis Britannica'', was reduced by the late 200s, though there was a minor upswing under the rule of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (272–337). His rule also saw the last major naval battle of the unified Roman Empire (before the permanent split into Western and Eastern [later "Byzantine"] Empires), the [[battle of Hellespont]] of 324. Some time after Hellespont, the classical trireme fell out of use, and its design was forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Rankov (1995), pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
A transition from galley to sailing vessels as the most common types of warships began in the [[high Middle Ages]] (c. 11th century). Large high-sided sailing ships had always been formidable obstacles for galleys. To low-freeboard oared vessels, the bulkier sailing ships,  the [[cog (ship)|cog]] and the [[carrack]], were almost like floating fortresses, being difficult to board and even harder to capture. Galleys remained useful as warships throughout the entire Middle Ages because of their maneuverability. Sailing ships of the time had only one mast, usually with just a single, large square sail. This made them cumbersome to steer and it was virtually impossible to sail into the wind direction. Galleys therefore were still the only ship type capable of coastal raiding and amphibious landings, both key elements of medieval warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Mediterranean====
In the eastern Mediterranean, the [[Byzantine Empire]] struggled with the incursion from invading Muslim Arabs from the 7th century, leading to fierce competition, a buildup of fleet, and war galleys of increasing size. Soon after conquering Egypt and the Levant, the Arab rulers built ships highly similar to Byzantine [[dromon]]s with the help of local [[Copt]]ic shipwrights from former Byzantine naval bases.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, the struggle between the Byzantines and Arabs had turned the Eastern Mediterranean into a no man's land for merchant activity. In the 820s [[Crete]] was captured by Andalusian Muslims displaced by a failed revolt against the [[Emirate of Cordoba]], turning the island into a base for (galley) attacks on Christian shipping until the island was recaptured by the Byzantines in 960.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Mediterranean====
In the western Mediterranean and Atlantic, the division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the late 9th century brought on a period of instability, meaning increased piracy and raiding in the Mediterranean, particularly by newly arrived Muslim invaders. The situation was worsened by raiding Scandinavian [[Viking]]s who used [[longship]]s, vessels that in many ways were very close to galleys in design and functionality and also employed similar tactics. To counter the threat, local rulers began to build large oared vessels, some with up to 30 pairs of oars, that were larger, faster and with higher sides than Viking ships.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavian expansion, including incursions into the Mediterranean and attacks on both Muslim Iberia and even Constantinople itself, subsided by the mid-11th century. By this time, greater stability in merchant traffic was achieved by the emergence of Christian kingdoms such as those of France, Hungary and Poland. Around the same time, Italian port towns and city states, like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], rose on the fringes of the Byzantine Empire as it struggled with eastern threats.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

After the advent of Islam and [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th and 8th century, the old Mediterranean economy collapsed and the volume of trade went down drastically.&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, ''Mohammed and Charlemagne''; the thesis appears in chapters 1–2 of ''Medieval Cities'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]], neglected to revive overland trade routes but was dependent on keeping the sea lanes open to keep the empire together. Bulk trade fell around 600-750 while the luxury trade increased. Galleys remained in service, but were profitable mainly in the luxury trade, which set off their high maintenance cost.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), pp. 40, 47&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century, there was a sharp increase in piracy which resulted in larger ships with more numerous crews. These were mostly built by the growing city-states of Italy which were emerging as the dominant sea powers, including [[Venetian Republic|Venice]], [[Genoa]] and [[Pisa]]. Inheriting the Byzantine ship designs, the new merchant galleys were similar [[dromon]]s, but without any heavy weapons and both faster and wider. They could be manned by crews of up to 1,000 men and were employed in both trade and warfare. A further boost to the development of the large merchant galleys was the upswing in Western European pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), p.&amp;nbsp;102–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Konrad von Grünenberg - Beschreibung der Reise von Konstanz nach Jerusalem - Blatt 05v-06r.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] great galley with three sails taking [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Jerusalem ([[Conrad Grünenberg]] 1486/7).]]
In Northern Europe, [[Viking longship]]s and their derivations, [[knarr]]s, dominated trading and shipping, though developed separately from the Mediterranean galley tradition. 
In the South galleys continued to be useful for trade even as sailing vessels evolved more efficient hulls and rigging; since they could hug the shoreline and make steady progress when winds failed, they were highly reliable. The zenith in the design of merchant galleys came with the state-owned ''great galleys'' of the [[Venetian Republic]], first built in the 1290s. These were used to carry the lucrative trade in luxuries from the east such as spices, silks and gems. They were in all respects larger than contemporary war galleys (up to 46&amp;nbsp;m) and had a deeper draft, with more room for cargo (140-250 t). With a full complement of rowers ranging from 150 to 180 men, all available to defend the ship from attack, they were also very safe modes of travel. This attracted a business of carrying affluent pilgrims to the Holy Land, a trip that could be accomplished in as little 29 days on the route Venice-[[Jaffa]], despite landfalls for rest and watering or for respite from rough weather.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;123–126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the true galley===
[[Late Middle Ages|Late medieval]] maritime warfare was divided in two distinct regions. In the Mediterranean galleys were used for raiding along coasts, and in the constant fighting for naval bases. In the Atlantic and Baltic there was greater focus on sailing ships that were used mostly for troop transport, with galleys providing fighting support.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2000), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Galleys were still widely used in the north and were the most numerous warships used by Mediterranean powers with interests in the north, especially the French and Iberian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Mott (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;105–6&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th and 14th century, the galley evolved into the design that was to remain essentially the same until it was phased out in the early 19th century. The new type descended from the ships used by Byzantine and Muslim fleets in the early Middle Ages. These were the mainstay of all Christian powers until the 14th century, including the great maritime republics of Genoa and Venice, the Papacy, the Hospitallers, Aragon and Castile, as well as by various [[pirate]]s and [[Privateer|corsairs]]. The overall term used for these types of vessels was ''gallee sottili'' ("slender galleys"). The later [[Ottoman navy]] used similar designs, but they were generally faster under sail, and smaller, but slower under oars.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;64–69&lt;/ref&gt; Galley designs were intended solely for close action with hand-held weapons and projectile weapons like bows and crossbows. In the 13th century the Iberian Crown of [[Aragon]] built several fleet of galleys with high castles, manned with Catalan crossbowman, and regularly defeated numerically superior [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;Mott (2003), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first half of the 14th century the Venetian ''galere da mercato''  ("merchantman galleys") were being built in the shipyards of the state-run [[Venetian Arsenal|Arsenal]] as "a combination of state enterprise and private association, the latter being a kind of consortium of export merchants", as Fernand Braudel described them.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, ''The Perspective of the World'', vol. III of ''Civilization and Capitalism'' (1979) 1984:126&lt;/ref&gt; The ships sailed in convoy, defended by archers and slingsmen (''ballestieri'') aboard, and later carrying cannons. In [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], the other major maritime power of the time, galleys and ships in general were more produced by smaller private ventures.

[[File:Michael of Rhodes-galley of flanders.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of a 15th-century trade galley from a manuscript by [[Michael of Rhodes]] (1401–1445) written in 1434.]]
In the 14th and 15th centuries merchant galleys traded high-value goods and carried passengers. Major routes in the time of the early Crusades carried the pilgrim traffic to the Holy Land. Later routes linked ports around the Mediterranean, between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea (a grain trade soon squeezed off by the Turkish capture of Constantinople, 1453) and between the Mediterranean and [[Bruges]]— where the first Genoese galley arrived at Sluys in 1277, the first Venetian ''galere'' in 1314— and [[Southampton]]. Although primarily sailing vessels, they used oars to enter and leave many trading ports of call, the most effective way of entering and leaving the [[Lagoon of Venice]]. The Venetian ''galera'', beginning at 100 tons and built as large as 300, was not the largest merchantman of its day, when the Genoese [[carrack]] of the 15th century might exceed 1000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Fernand Braudel, ''The Mediterranean in the Age of Philip II'' I, 302.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1447, for instance, Florentine galleys planned to call at 14 ports on their way to and from Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1992), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of oars enabled these ships to navigate close to the shore where they could exploit land and sea breezes and coastal currents, to work reliable and comparatively fast passages against the prevailing wind. The large crews also provided protection against piracy. These ships were very seaworthy; a Florentine great galley left Southampton on 23 February 1430 and returned to its port at Pisa in 32 days. They were so safe that merchandise was often not insured.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; These ships increased in size during this period, and were the template from which the [[galleass]] developed.

===Transition to sailing ships===
As early as 1304 the type of ship required by the Danish defence organization changed from galley to [[cog (ship)|cog]], a flat-bottomed sailing ship.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 15th century, sailing ships began to dominate naval warfare in northern waters. While the galley still remained the primary warship in southern waters, a similar transition had begun also among the Mediterranean powers. A [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] naval raid on the island of [[Jersey]] in 1405 became the first recorded battle where a Mediterranean power employed a naval force consisting mostly of cogs or [[Carrack|nefs]], rather than the oared-powered galleys. The [[battle of Gibraltar (1476)|battle of Gibraltar]] between Castile and Portugal in 1476 was another important sign of change; it was the first recorded battle where the primary combatants were full-rigged ships armed with wrought-iron guns on the upper decks and in the waists, foretelling of the slow decline of the war galley.&lt;ref&gt;Mott (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;109–111&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from the Mediterranean war galley to the sailing vessel as the preferred method of vessel in the Mediterranean is tied directly to technological developments and the inherent handling characteristics of each vessel types. The primary factors were changing sail design, the introduction of cannons aboard vessels, and the handling characteristics of the vessels.

The sailing vessel was always at the mercy of the wind for propulsion, and those that did carry oars were placed at a disadvantage because they were not optimized for oar use. The galley did have disadvantages compared to the sailing vessel though. Their smaller hulls were not able to hold as much cargo and this limited their range as the crews were required to replenish food stuffs more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Hattendorf and Unger (2003) pp, 70&lt;/ref&gt; The low freeboard of the galley meant that in close action with a sailing vessel, the sailing vessel would usually maintain a height advantage. The sailing vessel could also fight more effectively farther out at sea and in rougher wind conditions because of the height of their freeboard.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2000) pp 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Under sail, an oared warship was placed at much greater risk as a result of the piercings for the oars which were required to be near the waterline and would allow water to ingress into the galley if the vessel heeled too far to one side. These advantages and disadvantages led the galley to be and remain a primarily coastal vessel. The shift to sailing vessels in the Mediterranean was the result of the negation of some of the galley's advantages as well as the adoption of gunpowder weapons on a much larger institutional scale. The sailing vessel was propelled in a different manner than the galley but the tactics were often the same until the 16th century. The real-estate afforded to the sailing vessel to place larger cannons and other armament mattered little because early gunpowder weapons had limited range and were expensive to produce. The eventual creation of cast iron cannons allowed vessels and armies to be outfitted much more cheaply. The cost of gunpowder also fell in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Glete, (2000) pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The armament of both vessel types varied between larger weapons such as bombards and the smaller swivel guns. For logistical purposes it became convenient for those with larger shore establishments to standardize upon a given size of cannon. Traditionally the English in the North and the Venetians in the Mediterranean are seen as some the earliest to move in this direction. The improving sail rigs of northern vessels also allowed them to navigate in the coastal waters of the Mediterranean to a much larger degree than before.&lt;ref&gt;Glete, (2000) pp. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from warships the decrease in the cost of gunpowder weapons also led to the arming of merchants. The larger vessels of the north continued to mature while the galley retained its defining characteristics. Attempts were made to stave this off such as the addition of fighting castles in the bow, but such additions to counter the threats brought by larger sailing vessels often offset the advantages of galley.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974) pp. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of guns===
[[File:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Battle of Haarlemmermeer.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of the [[battle of Haarlemmermeer]] of 1573 by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]]. Note the use of small sailing vessels and galleys on both sides.]]
From around 1450, three major naval powers established a dominance over different parts of the Mediterranean using galleys as their primary weapons at sea: the [[Ottomans]] in the east, Venice in the center and [[Habsburg Spain]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (1993), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The core of their fleets were concentrated in the three major, wholly dependable naval bases in the Mediterranean: [[Constantinople]], [[Venice]] and [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Naval warfare in the 16th century Mediterranean was fought mostly on a smaller scale, with raiding and minor actions dominating. Only three truly major fleet engagements were actually fought in the 16th century: the battles of [[Battle of Preveza|Preveza]] in 1538, [[battle of Djerba|Djerba]] in 1560 and [[battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] in 1571. Lepanto became the last large all-galley battle ever, and was also one of the largest battle in terms of participants anywhere in early modern Europe before the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Glete (1993), pp. 114–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the Mediterranean powers employed galley forces for conflicts outside the Mediterranean. Spain sent galley squadrons to the Netherlands during the later stages of the [[Eighty Years' War]] which successfully operated against Dutch forces in the enclosed, shallow coastal waters. From the late 1560s, galleys were also used to transport silver to Genoese bankers to finance Spanish troops against the Dutch uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2000), pp. 154, 163&lt;/ref&gt; Galleasses and galleys were part of an invasion force of over 16,000 men that conquered the [[Azores]] in 1583. Around 2,000 galley rowers were on board ships of the famous 1588 [[Spanish Armada]], though few of these actually made it to the battle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2000), pp., 156, 158-59&lt;/ref&gt; Outside European and Middle Eastern waters, Spain built galleys to deal with pirates and privateers in both the Caribbean and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1973), p. 12; Mott, 113-14&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman galleys contested the Portuguese intrusion in the Indian Ocean in the 16th century, but failed against the high-sided, massive Portuguese carracks in open waters.&lt;ref name="Mott 2003, p. 112"&gt;Mott (2003), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the huge loss of men and material after the loss of the Spanish Armada in 1588 Spain maintained four permanent galley squadrons. Together they formed the largest galley navy in the Mediterranean in the early 17th century. They formed the backbone of the Spanish war fleet and were used for ferrying troops, supplies, horses and munitions to Spain's Italian and African possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;11–13&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Turks attempted to contest the Portuguese rise to power in the [[Indian Ocean]] in the 16th century with Mediterranean-style galleys, but were foiled by the formidable Portuguese [[carrack]]s. Even though the carracks themselves were soon surpassed by other types of sailing vessels, their greater range, great size and high superstructures, armed with numerous [[wrought iron]] guns easily outmatched the short-ranged, low-freeboard Turkish galleys.&lt;ref name="Mott 2003, p. 112"/&gt; The Spanish used galleys to more success in their colonial possessions in the Caribbean and the Philippines to hunt pirates&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1973), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and were used sporadically in the Netherlands and the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref&gt;Mott (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sloane 3584 f.78v Turkish galleys in battle, c.1636.PNG|thumb|Ottoman galleys in battle with raiding boats in the Black Sea; Sloane 3584 manuscript, c. 1636]]
Galleys had been synonymous with warships in the Mediterranean for at least 2,000 years, and continued to fulfill that role with the invention of gunpowder and heavy artillery. Though early 20th-century historians often dismissed the galleys as hopelessly outclassed with the first introduction of naval artillery on sailing ships,&lt;ref&gt;See especially Rodger (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; it was the galley that was favored by the introduction of heavy [[naval artillery|naval guns]]. Galleys were a more "mature" technology with long-established tactics and traditions of supporting social institutions and naval organizations. In combination with the intensified conflicts this led to a substantial increase in the size of galley fleets from c. 1520–80, above all in the Mediterranean, but also in other European theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2003), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Galleys and similar oared vessels remained uncontested as the most effective gun-armed warships in theory until the 1560s, and in practice for a few decades more, and were actually considered a grave risk to sailing warships.&lt;ref&gt;The British naval historian Nicholas Rodger describes this as a "crisis in naval warfare" which eventually led to the development of the galleon, which combined ahead-firing capabilities, heavy broadside guns and a considerable increase in maneuverability by introduction of more advanced sailing rigs; Rodger (2003), p. 245. For more detailed arguments concerning the development of broadside armament, see Rodger (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; They could effectively fight other galleys, attack sailing ships in calm weather or in unfavorable winds (or deny them action if needed) and act as floating siege batteries. They were also unequaled in their amphibious capabilities, even at extended ranges, as exemplified by French interventions as far north as Scotland in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2003), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy artillery on galleys was mounted in the bow, which aligned easily with the long-standing tactical tradition of attacking head on, bow first. The ordnance on galleys was heavy from its introduction in the 1480s, and capable of quickly demolishing the high, thin medieval stone walls that still prevailed in the 16th century. This temporarily upended the strength of older seaside fortresses, which had to be rebuilt to cope with gunpowder weapons. The addition of guns also improved the amphibious abilities of galleys as they could make assaults supported with heavy firepower, and were even more effectively defended when beached stern-first.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 264–66&lt;/ref&gt; An accumulation and generalizing of bronze cannons and small firearms in the Mediterranean during the 16th century increased the cost of warfare, but also made those dependent on them more resilient to manpower losses. Older ranged weapons, like bows or even crossbows, required considerable skill to handle, sometimes a lifetime of practice, while gunpowder weapons required considerably less training to use successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; According to a highly influential study by military historian John F. Guilmartin, this transition in warfare, along with the introduction of much cheaper cast iron guns in the 1580s, proved the "death knell" for the war galley as a significant military vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Gunpowder weapons began to displace men as the fighting power of armed forces, making individual soldiers more deadly and effective. As offensive weapons, firearms could be stored for years with minimal maintenance and did not require the expenses associated with soldiers. Manpower could thus be exchanged for capital investments, something which benefited sailing vessels that were already far more economical in their use of manpower. It also served to increase their strategic range and to out-compete galleys as fighting ships.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediterranean decline===
[[Image:Battle of Lepanto 1571.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, naval engagement between allied Christian forces and the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Turks]].]]
Atlantic-style warfare based on heavily armed sailing ships began to change the nature of naval warfare in the Mediterranean in the 17th century. In 1616, a small Spanish squadron of five [[galleon]]s and a [[patache]] was used to cruise the eastern Mediterranean and defeated a fleet of 55 galleys at the [[battle of Cape Celidonia]]. By 1650, war galleys were used primarily in the wars between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in their struggle for strategic island and coastal trading bases and until the 1720s by both France and Spain but for largely amphibious and cruising operations or in combination with heavy sailing ships in a major battle, where they played specialized roles. An example of this was when a Spanish fleet used its galleys in a mixed naval/amphibious battle in the second 1641 [[Battle of Tarragona (August 1641)|battle of Tarragona]], to break a French naval blockade and land troops and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2000), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Even Venice, a purely Mediterranean power, began to construct sail only warships in the latter part of the century, as did other purely Mediterranean powers. Christian and Muslim corsairs had been using galleys in sea roving and in support of the major powers in times of war, but largely replaced them with [[xebec]]s, various sail/oar hybrids, and a few remaining light galleys in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Jan Glete 1992 p. 99"&gt;Jan Glete, "The Oared Warship" in Gardiner &amp; Lavery (1992), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

No large all galley battles were fought after the gigantic clash at Lepanto in 1571, and galleys were mostly used as cruisers or for supporting sailing warships as a rearguard in fleet actions, similar to the duties performed by [[frigate]]s outside the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Jan Glete 1992 p. 99"/&gt; They could assist damaged ships out of the line, but generally only in very calm weather, as was the case at the [[Battle of Málaga (1704)|Battle of Málaga]] in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (2003), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; For small states and principalities as well as groups of private merchants, galleys were more affordable than large and complex sailing warships, and were used as defense against piracy. Galleys required less timber to build, the design was relatively simple and they carried fewer guns. They were tactically flexible and could be used for naval ambushes as well amphibious operations. They also required few skilled seamen and were difficult for sailing ships to catch, but vital in hunting down catching other galleys and oared raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), pp. 14–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest galley fleets in the 17th century were operated by the two major Mediterranean powers, [[early modern France|France]] and [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]. France had by the 1650s become the most powerful state in Europe, and expanded its galley forces under the rule of the absolutist "Sun King" [[Louis XIV]]. In the 1690s the French [[galley corps]] (''Corps des galères'') reached its all-time peak with more than 50 vessels manned by over 15,000 men and officers, becoming the largest galley fleet in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was intense rivalry between France and Spain, not a single galley battle occurred between the two great powers during this period, and virtually no naval battles between other nations either.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], French galleys were involved in actions against [[Antwerp]] and [[Harwich]],&lt;ref name="Lehmann 1984, p. 12"/&gt; but due to the intricacies of alliance politics there were never any Franco-Spanish galley clashes. In the first half of the 18th century, the other major naval powers in the Mediterranean Sea, the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] based in Malta and of the [[Papal States]] in central Italy, cut down drastically on their galley forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), pp. 272–73&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of action, the galley corps received vast resources (25-50% of the French naval expenditures) during the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; It was maintained as a functional fighting force right up until its abolishment in 1748, though its primary function was more of a symbol of Louis XIV's absolutist ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), pp. 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

The last recorded battle in the Mediterranean where galleys played a significant part was at [[battle of Matapan|Matapan]] in 1717, between the Ottomans and Venice and its allies, though they had little influence on the final outcome. Few large-scale naval battles were fought in the Mediterranean throughout most of the remainder of the 18th century. The Tuscan galley fleet was dismantled around 1718, Naples had only four old vessels by 1734 and the French Galley Corps had ceased to exist as an independent arm in 1748. Venice, the Papal States and the Knights of Malta were the only state fleets that maintained galleys, though in nothing like their previous quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, (1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;272–73; Anderson, (1962), pp.&amp;nbsp;71–73&lt;/ref&gt; By 1790, there were fewer than 50 galleys in service among all the Mediterranean powers, half of which belonged to Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (1992), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in northern Europe===
[[File:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602.jpg|thumb|Dutch ships ramming Spanish galleys in the [[Battle of the Narrow Seas]], October 1602.]]
Oared vessels remained in use in northern waters for a long time, though in subordinate role and in particular circumstances. In the [[Italian Wars]], French galleys brought up from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic posed a serious threat to the early English [[Tudor navy]] during coastal operations. The response came in the building of a considerable fleet of oared vessels, including hybrids with a complete three-masted rig, as well as a Mediterranean-style galleys (that were even attempted to be manned with convicts and slaves).&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;208–12&lt;/ref&gt; Under King [[Henry VIII]], the English navy used several kinds of vessels that were adapted to local needs. English ''galliasses'' (very different from the Mediterranean vessel [[galleass|of the same name]]) were employed to cover the flanks of larger naval forces while ''pinnaces'' and ''rowbarges'' were used for scouting or even as a backup for the [[longboat]]s and tenders for the larger sailing ships.&lt;ref name="John Bennel 2000 pp. 35-37"&gt;John Bennel, "The Oared Vessels" in Knighton &amp; Loades (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;35–37.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1566–1609) both the Dutch and Spanish found galleys useful for amphibious operations in the many shallow waters around the Low Countries where deep-draft sailing vessels could not enter.&lt;ref name="Lehmann 1984, p. 12"&gt;Lehmann (1984), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While galleys were too vulnerable to be used in large numbers in the open waters of the Atlantic, they were well-suited for use in much of the Baltic Sea by Denmark, Sweden, Russia and some of the Central European powers with ports on the southern coast. There were two types of naval battlegrounds in the Baltic. One was the open sea, suitable for large sailing fleets; the other was the coastal areas and especially the chain of small islands and archipelagos that ran almost uninterrupted from Stockholm to the Gulf of Finland. In these areas, conditions were often too calm, cramped and shallow for sailing ships, but they were excellent for galleys and other oared vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;230–30; see also R. C. Anderson, ''Naval Wars in the Baltic'', pp.&amp;nbsp;177–78&lt;/ref&gt; Galleys of the Mediterranean type were first introduced in the [[Baltic Sea]] around the mid-16th century as competition between the Scandinavian states of Denmark and Sweden intensified. The Swedish galley fleet was the largest outside the Mediterranean, and served as an auxiliary branch of the army. Very little is known about the design of Baltic Sea galleys, except that they were overall smaller than in the Mediterranean and they were rowed by army soldiers rather than convicts or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Glete (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;224–25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baltic revival and decline====
[[File:Ferdinand Victor Perrot - The Battle of Grengam on 27th July 1720.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of the [[Battle of Grengam]] in 1720 by [[Ferdinand Perrot]] (1808–41) showing a large Russian galley engaging Swedish frigates at close range. Note the crowded fighting platform (''rambade'') in the bow.]]
Galleys were introduced to the [[Baltic Sea]] in the 16th century but the details of their designs are lacking due to the absence of records. They might have been built in a more regional style, but the only known depiction from the time shows a typical Mediterranean vessel. There is conclusive evidence that Denmark became the first Baltic power to build classic Mediterranean-style galleys in the 1660s, though they proved to be generally too large to be useful in the shallow waters of the Baltic archipelagos. Sweden and especially Russia began to launch galleys and various rowed vessels in great numbers during the [[Great Northern War]] in the first two decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1962), pp.&amp;nbsp;91–93; Berg, "Skärgårdsflottans fartyg" in Norman (2000) pp. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was late in the game when it came to building an effective oared fighting fleet, while the Russian galley forces under Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] developed into a supporting arm for the sailing navy and a well-functioning auxiliary of the army which infiltrated and conducted numerous raids on the eastern Swedish coast in the 1710s.&lt;ref&gt;Glete, "Den ryska skärgårdsflottan" in Norman (2000), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden and Russia became the two main competitors for Baltic dominance in the 18th century, and built the largest galley fleets in the world at the time. They were used for amphibious operations in Russo-Swedish wars of [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)|1741–43]] and [[Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790)|1788–90]]. The last galleys ever constructed were built in 1796 by Russia, and remained in service well into the 19th century, but saw little action.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1962), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The last time galleys were deployed in action was when the Russian navy was attacked in Åbo ([[Turku]]) in 1854 as part of the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bondioli, Burlet &amp; Zysberg (1995), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 18th century, the role of Baltic galleys in coastal fleets was replaced first with hybrid "archipelago frigates" (such as the [[turuma]] or [[pojama]]) and [[xebec]]s, and after the 1790s with various types of [[gunboat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Glete, "Den ryska skärgårdsflottan: Myt och verklighet" in Norman (2000), pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Russian and Swedish navies were based on a form of [[conscription]], and both navies used conscripts as galley rowers. This had several advantages over convicts or slaves: the rowers could be armed to fight as marines, they could be also used as land soldiers and invasion force, and they could be taught better and more skilled than convicts or slaves. Since most naval conscripts came from coastal parishes and towns, most were already experienced seafarers when they entered the service.

=== Southeast Asia ===
[[File:Galley from Banten 1598.jpg|thumb|Galley from Banten, 1598]]
Various types of indigenous galley-like vessels are used in Southeast Asia, namely: [[Lancaran (ship)|lancaran]], [[penjajap]], [[kelulus]], [[lanong]], [[Garay (ship)|garay]], [[Kora kora|kora-kora]], and [[karakoa]]. During the turn of the 16th century, mediterranean influence came, mainly by Ottoman influences of sultanates in [[Nusantara|Nusantaran archipelago]]. A royal galley (''ghali kenaikan raja'') of the [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca sultanate]] that was built approximately in 1453 is called ''Mendam Berahi'' (Malay for "Suppressed Passion"). It was 60 ''gaz'' (54.6 m) long and 6 ''depa'' (11 m) wide. This ghali had 3 masts and could carry 400 men; 200 of them were rowers in 50 rowing line. It was armed with 5 bow-mounted ''rentaka'' and [[Naval ram|ramming beam]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] in 1568 siege of Portuguese Malacca used 4 large galley 40-50 meter long each with 190 rowers and 3 masts. They were armed with 12 large camelos (3 at each bow side, 4 at stern), 1 [[Basilisk (cannon)|basilisk]] (bow-mounted), 12 falcons, and 40 swivel guns. By then cannons, firearms, and other war material had come annually from [[Jeddah]], and the Turks also sent military expert, master of galleys, and technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Acehnese attack on Malacca in 1629|last=Boxer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=119-121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1575 siege, Aceh used 40 two-masted galleys with Turkish captains carrying 200-300 soldier of [[Turkic peoples|Turk]], [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Dakhini Muslims|Deccanis]], and Aceh origins. The state galleys of Aceh, Daya, and Pedir is said to carry 10 ''[[Cannon|meriam]]'', 50 ''[[Lantaka|lela]]'', and 120 ''[[Blunderbuss|cecorong]]'' (not counting the ''[[Musket|ispinggar]]''). Smaller galley carry 5 ''meriam'', 20 ''lela'', and 50 ''cecorong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Hikajat Atjeh|last=Iskandar|first=Teuku|publisher=KITLV|year=1958|isbn=|location=Gravenhage|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western and native sources mention that [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]] had 100-120 galleys at any time (not counting the smaller [[fusta]] and [[galiot]]), spread from Daya (west coast) to Pedir (east coast). One galley captured by Portuguese in 1629 is very large, and it was reported there were total 47 of them. She reached 100 m in length and 17 m in breadth, had 3 masts with square sails and topsails, propelled by 35 oars on each side and able to carry 700 men. It is armed with 98 guns: 18 large cannon (five 55-pounders at the bow, one 25-pounder at the stern, the rest were [[18-pounder short gun|17]] and [[18-pounder long gun|18-pounders]]), 80 [[Falconet (cannon)|falcons]] and many swivel guns. The ship is called "''Espanto do Mundo''" (terror of the universe), which probably a free translation from ''"Cakra Dunia''". The Portuguese reported that it was bigger than anything ever built in the Christian world, and that its castle could compete with that of galleons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian Past|last=Reid|first=Anthony|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2012|isbn=978-981-4311-96-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Dutch engravings from 1598 and 1601 depicted galley from [[Banten Sultanate|Banten]] and [[Madura Island|Madura]]. They had 2 and 1 mast(s), respectively. Major difference from mediterranean galleys, Nusantaran galley had raised fighting platform called "balai" in which the soldier stood, a feature common in warships of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tweede Boek|last=Lode|first=|publisher=|year=1601|isbn=|location=Amsterdam|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sultanate of Gowa|Sultanate of Goa]] of mid 17th century had "''Galle''" 40 m long and 6 m breadth, carrying 200-400 men. Other ''galle'' of the kingdom varied between 23-35 m in length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Wells egyptian ship red sea.png|thumb|right|Illustration of an Egyptian rowed ship of c. 1250 BC. Due to a lack of a proper [[keel]], the vessel has a [[truss]], a thick cable along its length, to prevent it from losing its shape.]]
Galleys have since their first appearance in ancient times been intended as highly maneuverable vessels, independent of winds by being rowed, and usually with a focus on speed under oars. The profile has therefore been that of a markedly elongated hull with a ratio of breadth to length at the waterline of at least 1:5, and in the case of ancient Mediterranean galleys as much as 1:10 with a small draught, the measurement of how much of a ship's structure that is submerged under water. To make it possible to efficiently row the vessels, the [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], the height of the railing to the surface of the water, was by necessity kept low. This gave oarsmen enough leverage to row efficiently, but at the expense of seaworthiness. These design characteristics made the galley fast and maneuverable, but more vulnerable to rough weather.

The documentary evidence for the construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and schematics in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of them actually in natural size. Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or heavy cargo that could sink them, not a single wreckage of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreckage of a small Punic [[liburnian (ship)|liburnian]] from the Roman era, the [[Marsala Ship]].&lt;ref&gt;Coates (1995), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

On the funerary monument of the Egyptian king [[Sahure]] (2487–2475 BC)  in [[Abusir]], there are relief images of vessels with a marked [[Sheer (ship)|sheer]] (the upward curvature at each end of the hull) and seven pairs of oars along its side, a number that was likely to have been merely symbolical, and steering oars in the stern. They have one mast, all lowered and vertical posts at stem and stern, with the front decorated with an [[Eye of Horus]], the first example of such a decoration. It was later used by other Mediterranean cultures to decorate seagoing craft in the belief that it helped to guide the ship safely to its destination. These early galleys apparently lacked a [[keel]] meaning they lacked stiffness along their length. Therefore, they had large cables connecting stem and stern resting on massive crutches on deck. They were held in tension to avoid [[hogging and sagging|hogging]], or bending the ship's construction upwards in the middle, while at sea.&lt;ref name="Wachsmann 1995, p. 11-12"/&gt; In the 15th century BC, Egyptian galleys were still depicted with the distinctive extreme sheer, but had by then developed the distinctive forward-curving stern decorations with ornaments in the shape of [[lotus flower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This flower-inspired stern detail would later be widely used by both Greek and Roman ships.&lt;/ref&gt; They had possibly developed a primitive type of keel, but still retained the large cables intended to prevent hogging.&lt;ref name="Wachsmann 1995, pp. 21-23"/&gt;

[[File:Mortise tenon joint hull trireme-en.svg|thumb|A schematic view of the [[mortise and tenon]] technique for shipbuilding that dominated the Mediterranean until the 7th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The design of the earliest oared vessels is mostly unknown and highly conjectural. They likely used a [[mortise and tenon|mortise]] construction, but were sewn together rather than pinned together with nails and dowels. Being completely open, they were rowed (or even paddled) from the open deck, and likely had "ram entries", projections from the bow lowered the resistance of moving through water, making them slightly more hydrodynamic. The first true galleys, the [[triaconter]]s (literally "thirty-oarers") and [[penteconter (ship)|penteconter]]s ("fifty-oarers") were developed from these early designs and set the standard for the larger designs that would come later. They were rowed on only one level, which made them fairly slow, likely only 5-5.5 knots. By the 8th century BC the first galleys rowed at two levels had been developed, among the earliest being the two-level penteconters which were considerably shorter than the one-level equivalents, and therefore more maneuverable. They were an estimated 25&amp;nbsp;m in length and displaced 15 tonnes with 25 pairs of oars. These could have reached an estimated top speed of up to 7.5 knots, making them the first genuine warships when fitted with bow rams. They were equipped with a single [[square sail]] on mast set roughly halfway along the length of the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Coates (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trireme===
{{main|trireme}}
[[File:Olympias.3.JPG|thumb|The stern of the modern trireme replica ''[[Olympias (trireme)|Olympias]]'' with twin side rudders]]
By the 5th century BC, the first ''triremes'' were in use by various powers in the eastern Mediterranean. It had now become a fully developed, highly specialized vessel of war that was capable of high speeds and complex maneuvers. At nearly 40&amp;nbsp;m in length, displacing almost 50 tonnes, it was more than three times as expensive as a two-level penteconter. A trireme also had an additional mast with a smaller square sail placed near the bow.&lt;ref name="Coates 1995 pp. 133-34"/&gt; Up to 170 oarsmen sat on three levels with one oar each that varied slightly in length. To accommodate three levels of oars, rowers sat staggered on three levels. Arrangements of the three levels are believed to have varied, but the most well-documented design made use of a projecting structure, or [[outrigger]], where the [[oarlock]] in the form of a ''thole pin'' was placed. This allowed the outermost row of oarsmen enough [[lever]]age for full strokes that made efficient use of their oars.&lt;ref&gt;Coates (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;137–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Israeli National Maritime Museum- Naval ram-1.jpg|thumb|The [[Athlit ram]], a preserved original warship ram from around 530–270 BC. It weighs nearly half a tonne and was probably fitted to a "five" or a "four".&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1991), pp. 135–36&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first dedicated war galleys fitted with rams were built with a [[mortise and tenon]] technique, a so-called ''shell-first'' method. In this, the planking of the hull was strong enough to hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for [[caulking]]. Hulls had sharp bottoms without [[keelson]]s in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from [[hogging and sagging|hogging]] there was a ''hypozoma'', a thick cable that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Coates (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;131–32&lt;/ref&gt; The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400&amp;nbsp;kg up to 2 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Coates 1995 pp. 133-34"&gt;Coates (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;133–34; Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;165–67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman era===
Galleys from 4th century BC up to the time of the early [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century AD became successively larger. Three levels of oars was the practical upper limit, but it was improved on by making ships longer, broader and heavier and placing more than one rower per oar. Naval conflict grew more intense and extensive, and by 100 BC galleys with four, five or six rows of oarsmen were commonplace and carried large complements of soldiers and catapults. With high freeboard (up to 3&amp;nbsp;m) and additional tower structures from which missiles could be shot down onto enemy decks, they were intended to be like floating fortresses.&lt;ref&gt;Coates (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–40&lt;/ref&gt; Designs with everything from eight rows of oarsmen and upwards were built, but most of them are believed to have been impractical show pieces never used in actual warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov (2000), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy IV]], the Greek pharaoh of Egypt 221–205 BC, is recorded as building a gigantic ship with ''forty'' rows of oarsmen, though no specification of its design remains. One suggested design was that of a huge trireme [[catamaran]] with up to 14 men per oar and it is assumed that it was intended as a showpiece rather than a practical warship.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw(1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;164–65&lt;/ref&gt;

With the consolidation of Roman imperial power, the size of both fleets and galleys decreased considerably. The huge polyremes disappeared and the fleet were equipped primarily with triremes and [[liburnian (ship)|liburnian]]s, compact biremes with 25 pairs of oars that were well suited for patrol duty and chasing down raiders and pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Hocker (1995), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern provinces oared patrol boats were employed to keep local tribes in check along the shores of rivers like the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;Rankov (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;80–83&lt;/ref&gt; As the need for large warships disappeared, the design of the [[trireme]], the pinnacle of ancient war ship design, fell into obscurity and was eventually forgotten. The last known reference to triremes in battle is dated to 324 at the [[battle of the Hellespont]]. In the late 5th century the Byzantine historian [[Zosimus]] declared the knowledge of how to build them to have been long since forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Rankov (1995), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The earliest medieval galley specification comes from an order of [[Charles I of Sicily]], in 1275 AD.&lt;ref&gt;See both Bass and Pryor&lt;/ref&gt; Overall length 39.30&amp;nbsp;m, [[keel]] length 28.03&amp;nbsp;m, depth 2.08&amp;nbsp;m. Hull width 3.67&amp;nbsp;m. Width between [[outrigger]]s 4.45&amp;nbsp;m. 108 oars, most 6.81&amp;nbsp;m long, some 7.86&amp;nbsp;m, 2 steering oars 6.03&amp;nbsp;m long. Foremast and middle mast respectively heights 16.08&amp;nbsp;m, 11.00&amp;nbsp;m; circumference both 0.79&amp;nbsp;m, yard lengths 26.72&amp;nbsp;m, 17.29&amp;nbsp;m. Overall [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] tonnage approximately 80 metric tons. This type of vessel had two, later three, men on a [[Bench (furniture)|bench]], each working his own oar. This vessel had much longer oars than the Athenian trireme which were 4.41&amp;nbsp;m &amp; 4.66&amp;nbsp;m long.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; This type of warship was called ''galia sottil''.&lt;ref&gt;Landström&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dromon and the ''galea''====
[[File:Galley.jpg|thumb|right|14th-century painting of a light galley, from an icon now at the [[Byzantine and Christian Museum]] at [[Athens]]]]
The primary warship of the Byzantine navy until the 12th century was the [[dromon]] and other similar ship types. Considered an evolution of the Roman [[Liburnian (ship)|liburnian]], the term first appeared in the late 5th century, and was commonly used for a specific kind of war-galley by the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 123–125&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''dromōn'' (literally "runner") itself comes from the Greek root ''drom-(áō)'', "to run", and 6th-century authors like [[Procopius]] are explicit in their references to the speed of these vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; During the next few centuries, as the naval struggle with the Arabs intensified, heavier versions with two or possibly even three banks of oars evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1995), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The accepted view is that the main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full [[Deck (ship)|deck]], the abandonment of [[ramming|rams]] on the bow in favor of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of [[lateen]] sails.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram are unclear. Depictions of upward-pointing beaks in the 4th-century ''[[Vatican Vergil]]'' manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt; One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient shell-first construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 145–147, 152&lt;/ref&gt; At least by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

The dromons that Procopius described were single-banked ships of probably 25 oars per side. Unlike ancient vessels, which used an [[outrigger]], these extended directly from the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1995), pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; In the later [[bireme]] dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 232, 255, 276&lt;/ref&gt; The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 205, 291&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stern]] (''prymnē'') had a tent that covered the captain's berth;&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; the prow featured an elevated forecastle that acted as a fighting platform and could house one or more siphons for the discharge of [[Greek fire]];&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;  and on the largest dromons, there were wooden castles on either side between the masts, providing archers with elevated firing platforms.&lt;ref name="Galley104"&gt;Pryor (1995), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The bow spur was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standardization===
From the 12th century, the design of war galleys evolved into the form that would remain largely the same until the building of the last war galleys in the late 18th century. The length to breadth-ratio was a minimum of 8:1. A rectangular ''telaro'', an [[outrigger]], was added to support the oars and the rowers' benches were laid out in a diagonal herringbone pattern angled aft on either side of a central gangway, or ''corsia''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1962), pp. 52, 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the form of the ''galea'', the smaller Byzantine galleys, and would be known mostly by the Italian term ''gallia sottila'' (literally "slender galley"). A second, smaller mast was added sometime in the 13th century and the number of rowers was rose from two to three rowers per bench as a standard from the late 13th to the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1992), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gallee sottili'' would make up the bulk the main war fleets of every major naval power in the Mediterranean, assisted by the smaller single-masted ''galiotte'', as well as the Christian and Muslim [[Barbary pirates|corsairs]] fleets. Ottoman galleys were very similar in design, though in general smaller, faster under sail, but slower under oars.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1992), pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; The standard size of the galley remained stable from the 14th until the early 16th century, when the introduction of naval artillery began to have effects on design and tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1962), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vittore Carpaccio - Sant'Orsola polyptich - Ritorno Degli ambasciatori-detail.jpeg|thumbnail|center|500px|A Venetian ''galea sottila'' from the late 15th century from [[Vittore Carpaccio]]'s ''Return of the Ambassadors'' in the series [[Legend of Saint Ursula]] (1497–1498). Note the oars arranged in groups of three according to the ''alla sensile'' rowing method.]]
The traditional two side rudders were complemented with a [[stern rudder]] sometime after c. 1400 and eventually the side rudders disappeared altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor refers to claims that stern rudders evolved by the Byzantines and Arabs as early as the 9th century, but refutes it due to lack of evidence. Anderson (1962), pp. 59–60; Pryor (1992), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during the 15th century that large artillery pieces were first mounted on galleys. Burgundian records from the mid-15th century describe galleys with some form of guns, but do not specify the size. The first conclusive evidence of a large cannon mounted on a galley comes from a woodcut of a Venetian galley in 1486.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann (1984), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The first guns were fixed directly on timbers in the bow and aimed directly forwards, a placement that would remain largely unchanged until the galley disappeared from active service in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Guilmartin 1974, p. 216"&gt;Guilmartin (1974), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swedish galley (1715)-rambade.jpg|thumb|left|The ubiquitous bow fighting platform (''rambade'') of early modern galleys. This model is of a 1715 Swedish galley, somewhat smaller than the standard Mediterranean war galley, but still based on the same design.]]
With the introduction of guns in the bows of galleys, a permanent wooden structure called ''rambade'' (French: ''rambade''; Italian: ''rambata''; Spanish: ''arrumbada'') was introduced. The ''rambade'' became standard on virtually all galleys in the early 16th century. There were some variations in the navies of different Mediterranean powers, but the overall layout was the same. The forward-aiming battery was covered by a wooden platform which gave gunners a minimum of protection, and functioned as both a staging area for boarding attacks and as a firing platform for on-board soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; After its introduction, the rambade became a standard detail on every fighting galley until the very end of galley era in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann (1984), pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-17th century, galleys reached what has been described as their "final form".&lt;ref name="Jan Glete 1992 p. 98"&gt;Jan Glete, "The Oared Warship" in Gardiner &amp; Lavery (1992), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Galleys had looked more or less the same for over four centuries and a fairly standardized classification system for different sizes of galleys had been developed by the Mediterranean bureaucracies, based mostly on the number of benches in a vessel.&lt;ref name="Glete 1993 81"/&gt; A Mediterranean galley would have 25-26 pairs of oars with five men per oar (c. 250 rowers), 50-100 sailors and 50-100 soldiers for a total of about 500 men. The exceptions were the significantly larger "flagships" (often called ''lanternas'', "lantern galleys") that had 30 pairs of oars and up to seven rowers per oar. The armament consisted of one heavy 24- or 36-pounder gun in the bows flanked by two to four 4- to 12-pounders. Rows of light [[swivel gun]]s were often placed along the entire length of the galley on the railings for close-quarter defense. The length-to-width ratio of the ships was about 8:1, with two main masts carrying one large [[lateen]] sail each. In the Baltic, galleys were generally shorter with a length-to-width ratio from 5:1 to 7:1, an adaptation to the cramped conditions of the Baltic archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Glete, "The Oared Warship" in Gardiner &amp; Lavery (1992), pp. 98–100&lt;/ref&gt;

A single [[mainmast]] was standard on most war galleys until c. 1600. A second, shorter mast could be raised temporarily in the bows, but became permanent by the early 17th century. It was  stepped slightly to the side to allow for the recoil of the heavy guns; the other was placed roughly in the center of the ship. A third smaller mast further astern, akin to a [[mizzen mast]], was also introduced on large galleys, possibly in the early 17th century, but was standard at least by the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1962), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Galleys had little room for provisions and depended on frequent resupplying and were often beached at night to rest the crew and cook meals. Where [[galley (kitchen)|cooking areas]] were actually present, they consisted of a clay-lined box with a [[hearth]] or similar cooking equipment fitted on the vessel in place of a rowing bench, usually on the port (left) side.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann (1984), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propulsion==
Throughout their long history, galleys relied on rowing as the most important means of propulsion. The arrangement of rowers during the 1st millennium BC developed gradually from a single row up to three rows arranged in a complex, staggered seating arrangement. Anything above three levels, however, proved to be physically impracticable. Initially, there was only one rower per oar, but the number steadily increased, with a number of different combinations of rowers per oar and rows of oars. The ancient terms for galleys was based on the numbers of rows or rowers plying the oars, not the number of rows of oars. Today it is best known by a modernized Latin terminology based on numerals with the ending "-reme" from ''rēmus'', "oar". A ''[[trireme]]'' was a ship with three rows of oarsmen, a ''quadrireme'' four, a ''hexareme'' six, and so forth. There were warships that ran up to ten or even eleven rows, but anything above six was rare. A huge [[Tessarakonteres|''forty''-rowed ship]] was built during the reign of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]] in Egypt. Little is known about its design, but it is assumed to have been an impractical prestige vessel.

===Rowing===
[[File:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|right|Modern reconstruction of a cross-section of an ancient Greek trireme, showing the three levels of rowers.]]
Ancient rowing was done in a fixed seated position, the most effective rowing position, with rowers facing the stern. A sliding stroke, which provided the strength from both legs as well as the arms, was suggested by earlier historians, but no conclusive evidence has supported it. Practical experiments with the full-scale reconstruction ''Olympias'' has shown that there was insufficient space, while moving or rolling seats would have been highly impractical to construct with ancient methods.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov, ''The Athenian Trireme'', pp.&amp;nbsp;246–47; Shaw (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Rowers in ancient war galleys sat below the upper deck with little view of their surroundings. The rowing was therefore managed by supervisors, and coordinated with pipes or rhythmic chanting.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov, ''The Athenian Trireme'', pp.&amp;nbsp;249–52&lt;/ref&gt; Galleys were highly maneuverable, able to turn on their axis or even to row backwards, though it required a skilled and experienced crew.&lt;ref name="Morrison, Coates pp. 246-47"&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov, ''The Athenian Trireme'', pp.&amp;nbsp;246–47&lt;/ref&gt; In galleys with an arrangement of three men per oar, all would be seated, but the rower furthest inboard would perform a stand-and-sit stroke, getting up on his feet to push the oar forwards and then sitting down again to pull it back.&lt;ref name="Morrison, Coates pp. 246-47"/&gt;

The faster a vessel travels, the more energy it uses. Reaching high speed requires energy which a human-powered vessel is incapable of producing. Oar system generate very low amounts of energy for propulsion (only about 70 W per rower) and the upper limit for rowing in a fixed position is around 10 knots.&lt;ref&gt;Coates 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–28&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient war galleys of the kind used in Classical Greece are by modern historians considered to be the most energy efficient and fastest of galley designs throughout history. A full-scale replica of a 5th-century BC [[trireme]], the ''[[Olympias (trireme)|Olympias]]'' was built 1985–87 and was put through a series of trials to test its performance. It proved that a cruising speed of 7-8 knots could be maintained for an entire day. Sprinting speeds of up to 10 knots were possible, but only for a few minutes and would tire the crew quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (1995), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient galleys were built very light and the original triremes are assumed to never have been surpassed in speed.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (1995), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval galleys are believed to have been considerably slower, especially since they were not built with ramming tactics in mind. A cruising speed of no more than 2-3 knots has been estimated. A sprint speed of up to 7 knots was possible for 20–30 minutes, but risked exhausting the rowers completely.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowing in headwinds or even moderately rough weather was difficult as well as exhausting.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov, ''The Athenian Trireme'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; In high seas, ancient galleys would set sail to run before the wind. They were highly susceptible to high waves, and could become unmanageable if the rowing frame (''apostis'') came awash. Ancient and medieval galleys are assumed to have sailed only with the wind more or less astern with a top speed of 8-9 knots in fair conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1992), pp. 71–75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galley slaves===
{{main|Galley slave}}
[[File:Venice galley rowing alla sensile1.jpg|thumb|left|Model of a Venetian three-banked galley rowed ''alla sensile'', with three rowers sharing a bench but handling one oar each]]
Contrary to the popular image of rowers chained to the oars, conveyed by movies such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', there is no evidence that ancient navies ever made use of condemned criminals or [[slave]]s as oarsmen, with the possible exception of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1995), pp. 325–26&lt;/ref&gt; Literary evidence indicates that [[History of Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman navy|Roman navies]] relied on paid labor or ordinary soldiers to man their galleys.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel L. Sargent, "The Use of Slaves by the Athenians in Warfare", ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1927), pp. 264–279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lionel Casson, 1966, 36"&gt;Lionel Casson, "Galley Slaves", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 97 (1966), pp. 35–44&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were put at the oars only in times of extreme crisis. In some cases, these people were given freedom thereafter, while in others they began their service aboard as free men. Roman merchant vessels (usually sailing vessels) were manned by slaves, sometimes even with slaves as [[Master (naval)|ship's master]], but this was seldom the case in merchant galleys.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in the early 16th century that the modern idea of the [[galley slave]] became commonplace. Galley fleets as well as the size of individual vessels increase in size, which required more rowers. The number of benches could not be increased without lengthening hulls beyond their structural limits, and more than three oars per bench was not practicable. The demand for more rowers also meant that the relatively limited number of skilled oarsmen could not keep up with the demand of large galley fleets. It became increasingly common to man galleys with convicts or [[galley slave|slaves]], which required a simpler method of rowing. The older method of employing professional rowers using the ''alla sensile'' method (one oar per man, with two to three sharing the same bench) was gradually phased out in favor of rowing ''a scaloccio'', which required less skill.&lt;ref&gt;From Italian ''remo di scaloccio'' from ''scala'', "ladder; staircase"; Anderson (1962), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; A single large oar was used for each bench, with several rowers working it together and the number of oarsmen per oar rose from three up to five. In some very large command galleys, there could be as many as seven to an oar.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Morisot-Nova Triremis quam dicimus, Galere-detail.jpeg|thumbnail|center|600px|An illustration from 1643 showing the layout of rowing benches as well and placement of rowers on a galley with 16 pairs of oars. It also shows a rower at the top of the stroke using the standing rowing technique typical of ''a scaloccio'' rowing.]]
All major Mediterranean powers sentenced criminals to galley service, but initially only in time of war. Christian naval powers such as Spain frequently employed Muslim captives and [[prisoners of war]]. The [[Ottoman navy]] and its North African [[Barbary corsairs|corsair]] allies often put Christian prisoners to the oars, but also mixed volunteers. [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] relied on mostly servile rowers, in great part because its organizational structure was geared toward employing slaves and convicts.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 109–112&lt;/ref&gt; Venice was one of few major naval powers that used almost only free rowers, a result of their reliance on ''alla sensile'' rowing which required skilled professional rowers. The Knights of Saint John used slaves extensively, as did the Papal States, Florence and Genoa. North African ''ghazi'' corsairs relied almost entirely on Christian slaves for rowers.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 114–119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sails===
In ancient galleys under sail, most of the moving power came from a single [[square sail]]. It was rigged on a mast somewhat forwards of the center of the ship with a smaller mast carrying a [[head sail]] in the bow. Triangular [[lateen]] sails are attested as early as the 2nd century AD, and gradually became the sail of choice for galleys. By the 9th century lateens were firmly established as part of the standard galley rig. The lateen rig was more complicated and required a larger crew to handle than a square sail rig, but this was not a problem in the heavily manned galleys.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1980), pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Belisarius' Byzantine invasion fleet of 533 was at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon,&lt;ref&gt;Basch (2001), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), pp. 153–159&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a square sail rig, the [[spar (sailing)|spar]] of a lateen sail did not pivot around the mast. To change [[tacking (sailing)|tack]]s, the entire spar had to be lifted over the mast and to the other side. Since the spar was often much longer than the mast itself, and not much shorter than the ship itself, it was a complex and time-consuming maneuver.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1992), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armament and tactics==
{{main|Galley tactics}}
In the earliest times of naval warfare [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] was the only means of deciding a naval engagement, but little to nothing is known about the tactics involved. In the first recorded naval battle in history, the [[battle of the Delta]], the forces of Egyptian Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] won a decisive victory over a force made up of the enigmatic group known as the [[Sea Peoples]]. As shown in commemorative reliefs of the battle, Egyptian archers on ships and the nearby shores of the Nile rain down arrows on the enemy ships. At the same time Egyptian galleys engage in boarding action and [[capsize]] the ships of the Sea Peoples with ropes attached to grappling hooks thrown into the rigging.&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmann (1995), pp. 28–34, 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the ram===
[[File:Olympias.1.JPG|thumb|The ram bow of the [[trireme]] ''[[Olympias (trireme)|Olympias]]'', a modern full-scale reconstruction of a classical Greek trireme.]]
Around the 8th century BC, [[ramming]] began to be employed as war galleys were equipped with heavy bronze [[naval ram|rams]]. Records of the [[Persian Wars]] in the early 5th century BC by the Ancient historian [[Herodotus]] (c. 484-25 BC) show that by this time ramming tactics had evolved among the Greeks. The formations adapted for ramming warfare could either be in columns in line ahead, one ship following the next, or in a line abreast, with the ships side by side, depending on the tactical situation and the surrounding geography. The primary methods for attack was either to break through the enemy formation or to outflank it.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Coates &amp; Rankov (2000), pp. 42–43, 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Ramming itself was done by smashing into the rear or side of an enemy ship, punching a hole in the planking. This did not actually sink an ancient galley unless it was heavily laden with cargo and stores. With a normal load, it was buoyant enough to float even with a breached hull. Breaking the enemy's oars was another way of rendering ships immobile, rendering them easier targets. If ramming was not possible or successful, the on-board complement of soldiers would attempt to board and capture the enemy vessel by securing it with grappling irons, accompanied by missile fire with arrows or javelins. Trying to set the enemy ship on fire by hurling incendiary missiles or by pouring the content of fire pots attached to long handles is thought to have been used, especially since smoke below decks would easily disable rowers.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates (1995), pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes was the first naval power to employ this weapon, sometime in the 3rd century, and used it to fight off head-on attacks or to frighten enemies into exposing their sides for a ramming attack.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1991), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful ramming was difficult to achieve; just the right amount of speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets that did not have well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.&lt;ref&gt;Casson (1991), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byzantines repel the Russian attack of 941.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Byzantine fleet repels the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 941. The Byzantine [[dromon]]s are rolling over the Rus' vessels and smashing their oars with their spurs.]]
Despite the attempts to counter increasingly heavy ships, ramming tactics were gradually superseded in the last centuries BC by the Macedonians and Romans, both primarily land-based powers. Hand-to-hand fighting with large complements of heavy infantry supported by ship-borne catapults dominated the fighting style during the Roman era, a move that was accompanied by the conversion to heavier ships with larger rowing complements and more men per oar. Though effectively lowering mobility, it meant that less skill was required from individual oarsmen. Fleets thereby became less dependent on rowers with a lifetime of experience at the oar.&lt;ref name="Morrison, Coates 2000 pp. 48-49"/&gt;

By late antiquity, in the 1st centuries AD, ramming tactics had completely disappeared along with the knowledge of the design of the ancient trireme. Medieval galleys instead developed a projection, or "spur", in the bow that was designed to break oars and to act as a boarding platform for storming enemy ships. The only remaining examples of ramming tactics were passing references to attempts to collide with ships in order to destabilize or capsize them.&lt;ref name="Frederick M. Hocker 1995 pp. 95, 98"&gt;Hocker (1995), pp. 95, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine ship attacking with [[Greek fire]]. [[John Skylitzes|Madrid Skylitzes manuscript]], 11th century.]]
The [[Byzantine navy]], the largest Mediterranean war fleet throughout most of the early Middle Ages, employed crescent formations with the flagship in the center and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. Similar tactics are believed to have been employed by the Arab fleets they frequently fought from the 7th century onwards. The Byzantines were the first to employ [[Greek fire]], a highly effective incendiary liquid, as a naval weapon. It could be fired through a metal tube, or ''siphon'' mounted in the bows, similar to a modern [[flame thrower]]. The properties of Greek fire were close to that of [[napalm]] and was a key to several major Byzantine victories. By 835, the weapon had spread to the Arabs, who equipped ''harraqas'', "fireships", with it. The initial stages in naval battles was an exchanges of missiles, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows, [[caltrop]]s and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the boarding commenced, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.&lt;ref name="Frederick M. Hocker 1995 pp. 95, 98"/&gt; Byzantine dromons had [[pavesade]]s, racks along the railings, on which marines could hang their shields, providing protection to the deck crew.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor &amp; Jeffreys (2006), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; Larger ships also had wooden castles on either side between the masts, which allowed archers to shoot from an elevated firing position.&lt;ref name="Galley104"&gt;Pryor (1995), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinello-Battle of Punta San Salvatore-detail1.jpg|thumb|Battle between Venetian and Holy Roman fleets; detail of fresco by [[Spinello Aretino]] 1407–1408.]]
Later medieval navies continued to use similar tactics, with the [[line abreast]] formation as standard. As galleys were intended to be fought from the bows, and were at their weakest along the sides, especially in the middle. The crescent formation employed by the Byzantines continued to be used throughout the Middle Ages. It would allow the wings of the fleet to crash their bows straight into the sides of the enemy ships at the edge of the formation.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1983), pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger of Lauria]] (c. 1245–1305) was a successful medieval naval tactician who fought for the [[Aragon]] navy against French [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] fleets in the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]]. At the [[Battle of Malta]] in July 1283, he lured out Angevin galleys that were beached stern-first by openly challenging them. Attacking them in a strong defensive position head-on would have been very dangerous since it offered good cohesion, allowed rowers to escape ashore and made it possible to reinforce weak positions by transferring infantry along the shore. He also employed skilled crossbowmen and [[almogavars]], light infantry, that were more nimbler in ship-to-ship actions than heavily armed and armored French soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1983), pp. 184–188&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[battle of the Gulf of Naples]] in 1284, his forces launched clay cooking pots filled with soap before attacking; when the pots broke against the enemy decks, they became perilously slippery and difficult for heavy infantry to keep their feet on.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor (1983), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun galleys===
The earliest guns were of large calibers, and were initially of wrought iron, which made them weak compared to cast bronze guns that would become standard in the 16th century. They were at first fixed directly on timbers in the bow, aiming directly forwards. This placement would remain largely unchanged until the galley disappeared from active service in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Guilmartin 1974, p. 216"/&gt; The introduction of heavy guns and small arms did not change tactics considerably. If anything, it accentuated the bow as the offensive weapon, being both a staging area for boarders and the given position for small arms and cannons. The galley was capable of outperforming sailing vessel in early battles. It retained a distinct tactical advantage even after the initial introduction of naval artillery because of the ease with which it could be brought to bear upon an opposing vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Rose (2002), pp. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fernando Bertelli, Die Seeschlacht von Lepanto, Venedig 1572, Museo Storico Navale (550x500).jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary depiction of the [[battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 that shows the strict formations of the opposing fleets. Fresco in the Gallery of Maps in [[Vatican Museum]].]]
In large-scale galley-to-galley engagements, tactics remained essentially the same until the end of the 16th century. [[Cannon]]s and small firearms were introduced around the 14th century, but did not have immediate effects on tactics; the same basic crescent formation in line abreast that was employed at the [[battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 was used by the Byzantine fleet almost a millennium earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery on early gun galleys was not used as a long-range standoff weapon against other gun-armed ships. The maximum distance at which contemporary cannons were effective, c. 500&amp;nbsp;m (1600&amp;nbsp;ft), could be covered by a galley in about two minutes, much faster than the reload time of any heavy artillery. Gun crews would therefore hold their fire until the last possible moment, somewhat similar to [[infantry tactics]] in the pre-industrial era of short range firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; The weak points of a galley remained the sides and especially the rear, the command center. Unless one side managed to outmaneuver the other, battle would be met with ships crashing into each other head on. Once fighting began with ships locking on to one another bow to bow, the fighting would be fought over the front line ships. Unless a galley was completely overrun by an enemy boarding party, fresh troops could be fed into the fight from reserve vessels in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmartin (1974), pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonial symbolism==
[[File:AnthonyRoll-30 Galley Subtle.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Galley Subtle'', one of the very few Mediterranean-style galleys employed by the English. This illustration is from the [[Anthony Roll]] (c. 1546) and was intended as its centerpiece.]]
Galleys were used for purely ceremonial purposes by many rulers and states. In early modern Europe, galleys enjoyed a level of prestige that sailing vessels did not enjoy. Galleys had from an early stage been commanded by the leaders of land forces, and fought with tactics adapted from land warfare. As such, they enjoyed the prestige associated with land battles, the ultimate achievement of a high-standing noble or king. In the Baltic, the Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa|Gustav I]], the founder of the modern Swedish state, showed particular interest in galleys, as was befitting a Renaissance prince. Whenever traveling by sea, Gustav, the court, royal bureaucrats and the royal bodyguard would travel by galley.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Glete, "Vasatidens galärflottor" in Norman (2000), pp. 39, 42&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, English king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had high ambitions to live up to the reputation of the omnipotent Renaissance ruler and also had a few Mediterranean-style galleys built (and even manned them with slaves), though the English navy relied mostly on sailing ships at the time.&lt;ref name="John Bennel 2000 pp. 35-37"/&gt;

Despite the rising importance of sailing warships, galleys were more closely associated with land warfare, and the prestige associated with it. British naval historian [[Nicholas Rodger]] has described this as display of "the supreme symbol of royal power&amp;nbsp;... derived from its intimate association with armies, and consequently with princes".&lt;ref&gt;Rodger (2003), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; This was put to perhaps its greatest effect by the French "Sun King", [[Louis XIV]], in the form of a dedicated [[galley corps]]. Louis and the French state created a tool and symbol of royal authority that did little fighting, but was a potent extension of [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] ambitions. Galleys were built to scale for the royal flotilla at the [[Grand Canal of Versailles|Grand Canal]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] for the amusement of the court.&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the royal flotilla of Louis XIV, see Amélie Halna du Fretay, "[http://crcv.revues.org/10312#illustrations La flottille du Grand Canal de Versailles à l'époque de Louis XIV : diversité, technicité et prestige]" {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal galleys patrolled the Mediterranean, forcing ships of other states to salute the King's banner, convoyed ambassadors and cardinals, and obediently participating in naval parades and royal pageantry. Historian Paul Bamford described the galleys as vessels that "must have appealed to military men and to aristocratic officers&amp;nbsp;... accustomed to being obeyed and served".&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gouache of 17th century French royal galley-side.jpg|thumb|[[Gouache]] of a late 17th-century French royal galley. The vessel is richly decorated with red and blue [[damask]], [[brocade]] and [[velvet]] for the stern canopy and flags, and carved gilded ornaments on railings, outrigger and hull.]]
Sentencing criminals, political dissenters and religious deviants as galley rowers also turned the galley corps into a large, feared, and cost-effective prison system.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1974), pp. 275–278&lt;/ref&gt; French Protestants were particularly ill-treated at the oar and though they were only a small minority, their experiences came to dominate the legacy of the king's galleys. In 1909, French author [[Albert Savine]] (1859–1927) wrote that "[a]fter the Bastille, the galleys were the greatest horror of the old regime".&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1973), pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Long after convicts stopped serving in the galleys, and even after the reign of Napoleon, the term ''galérien'' ("galley rower") remained a symbolic general term for forced labor and convicts serving harsh sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford (1973), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a galley rower did not carry such stigma at Baltic, where galley rowers were [[conscription|conscripts]]: rather they considered themselves as marine soldiers. The main building of the Finnish Naval Academy at [[Suomenlinna]], [[Helsinki]] bears the nickname ''Kivikaleeri'' ("Stone Galley") as a legacy of the era.

==Surviving examples==
[[File:Galère La Liberté.JPG|thumbnail|''La Liberté'', a full-scale replica of a 17th-century galley in Switzerland, though without any rowing benches]]

===Original vessels===
The naval museum in [[Istanbul]] contains the galley ''Kadırga'' (Turkish for "galley", ultimately from Byzantine Greek ''katergon''), dating from the reign of Mehmed IV (1648–1687). She was the personal galley of the sultan, and remained in service until 1839. She is presumably the only surviving galley in the world, albeit without its masts. It is 37&amp;nbsp;m long, 5.7&amp;nbsp;m wide, has a draught of about 2&amp;nbsp;m, weighs about 140 tons, and has 48 oars powered by 144 oarsmen.

===Reconstructions===
A 1971 reconstruction of the [[Real (galley)|''Real'']], the flagship of [[John of Austria]] in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]], is in the Museu Marítim in [[Barcelona]]. The ship was 60&amp;nbsp;m long and 6.2&amp;nbsp;m wide, had a draught of 2.1&amp;nbsp;m, weighing 239 tons empty, was propelled by 290 rowers, and carried about 400 crew and fighting soldiers at Lepanto. She was substantially larger than the typical galleys of her time.

A group called "The Trireme Trust" operates, in conjunction with the Greek Navy, a reconstruction of an ancient Greek [[Trireme]], the ''Olympias''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/rowing/trireme/ The Trireme Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivlia (ship)|''Ivlia'']] is a replica Greek [[bireme]] built at [[Sochi]] on the [[Black Sea]] in 1989 which spent six seasons touring round Europe with volunteer crews.

The ''Nomos,'' another trireme originally built for [[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]], is preserved at [[Charlestown, Cornwall|Charlestown]] Shipwreck Museum in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://detritusofempire.blogspot.com/2014/05/cornwall-goes-to-movies.html Cornwall goes to the movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological finds===
In 1965, the remains of a small Venetian galley (fusta) sunk in 1509 were found in [[Lake Garda]], Italy. The vessel had been burned and only the lower hull remained.&lt;ref&gt;Scandurra, Enrico (1972), pp&amp;nbsp;209–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1990s, a sunken medieval galley was found close to the island of [[San Marco in Boccalama]], in the [[Venice Lagoon]].&lt;ref&gt;AA.VV., 2003, La galea di San Marco in Boccalama. Valutazioni scientifiche per un progetto di recupero (ADA - Saggi 1), Venice&lt;/ref&gt; The hull has been dated, for the context and the C14 analysis, between the end of the XIII and the beginning of the XIV century.

The excavation and the photogrammetric survey ([[photogrammetry]]) and 3D [[laser scanner]] of this important testimony of medieval nautical archaeology has started in 2001 through two complex executive phases.&lt;ref&gt;D'Agostino - Medas, (2003), Excavation and Recording of the medieval Hulls at San Marco in Boccalama (Venice), the INA Quarterly (Institute of Nautical Archaeology), 30, 1, Spring 2003, pp. 22–28&lt;/ref&gt; The stratigraphic excavation of the wreck was in fact performed entirely underwater, according to the archaeological methodologies. The survey of the hull was instead realized after the setting in dry the entire medieval perimeter of the submerged island. This operation took place through the infixation of a continuous barrier consisting of sheet piles and the use of water pumps. This long excavation and documentation campaign was directed by underwater archaeologist Marco D'Agostino and, as deputy director, by his colleague Stefano Medas.

The lower hull is mostly intact and it was not recovered due to high costs.

==Books==

===''Warrior of Rome''===
From the beginning Sidebottom intended the ''Warrior of Rome'' to be a series structured in trilogies.&lt;ref name="OT2" /&gt; The first three volumes take place in the Middle East and subsequent arcs are set around the [[Black Sea]], the Baltic, Sicily, North Africa, and Italy.&lt;ref name="OT1" /&gt; Sidebottom stated he drew inspiration for the series from historical writer [[Tacitus]] and commented that he had based several of the series' elements on real people and events from history.&lt;ref name="OT1" /&gt; The series has sold well, with ''Fire in the East'' selling over 100,000 copies and spending five weeks in the UK top 10 upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;"MJ expands deal with Sidebottom." The Bookseller 10 July 2009: 11. Literature Resource Center. Web. 22 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide the series has sold over half a million copies.

The series centres on the [[Angles|Anglo]]-Roman soldier '''Marcus Clodius Ballista''' (a fictionalized version of [[Balista]], a.k.a. Callistus, one of the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Thirty Tyrants]]) as he must live through and survive the machinations of the [[Roman Empire]] and several of the crises of the second half of the third century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Fire in the East|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59020-246-3|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Throne of the Caesars''===
Sidebottom has written another series set in ancient Rome and its empire called ''Throne of the Caesars''. The new trilogy is set 30 years before the first ''Warrior of Rome'' book in the reigns of [[Severus Alexander]] and [[Maximinus Thrax]], (AD 235–38), beginning with the assassination of Alexander and the deaths of [[Pupienus]] and [[Balbinus]]. It was described by The Times of London as "Absorbing and brilliant... Game of Thrones without the dragons", and was praised by Bob Carr, the former Premier of NSW, in a review article in The Australian (19 November 2016) www.theaustralian.com.au/.../review/...throne-of-the-caesars/.../72b26335f1d45918d2...


'''''The Last Hour'''''

A thriller set in the City of Rome. The hero has until sunset the next day to get across the eternal city, and save the Emperor. If he fails, his family will die. The Watch have orders to arrest him, while other sinister forces want him dead.

In 1921, he became the organizer and head of the scientific society and publishing house Atheist ({{lang-ru|"Атеист"}}).

'''James Burke''' (born 22 December 1936) is a British broadcaster, science historian, author, and television producer, who is known, among other things, for his [[documentary film|documentary]] [[television series]] ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978), and for its more philosophically oriented companion series, ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985), which is about the [[history of science and technology]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has called him "one of the most intriguing minds in the Western world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/news-letter-belfast-northern-ireland-the/mi_7950/is_2005_June_3/connecting-intriguing-minds-western/ai_n34034374/ Connecting with one of the most intriguing minds in the Western world]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Byline: IAN STARRETT, 2005/06/03, News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland), The Newspaper / BNET {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Burke was born in [[Derry]], Northern Ireland, and was educated at [[Maidstone Grammar School]] and at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], where he earned an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] degree in [[Middle English]]. Upon graduation he moved to Italy, where at the British School in [[Bologna]] he was lecturer in English and director of studies, 1961–63.  He also lectured at the [[University of Urbino]].  Thereafter he was headmaster of the English School in Rome, 1963–65. He was also involved in the creation of an English&amp;ndash;Italian dictionary, and the publication of an art encyclopedia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Burke's entry into television was explained by the American [[People (magazine)|''People'']] magazine in 1979: "Television beckoned by chance one day on a Rome bus. Spotting an ad for a reporter for the local bureau of Britain's [[ITV Granada|Granada TV]], he says, 'I decided if the bus stopped at the next corner I would get off and apply for the job.' It did, he did, and the next thing he knew 'we went straight off to Sicily to do a series on the Mafia.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tweedy|first1=Ann|title=Technology Is All Connections, Says James Burke—but Between Sleepless Monks and Henry Ford?|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074932,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=12|issue=18|date= 29 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, he moved to London and joined the Science and Features Department of the [[BBC]], for which he was host or co-host of several programmes. He also worked as an instructor in English as a Foreign Language at the Regency Language School in [[Ramsgate]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Burke established his reputation as a reporter on the [[BBC1]] science series ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' and went on to present ''[[The Burke Special]]''. He was BBC television's science anchorman and chief reporter for the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] missions, as the main presenter of the [[British television Apollo 11 coverage|BBC's coverage of the first moon landing]] in 1969.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In collaboration with [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]], he produced the ten-part documentary series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978), which was first broadcast on the BBC, and subsequently on [[PBS]] in the United States. ''Connections'' traced the historical relationships between invention and discovery: each episode chronicled a particular path of technological development. ''Connections'' was the most-watched PBS television series up to that time. It was followed by the twenty-part ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994) and the ten-part ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1997). ''Connections: An Alternative View of Change'' was broadcast in more than fifty countries and the companion book ''Connections: An Alternative History of Technology'' (1978) sold well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1980, Burke and Jackson produced the six-part BBC series ''The Real Thing'', about perception.

In 1985, Burke, with Richard Reisz and John Lynch, produced the ten-part series ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (revised 1995), which concentrated on the philosophical aspects of scientific change in [[Western culture]].

Burke has also been a regular writer for ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', and a consultant to the [[SETI]] project.

Burke has received the gold and the silver medals of the [[Royal Television Society]]. In 1998 he was made an honorary fellow of the [[Society for Technical Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stc.org/component/content/article/83-honors-articles/888-previous-honorary-fellows |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610213505/http://www.stc.org/component/content/article/83-honors-articles/888-previous-honorary-fellows |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 June 2015 |title=Previous Honorary Fellows |work=Society for Technical Communication |accessdate=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke has also contributed to podcasts, such as in 2008 when he appeared on Hardcore History with [[Dan Carlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dancarlin.com/dccart/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=144 |title=Hardcore History |work=A Fly on James Burke's Wall |accessdate=21 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607183153/http://dancarlin.com/dccart/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=144 |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 on Common Sense with Dan Carlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/ |title=Common Sense |work=Reconnections with James Burke |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to newspaper articles including two series for the Mogollon Connection by [[Jesse Horn]], one focusing on the nature of morality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azalert.com/mogollonconnection/?p=793 |title=Chasing Demons |work=The biology of good |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other on the future of our youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azalert.com/mc/090308child4.htm |title=For the Sake of Our Children |work=Disconnection |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke presented a monologue ''James Burke on the End of Scarcity'', first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 26 December 2017, in which he predicted [[Nanotechnology|nanotech]]-manufacturing would revolutionize the world economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBC episode|id=b09jvfc4|episode=James Burke on the End of Scarcity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Knowledge Web''&lt;span id="KnowledgeWeb"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
Burke is the leading figure in the development of the ''Knowledge Web'', to be the digital realization of his books and television programmes, and which will allow the user to travel through history and create his or her own connections. Eventually, the project may feature immersive virtual-reality historical recreations of people, places, and events.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Connections app ==
Burke is developing a [[mobile app]] called Connections which aims to allow users to make searches in Wikipedia in ways that could lead them to develop mind associations and connections of apparently unrelated fields of knowledge or topics.  Surprises, anomalies, and unexpected perspectives on a search can emerge from using the app.  According to Burke, the Connections app is an alternative and innovative method to more linear internet search engines such as [[Google Search|Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/11/17/james-burkes-new-project-ai.html|title=James Burke’s new project aims to help us deal with change, think connectively, and benefit from surprise|date=2016-11-17|website=Boing Boing|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions==
In an article for the ''[[Radio Times]]'' in 1973, Burke predicted the widespread use of computers for business decisions, the creation of metadata banks of personal information, and changes in human behaviour, such as greater willingness to reveal personal information to strangers. In an interview on the ''[[PM (Radio 4)|PM]]'' programme on BBC Radio 4 on 30 August 2013, Burke discussed his predictions of a [[post-scarcity economy]] driven by advances in [[Molecular assembler#Nanofactories|nanofactories]], which he believes may be viable by the year 2043.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audioboo.fm/boos/1574606-james-burke-predicted-the-future-in-1973-now-he-does-it-again |title=Audioboo / James Burke predicted the future in 1973. Now he does it again |publisher=Audioboo.fm |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke posed at least one of his predictions within a question. In ''Connections'', he pointed out that the increase in possible connections over time causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to [[Accelerating change|accelerate]]. So, what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, ''becomes too much for the average person to handle'', and what does this mean for individual power, liberty, and privacy?

In the conclusion of ''Connections'', Burke said that computing and communications might be controlled by a [[computer science]] élite. Later, in addition to this, he suggested in the conclusion of ''The Day the Universe Changed'' that a [[web 2.0|worldwide revolution]] in communications and computer technology would allow people to [[social media|instantaneously exchange ideas and opinions]].

'''Jan Roegiers''' (1944–2013) was a professor at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], and also university archivist, librarian and curator. He specialised in [[early modern]] academic history, and in particular the history of the [[Old University of Leuven|pre-1797 University of Leuven]]. During his lifetime he was "generally regarded as one of the most authoritative voices in the world of academic history, archive and library science and the heritage sector in Belgium."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Delsaerdt, [http://www.vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/nieuws/2013/07/2895-professor-jan-roegiers-overleden "Professor Jan Roegiers overleden"], ''Vlaamse Erfgoedbibliotheek'', 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with giving the newly established Flemish university (an independent institution only from 1968) a sense of historical continuity with Leuven's past.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Derez, [http://bib.kuleuven.be/ub/nieuws/2013/ere-hoofdbibliothecaris-jan-roegiers-overleden "Ere-hoofdbibliothecaris Jan Roegiers overleden"], University Library News, 11 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jan Roegiers was born in [[Sleidinge]], [[East Flanders]], on 19 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Noël Geirnaert, [http://www.vvbad.be/sites/www.vvbad.be/files/artikel/file/META_201306_Personalia.pdf "In memoriam Jan Roegiers (1944-2013)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216132551/http://www.vvbad.be/sites/www.vvbad.be/files/artikel/file/META_201306_Personalia.pdf |date=2015-02-16 }}, META (newsletter of the Vlaamse Vereniging voor Bibliotheek, Archief &amp; Documentatie), 2013/6.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the Sint-Vincentiuscollege in Eeklo and from there entered the diocesan seminary in Ghent. After a short time in the seminary he enrolled at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], where he completed degrees in History and in [[Preservation (library and archival science)|library and archive science]].

==Academic career==
He became a senior lecturer in the faculty of Arts and the faculty of Theology, chief archivist of the university (1975–2009), head of [[Academic libraries in Leuven|Leuven University Library]] (1981–1996), and curator of the university's art collection (1983–2009).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Derez, [http://bib.kuleuven.be/ub/nieuws/2013/ere-hoofdbibliothecaris-jan-roegiers-overleden "Ere-hoofdbibliothecaris Jan Roegiers overleden"], University Library News, 11 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was director of the ''[[Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique]]'' (1990-2009), chair of the editorial board of ''[[Lias (journal)|LIAS: Journal of Early Modern Intellectual Culture and its Sources]]'' (1993-2009), and chair of the editorial board of ''[[Trajecta]]'' (1998-2009).&lt;ref&gt;Martine De Reu, [http://kadoc.kuleuven.be/trajecta_portal/nl/actu/ann_first.php "In memoriam Jan Roegiers (19 oktober 1944 – 12 juli 2013)"], Trajecta Portal&lt;/ref&gt; He was a moving influence on the early stages of the Flemish [[short-title catalogue]] (STCV).&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Delsaerdt, [http://www.vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/nieuws/2013/07/2895-professor-jan-roegiers-overleden "Professor Jan Roegiers overleden"], ''Vlaamse Erfgoedbibliotheek'', 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roegiers gave his valedictory lecture, on academic heritage and university history, on 19 February 2010. On the same occasion he was presented with a [[Festschrift]] celebrating his career, ''The Quintessence of Lives: Intellectual Biographies in the Low Countries presented to Jan Roegiers'', edited by P. Delsaerdt, H. Schwall, D. Vanysacker, and [[Jean-Pierre Delville|J.-P. Delville]] (Brepols, 2010). His retirement was marked with a special exhibition in Leuven University's Central Library, ''Anima Academiae Bibliotheca'', from 10 June to 25 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/agenda/2010/06/943-tentoonstelling-anima-academiae-bibliotheca&lt;/ref&gt;

Roegiers died on 12 July 2013 and was buried on 19 July in the Sint-Jan-de-Doperkerk in Leuven. The reading room of the university archive was named "Jan Roegiers reading room" in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blfhe_20130718_001 "KU Leuven betoont eer aan overleden professor"], ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'', 18 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl August Wittfogel''' ({{zh|t=魏復古|p=Wèi Fùgǔ}}; 6 September 1896 – 25 May 1988) was a [[German-American]] [[playwright]], [[historian]], and [[sinologist]]. Originally a [[Marxist]] and an active member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], after the [[Second World War]] Wittfogel was an equally fierce [[anti-communist]].

==Biography==

Karl August Wittfogel was born 6 September 1896 at [[Woltersdorf, Lower Saxony|Woltersdorf]], in [[Lüchow]], [[Province of Hanover]]. Wittfogel left school in 1914. He studied philosophy, history, sociology, geography at [[Leipzig University]] and also in Munich, Berlin and Rostock and in 1919 again in Berlin. From 1921 he studied sinology in Leipzig. In between Wittfogel was drafted into a Signal Corps Unit (''Fernmeldeeinheit'') in 1917&lt;ref&gt;See the useful Wittfogel page of his high school, the [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums|Johanneum]], Lüneburg and esp. Ulrich Menzel's excellent online presentation in the ''Personenlexikon Internationale Beziehungen virtuell''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[First World War]], he was the leader of the Lüneburg [[German Youth Movement|Wandervogel]] group.&lt;ref&gt;Lit.: Walter Laqueur, ''Young Germany'', 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he set up the Lüneburg local&lt;ref&gt;Lit.: Mathias Greffrath, ''Ein ernster Mensch'', Die Zeit, 10. 6. 1988 (online archives). Later Wittfogel wrote under the pseudonym "Jungmann" am account of youth movements in [[Max Horkheimer]]'s compilation "Studies in Authority and the Family." Unfortunately, although Horkheimer's and [[Herbert Marcuse's]] contributions have been translated, Wittfogel's have not been.
:Wittfogel who had been a leader of the German Socialist Student Movement after the war beside [[Klaus Reichenbach]] liked [[Rudi Dutschke]] when they met in Düsseldorf in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; of the radical [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD). In 1920, he joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD).&lt;ref&gt;At the ''Meißnertag'' 1923, a large  Youth Movement gathering, Wittfogel asked the members of the ''Freideutsche Jugend'': "''In Wahrheit steht jedes Zeitalter unter einer großen Idee. Habt ihr diese große Idee. Seid ihr bereit dafür zu sterben?''" Wittfogel asked them if they knew the need of the age, its big idea and if they had what it takes to die for their convictions.
:Lit.: Karl-Otto Schüddekopf, ''Linke Leute von rechts'', Stuttgart, 1960.
:After expelling a strong radical group in the autumn of 1919, the KPD was basically a sect, until a majority of USPD delegates decided to join it at their party convention in October 1920. A third of USPD members (ca. 300,000) joined the 70,000-strong KPD.
:Lit.: Ossip K. Flechtheim, ''Die KPD in der Weimarer Republik'' (1st edition 1948), Frankfurt, 1969 edition, pp. 35f., 156f.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittfogel met [[Karl Korsch]] in 1920&lt;ref&gt;M. Buckmiller says not only because W. taught at the Volkshochschule Schloss [[Tinz]], but also because of Korsch's wife Dr. [[Hedda Korsch]], who was active in the school reform movement.&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited to the 1923 conference that helped establish the [[Institute for Social Research]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Weil]] financed and [[Richard Sorge]] organized this ''Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche'' (1st marxist workweek) with [[Karl Korsch]] and [[Hedda Korsch]], [[Georgy Lukacs]], [[Béla Fogarasi]], his later wife [[Margarete Lissauer]], Felix José and Käthe Weil (they were married 1921-1929), Richard and Christiane Sorge, [[Friedrich Pollock]], [[Julian Gumperz]] and his later wife [[Hede Massing]], from 1919 to 1923 married to [[Gerhart Eisler]], [[Konstantin Zetkin]], [[Fukomoto]], [[Eduard Ludwig Alexander]] and [[Gertrud Alexander]], their kid, and others. Rose Wittfogel, born Schlesinger, also took part. They were married from 1921 (other sources say 1920) to 1929. She was a sculptor, later a librarian at the Frankfurt Institute. She emigrated to the Soviet Union and worked there (among other things?) as a translator at the VAGAAR, an Organisation for foreign workers.
:Michael Buckmiller, ''Die "Marxistische Arbeitswoche" 1923 und die Gründung des "Instituts für Sozialforschung"'', in Willem van Reijen, Gunzelin Schmid Noerr (eds.), ''Grand Hotel Abgrund'', p. 141-182. For Rose Schlesinger p. 148, citing D. Pike, ''Deutsche Schriftsteller im sowjetischen Exil, 1934-1945'', Frankfurt am Main, 1981, S. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1925 to 1933 was a member of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;If he seems not to really belong to the famous [[Frankfurt School]], it may be because of his Marxism, his activism or even because he was not Jewish.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Ph.D. from the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurter Universität]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;His supervisors were [[Wilhelm Gerloff]], [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] and [[Franz Oppenheimer]]. His thesis was ''On the Economical Importance  of the Agrarian and Industrial Productive Forces in China'',
:''Die ökonomische Bedeutung der agrikolen und industriellen Produktivkräfte Chinas'', W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart. 1930.
:This was the first chapter of ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft Chinas'', 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittfogel was always an active and faithful member of the communist party and a vocal critic of all its enemies.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Mass Psychology of Fascism'', Wilhelm Reich mentions a bizarre debate with Otto Strasser on religion, in a Berlin mass meeting, in January, 1933.
:In a short 1974 notice to a reprint of his 1929 essay on Political Geography, Wittfogel says he came out much stronger against the Nazis than the KPD and [[Comintern|Komintern]] line wanted.
:Lit.: ''Politische Geography'', Josef Matznetter, ed., Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt, 1977, p. 230.
:Communist students at Jena invited him and [[Alfred Bäumler]] for a debate on the importance of Hegel for the Germany of today. Bäumler was a specialist on Kant, Nietzsche and [[Bachofen]]. He soon became a leading Nazi philosopher.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Machtergreifung|Hitler came to power]] in 1933, Wittfogel tried to escape to Switzerland, but was arrested and interned in prisons and [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Borgermoor Moorlager [[Esterwegen]] im [[Emsland]], a peat bog-camp in the Emsland and in [[Lichtenburg concentration camp|Lichtenburg]] near [[Torgau]].
:Lit.: A novel ''Staatliches Konzentrationslager VII, Eine "Erziehungsanstalt" im Dritten Reich'' was first published in London, 1936 under the pen name ''Klaus Hinrichs''. German edition: Edition Temmen, Bremen, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; An international outcry&lt;ref&gt;His second wife [[Olga Joffe]] worked tirelessly for his release and, with the help of nationalbolshevist revolutionary [[Friedrich Hielscher]] and the also radical right-wing geographer [[Karl Haushofer]] and the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] historian [[R. H. Tawney]], managed to get Wittfogel free (Mathias Greffrath, Martin Jay).&lt;/ref&gt; led to his freedom in 1934.

He left Germany for England and then the United States. Wittfogel's belief in the Soviet Union was destroyed with the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], and he began to hate the totalitarian, "asiatic" nature of Soviet and [[Chinese Communism]] from Lenin to Mao. He turned against his former comrades and denounced some of them, as well as American scholars such as [[Owen Lattimore]] and [[Moses I. Finley]], at the [[McCarran Committee]] hearings in 1951.  He came to believe that the state-owned economies of the [[Soviet bloc]] inevitably led to despotic governments even more oppressive than those of "traditional Asia" and that those regimes were the greatest threat to the future of all mankind.

In 1921 Wittfogel married Rose Schlesinger. Wittfogel's second wife was the sociologist [[Olga Lang|Olga (Joffe) Lang]], a Russian sociologist who traveled with him to China and collaborated with him on a project to analyze the Chinese family. Lang later published a monograph on the Chinese family and a biography of the anarchist writer, [[Ba Jin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/7x/tf2s20027x/files/tf2s20027x.pdf Register of Karl Wittfogel Papers Hoover Institution]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Esther Schiff Goldfrank]] became Wittfogel's wife in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Levitas, ''Esther Schiff Goldfrank'', p. 120- 126, in ''Women Anthropologists'', Ute Gacs, editor, new ed., University of Illinois Press, Chicago, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittfogel held academic positions at [[Columbia University]] from 1939 and was professor for Chinese history at the [[University of Washington]] from 1947 to 1966. He died of pneumonia on May 25, 1988 at [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/26/obituaries/karl-a-wittfogel-social-scientist-who-turned-on-communists-91.html | title=Karl A.

==Playwright==

In the early 1920s, Wittfogel wrote a number of communist, but also somewhat expressionistic, plays: "The Cripple", performed with other short plays on October 14, 1920 at [[Erwin Piscator|Erwin Piscator's]] Berlin Proletarian Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Piscator himself played the Cripple at the opening. [[John Heartfield]] managed a half-hour late delivery of the backdrop, [[Erwin Piscator]], ''Das politische Theater'' [new edition], Hamburg, 1963, S. 48f., note 1. Reprinted in ''Literatur im Klassenkampf, Zur proletarisch-revolutionären Literaturtheorie 1919-1923, Eine Dokumentation von Walter Fähnders und Martin Rector'', Fischer, Frankfurt am Main, 1974, p. 242f.. The Proletarian Theatre bill (''I. Programm-Ausgabe'') for this evening on pages 206ff..The [[German Communist Party|KPD]] newspaper ''[[Die Rote Fahne]]'' published a harsh review of the plays, ''G. G. L.'' (Gertrud Alexander), ''Proletarisches Theater'', ''Die Rote Fahne'', Vol. 3, 1920, No. 210, Oct. 17. This and ''Proletarisches Theater und der Gegner'', Julian Gumperz's answer with another short notice by Gertrud Alexander (''Die Rote Fahne'', 3, 1920, no. 213, Oct. 21), ''Literatur im Klassenkampf'', pages 208 to 213.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Red Soldiers", "The Man Who Has an Idea", "The Mother", "The Refugee", "The Skyscraper" and "Who is the Biggest Fool?", all of which were published by ''Malik''.&lt;ref&gt;''Who Is the Biggest Fool?'' was produced (the text adapted) by [[Gustav von Wangenheim|Gustav von Wangenheim's]] ''Truppe 1931'' (troop 1931) early in 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Wittfogel declined an offer to become the dramatic producer of the revolutionary Volksbühne (People's Stage) in Berlin, because he wanted to concentrate on his academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/research/showcase/1949b.html "Karl A. Wittfogel and His Provocative Theory of Oriental Despotism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221726/http://www.washington.edu/research/showcase/1949b.html |date=2009-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published some long Hegelian essays on aesthetics and literature in ''Die Linkskurve'', journal of the Association of Proletarian Revolutionary  Writers, and was a member of its editorial staff from April 1930.&lt;ref&gt;His conservative aesthetics put Wittfogel on Lukacs' side -- not what might have been expected from his plays. With the earlier [[Dada]] and [[Proletkult]] debates, the Mehring-, documentary- and proletarian-literature feud, from 1928 on became part of the long and bitter debate on literary modernism and communism, which culminated in the 1930s onslaught on [[Expressionism]] in the Moscow journal ''Das Wort''. The whole sorry mess was rekindled in the 1960s as the  [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]-Lukacs debate. At the time, Brecht had not really been able to publish his views.
:Helga Gallas, ''Marxistische Literaturtheorie'', Luchterhand, Neuwied, 1971, on the 1928-1933 [[Bund Proletarisch Revolutionärer Schriftsteller]].
The Maoist [[Jan Myrdal]] in 1974 accused Wittfogel, [[Kurt Sauerland]] and [[George Lukacs]], who were in favour of "culture" and an "elitist" aesthetics in the so-called "Mehring debate", to have turned Marxism into a theology and thus brought Hitler to power. "Wittfogel, Sauerland, Lukács tragen eine schwere historische Verantwortung" (p. 95, "are to blame for the course of history").
:Jan Myrdal who has written about China for nearly fifty years without knowing the language, also called Wittfogel non-intellectual, uncouth ("ungeschlacht") and a pretend professor.
:Lit.: [[Lars Gustafsson]] and Jan Myrdal, ''Die unnötige Gegenwart'', Hanser, München, 1975, pp. 85- 95. First published as ''Den onödiga Samtiden'', Stockholm, 1974.
Jan Myrdal also called Wittfogel "parteikonformer...Ideologe", "spineless follower of the party line", but while Wittfogel believed in the party at least until 1933 and still sometimes fiercely defended it until at least around 1939 (he broke with [[Paul Massing]] over the [[Ruth Fischer]] revelations), even in the 1920s Wittfogel had ideas of his own, e.g. on nature, which to him could never simply be a  part of human history and pure object of thinking, an idea Lukacs did not like at all. With very few others he took Marx's idea of a genuine "asiatic" way of pre-capitalist development seriously. At a Leningrad conference in 1931, all those ideas of an "asiatic" "mode of production" were shot down and buried by the Stalinist majority. They resurfaced around 1960, but by then Wittfogel was of course a non-person in communist eyes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oriental Despotism==

Wittfogel is best known for his monumental work ''[[Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power]]'', first published in 1957. Starting from a Marxist analysis of the ideas of [[Max Weber]] on China and India's "hydraulic-bureaucratic official-state" and building on Marx's sceptical view of the [[Asiatic Mode of Production]], Wittfogel came up with an analysis of [[Oriental despotism]] which emphasized the role of irrigation works, the bureaucratic structures needed to maintain them and the impact that these had on society, coining the term "[[hydraulic empire]]" to describe the system. In his view, many societies, mainly in Asia, relied heavily on the building of large-scale irrigation works. To do this, the state had to organize forced labor from the population at large. As only a centralized administration could organize the building and maintenance of large-scale systems of irrigation, the need for such systems made [[bureaucratic despotism]] inevitable in so-called Oriental lands. This structure was uniquely placed to also crush civil society and any other force capable of mobilizing against the state. Such a state would inevitably be despotic, powerful, stable and wealthy. Wittfogel believed this hydraulic hypothesis applied to Russia under the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The sinologist [[Frederick W. Mote]], however, strongly disagreed with Wittfogel's analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Mote  |first = Frederick W. |authorlink = |title =The Growth of Chinese Despotism: A Critique of Wittfogel's Theory of Oriental Despotism as Applied to China |journal =Oriens Extremus |volume =8 |issue = 1 |pages =1–41 |date =1961 |language = |url = |jstor =  43382295 |issn = |doi = |accessdate = |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others, such as [[Barrington Moore]], [[George Lichtheim]] and especially [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] are among those who found the thesis stimulating. [[F. Tökei]], [[Gianni Sofri]], [[Maurice Godelier]] and Wittfogel's estranged pupil [[Lawrence Krader]], then Maoist [[F. Kramer]] or [[Claus Leggewie]]/[[Helmut Raich]] concentrated on the concept. Two Berlin leaders of the SDS student movement, [[Rudi Dutschke]] and [[Bernd Rabehl]], have published on these themes. Then East German dissident Rudolf Bahro later said that his ''Alternative in Eastern Europe'' was based on ideas of Wittfogel, but because of the latter's later anti-communism, Wittfogel could not be mentioned by name. Bahro's later ecological ideas, recounted in ''From Red to Green'' and elsewhere were likewise inspired by Wittfogel's geographical determinism.

The Hydraulic Society thesis was also taken up by ecological anthropologists such as [[Marvin Harris]]. Further applications of the thesis included that to Mayan society, when aerial photographs revealed the network of canals in the Mayan areas of [[Yucatan]]. Critics have denied that Ceylon or Bali are truly hydraulic in the Wittfogel sense.

'''Karl Bittel''' (22 June 1892 – 18 April 1969) was a [[Germany|German]] left-wing [[Historian]] and [[Journalist]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=303|author2=[[Andreas Herbst]]|author1=[[Bernd-Rainer Barth]]|title=Bittel, Karl * 22.6.1892, † 18.4.1969 Direktor des Deutschen Instituts für Zeitgeschichte|publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken |language= German| accessdate= 1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Karl Bittel was born in [[Darmstadt]].   His father was a bank worker.   He attended school at [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] in the south-west of Germany, across the [[River Rhine|Rhine]] from [[Mulhouse]].   He passed his [[Abitur|school final exams]] in 1911.   By that time he had already co-founded a Freiburg [[Wandervogel]] youth group, for which he produced a news-sheet.   Then, between 1911 and 1915, he studied [[Economics]] (''[[:de:Volkswirtschaft|Volkswirtschaft]]''), [[Law]] and [[History]] at the universities of [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;   It was while he was at Tübingen that he joined the [[:de: Deutsche Akademische Freischar|Deutsche Akademische Freischar]], a (relatively) forward looking student fraternity.   He received his doctorate from Tübingen in 1915 for a dissertation on the consumer-co-operative movement pioneer, [[Eduard Pfeiffer]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eduard Pfeiffer]] und die dt. Konsumgenossenschaftsbewegung'' in Tübingen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittel was a volunteer contributor to the "Freiburger Volksstimme", a local newspaper at the popular end of the political spectrum, and served between 1913 and 1916 as Secretary for Consumers Club in nearby [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]].   At the same time he was publishing articles on the Co-Operative movement.   In August 1914 [[First World War|war]] had broken out, and it ended in November 1918 with military defeat for Germany and her allies.   During the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolutionary year]] that ensued in Germany Bittel was a member of the [[:de:Arbeiter- und Soldatenrat|Soldiers' and Workers']] [[Workers' council|Council]] in [[Karlsruhe]].   In 1919 Bittel became a member of the newly established [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;

He became a lecturer at the Party Main Academy in Jena in 1920, and then editor of a [[Chemnitz]] based newspaper called "Kämpfer" (''"Fighters"'').   This was just one of a succession of radical left-wing journals which he produced or for which he was writing during this time.   The early 1920s saw a splintering on the political left in Germany, triggered in part by contrasting reactions to the fast moving political events in the [[Soviet Union]], but Bittel remained true to the mainstream Communist Party through the period, becoming head of the Party Central Committee's "Co-operatives Department" in 1922.   1922 was also the year in which he became, in November, a Communist Party member of the town council in [[Weißenfels]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In 1923 he was a delegate to the [[Comintern]]'s First World Congress of Farmers' organisation (identified in some sources as ''"Krestintern"'').&lt;ref&gt;Protokoll vom Ersten Internationalen Bauernkongress. Vom
10. bis 16. Oktober 1923 in Moskau. Neues Dorf, Berlin, 1924 (Bibliothek des Internationalen Bauern-Rates, Vol. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;   Bittel then remained in the [[Soviet Union]], till 1927 working as Secretary to the [[Communist International|Comintern]]'s Co-Operative section.   In August 1927 he returned to Germany.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;   In 1928 he took charge of the administration office for Soviet trade representation, and then, from 1930 till (formally) April 1933 at the Berlin-based successor Soviet-German organisation known as DEROP AG.   [[Machtergreifung|Régime change]] came to Germany in January 1933 and the [[Adolf Hitler|new Chancellor]] lost little time in [[Gleichschaltung|moving the country]] towards [[One-party state|one-]][[Nazi Party|party dictatorship]].   Membership of alternative political parties became illegal, with the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] a particular target for state persecution.   During the early months of 1933 Karl Bittel left Berlin and settled in [[Bodman-Ludwigshafen]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodman-Ludwigshafen is a small village on the [[Bodensee]], and has vanishingly little in common with the industrial city [[Ludwigshafen]] made famous by [[BASF]] and [[Helmut Kohl]].&lt;/ref&gt;   It was in his new home in a village on the shores of the [[Bodensee]] that Bittel was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in May 1933.   He spent the next year or so in detention in [[concentration camp]]s at [[Lager Heuberg|Heuberg]] and then just outside [[:de:KZ Oberer Kuhberg|Ulm]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;

He was released in 1934.   Unlike many Communists, he was able to remain in Germany during the twelve years of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]], but there is no evidence of his having engaged in any sort of political activity during this time.  He was able to live unmolested in his remote lake-side village, focusing on academic research.   He was even able to have some of his work published:  a work involving [[Paracelsus]] was printed in 1942.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ParacKB&gt;{{cite book|title=Paracelsus im Bauernkrieg? Eine Korrektur zu seiner Biographie|author=Harl Bittel| date=1942| publisher=[[:de:Propyläen Verlag|Propyläen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1945 [[Second World War|war]] ended.   What remained of Germany was divided up into [[Allied-occupied Germany|four occupation zones]], in which membership of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] was no longer illegal.   Bittel now joined the Party Secretariat and the party's regional leadership team for [[South Baden|Baden]], where he also became Chairman of the Baden branch of the [[Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime]], a post he held till Summer 1949.   In addition, in 1946 he co-founded a Communist Newspaper based in [[Offenburg]], entitled "Unser Tag" (''"Our Day"''), becoming "licence holder" and editor in chief of the publication till 1948.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;

By 1949 it had become clear that whatever the future might hold for Germany, the portion of it under [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet administration]] was developing very differently from the zones occupied by the other three victorious wartime powers.   As the [[Berlin Blockade|Soviet blockade]] of [[West Berlin]] was lifted, in May 1949 the US, British and American zones were combined and re-founded as the [[West Germany|German Federal Republic]].   Bittel's prompt reaction was to relocate the same month from what was now designated [[West Germany]], to the [[Soviet occupation zone]], which itself would be re-founded a few months later, in October, as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic]].   Between 1949 and 1957 Bittel served as deputy head, and then from 1951 as head of the [[:de:Deutsches Institut für Zeitgeschichte|German Institute for Contemporary History (''Deutsches Institut für Zeitgeschichte"'')]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;

From 1951 till 1953 he also held office as the Senior Chairman of the [[GDR Union of Journalists|(East) German Union of Journalists]].   He was made an honorary professor at the [[Leipzig University|"Karl Marx University"]] (as it was then know) in [[Leipzig]], and in 1957 became a full professor, with a teaching position, at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].   That year he was also invited to present a series of guest lectures in the [[Soviet Union]].   In 1958 his job portfolio was boosted with a special advisory post to the East German [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (East Germany)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]].   Between 1963 and 1969 he also belonged to the Presidium of the [[Rostock]] branch of the national [[Cultural Association of the GDR|Culture Association]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKB/&gt;

Bittel was one of a small but determined group of like-minded historians who promoted the orienting of historical seminars and institutions according to the precepts of East Germany's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (SED / ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'')]].   This was seen as necessary because, especially in the early years of the German Democratic Republic, the country's mainstream historians were drawn, for the most part, from outside the [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historical tradition]].   Nevertheless, in the judgement of [[Lothar Mertens]],  Karl Bittel -  along with colleagues such as [[Horst Bartel]], [[Walter Bartel]], [[Rudolf Lindau (politician)|Rudolf Lindau]] and [[Albert Schreiner]] - lacked the necessary skill and rigour sufficiently to distance their academic output from the category of "mere" party propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Mertens: ''Priester der Klio oder Hofchronisten der Partei?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1450">A '''Legist''', from the Latin ''lex'' 'law', is any expert or student of law.

It was especially used since the [[Carolingian]] dynasty for royal councillors who advised the monarch in legal matters, and specifically helped base its absolutist ambitions on [[Roman Law]]. More generally they were teachers of civil or Roman law, who, besides expounding sources, explaining terms, elucidating texts, summarizing the contents of chapters etc., illustrated by cases, real or imaginary, the numerous questions and distinctions arising out of the "Corpus Juris" enactments of the ancient Roman code.
 
From the twelfth century, when a fresh impulse was given to legal researches, the terms legist and [[decretist]] -- the latter applied, in the narrower sense, to the interpreter of ecclesiastical [[canon law]] and commentator on the canonical texts—have been carefully distinguished.
 
Legists came to be employed by lower authorities in the feudal pyramid. The rise of universities would lead to academical lawyers taking their place in the western world.

By analogy, the term is also applied to equivalent legal advisers in other traditions, e.g. in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and/or civil law of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

'''Peter Robert Lamont Brown''', [[British Academy|FBA]], (born 26 July 1935) is [[Princeton University Department of History|Rollins Professor of History Emeritus]] at [[Princeton University]]. He is credited with having brought coherence to the field of [[Late Antiquity]], and is sometimes regarded as the inventor of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Peter Brown {{!}} Department of History|url=http://history.princeton.edu/people/peter-brown|website=history.princeton.edu|access-date=2016-01-31}} Ruby Shao, "Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity", ''The Daily Princetonian'', Apr. 20, 2017: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; His work has concerned, in particular, the religious culture of the later [[Roman Empire]] and early [[medieval Europe]], and the relation between religion and society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/history/people/display_person.xml?netid=prbrown Faculty Page] at Princeton University.

==Early life==

Peter Brown was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland, in 1935, to a Scots-Irish [[Protestant]] family. Until 1939, he spent winter and spring each year in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], where his father worked as a railway engineer based at [[Khartoum]]. For the rest of the year, he would return with his mother to [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], in Co. Wicklow, near Dublin. Following the outbreak of war, Brown and his mother remained in Ireland, though his father did not return finally until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 8; Ruby Shao, "Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity", ''The Daily Princetonian'', Apr. 20, 2017: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown has written and spoken about the influence of the Sudanese connection on several occasions. Speaking to the ''Daily Princetonian'', he has remarked: '"Living in the Sudan put in me a love of the Middle East, a real interest in it, distant memories of a very sunny world with large, dark Sudanese servants in long white robes"', combined with memories of 'hippopotami, crocodiles, and camels under starry skies'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Shao, "Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity", ''The Daily Princetonian'', Apr. 20, 2017: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; After his father had returned to Ireland, 'a handbook of ''Sudanese Courtesy Customs'', containing delicate Arabic phrases of greeting and polite enquiry, was prominent on his bookshelf, as was a deluxe edition of T.E. Lawrence's ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', which I would read, from cover to cover, every time that I returned home on holiday from my school in England.'&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Such influences, with 'roots deep in my childhood, already ensured, perhaps, that both religion and the "exotic" (the non-European and, by implication, the non-classical) were both too large, too ever-present and too rich for their intrusion into the classical world to be dismissed out of hand, as unambiguously negative symptoms of decline. The power of both had begun to puzzle and intrigue me. The collapse of an enlightened empire might, indeed, be a catastrophic event, for all I knew; but it was unlikely to be uninteresting.'&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown was educated at Aravon School - now closed but, at that time, a distinguished preparatory school in Bray, where he first studied Latin and French.&lt;ref&gt;James Howard-Johnston, 'Introduction', in J. Howard-Johnston &amp; P. A. Hayward, ''The Cult of Saints in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages: Essays on the Contribution of Peter Brown'' (Oxford, 2000), 1-24, at 1; Ruby Shao, "Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity", ''The Daily Princetonian'', Apr. 20, 2017: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity; [https://www.irishtimes.com/news/aravon-not-like-a-normal-school-1.96659| Nuala Haughey, 'Aravon "not like a normal school"', The Irish Times, 14 August 1997]; [https://www.independent.ie/regionals/braypeople/news/de-burgh-sells-former-aravon-school-to-john-scottus-school-35394657.html 'De Burgh sells former Aravon school to John Scottus school', Independent.ie, 28 January 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Brown entered [[Shrewsbury School]] in Shropshire, one of the prominent [[Public school (England)|"public" schools]] in England, on a scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acls.org/Publications/OP/Haskins/2003_PeterBrown.pdf "A Life of Learning", Charles Homer Haskins Lecture 2003], p.3; Ruby Shao, "Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity", ''The Daily Princetonian'', Apr. 20, 2017: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Shrewsbury School that Brown, who initially expected to concentrate on sciences, first studied Ancient Greek and turned in earnest to the study of history: 'I myself had become a keen amateur astronomer, and had re-invented gunpowder to the detriment of my aunt's carpet. I fully intended to enter the Science stream of my new school. My housemaster summoned me to his study. In between puffs of his pipe, he announced with utter certainty: "Brown, you did too well in [the] Entrance [examination] to do Science. You shall do ... Greek." And Greek I did, if only for one year, before taking the Junior Certificate and then lapsing from the high calling of a classical scholar in the English Public School tradition into the study of mere History.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acls.org/Publications/OP/Haskins/2003_PeterBrown.pdf "A Life of Learning", Charles Homer Haskins Lecture 2003], p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked to comment on his intellectual formation, Brown has also indicated that he completed his public schooling a year early, returning to Ireland (as he had done for school holidays) in 1952, the year he turned 17. It was then in Dublin that he read [[Michael Rostovtzeff|Mikhail Rostovtzeff's]] ''The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire'' (1926), which he borrowed from the lending library of the [[Royal Dublin Society]] at Ballsbridge.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic year 1952-3 was a 'hiatus' for Brown, between school and university, during which he learned to type at a secretarial school, and received German lessons from an academic at Trinity College Dublin who had been a refugee from Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Shao, "Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity", ''The Daily Princetonian'', Apr. 20, 2017: http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Brown took up a scholarship to read Modern History at [[New College, Oxford|New College]], Oxford, from 1953 to 1956. Most of his degree was 'devoted to English History in its entirety and to the European High Middle Ages, from 919 to 1127', but in his final academic year, he undertook a Special Subject on The Age of Augustine, and was particularly influenced by the writings of [[Henri-Irenee Marrou|Marrou]] and [[Andre Piganiol|Piganiol]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 10-11, quoting 10.&lt;/ref&gt; That Special Subject had a profound influence on Brown: 'I was thrilled by the glimpse which both authors offered of the sheer resilience of a pre-Christian society and culture at the very moment of the triumph of the Christian church within the Roman empire. Institutions and powerful bodies of ideas, that I had known only in the medieval and post-Reformation periods — and many of which, in their modern form, still hung, like chill clouds, above the heart of any Irish boy, Catholic or Protestant — were shown to have originated first in a very distant, ancient world.'&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Employment and Professional Memberships===
Following his graduation Brown began, but did not complete, a doctoral thesis under the external supervision of [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] (at that time professor of ancient history at [[University College London]]). The potential he had shown as an undergraduate was recognized by the award of the Harmsworth Senior Scholarship at [[Merton College]], Oxford, and a seven-year Prize Fellowship at [[All Souls College]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Who's Who'', "Brown, Peter Robert Lamont".&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when it was normally possible to remain in the college after the Prize Fellowship, All Souls College subsequently elected him a research fellow in 1963 and a senior research fellow in 1970. The Modern History Faculty of the [[University of Oxford]] appointed him a special lecturer in 1970 and a reader (''ad hominem'') in 1973. He was elected a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1971. Brown left Oxford to become professor of modern history and head of the Department of History at [[Royal Holloway]] College in the [[University of London]] (1975–78). He subsequently left Britain to become professor of classics and history in the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1978–86) and then Philip and Beulah Rollins [[Princeton University Department of History|Professor of History]] at [[Princeton University]] (1986–2011).  He was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1979, a fellow of the [[Medieval Academy of America]] in 1988, and a resident member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Who's Who'', "Brown, Peter Robert Lamont".&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the tenured faculty at UC Berkeley and Princeton, Brown held visiting professorships at both institutions: at UC Berkeley in 1975, and at Princeton in 1983-6. He has also held visiting professorships at UCLA and in Italy. Other engagements as a visiting teacher have taken Brown to Toronto in the 1970s and, since 2000, to Hungary and Iceland. At Princeton, Brown was given the President's Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2000. A significant number of his former students in the UK and US have gone on to substantive academic posts.

===Speaking Engagements===
Brown has delivered several named lecture series. These include the Carl Newell Jackson Lectures at Harvard University (1976);&lt;ref&gt;Published as ''The Making of Late Antiquity'' (1978).

He has also been a named lecturer, usually in retrospect, in all the universities at which he has held substantive posts: lectures include the Magie Lecture at Princeton (1991);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancientworld.princeton.edu/magie-lecturers Magie Lectures, Princeton.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Pritchett Lecture at UC Berkeley (1993);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahma.berkeley.edu/pritchett-lecture Pritchett Lectures, UC Berkeley.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Hayes Robinson Lecture at Royal Holloway College, University of London (1997);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/history/research/hayesrobinsonlecture.aspx Hayes Robinson Lectures, RHUL.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Ronald Syme Lecture at Wolfson College, Oxford, and the Dacre Lecture in the History Faculty at Oxford (2006 and 2010 respectively).

In 2007, Brown gave an inaugural talk at the opening of the Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity. In 2015 he was hosted by the Group for the Study of Late Antiquity at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, in a public discussion with Paula Fredriksen.

Brown has also frequently been a keynote speaker at conferences and congresses. These include the International Congress of Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo (1986); the International Medieval Congress at Leeds (1999); and the Sewanee Medieval Colloquium (2012). He gave the inaugural address at the first Coloquio Internacional "Nuevas perspectivas sobre la Antigüedad tardía" in Segovia (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/inst_lucio_anneo_seneca/investigacion/Centro_Teodosio http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/inst_lucio_anneo_seneca/investigacion/Centro_Teodosio]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editorial Work===
For several decades, Brown has been General Editor of the book series 'The Transformation of the Classical Heritage', published by the University of California Press. The first volume in the series was published in 1981. The full published list to date now exceeds fifty-five titles.&lt;ref&gt;The Press maintains a [http://www.ucpress.edu/series.php?ser=tch series home page.] Many of the volumes are also available in an [http://humanitiesebook.org/the-collection/series_TRANSFORMATION.html ACLS Humanities E-Book Special Series.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Grants===
Following his earlier books, Brown has received some prestigious and substantial research grants. These include the [[MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1982 and the Distinguished Achievement Award for scholars in the humanities from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macfound.org/fellows/116/ MacArthur Foundation grantee page]; [https://mellon.org/about/annual-reports/2001-presidents-report/#!/faculty-fellowships-humanities-related-disciplines Mellon Foundation Annual Report 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Overview==

Brown, who has a knowledge of at least 26 languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Peter+Brown&amp;title=&amp;subject=4.+Humanities&amp;subdiv=404&amp;mem=Resident&amp;year=1995&amp;year-max=1995&amp;dead=Alive&amp;keyword=&amp;smode=advanced|See American Philosophical Society record]&lt;/ref&gt; has been instrumental in the development of the study of late antiquity as a field. Within this broad field, he has also been central in the study of Augustine, monasticism (both the eremetical "holy man" and coenobitic alternatives), the cult of the saints and the practice of sexual renunciation. More recently, he has made fundamental contributions to the study of power relations in late Roman society and to the study of financial giving. He has produced a steady stream of articles (several being classics in the field) since 1961, and a steady series of influential books since 1967.

[[Janet Nelson]], the distinguished British historian of the early Middle Ages, has said: "He took the study of medieval history into fields of cultural history and social history, social psychological history. He was interested in religion but not in an old-fashioned ecclesiastical history, institutional sort of way, but what made people think in this way: how did they conceptualise God? How did they think about religious symbols and rituals in the ways that they did? Why did these things change? That was his agenda. He wrote mostly about late antiquity, the very early period, but he sometimes ventured into the Middle Ages and whenever he did he transformed the scene. The great area he’s famous for doing is the cult of the saints."&lt;ref&gt;"Dame Janet Nelson, Interview Transcript,  30 May 2008" [http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/interviews/Nelson_Janet.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on her interview with Brown, Ruby Shao has remarked: 'Brown cites the balance of his scholarship between eastern and western Christianity as his proudest accomplishment. Few scholars research both equally, as the task demands mastery of different languages and intuitions. His commitment has challenged him throughout his career to break into new territory, such as by examining the Desert Fathers, Syriac poetry, and languages like Greek and Coptic.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/04/peter-brown-late-antiquity|title=Peter Brown: Inventor of late antiquity|work=The Princetonian|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956 to 1971===

Following his exposure to the works of Marrou and Piganiol as an undergraduate, and shortly after joining All Souls College as a Prize Fellow, Brown travelled in Italy in 1957-8, doing research at the British School in Rome. During that time, he was especially influenced by the work of Santo Mazzarino,&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; which provided a stimulus for Brown's earliest lectures at Oxford, on return from Italy in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocla.history.ox.ac.uk/pdf/brown_what_in_name.pdf|P. Brown, 'What's in a Name? A talk given at the opening of Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity on Friday 28 September 2007', 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences were Norman Hepburn Baynes, William Frend and A. H. M. Jones.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's earliest research articles concerned the Christianization of the senatorial aristocracy of Rome (1961), and the phenomena of religious dissent and coercion in late Roman North Africa (1961, 1963). From there, he turned to the study of Augustine's own views on the state (1963) and its use of coercion in matters of religion (1964). Italy and Africa in the fourth and early fifth centuries provided the principal context for the life of Augustine, which became the subject of Brown's substantial first book - ''Augustine of Hippo: A Biography'' (1967). This was followed by related articles that explored both the Pelagian milieu in Italy (1968, 1970) and the relation between Christianity and local culture in Roman Africa (1968).

Following the completion of ''Augustine'', however, Brown felt "free, at last" to take a wider approach to Late Antiquity, and to turn in particular to the Near East and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, A. H. M. Jones' vast magnum opus on ''The Later Roman Empire, 284-602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' had appeared, on which Brown wrote a long and important review article for the ''Economic History Review'' (1967). In addition, as Augustine had been a Manichaean for many years, Brown already had a natural route into the religious history of the eastern half of the later Roman Empire and the Persian Empire. An article on "The Diffusion of Manichaeism in the Roman Empire" (1969) reflected the direction of his interests, and was spectacularly corroborated when, shortly after, the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]] came to light.

In 1969, [[Geoffrey Barraclough]] (as General Editor of the Thames &amp; Hudson "Library of European Civilization" series) approached Brown with a view to commissioning a book on late antiquity - and Brown has since noted that it might well have been Barraclough who suggested "The World of Late Antiquity" as a title.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 17: "As for 'Late Antiquity' itself, the term was relatively new to me. It may well be that Barraclough himself suggested the title: his knowledge of German historiography, in which ''Spätantike'' already played a significant role, makes this likely. I had usually been content with 'late Roman'." See also [http://ocla.history.ox.ac.uk/pdf/brown_what_in_name.pdf P. Brown, 'What's in a Name? A talk given at the opening of Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity on Friday 28 September 2007', 1: "It was not until 1964, when lecturing on Saint Augustine in the Hovenden Room, that I made frequent use of the term 'late antique'."]&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Brown engaged increasingly with the work of Henri Pirenne - and also with that of the French [[Annales School]], in particular [[Fernand Braudel]]. Their work, combined with the eastward shift in his interests, prompted Brown to think increasingly of the Mediterranean as "truly distinctive".&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, 'SO Debate: The World of Late Antiquity Revisited', ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's interest in analyzing culture and religion as social phenomena, and as part of a wider context of historical change, had already been fostered by engagement with the work of Baynes, Frend and Jones. But the ''Annales''{{'}} influence in Brown's work can be seen in his increasing use of [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] as interpretative tools for historical analysis. Brown was influenced by Anglo-American anthropology, himself noting the role of both a largely British tradition of social anthropology and a largely American tradition of cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;See the collection of articles (by Brown and others) in ''Symbolae Osloenses'' 72 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971-Present===
Brown's views slightly shifted in the eighties. In articles and new editions Brown said that his earlier work, which had deconstructed many of the religious aspects of his field of study, needed to be reassessed. His later work shows a deeper appreciation for the specifically Christian layers of his subjects of study.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Peter Brown, ''Authority and the Sacred: Aspects of the Christianisation of the Roman World'' (Cambridge, 1995), chapter 3, involves a reappraisal of the role of the holy man on substantially different lines from those proposed in Brown, "The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 61 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent research focuses on wealth and poverty in late antiquity, especially in Christian writers.

==Principal Publications==

[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|upright|A 6th century picture of [[Augustine of Hippo]] ]]

===''Augustine of Hippo: A Biography'' (1967; 2000)===
Brown's biography of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was widely acclaimed. Reviewing it in the ''Journal of Theological Studies'', [[William Hugh Clifford Frend|William Frend]] - with whom Brown had had a courteous but critical difference of opinion on the religious history of Roman Africa - wrote: "This is a superb book, an intensely personal interpretation of its central figure, but one in which the scholar's full range of skills, those of the historian, the philosopher, and human psychologist have been brought to bear, sustained throughout by a profound knowledge of Augustine's writings and those of his contemporaries, as well as of modern critical works. The entire compass of the life and thought of the later Roman Empire in the West is its canvas."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''The Journal of Theological Studies'' (New Series) 19/2 (1968), 654-6, at 654.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiosyncrasies of the book did not go unnoticed. Another great master of Augustinian studies, the Rev. [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], remarked that Brown's book was a "biography without the theology" - a judgment that Brown has accepted as "fair".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Augustine'' (revised edition, 2000), 495.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, among Anglophone students, Brown's book has often been read hand in hand with Gerald Bonner's ''St Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', which first appeared four years earlier, in 1963, and which Bonner updated in subsequent editions.

Equally, however, it was Brown's distinctive and subtle de-emphasis of theological content, combined with his use of psychoanalytic insight - which was then highly unusual in the study of an ancient figure - that helped to set Augustine convincingly, as an individual, within a historical landscape. This was noticed by [[R. W. Southern|Richard Southern]], who praised Brown for "bringing Augustine out of the tomb of theological doctrine, and setting his mind and emotions working before our eyes."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Statesman''. Southern may have been influenced by Brown's approach when he later wrote ''Saint Anselm: A Portrait in a Landscape'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown published a new edition in 2000, closing with two new chapters - one focusing on new evidence and the other on new interpretations.

===''The World of Late Antiquity'' (1971)===
In his second book ''The World of Late Antiquity'' (1971), Brown offered a radically new interpretation of the entire period between the second and eighth centuries AD. The traditional interpretation of this period was centred around the idea of decadence from a 'golden age', classical civilisation, after the famous work of [[Edward Gibbon]] ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1779). On the contrary, Brown proposed to look at this period in positive terms, arguing that Late Antiquity was a period of immense cultural innovation.

==="The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity" (1971)===
His most celebrated early paper concerned the figure of the 'holy man'. According to Brown, the charismatic, Christian [[ascetic]]s (holy men) were particularly prominent in the late Roman empire and the early Byzantine world as mediators between local communities and the divine. This relationship expressed the importance of patronage in the Roman social system, which was taken over by the Christian ascetics. But more importantly, Brown argues, the rise of the holy man was the result of a deeper religious change that affected not only Christianity but also other religions of the late antique period – namely the need for a more personal access to the divine.

=== ''The Body and Society'' (1988) ===
Published in 1988, Peter Brown's ''The Body and Society'' was a groundbreaking study of the marriage and sexual practices of early Christians in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. Brown focuses on the practice of permanent sexual renunciation-continence, celibacy, and lifelong virginity in Christian circles from the first to the fifth centuries A.D. and traces early Christians' preoccupations with sexuality and the body in the work of the period's great writers.

''The Body and Society'' questions how theological views on sexuality and the human body both mirrored and shaped relationships between men and women, Roman aristocracy and slaves, and the married and the celibate. Brown discusses Tertullian, Valentinus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, the Desert Fathers, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine, among others, and considers asceticism and society in the Eastern Empire, martyrdom and prophecy, gnostic spiritual guidance, promiscuity among the men and women of the church, monks and marriage in Egypt, the ascetic life of women in fourth-century Jerusalem, and the body and society in the early Middle Ages. In his new introduction, Brown reflects on his work's reception in the scholarly community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-body-and-society/9780231144070|title=The Body and Society {{!}} Books {{!}} Columbia University Press|website=Columbia University Press|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Through the Eye of a Needle'' (2012)===
Brown's longest book to date, ''Through the Eye of a Needle'' concerns attitudes to philanthropic giving in the Latin West in Late Antiquity. Divided into five parts, the core of the book - the long Parts II-III - focuses on two generations between about AD370 and 430, when a rich diversity of views gave way to an increasing polarization of thought brought on by the debate between Augustine and the Pelagians. Parts I and IV-V place this highly focused study in the much wider frame of the social structures of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries.

==Honours==
Brown has received formal recognition for his academic achievements in at least twelve countries on three continents.

===Honorary degrees and college fellowships===

'''Quintus Curtius Rufus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|t|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɜr|ʃ|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|r|uː|f|ə|s}}) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[historian]], probably of the 1st century, author of his only known and only surviving work, ''Historiae Alexandri Magni'', "[[Histories of Alexander the Great]]", or more fully ''Historiarum Alexandri Magni Macedonis Libri Qui Supersunt'', "All the Books That Survive of the Histories of Alexander the Great of Macedon." Much of it is missing. Apart from his name on the manuscripts, nothing else certain is known of him. This fact alone has led philologists to believe that he had another historical identity, to which, due to the accidents of time, the link has been broken. A few theories exist. They are treated with varying degrees of credibility by various authors. Meanwhile, the identity of Quintus Curtius Rufus, historian,  is maintained separately.

==The historical ''alter ego''==
Curtius' work is uniquely isolated. No other ancient work refers to it, or as far as is known, to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Pratt&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pratt|1809|pp=xvi-xxi}} The lesser known Pratt was a clerk in the library of [[East India House]]. His employment was to research and publish documents on the East Indies trade. He expanded that process into writing universal history books, such as the ''History of Japan''. He did some writing to gratify his own interests, such as the translation of Curtius, which reveals the depth of his education and research. He remained so unself-confident that he did not put his name on the work. In the Preface he begins one footnote with “As a stranger to antiquarian studies, I hesitate to point out ....” He was certainly no stranger. The book received professional reviews, becoming popular.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that the Senate and emperors frequently proscribed or censored works, suggests that Curtius had not published the manuscript before his death, but left it in care of the emperor. The emperors intended to publish it posthumously but did not find a political opportunity. They had adopted the identity of Alexander for themselves. The provinces fashioned from the Macedonian Empire were difficult to govern, always on the point of rebellion. The work of Curtius, Pratt conjectures, was not politically appropriate because it would have encouraged independence.

The earliest opportune moment was the year 167, when the campaign of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] against the [[Parthian Empire]] had failed, and the returning troops were in bad morale and infected with the [[Antonine Plague]]. The emperor attempted to build national pride among the former Macedonian states. [[Avidius Cassius]], commandant of [[Legio III Gallica]], returning veterans, was promoted to Consul. He claimed descent from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] of Macedonia. New coins and medals were issued in Macedonia on Alexandrian themes. Pratt conjectures that the manuscript in storage, by this time damaged and partly destroyed, was published finally, accounting for the previous lack of references to it. It is also possible Books I and II along with other loci were censored out. As the emperors probably had surmised, it was immediately popular.

===Most credible date===
[[File:Claudius Ny Carlsberg02.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Claudius]]
The dating available relies entirely on internal evidence, which is not certain, but offers some degree of preponderance. In Book X Curtius digresses to give an encomium on blessings of peace under empire, citing the [[Roman Empire]] with the implication of contemporaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 9, 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence he reasserts the policy of [[Augustus]], which casts the empire as the restoration of monarchy for the suppression of the civil wars fomented by the contention of powerful noblemen vying for control of the Republic. Curtius' glowing endorsement of the policy dates him to the Roman Empire.

He also mentions the [[Parthian Empire]]. It was formed by the eastern [[satrap]]ies recusing themselves from Macedonian overlordship and restoring a purely Iranian empire. It defended itself successfully against Rome, even though Rome absorbed what was left of the Macedonian kingdoms. The dates of the Parthian Empire are 247 BC through 224 AD. Although Curtius may have been writing about an empire vanished in his own day, the most straightforward approach assumes that he wrote in a window, 63 BC (start of the Roman Empire) through 224 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For further localization, the same imperial [[Purple prose|purple passage]] contrasts the civil wars of the Macedonians ([[Diadochi wars]]) due to failure to obtain a stable emperor, with an incident of the Roman Empire in which the risk of civil war was avoided by the appointment of a new emperor in a single night. Not very many incidents fit the description. Baynham summarizes the argument of Julius Nützell that the crisis might be the night of January 24/25, 41 AD, following the assassination of [[Caligula]] on that day. The Senate met on an emergency basis to debate whether the [[Roman Republic]] should be restored. The [[Praetorian Guard]] forced its way in to insist on the appointment of Caligula's uncle, [[Claudius]]. His reign concentrated on the restoration of the rule of law. A lawyer, he issued up to 20 imperial edicts per day, re-establishing the [[Pax Romana]]. If this argument is correct, Curtius' work must be dated to after 41 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|pp=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper limit is provided by a passage that mentions the "continued prosperity of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] under Roman dominion."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtius|1896|p=xii}} On Book IV, Chapter 4, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The peace of the empire came to an end in 43 AD when Claudius invaded Britain. None of these dates are certain, but the union of all the ranges presents a credible view of Curtius' date. Baynham says: "many modern scholars now accept a date in the middle to late part of the first century A.D. as a likely floruit for Curtius."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most credible identity===
By his name, Quintus Curtius Rufus was a member of the ''Curtii Rufi'' branch of the [[Curtia (gens)|Curtii family]], one of the original nobility of Rome. Due to the frequently used institution of [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]], people of the name ''Curtius'' (or female ''Curtia'') might not be [[consanguineous]]. Moreover, the same name tended to be repeated, typically from grandfather to grandson. After centuries of ''Curtii'', a ''Curtius'' might turn up in history at any location or in any period.

The candidates for the historical identity of the author are but few. Given the time frame of the mid-1st century, however, there is a credible candidate. He is a certain [[Curtius Rufus]] (The [[praenomen]] has been omitted. Presumably it is Quintus.) In the [[List of Roman consuls]] he served as [[Roman consul|Consul Suffectus]] for October through December, 43 AD under the emperor [[Claudius]]. He had been a protégé of [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yardley|Atkinson|2009||pp=9–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He must have written the ''Histories'' in the year or two before the consulship. [[Tacitus]] says that he was on the staff of the [[Quaestor]] of Africa during that time, which would have given him the opportunity to use the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annales'', Book XI, Section 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tiberius]] had died in 37; [[Caligula]] was emperor then. Curtius’ relations with Caligula are not mentioned. But Caligula was not in his vicinity.

On Curtius’ return, a book such as the ''Historiae'' unless politically incorrect would have impressed the scholarly Claudius. Tiberius already had been an admirer before the book: he said that Curtius Rufus was his own ancestor; i.e., a self-made man. Tacitus hints that Curtius was of low birth, possibly the son of a gladiator. The story is only compatible with the name if one assumes adoption, which Tiberius could easily have arranged,

If Curtius took office at the minimum age of 25, and Tiberius made his comment in the year of his own death, Curtius would have been 19 or younger when described as a self-made man. In an age when Alexander had become regent of Macedon at 16, a rise to fame at 19, and consulship at 25, would not have been incredible. Tiberius would have been a senior emperor when Curtius came to his attention. What his qualifications were for the patronage remain obscure. If, on the other hand, Quintus Curtius Rufus is to be identified with [[Curtius Rufus]], Consul Suffect of 43, then the most likely circumstantial evidence places his birth in the early years of the 1st century, in the reign of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Historiae''==
{{main|Histories of Alexander the Great}}

===Manuscripts and editions===
''Historiae'' survives in 123 [[Codex|codices]], or bound [[manuscript]]s, all deriving from an original in the 9th century. As it was a partial text, already missing large pieces, they are partial as well. They vary in condition. Some are more partial than others, with [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] that developed since the 9th century. The original contained ten ''libri'', "books," equivalent to our chapters. Book I and II are missing, along with any Introduction that might have been expected according to ancient custom. There are gaps in V, VI, and X. Many ''loci'', or "places," throughout are obscure, subject to interpretation or emendation in the name of restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work enjoyed popularity in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It is the main source for a genre of tales termed the [[Alexander Romance]] (some say romances); for example, [[Walter of Châtillon|Walter of Chatillon]]'s epic poem ''[[Alexandreis]]'', which was written in the style of [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]]. These romances spilled over into [[the Renaissance]], especially of Italy, where Curtius was idolized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters, such as [[Paolo Veronese]] and [[Charles Le Brun]], painted scenes from Curtius.

The ''Editio Princeps'', or first printed edition, was published in 1470 or 1471 at Venice by Vindelinus Spirensis. A slow but steady stream of editions appeared subsequently until more of a need for standardization was perceived. In 1867 Edmund Hedicke instigated a convention that persists yet. He based his edition of that year on the five best manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynham|1998|pp=3–4}}. They are B for Bernensis, F for Florentinus, L for Leidensis, P for Parisinus, and V for Vosianus.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The vulgate authors===
In what remains of his work, Curtius mainly does not identify sources. They were, perhaps, stated in the missing books. Speculations of what they were based on thorough analysis of the content and style vary widely. Yardley and Heckel say: "The internal evidence for Curtius' sources is disappointing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yardley|Heckel|2004|loc=Introduction: C. Curtius' Sources and Models}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He does, however, mention [[Cleitarchus]], a historian in camp, twice,&lt;ref&gt;9.5.21, 9.18.15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] once, and [[Timagenes]] once. These men were participants in the Alexander story and therefore are counted as eyewitnesses, or [[primary source]]s. All accounts based on them are by analogy also termed "primary."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yardely|Atkinson|2009|p=1}} identifies five: Curtius, [[Diodorus Siculus]] Book 17; [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]], "Philippic History," Books 11-12 (in epitome by [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]); [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'', and [[Plutarch]], "Life of Alexander."&lt;/ref&gt; These works are also called "the Vulgate."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3461">'''Sir San Crombie Po''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (1870–1946) was a [[Karen people|Karen]] nationalist who devoted himself to improving the situation of the Karen people of [[Myanmar|Burma]] in the early 20th century.

He was born in 1870 near the village of Bassein. His family was Sgaw Karen and [[Christian]]. He attended a school headed by an American missionary, Charles Nichols, who was impressed with his motivation and decided Po should continue his education in the [[United States]]. At the age of fourteen, he was sent to live with relatives of Dr. Nichols. After high school, he attended [[Albany Medical College]] and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Po, San C, with an introduction by Christina Fink. Burma and the Karens.

Ltd., 2001. {{ISBN|974-7534-82-7}}. introduction, page xv-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; He applied for naturalization as a U.S. citizen but was denied on the grounds of his race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/cu31924016940284 |first=James Brown |last=Scott |first2=David Jayne |last2=Hill |first3=Gaillard |last3=Hunt |title=Citizenship of the United States, expatriation, and protection abroad |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Government Printing Office|year=1906|accessdate=2013-03-25|ref=harv|p=[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924016940284#page/n107/mode/2up 100]|postscript=none}}.

He returned to [[Myanmar|Burma]] and served as the district medical officer in Bassein, followed by Kyaukse and Myaungmya.  He increasingly became involved in Karen nationalist affairs and in 1915 was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Burma]], an advisory council to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonial governor.

He was awarded a [[CBE]] and was further [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=33936&amp;geotype=London&amp;gpn=2936&amp;type=ArchivedIssuePage&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also known for his book ''Burma and the Karens''.  Published in 1928, ''Burma and the Karens'' now functions as a survey on the situation facing the Karen people in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paung, Shah. "San C. Po: Elusive Dream."

'''Schwabach''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃvaːbax}}) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Town#Germany|town]] of about 40,000 inhabitants near [[Nuremberg]] in the centre of the region of [[Franconia]] in the north of [[Bavaria]]. The city is an autonomous administrative district (''kreisfreie Stadt'').  Schwabach is also the name of the river which runs through the city prior joining the [[Rednitz]].

Schwabach is famous for its crafts made of [[gold]], particularly [[metal leaf|gold foil]]. In 2004, Schwabach celebrated this tradition with an anniversary festival, marking "500 years gold foil in Schwabach".

Around 1500, a local typesetter developed the "[[Schwabacher]]" font. This font was used for printing the first Bible in German, which had been worked out by [[Martin Luther]].

Schwabach is also the birthplace of composer [[Adolf von Henselt]], the botanist [[Johann Gottfried Zinn]], the biologist [[Ralf Baumeister]] and one of the developers of [[MP3]], [[Bernhard Grill]]. It was often visited by [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==Etymology==
The name derives from the old [[Franconia]]n name ''Suapaha'' (later ''Suabaha'', then ''Villa Suabach'') which translates as "Schwaben-Bach" in modern [[German language|German]], which means "[[Swabia]]n [[stream]]", the first part of the name was given by the Franconians who came to the area about a millennium after the [[Hallstatt culture]] to the people living on the banks of that stream, which were perceived as "[[Swabia]]ns" by them, while the second part of the name is a reference to the stream which flows through town.

[[File:Skopje 2014 - Museum of the Macedonian Struggle and National Theatre.JPG|thumb|500px|View of the buildings finished after the 1963 earthquake (2014).]]
'''Skopje 2014''' ({{lang-mk|Скопје 2014}}) is a project financed by the [[Government of the Republic of Macedonia]], with the main ideology being based on that of the then-ruling party [[VMRO-DPMNE]],&lt;ref&gt;EastWest Institute (2000). Jonathan P. Stein, ed. The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-Communist Europe: State-Building, Democracy, and Ethnic Mobilization. M.E. Sharpe. p. 91. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0528-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of giving the capital [[Skopje]] a more classical appeal. The project, officially announced in 2010, consists mainly of the construction of colleges, museums and government buildings, as well as the erection of monuments depicting historical figures from the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Around 20 buildings and over 40 monuments are planned to be constructed as part of the project.&lt;ref name="Marusic2" /&gt; 

In fact this political project is [[nation-building]] one and tries to impose a new [[Macedonian historiography|revisionist narrative of the Macedonian history]], promoting  Macedonian identity, with  unbroken continuity from the antiquity over the middle ages to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Janev, G. (2015). ‘Skopje 2014’: erasing memories, building history. In M. Couroucli, &amp; T. Marinov (Eds.), Balkan heritages: Negotiating history and culture (pp. 111-130). Taylor &amp; Francis, 2017, {{ISBN|1134800754}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced for constructing nationalistic [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Couroucli and Tchavdar Marinov eds., Balkan Heritages: Negotiating History and Culture, British School at Athens - Modern Greek and Byzantine Studies, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2017, {{ISBN|1134800754}}, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Skopje 2014 has also generated controversy for its cost, for which estimates range from 80 to 500 million euros.&lt;ref name="Bugjevac"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=C18D740B2343534A8B173AAD06639F3A|title=СКОПЈЕ ЌЕ УМРЕ ОД  НЕВКУС|last=Bugjevac|first=Dejan|year=2007|work=Globus|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koteska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/655-troubles-with-history-skopje-2014|title=Troubles with History: Skopje 2014|last=Koteska|first=Jasna|date=29 December 2011|work=Art Margins Online|accessdate=8 June 2012|location=Republic of Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skopje 2014 project encompasses the construction, from 2010 to 2014, of 136 structures built at a cost of more than US$700 million.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times International Edition, October 14, 2016, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the authorities and institutions of the country announced the halt of the project and then set up a Commission for envisaging the removal of its controversial monuments and statues.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

==Background==
[[File:Skopje-razglednica 014.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Theatre and Kale Fortress before the 1963 earthquake]]
[[File:Wodno.jpg|thumb|250px|View toward [[Macedonia Square, Skopje|Macedonia Square]] from the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]] in July 2011. Visible are the statues of Dame Gruev, Goce Delčev, Tsar Samuil, and the under construction Warrior on a Horse monument]]

The [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] destroyed approximately 80% of the city, including most of the neoclassical buildings in the central part of Skopje.&lt;ref name="MRT"&gt;[http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3316&amp;Itemid=27 Marking the 44th anniversary of the catastrophic 1963 Skopje earthquake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210952/http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3316&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2007-09-30 }} [[Macedonian Radio-Television|MRT]], Thursday, 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding that followed saw the construction of mostly plain [[modernist architecture]]. This is one of the reasons given by the VMRO-DPMNE government for the necessity of the project, to give Skopje a more monumental and visually pleasing image. Another reason is to restore the missing sense of national pride and create a more metropolitan atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Marusic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/gallery/skopje-2014|title=Skopje 2014: The new face of Macedonia, updated|last=Marusic|first=Siniša|date=11 May 2012|publisher=BalkanInsight|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the opening of [[Porta Macedonia]] in January 2012, then Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]] stated that Skopje 2014 was his idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/20045/45/|title=PM Gruevski: Yes, Skopje 2014 was my Idea|date=7 January 2012|publisher=MINA|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
{{see also|Antiquization}}
The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced. The cost of the project is estimated at anywhere from 80 to more than 500 million euros&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/index.html Is Macedonia's capital being turned into a theme park?], CNN, October 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonian-culture-strategy-milestone-or-wish-list  Macedonian Culture Strategy: Milestone or Wish List?], BalkanInsight, 15 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen by many as a waste of resources in a country with high unemployment and poverty. The project is also believed by critics to be a distraction from these problems.&lt;ref name="Marusic" /&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Union of Macedonia]], the main opposition party, opposes the project and has alleged that the monuments could have cost six to ten times less than what the government paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skopjediem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9407:sdsm-allegations-at-government-on-skopje-2014-project-&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=81|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104174531/http://www.skopjediem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9407:sdsm-allegations-at-government-on-skopje-2014-project-&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=81|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 January 2013|title=SDSM Allegations at Government on Skopje 2014 Project|date=30 March 2011|publisher=SkopjeDiem|accessdate=30 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is seen as a part of the government's "antiquisation" policy, in which the country seeks to claim [[Ancient Macedonians|ancient Macedonian]] figures like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon]] for itself. The timing of the project, following the country's non-invitation to NATO due to its continued [[Macedonia naming dispute|naming dispute]] with [[Greece]], has led to speculation that it is retaliation or an attempt to put pressure on Greece.&lt;ref name="Georgievski"&gt;''Ghosts of the past endanger Macedonia's future''. Boris Georgievski, BalkanInsight, October 27, 2009 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future].&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents see the scheme as the embodiment of nationalism by a conservative government focused as much on giving the metropolis a facelift as changing the nation's history and have described it as a mini-[[Las Vegas]]&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse Macedonia statue: Alexander the Great or a warrior on a horse?], Sunday 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while others appreciate its classical nod to the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2011/05/05/the-changing-face-of-skopje/ The Changing Face of Skopje], Euronews.com, May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Vaknin]], a former adviser to Nikola Gruevski, has stated that the project is not anti-Greek or anti-Bulgarian, but anti-Albanian. In an interview, he said "Antiquisation has a double goal, which is to marginalise the Albanians and create an identity that will not allow Albanians to become Macedonians."&lt;ref name="Georgievski" /&gt; The project, however, later included depictions of ethnic Albanians in the monuments including [[Nexhat Agolli]], [[Josif Bageri]], and [[Pjetër Bogdani]], as well as others on the [[Art Bridge]], and includes the construction of [[Skanderbeg Square (Skopje)|Skanderbeg Square]].

Architects have criticized the aesthetics of the project and believe the money could have been spent on constructing modern buildings.&lt;ref name="Marusic" /&gt; It has also been described as nationalist [[kitsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://balkans.courriers.info/spip.php?page=dossier&amp;id_article=18171|title=Macédoine : Skopje 2014, kitsch nationaliste et foire aux antiquités|year=2012|publisher=Le Courrier des Balkans|language=French|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "brings unknown history" to the citizens&lt;ref&gt;Borian Jovanovski Al Jazeera, 18 March 2015, [http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/03/macedonia-facade-150318135440964.html]: "Talking about this project Skopje 2014, yes it's damaging to inter-ethnic relations, it's not reflecting the multi-cultural society that Macedonia is. But on the other hand you have an Albanian party in the government - and they agree - so in a way they have responsibility for what's going on too. It's obvious that it is damaging inter-ethnic relations which are anyway fragile and damaging Macedonian national identity too because it brings us to history that is unknown to us, in which we are a kind of successor to Alexander the Great. This is not true because Alexander the Great is famous because he enlarged the Hellenic culture. We are Slavs who are not Hellenic at all."&lt;/ref&gt; and current prime minister [[Zoran Zaev]] has labeled it an "idiotic project".&lt;ref&gt;Zoran Zaev, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 27 December 2016, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/mazedonien-hinter-neuen-fassaden-1.3311464]: "Mit dem idiotischen Skopje-2014-Projekt und der zusammenhängenden Pseudo-Geschichtsschreibung, die Alexander den Großen für Mazedonien reklamiert, haben wir nicht nur Griechenland provoziert, sondern auch viel internationale Unterstützung für unsere Position verloren." (English translation: With the idiotic Skopje 2014 project and the related pseudo-historiography that claims Alexander the Great for Macedonia, we have not only provoked Greece, but also lost much international support for our position.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
In late February 2018, the government and institutions of the Republic of Macedonia announced the halt of the Skopje 2014 program and begun removing its [[Macedonian nationalism|controversial]] monuments and statues. The [[Ministry of Culture (Macedonia)|Macedonian Ministry of Culture]] also has set up a Commission to envisage the possibility of removing the rest of them, such as of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon]]. As a first step, the monument of [[Andon Kyoseto]] was dismantled, as one of the mostly disputed of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mia.mk/EN/Inside/RenderSingleNews/289/134124689/|title=City of Skopje starting to take action on Skopje 2014 project: Mayor|publisher=Macedonian Information Agency|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/a-skopje-2014-monument-is-removed/|title=A “Skopje 2014” monument is removed|publisher=IBNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2018/2/22/statue-removed-macedonia|title=Macedonia Removes the Skopje 2014 Statue of Andon Kyoseto|publisher=EUscoop|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amna.gr/en/article/232954/Skopje-starts-removal-of-irredentist-statues-put-up-by-Gruevski-government|title=Skopje starts removal of 'irredentist' statues put up by Gruevski government|publisher=AMNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/removal-of-monuments-in-skopje-whose-turn-is-next/|title=Removal of monuments in Skopje, whose turn is next?|publisher=IBNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.protothema.gr/skopje-authorities-start-to-tear-down-nationalistic-statues/|title=Skopje authorities start to tear down nationalistic statues|publisher=Proto Thema|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-removes-divisive-court-statue-02-22-2018|title=Divisive Revolutionary's Statue Vanishes from Macedonian Capital|publisher=BIRN|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the Macedonian Government announced that the monuments would be renamed and marked with inscriptions honouring Greek-Macedonian friendship. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/divisive-skopje-2014-landmarks-find-new-purpose-06-14-2018|title=Macedonia to Rename Divisive Statues that Irked Greece|publisher=BIRN|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans==

===Bridges===

====New bridge constructions====

=====Art Bridge=====

{{main|Art Bridge}}

The Skopje 2014 project calls for two new pedestrian bridges to be built across the [[Vardar River|Vardar]] in the centre of the city. One is the Art Bridge, which is being constructed between the Freedom Bridge and the also under-construction Eye Bridge. It is expected to cost 2.5 million euros. The bridge will include 29 sculptures, with 14 at each end and one in the centre. It will be 83 metres (272.3 feet) in length and 9.2&amp;nbsp;m (30.2&amp;nbsp;ft) in width, while the central part of the bridge will be 12&amp;nbsp;m (39.4&amp;nbsp;ft) wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=C71B15A20E1CA24AABF563D72712711D|title=Мостот на уметноста се искачи на конструкцијата|date=April 8, 2012|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613224413/http://www.utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=C71B15A20E1CA24AABF563D72712711D|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural buildings===

====Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra hall====
Notable in Skopje 2014 for its bold modern architecture as opposed to the usual neoclassical style seen in the project, the under-construction concert hall to house the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the first buildings to begin construction in the project, with the cornerstone having been laid in June 2009. The exterior of the building is nearing completion. The concert hall is planned to have excellent acoustics and will have a capacity of 900 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kurir.mk/makedonija/kultura/49599-FOTO-Kako-ke-izgleda-novata-sala-na-Makedonskata-Filharmonija|title=ФОТО: Како ќе изгледа новата сала на Македонската Филхармонија?|date=14 November 2011|publisher=Kurir|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220164605/http://www.kurir.mk/makedonija/kultura/49599-FOTO-Kako-ke-izgleda-novata-sala-na-Makedonskata-Filharmonija|archivedate=20 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is situated on the eastern bank of the [[Vardar]], across the river from [[Macedonia Square, Skopje|Macedonia Square]]. The exterior of the museum is almost complete, as of June 2012, and is among the more monumental buildings of the project, with its [[Greek Revival]] architecture.&lt;ref name="Ivanovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/?ItemID=DC1E632C696096498994678CDACAFDF6|title=Археолошки музеј во центарот на Скопје|last=Ivanovska|first=Vesna|date=January 21, 2009|work=Dnevnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=22 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[VMRO-DPMNE]], the ruling party, states the budget for the construction as 436,000,000 [[Macedonian denar|denars]].&lt;ref name="VMRO-DPMNE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vmro-dpmne.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/documents/VMRO%20programa%202014-2018%20v2a.pdf|title=Проберено: Проекти кои што докажано се остартуваат|publisher=VMRO-DPMNE|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agency for Electronic Communications====
[[File:Skopje 2014 - Agency for Electronic Communications and Archeological Museum.JPG|thumb|Agency for Electronic Communications (right)]]
The cornerstone for the new building to house the Agency for Electronic Communications was laid on 30 March 2011. It is being constructed on the eastern bank of the Vardar in between two other Skopje 2014 buildings, the Museum of Archaeology and the Financial Police Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7083|title=Камен темелник за новиот објект на АЕК|date=30 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total cost of the building's construction is around 8.5 million euros, which the government claims will be fully funded by the Agency's budget. It is expected to be completed in 15 months or by the late summer of 2012.&lt;ref name="Jovanova"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kapital.mk/MK/dneven_vesnik.aspx/26429/agencijata_za_elektronski_komunikacii_ja_dobiva_svojata_zgrada.aspx?iId=33|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221020103/http://www.kapital.mk/MK/dneven_vesnik.aspx/26429/agencijata_za_elektronski_komunikacii_ja_dobiva_svojata_zgrada.aspx?iId=33|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2013|title=АГЕНЦИЈАТА ЗА ЕЛЕКТРОНСКИ КОМУНИКАЦИИ ЈА ДОБИВА СВОЈАТА ЗГРАДА|last=Jovanova|first=Sonja|date=30 March 2011|publisher=Kapital|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Criminal Court Building is being constructed as part of the project. The cornerstone for the building was laid on 25 May 2010. The building, 10 stories tall, has been topped out. In it will be 74 judicial offices, 22 high courts, and 2 large courtrooms. The 2-story basement will contain parking. The building, reported to cost 8.3 million euros, was planned to be completed after 18 months of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=3626|title=Поставен камен темелник за новиот Кривичен суд|date=29 May 2010|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=3 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MFAandFinancialPoliceBldgSkopje.jpg|220px|thumb|The completed Financial Police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs buildings]]
On 11 October 2010 the cornerstone for the new building to house the Financial Police of the Republic of Macedonia was laid. The site is located between the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the new Agency for Electronic Communications. The building, currently several months from completion, is cylindrical in shape and is capped by a dome-shaped roof. The total cost of construction will be roughly 13 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=5216|title=Камен темелник за зграда на Обвинителството и Финансиската полиција|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry of Finance====
The government, in March 2011, invested 8.9 million euros into transforming an abandoned uncompleted building in central Skopje into a new home for the Ministry of Finance. Like the other governmental buildings in Skopje 2014, it will have a neoclassical appearance. Though it was scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2012, the building remains far from completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=6871|title=Министерството за финансии ќе се сели во "Југобанка"|date=8 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry of Foreign Affairs====
Construction of the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs building began in January 2010. It is located on the eastern bank of the Vardar between the Financial Police Building and Stiv Naumov Street. It will have two basement levels, seven above-ground levels, and a terrace atop the building. The building, which is nearly complete on the exterior, stands at a height of 27&amp;nbsp;m (88.6&amp;nbsp;ft) and will have costed 13.5 million euros when completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=2837|title=Официјален камен темелник за новото МНР|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New City Hall====
A new city hall for Skopje is being constructed below the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]], on the eastern bank of the Vardar. It is being constructed, as most other buildings in the project, in the neoclassical style and will cost roughly 15 million euros. It will be 21&amp;nbsp;m (68.9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, with six above-ground floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7984|title=Се гради објект за скопската градска администрација|date=3 June 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old City Hall====
Although a new city hall for Skopje is being constructed, the former one destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] will be fully reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It will be built on its original location at the north side of Macedonia Square, to the west of the Vardar Quay. A Greek investor will be building the Old City Hall, as well as a Marriott Hotel to the immediate left of the building, after purchasing the land in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=6920|title=Грчки инвеститор ќе ги гради Офицерскиот дом и хотелот на Плоштад Македонија|date=12 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Management Building====
Among the buildings being constructed below the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]] on the eastern bank of the Vardar is the Water Management Building. Construction of the building began in December 2011. It is expected to be completed in 3 years at a cost of 10 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.mk/read/58d92cc11d/d4bf718890/index.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221032952/http://www.time.mk/read/58d92cc11d/d4bf718890/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2013|title=Поставен камен-темелник на новата зграда на ЈП "Водовод и канализација"|date=4 December 2011|publisher=[[Macedonian Radio-Television]]|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trajkovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=6C30BE3B498BB14E96CAE30F422EF3AF|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219022739/http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=6C30BE3B498BB14E96CAE30F422EF3AF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 February 2013|title=Градската администрација ќе добие зграда под Кале|last=Trajkovska|first=Despina|date=13 December 2010|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===

====Justinian I====
[[File:Justinian I . 2 . Monuments in Skopje.JPG|thumb|180px|Justinian I monument]]

The monument of [[Justinian I]], born in [[Tauresium]] just outside modern Skopje, arrived at Macedonia Square on June 16, 2011. Similar to the monument of Tsar Samuil, also on Macedonia Square, it consists of Justinian I sitting on a throne, which is placed on a pedestal. The monument is made of white marble with the exception of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal, also characteristics it shares with the Tsar Samuil monument. The pedestal is 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, while Justinian upon his throne measures a further 5&amp;nbsp;m (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height.

The monument sits just north of the Stone Bridge, at the western bank of the Vardar River. It was made in Florence and cost over 1 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sky.mk/component/content/article/1249-2011-06-17-11-56-48.html|title=Се поставува Јустинијан Први|date=17 June 2011 &lt;!--13:55--&gt;|publisher=Sky.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203085300/http://sky.mk/component/content/article/1249-2011-06-17-11-56-48.html|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mother Teresa====
The construction of a monument consisting of a statue of Skopje native [[Mother Teresa]] and a fountain is planned. The monument will be located near the MEPSO building, which is north of Macedonia Square near the Vardar Quay, though location on the roundabout near the Goce Delčev Bridge is also a possibility. It is planned to stand around 30&amp;nbsp;m (98.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, even taller than the Warrior on a Horse monument.

It has been reported that a donation from India will fund the construction of the new Mother Teresa monument, who is already memorialized in the city with the [[Memorial House of Mother Teresa]] and a plaque marking the spot of her birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bukvar.mk/news/kje-se-gradi-spomenik-na-majka-tereza-povisok-od-voinot-na-konj?newsid=9SxW|title=ЌЕ СЕ ГРАДИ СПОМЕНИК НА МАЈКА ТЕРЕЗА ПОВИСОК ОД ВОИНОТ НА КОЊ|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Fakulteti.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=30 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pavilion at Macedonia Square====
[[File:Летниковецот на Плоштад (8).JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Pavilion at Macedonia Square]]

The Pavilion at Macedonia Square is situated on the north side of Macedonia Square. Construction began in early 2011 and was completed later that year at a cost of 350,000 euros.&lt;ref name="Dimitrievski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily.mk/i-letnikovec?forward=567090|title=И летниковец ...|last=Dimitrievski|first=Aleksandar|date=26 January 2011|publisher=Alfa TV|language=Macedonian|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion consists of a dome supported by several columns, covering a statue of a romantic couple.

====Porta Macedonia====

{{Main|Porta Macedonia}}

One of the main symbols of the project is Porta Macedonia, a [[triumphal arch]] situated on 11 October Street, near Macedonia Square. The arch is meant to commemorate the long struggle for Macedonian independence. It is 21&amp;nbsp;m (68.9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and contains 32 reliefs carved on the outside, depicting events from pre-history to the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. The inside of the arch consists of two levels, in which a souvenir shop and a gallery are located, and a rooftop observation deck. It formally opened to the public on Christmas Eve, January 6, 2012. The construction of Porta Macedonia is estimated at 4.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=11623|title="Порта Македонија" свечено претставена на јавноста|date=January 6, 2012|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=22 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tsar Samuil====
[[File:Samuil 1. Monuments in Skopje.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Tsar Samuil monument]]

The monument to [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] is among the new focal points of Macedonia Square. Officially unveiled on 28 June 2011, it is situated in front of the Pelister building, to the right of where Macedonia Street meets Macedonia Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=139834|title=Поставен споменикот на Цар Самоил|date=2011-06-28 &lt;!--  15:23 --&gt; |publisher=А1|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument, mostly in white marble, consists of a depiction of Tsar Samuil sitting on a throne, totaling 5&amp;nbsp;m (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, and is placed on a pedestal which itself is a further 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The reliefs on the sides of the pedestal are bronze.  Tsar Samuil, in the monument, holds a scepter. Made in Florence, the total cost of the Tsar Samuil monument was roughly 3.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E96A2FA4FAECB34697607E35AE088F1A|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219045443/http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E96A2FA4FAECB34697607E35AE088F1A|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=Споменикот на Цар Самоил стигна на плоштадот "Македонија"|date=2011-06-28 &lt;!-- , 11:11 --&gt;|publisher=Dnevnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite side of the Stone Bridge from Macedonia Square is Karpoš's Rebellion Square, which serves as a main entrance to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. It is undergoing a major reconstruction, as part of Skopje 2014, and its new centerpiece will be the statue and fountain officially named "Warrior," though it is widely believed that the statue is a depiction of [[Philip II of Macedon]], not to be confused with the equestrian statue of Philip II in Skopje's Avtokomanda neighborhood. The statue was placed onto the square on 22 May 2012.

Made in Vicenza, the statue is 15&amp;nbsp;m (49.2&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and is placed on a 13&amp;nbsp;m (42.7&amp;nbsp;ft) tall pedestal. The entire monument will cost roughly 2 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=15338|title=Филип Втори поставен на плоштадот "Карпошово востание"|date=22 May 2012|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=29 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the main symbol of the Skopje 2014 project is the Warrior on a Horse ({{lang-mk|Воин на коњ}}) statue and fountain in the centre of Macedonia Square. It is typically thought to depict [[Alexander the Great]], though it is not officially named for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/index.html Is Macedonia's capital being turned into a theme park?] CNN International, 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse Macedonia statue: Alexander the Great or a warrior on a horse?] The Guardian, Sunday 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statue was sculpted by [[Valentina Stevanovska]] and cast in Florence. "Alexander" was officially completed on September 8, 2011 to commemorate 20 years of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. It is 14.5&amp;nbsp;m (47.6&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and it sits on a cylindrical column, which itself is 10&amp;nbsp;m (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft) in height. The column consists of three large ivory sections, each separated by a thinner bronze ring. Each section contains reliefs. The column stands in a fountain. At the base of the column are 8 bronze soldiers, each 3&amp;nbsp;m (9.8&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. There are also 8 bronze lions, each 2.5&amp;nbsp;m (8.3&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, around the edges of the fountain pool, four of which act as part of the fountain, releasing water from their mouths. The fountain also plays music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vesti.alfa.mk/default.aspx?mid=36&amp;eventid=40603|title=Пуштање во употреба фонтана со споменикот "Воин на коњ"|date=8 September 2011|publisher=Alfa TV|language=Macedonian|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723123128/http://vesti.alfa.mk/default.aspx?mid=36&amp;eventid=40603|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total cost of the Warrior on a Horse monument is roughly 7.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trtmacedonian.com/trtworld/mk/newsDetail.aspx?HaberKodu=a7c635ff-8af9-489b-867a-9d01e3251863|title=ПОСТАВЕН СПОМЕНИКОТ НА АЛЕКСАНДАР МАКЕДОНСКИ НАРЕЧЕН "ВОИН НА КОЊ" ВО СКОПЈЕ|publisher=www.trtmacedonian.com|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Docked boats in Vardar River====
[[File:Ship in Vardar, Skopje.jpg|thumb|200px|One of building-boats in the Vardar River]]
The first of four building-boats as restaurants and cafes just in the Vardar River opened in July 2014. The boats are erected into the riverbed and, thus, will remain in their planned spots permanently. The boats, all to be situated in central Skopje, were intended to be in the Baroque style.&lt;ref name="plusinfo1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plusinfo.mk/vest/144687/Zaplovi-prvata-galija-vo-Vardar|title="Заплови" првата галија во Вардар|date=21 July 2014|language=Macedonian|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sitel.com.mk/dnevnik/makedonija/izbrani-idejnite-reshenija-za-splavovi-na-vardar|title=Избрани идејните решенија за сплавови на Вардар|date=3 March 2012|publisher=Sitel|language=Macedonian|accessdate=20 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ferris wheel====
The erection of a Ferris wheel is foreseen on the Vardar River. It will require the construction of a new pedestrian bridge, to run from the [[Museum of the Macedonian Struggle (Skopje)|Museum of the Macedonian Struggle]] to the MEPSO Building, upon which it will stand. No final plan for the project has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plusinfo.mk/vest/27264/Panoramskoto-trkalo-kje-se-gradi-na-nov-most|title=Панорамското тркало ќе се гради на нов мост|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Plusinfo|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fountains in Vardar River====
The addition of fountains on the Vardar River was planned early on in the project. They were completed in 2010. The fountains have been criticized for reportedly releasing mud, as well as for acting as a filter for trash flowing down the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kirilica.com.mk/vest.asp?id=66369|title=Потскокна и фонтаната во Вардар|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Kirilica|language=Macedonian|accessdate=17 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kale Fortress reconstruction====
Director of Cultural Heritage and archaeologist [[Pasko Kuzman]] has announced a plan to restore and reconstruct the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]]. The plan also includes the construction of a museum to house Byzantine archaeological finds from the fortress, as well as reconstructions of a prehistoric house and an Ottoman guard tower to be built on the place of their ruins. Souvenir shops and cafes are also foreseen additions. The most controversial part of the restoration of the fortress is the construction of a church, which has been protested by ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref name="Trpčevska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=5CE5FDEADB1BF94B8543DC889925F25D|title=Отомански кули и праисториски куќи ќе никнат на Кале|last=Trpčevska|first=Daniela|date=24 August 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karpoš's Rebellion Square reconstruction====
Karpoš's Rebellion Square is situated opposite the Vardar River of Macedonia Square and is undergoing a significant reconstruction. Plans include the erection of a statue and fountain depicting Phillip II of Macedon, though officially named "Warrior," at the far northeast side of the square. Another monument consisting of a fountain and statues representing the Mothers of Macedonia is being constructed in front of the Warrior monument. In front of this will be two monuments, also consisting of a fountain and statues, depicting horses. The two will be situated on either side of the entrance to the square from the Stone Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=8540|title=Почнува уредувањето на плоштадот Карпошово востание|date=6 July 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office building on Macedonia Square====
[[File:OfficeBldgMacedoniaSquare.jpg|thumb|220px|The office building]]

A new office building was constructed on the south side of Macedonia Square, on the Vardar Quay. It stands on the same place as the former headquarters of the National Bank, which was destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]]. The new office building is similar in shape to the former bank building, though it is not in the neoclassical style, which also makes it somewhat unusual in the Skopje 2014 project.&lt;ref name="Naumovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=4048432E7DF51C4B886B49D49DB3C216|title=Новата зграда во Скопје само ќе личи на Народната банка|last=Naumovska|first=Sanja|date=8 August 2008|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skanderbeg Square construction====
{{Main|Skanderbeg Square (Skopje)}}
[[File:Skopje, Daut Pasuv hamam (turecke lazne) ve Skopji, bila budova v.jpg|thumb|220px|Macedonian Opera]]
An existing statue of [[Skanderbeg]], an important historical figure to ethnic Albanians, will be the main fixture of an under construction square that will bear his name in Skopje's [[Čair Municipality]]. The square's total cost is estimated at around 10 million euros and is expected to be completed in 2014. The square will cover 28,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (301,389&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and will extend from Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. This will require building a portion of the square on top of Goce Delčev Boulevard. Aside from plenty of open space, the square will contain an amphitheatre, a fountain, and underground parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kanal5.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=37&amp;eventId=83549&amp;egId=13|title="Скендер Бег" готов до 2014 - та|date=28 November 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726135632/http://kanal5.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=37|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.mk/read/218a743d6a/484bce79b5/index.html|title=Плоштадот Скендерг-бег ќе чини 10 милиони евра|date=21 October 2011|publisher=Time.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219034051/http://www.time.mk/read/218a743d6a/484bce79b5/index.html|archivedate=19 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thule Society''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|l|ə}}; {{lang-de|Thule-Gesellschaft}}), originally the ''Studiengruppe für germanisches Altertum'' ("Study Group for [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] Antiquity"), was a German [[occult]]ist and ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' group founded in [[Munich]] right after [[World War I]], named after a [[Thule|mythical northern country]] in Greek legend. The society is notable chiefly as the organization that sponsored the [[German Workers' Party|Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]] (DAP; German Workers' Party), which was later reorganized by [[Adolf Hitler]] into the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP or Nazi Party). According to Hitler biographer [[Ian Kershaw]], the organization's "membership list ... reads like a Who's Who of early Nazi sympathizers and leading figures in Munich", including [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Hans Frank]], [[Julius Lehmann]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Dietrich Eckart]], and [[Karl Harrer]].&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian (2000). ''Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] contends that Hans Frank and Rudolf Hess had been Thule members, but other leading Nazis had only been invited to speak at Thule meetings or they were entirely unconnected with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|pp=149, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 2003 114"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2003|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johannes Hering, "There is no evidence that Hitler ever attended the Thule Society."&lt;ref name=GC201/&gt;

==Origins==
The Thule Society was originally a "German study group" headed by Walter Nauhaus,&lt;ref name=Ph&gt;{{harvnb|Phelps|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; a wounded [[World War I]] veteran turned art student from [[Berlin]] who had become a keeper of pedigrees for the [[Germanenorden]] (or "Order of [[Germanic peoples|Teutons]]"), a [[secret society]] founded in 1911 and formally named in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|pp=127–28, 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Nauhaus moved to Munich; his ''Thule Society'' was to be a cover-name for the Munich branch of the Germanenorden,&lt;ref&gt;Phelps 1963, n.31.&lt;/ref&gt; but events developed differently as a result of a schism in the Order. In 1918, Nauhaus was contacted in Munich by [[Rudolf von Sebottendorf]] (or von Sebottendorff), an occultist and newly elected head of the [[Bavaria]]n province of the schismatic offshoot known as the [[Germanenorden Walvater of the Holy Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|pp=131, 142–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men became associates in a recruitment campaign, and Sebottendorff adopted Nauhaus's Thule Society as a cover-name for his Munich lodge of the Germanenorden Walvater at its formal dedication on 18 August 1918.&lt;ref name=GC144&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
A primary focus of the Thule Society was a claim concerning the origins of the [[Aryan race]]. In 1917, people who wanted to join the "Germanic Order", out of which the Thule Society developed in 1918, had to sign a special "blood declaration of faith" concerning their lineage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The signer hereby swears to the best of his knowledge and belief that no Jewish or coloured blood flows in either his or in his wife's veins, and that among their ancestors are no members of the coloured races.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf von Sebottendorff, ''Bevor Hitler kam'', 1933, page 42 (original: "Blutbekenntnis": "Unterzeichner versichert nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen, daß in seinen und seiner Frau Adern kein jüdisches oder farbiges Blut fließe und daß sich unter den Vorfahren auch keine Angehörigen der farbigen Rassen befinden.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"[[Thule]]" ({{lang-gr|Θούλη}}) was a land located by Greco-Roman [[geographer]]s in the farthest north (often displayed as Iceland).&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.12:1:419.geography "Perseus Digital Library"], citing Smith's ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term "Ultima Thule" is also mentioned by Roman poet [[Virgil]] in his pastoral poems called the ''[[Georgics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vergil, Georgics, 1.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thule originally was probably the name for [[Scandinavia]], although Virgil simply uses it as a proverbial expression for the edge of the known world, and his mention should not be taken as a substantial reference to [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxford Classical Dictionary|2003|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thule Society identified Ultima Thule as a lost ancient landmass in the extreme north, near [[Greenland]] or [[Iceland]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicolas (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZzWRz9x8mwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Thule%20Society%22%20Ignatius%20Donnelly&amp;pg=PA145#v=snippet&amp;q=Ultima&amp;f=false ''The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology''] New YorkL NYU Press. p.145 {{isbn|9780814730607}}&lt;/ref&gt; said by [[Nazi occultism|Nazi mystics]] to be the capital of ancient [[Hyperborea]].

==Activities==
The Thule Society attracted about 250 followers in Munich and about 1,500 elsewhere in [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of the Thule Society were very interested in racial theory and, in particular, in combating [[Jew]]s and [[Communism|Communists]]. Sebottendorff planned but failed to kidnap Bavarian socialist [[prime minister]] [[Kurt Eisner]] in December 1918.&lt;ref name=Ph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Bavarian revolution]] of April 1919, Thulists were accused of trying to infiltrate its government and of attempting a coup. On 26 April, the Communist government in Munich raided the society's premises and took seven of its members into custody, executing them on 30 April. Amongst them were Walter Nauhaus and four well-known aristocrats, including Countess Heila von Westarp who functioned as the group's secretary, and [[Prince Gustav of Thurn and Taxis]] who was related to several European royal families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitas-international.org/showcase/chronography/timebase/1919tbse.htm Timebase 1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929134934/http://www.humanitas-international.org/showcase/chronography/timebase/1919tbse.htm |date=2006-09-29 }}. ''Timebase Multimedia Chronography''. Accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=148.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Thule organised a citizens' uprising as White troops entered the city on 1 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=149.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Münchener Beobachter'' newspaper===
In 1918, the Thule Society bought a local weekly newspaper, the ''[[Münchener Beobachter]]'' (Munich Observer), and changed its name to ''Münchener Beobachter und Sportblatt'' (Munich Observer and Sports Paper) in an attempt to improve its circulation. The ''Münchener Beobachter'' later became the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' ("''[[Völkisch]]'' Observer"), the main Nazi newspaper. It was edited by [[Karl Harrer]].

===Deutsche Arbeiterpartei===
[[Anton Drexler]] had developed links between the Thule Society and various extreme right workers' organizations in Munich. He established the [[German Workers' Party|''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'']] (DAP; German Workers' Party) on 5 January 1919, together with the Thule Society's Karl Harrer. Adolf Hitler joined this party in September the same year. By the end of February 1920, the DAP had been reconstituted as the [[Nazi Party|''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'']] (NSDAP; National Socialist German Workers' Party), often referred to as the Nazi Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebottendorff by then had left the Thule Society, and never joined the DAP or the Nazi Party. Dietrich Bronder (''Bevor Hitler kam'', 1964) alleged that other members of the Thule Society were later prominent in Nazi Germany: the list includes [[Dietrich Eckart]] (who coached Hitler on his [[public speaking]] skills, along with [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], and had ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' dedicated to him), as well as [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Hans Frank]], [[Hermann Göring]], [[Karl Haushofer]], [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985 221"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] has described this membership role and similar claims as "spurious" and "fanciful", noting that Feder, Eckart, and Rosenberg were never more than guests to whom the Thule Society extended hospitality during the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Bavarian revolution of 1918]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|pp=149, 217–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he has more recently acknowledged that Hess and Frank were members of the society before they came to prominence in the Nazi Party.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 2003 114"/&gt; It has also been claimed that Adolf Hitler himself was a member.&lt;ref name=Ange9&gt;{{harvnb|Angebert|1974|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence on the contrary shows that he never attended a meeting, as attested to by Johannes Hering's diary of society meetings.&lt;ref name=GC201&gt;Johannes Hering, "Beiträge zur Geschichte der Thule-Gesellschaft", typescript dated 21 June 1939, ''Bundesarchiv Koblenz'', NS26/865, cited in Goodrick-Clarke (1985: 201), who concludes: "There is no evidence that Hitler ever attended the Thule Society" (ibid., 201).&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite clear that Hitler himself had little interest in, and made little time for, "esoteric" matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skorzeny|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also Hitler's Nuremberg speech of 6 September 1938 on his disapproval of occultism.)

Wilhelm Laforce and Max Sesselmann (staff on the ''Münchener Beobachter'') were Thule members who later joined the NSDAP.&lt;ref name=Ph&gt;{{harvnb|Phelps|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
Early in 1920, Karl Harrer was forced out of the DAP as Hitler moved to sever the party's link with the Thule Society, which subsequently fell into decline and was dissolved about five years later,&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985 221"/&gt; well before Hitler came to power.

[[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]] had withdrawn from the Thule Society in 1919, but he returned to Germany in 1933 in the hope of reviving it.  In that year, he published a book entitled ''Bevor Hitler kam'' ({{de icon}}: ''Before Hitler Came''), in which he claimed that the Thule Society had paved the way for the Führer: "Thulers were the ones to whom Hitler first came, and Thulers were the first to unite themselves with Hitler."  This claim was not favourably received by the Nazi authorities: after 1933, esoteric organisations were suppressed (including ''völkisch'' occultists), many closed down by anti-[[Freemasonry|Masonic]] legislation in 1935.  Sebottendorff's book was prohibited and he himself was arrested and imprisoned for a short period in 1934, afterwards departing into exile in Turkey.

Nonetheless, it has been argued that some Thule members and their ideas were incorporated into the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name=Ange9/&gt;  Some of the Thule Society's teachings were expressed in the books of [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Alfred Rosenberg, ''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts: Eine Wertung der seelischgeistigen Gestaltungskämpfe unserer Zeit'', München: Hoheneichen, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; Many occult ideas found favour with Heinrich Himmler, who had a great interest in mysticism, unlike Hitler, but the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) under Himmler emulated the structure of [[Ignatius Loyola]]'s [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Höhne |1969 |pp=138, 143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the Thule Society, according to Hohne.

==Conspiracy theories==
The Thule Society has become the center of many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] concerning [[Nazi Germany]], due to its occult background (like the [[Ahnenerbe]] section of the SS). Such theories include the creation of [[vril]]-powered [[Nazi UFOs]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 2003: 166–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=October 2018}}
In popular culture, references to the Thule Society have included the 2013 [[Supernatural (season 8)|season 8]] episode "Everybody Hates Hitler" of [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', in which a group of society members seek out a lost ledger containing information about their experiments with [[necromancy]]. In the 2016 [[Supernatural (season 11)|season 11]] episode "The Vessel", a leading member of the Thule Society vies against Dean to find a piece of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] during World War II. In the [[Supernatural (season 12)|season 12]] episode "The One You've Been Waiting For", the Thule leadership endeavors to resurrect [[Adolf Hitler]], resulting in the death of both the leadership of the Thule Society and the resurrected Hitler.

* June 8: [[George Orwell|George Orwell's]] ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984)]]'' is published. The dystopian novel presents the super-state of Oceania, dominated by an omnipresent totalitarian government underpinned by pervasive overt and covert surveillance of citizens, proscribed language and rigid societal institutions. The book establishes the concept of "[[Orwellian]]" societies in the public imagination, framing government institutions as tools of manipulation via draconian control by [[propaganda]], [[surveillance]], [[misinformation]], [[Denialism|denial of truth]] ([[doublethink]]), and manipulation of the past, including the "[[unperson]]"— a person whose past existence is expunged from public record and memory.
* August 29: The USSR (aka Soviet Union, or "Russia" in common usage) detonates its [[RDS-1|first atomic bomb]] with essential aid of [[atomic spies]] from the US, UK, and Canada.

* June 25: [[Korean War|Prelude to Vietnam]]: Communist forces of [[North Korea]] invade western ally South Korea with support from the People's Republic of China and the USSR.

The dividing line chosen, at the seventeenth parallel a little north of the city of Hue, was quite close to the line that had separated the two halves of Vietnam in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but this was purely a coincidence. This line no longer corresponded to any natural division in Vietnamese society, in economy, political structure, religion, or dialect.

The pill is widely believed to have loosened sexual mores, including the double standard that sanctioned premarital sex for men but not for women. But, according to historian Elaine Tyler May, this idea is largely a myth. As May explained to a Stanford audience, the pill's impact on the sexual revolution is unclear. What is clear is that the drug had a far greater impact within marriage itself.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212220618/http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/pill-and-marriage-revolution#|archive-date=2017-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* May 4: [[Freedom Riders]]: Civil Rights activists travel on public buses and trains across the American South to personally confront and challenge segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freedom Rides: CORE Volunteers Put Their Lives on the Road|url=http://www.core-online.org/History/freedom%20rides.htm|website=core-online.org|publisher=Congress of Racial Equality|accessdate=September 22, 2014|quote=In 1961 CORE undertook a new tactic aimed at desegregating public transportation throughout the south. These tactics became known as the "Freedom Rides". The first Freedom Ride took place on May 4, 1961 when seven blacks and six whites left Washington, D.C., on two public buses bound for the Deep South. They intended to test the Supreme Court's ruling in Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which declared segregation in interstate bus and rail stations unconstitutional. In the first few days, the riders encountered only minor hostility, but in the second week the riders were severely beaten. Outside Anniston, Alabama, one of their buses was burned, and in Birmingham several dozen whites attacked the riders only two blocks from the sheriff's office. With the intervention of the U.S. Justice Department, most of CORE's Freedom Riders were evacuated from Birmingham, Alabama to New Orleans. John Lewis, a former seminary student who would later lead SNCC and become a US congressman, stayed in Birmingham. CORE Leaders decided that letting violence end the trip would send the wrong signal to the country. They reinforced the pair of remaining riders with volunteers, and the trip continued. The group traveled from Birmingham to Montgomery without incident, but on their arrival in Montgomery they were savagely attacked by a mob of more than 1000 whites. The extreme violence and the indifference of local police prompted a national outcry of support for the riders, putting pressure on President Kennedy to end the violence. The riders continued to Mississippi, where they endured further brutality and jail terms but generated more publicity and inspired dozens more Freedom Rides. By the end of the summer, the protests had spread to train stations and airports across the South, and in November, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued rules prohibiting segregated transportation facilities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 4: JFK meets with Soviet Premier Khrushchev in [[Vienna summit#The Berlin Question|Vienna]], and reports no progress on issues concerning partitioned Germany.

Rather than submit to such pressure, President John F. Kennedy replied that it would be a "cold winter." When he returned to the United States, Kennedy faced instead a summer of decision. On July 25 he announced plans to meet the Soviet challenge in Berlin, including a dramatic buildup of American conventional forces and drawing the line on interference with Allied access to West Berlin. This warning, in fact, contained the basis for resolving the crisis. On August 13 the East German Government, supported by Khrushchev, finally closed the border between East and West Berlin by erecting what eventually became the most concrete symbol of the Cold War: the Berlin Wall. Although the citizens of Berlin reacted to the wall with outrage, many in the West—certainly within the Kennedy administration—reacted with relief. The wall interfered with the personal lives of the people but not with the political position of the Allies in Berlin. The result was a "satisfactory" stalemate—the Soviets did not challenge the legality of Allied rights, and the Allies did not challenge the reality of Soviet power.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203020744/http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1946_cold_war/berlin_crisis.html|archivedate=December 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=John F.|title=Report on the Berlin Crisis (July 25, 1961) by John F.

The organization was composed primarily of mothers who feared the effects of nuclear proliferation on the short- and long-term health of their children. They were particularly concerned with levels of irradiation in milk and the increase in nuclear testing. WSP had the slogan "End the Arms Race – Not the Human Race," as well as "Pure Milk, Not Poison."  Bella Abzug joined the group in its early organizational stages as an active participant in the New York contingent and as creator and chairperson of WSP's legislative committee. By pushing the organization to incorporate legislative lobbying into its efforts, she helped it to become an effective political force. By 1964, the emphasis of Women Strike for Peace had shifted to focus as much on the Vietnam War as on disarmament, protesting against the draft and the war's effects on Vietnamese children. Abzug remained active in WSP until she was elected to Congress in 1970.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marder|first1=Dorothy|title=Photographs of Dorothy Marder – Women Strike for Peace, 1961–1975|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/Exhibits/Dorothy%20Marder/MarderExhibit1A_files/MarderExhibit1A.html|website=swarthmore.edu|publisher=Elizabeth Matlock and Wendy Chmielewski via Swarthmore College (Swarthmore College Peace Collection)|accessdate=September 22, 2014|quote=Women Strike for Peace (WSP) was formed in 1961 after over 50,000 women across the country marched for peace and against above ground testing of nuclear weapons.

Their declassification occurred over a period, leading up to the final report of a citizens' commission created by Congress six years ago to dispel lingering suspicions that the truth had been hidden. Discussing criticism of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination at the time, the article said that one member, Allen W. Dulles, a former Director of Central Intelligence, had failed to tell fellow members ''that Kennedy had ordered the C.I.A. to assassinate Castro.'' The article did not cite evidence or authority for the assertion about the President. Earlier articles, on July 20, 1997, and Nov. 23, 1997, also declared without qualification that Kennedy ordered Fidel Castro's assassination. A number of prominent historians and officials with knowledge of intelligence matters in that era have asserted in interviews that President Kennedy gave such an order. But others, also close to the President, dispute their account. The Times's practice is to attribute or qualify information that it is unable to report firsthand.

What made the show revolutionary were the models: a group of nonprofessionals with unabashedly dark skin and natural, unprocessed, curly hair. They were part of the newly formed Grandassa Models, and they were as unlike any fashion plates as the crowd had ever seen.  "It was a pioneering concept, women coming out on stage wearing their hair in a natural state," former AJASS member Robert Gumbs told The Post. "We didn't know how the community would respond. I think a number of people came to laugh."  Yet by the end of the evening, audience members were cheering the models. And the show's slogan, "Black Is Beautiful" — printed on fliers and posters announcing the event — would become a rallying cry and movement celebrating natural hair, darker skin and African heritage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having only a few hundred members across the country at the time the Statement was drafted, SDS drew tens of thousands of students into its ranks as the movement against the Vietnam War grew—before a deep factional split destroyed the organization in 1969. During SDS's history of activism, 60,000 copies of the Statement were distributed.

* August 5: Film star Marilyn Monroe dies of a [[barbiturate]] overdose under suspicious circumstances in Los Angeles. Monroe's death is a precursor to an explosion of recreational use of highly addictive prescription drugs (and thousands of accidental pill overdose deaths) during the counterculture era, even as legitimate use of these drugs is already in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Ucha-Udabe|first2=Ronaldo|last3=Alamo|first3=Cecilio|title=The History of Barbiturates a Century after their Clinical Introduction|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|date=December 2005|volume=1|issue=4|pages=329–343|pmc=2424120|publisher=Dove Press via US National Institutes of Health|quote=In relation to the frequent cases of death by overdose, given the small therapeutic margin of these substances, it should be pointed out that this was a common method in suicide attempts. It suffices to recall, in this regard, the famous case of Marilyn Monroe, on whose death certificate it clearly states "acute poisoning by overdose of barbiturates" (Figure 7). The lethal effect of these compounds was such that a mixture of barbiturates with other substances was even employed in some USA states for the execution of prisoners sentenced to death. Furthermore, there are classic reports of fatal overdose due to the "automatism phenomenon", whereby the patient would take his or her dose, only to forget that he or she had already taken it, given the amnesic effect of the drug, and take it again, this process being repeated several times (Richards 1934). Figure 8 shows the evolution of number of deaths (accidental or suicide) by barbiturate overdose in England and Wales for the period 1905–1960. In this regard, and in the city of New York alone, in the period 1957–1963, there were 8469 cases of barbiturate overdose, with 1165 deaths (Sharpless 1970), whilst in the United Kingdom, between 1965 and 1970, there were 12 354 deaths attributed directly to barbiturates (Barraclough 1974). These data should not surprise us, since in a period of just one year (1968), 24.7 million prescriptions for barbiturates were issued in the United Kingdom (Plant 1981). In view of these data, the Advisory Council Campaign in Britain took measures restricting the prescription of these drugs. Meanwhile, the prescription of prolonged-acting sedative barbiturates was strongly opposed through citizens' action campaigns such as CURB (Campaign on the Use and Restrictions of Barbiturates), especially active during the 1970s.|pmid=18568113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 Mistresses: #4, Marilyn Monroe|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1908008_1908007_1907992,00.html|website=content.time.com|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=September 25, 2014|quote=Monroe died later in 1962 of a drug overdose, but tales about her alleged fling with the President grew increasingly tall.

But the Dutch anti-smoking "magician" and voodoo showman '''Robert Jasper Grootveld has a better claim than most.''' In the early Sixties, his surreal, dadaist "happenings" in Amsterdam electrified the city's bored youth and led to the creation of the playful Provo movement (short for "provocation"). With the charismatic, flamboyantly transvestite Grootveld as a spokesman, Provo was a catalyst for cultural revolution. The group provided free bicycles, subverted a royal wedding and humiliated the stiff-necked Dutch establishment and Amsterdam police force so effectively that both groups – and the country – underwent a near-total personality change. Provo lasted only from 1965 to 1967 but the spirit of what Grootveld dubbed "International Magic Centre Amsterdam" broke old Holland, inspired hippies in San Francisco and musicians and artists in London and paved the way, among other things, for the summer of love, Dutch total football and the green movement. | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-jasper-grootveld-artist-and-activist-who-helped-found-the-dutch-provos-in-the-1960s-1687682.html | title = Robert Jasper Grootveld: Artist and activist who helped found the Dutch Provos in the 1960s | last = Winner | first = David | date = 19 May 2009 | website = www.independent.co.uk | publisher = The Independent | access-date = 3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/grootveld/documents/hipperzweters-voorjaar-1964.pdf International Institute of Social History – Grootveld flyers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The riot spurred from an incident on August 11, 1965 when Marquette Frye, a young African American motorist, was pulled over and arrested by Lee W. Minikus, a white California Highway Patrolman, for suspicion of driving while intoxicated. As a crowd on onlookers gathered at the scene of Frye's arrest, strained tensions between police officers and the crowd erupted in a violent exchange. The outbreak of violence that followed Frye's arrest immediately touched off a large-scale riot centered in the commercial section of Watts, a deeply impoverished African American neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles. For several days, rioters overturned and burned automobiles and looted and damaged grocery stores, liquor stores, department stores, and pawnshops. Over the course of the six-day riot, over 14,000 California National Guard troops were mobilized in South Los Angeles and a curfew zone encompassing over forty-five miles was established in an attempt to restore public order. All told, the rioting claimed the lives of thirty-four people, resulted in more than one thousand reported injuries, and almost four thousand arrests before order was restored on August 17. Throughout the crisis, public officials advanced the argument that the riot was the work outside agitators; however, an official investigation, prompted by Governor Pat Brown, found that the riot was a result of the Watts community's longstanding grievances and growing discontentment with high unemployment rates, substandard housing, and inadequate schools. Despite the reported findings of the gubernatorial commission, following the riot, city leaders and state officials failed to implement measures to improve the social and economic conditions of African Americans living in the Watts neighborhood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I think we'd had a barney or something, and I said, 'Oh, fuck you!' and they said, 'Well, we'll do it,'" McCartney told Barry Miles in the 1998 biography Many Years From Now.  The song was inspired by Lennon's 1965 LSD trip with Byrds members Roger McGuinn and David Crosby, during which actor Peter Fonda told a frightened Harrison that he knew "what it's like to be dead." And the result plays like both a celebration and a mockery of the acid movement, driven by Harrison's stoned guitar shrapnel and dextrous, Macca-styled bass runs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers, Allen Cohen and Michael Bowen, were key figures with the San Francisco Oracle (12 issues between September 1966 and February 1968), an underground publication credited for shaping Haight-Ashbury's burgeoning counterculture. Cohen and Bowen framed the event not as a protest, but as a celebration of "transcendental consciousness" and the "beauty of being."  While less known than events that followed, this gathering marked a seminal moment in the counterculture revolution of the 1960s. This short document of the Love Pageant Rally features several notable figures from the Haight-Ashbury scene at the time. Striking in the film is how clearly the movement is on the cusp of both of breaking through and falling, if not apart, at least away from its idyllic core. There are two primary focuses in its three minutes: Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters and a performance by Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin. Some groovy dancing does receive significant screen time, but for the sake of this brief essay, lets imagine they're grooving to Big Brother. The differences between where each stood in regards to their participation in hippie culture presents an interesting glimpse at the seismic shift the countercultural revolution rested at the edge of.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, the Strip was the international center of a movement  that John Densmore, the Doors drummer, refers to as magical.  "So we're the house band at the Whiskey a Go Go, and I'm sitting upstairs looking out the window," Densmore said. "It's like a Tuesday night, and it's complete gridlock and thousands of hippies on the street and I said, 'Wow, we're taking over.'"  But the nightly throngs rattled the nerves of homeowners and some merchants. Local officials ordered a curfew and a crackdown.  Pandora's Box, a popular club at Sunset and Crescent Heights Boulevard, had been scheduled for demolition, and rebels rallied Nov. 12, 1966, in an effort to save it.

* January 1: The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) implements radio non-duplication rules: [[FM Radio|FM]] stations must broadcast at least 50% original content, and not simply simulcasts of their [[Am radio|AM]] sister stations.

AM stations simply duplicated their programming onto the FM band, widening their audience with little effort. In 1965, the Federal Communications Commission enacted the FM Non-Duplication Rule. Until this law, AM stations were allowed to rebroadcast the majority of their programming on their FM stations. However, with the passage of the FM Non-Duplication Rule, as of January 1, 1967, FM stations would have to broadcast original content over 50% of their broadcast day. Station programmers and owners now faced with having to create original content were forced to exit the box that was the Top 40 format and begin experimenting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Cox|title=Radio After the Golden Age: The Evolution of American Broadcasting Since 1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXOvAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=16 September 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7434-9|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the activity was concentrated at the beginning of the period, in the heyday of underground press activity. The "summer of love" in 1967 saw the birth of about 100 underground publications nationwide, and Yarrowstalks was one of the first. It was the most physically appealing of the first wave in its creative use of color and artwork. In contrast to the other Philadelphia papers, ''Yarrowstalks'' leaned away from the politics. Like New York's East Village Other and the ''San Francisco Oracle'', ''Yarrowstalks'' was among the first underground paper to explore the graphic possibilities of cold-type offset printing. Color was splashed over pages with sketches and text. The ''Oracle'', particularly, was responsible for making newspaper graphics an art form, and it published some of the most beautiful and trend-setting psychedelic art of the 1960s. ''Yarrowstalks'' was Philadelphia's ''Oracle'', and it was the first of the undergrounds to publish the cartoons of Robert Crumb, an ex-Hallmark illustrator who has become the leading artist of underground "commix."  In his character, Mr. Natural, he captured the feeling of the movement. Mr. Natural graced ''Yarrowstalks'' that summer and subsequently appeared in most of the alternative publications in the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Short, like all of the other officers, took cover wherever possible. The chief directed officers to fire only when fired upon and only above the building or directly at a known source of the gunfire. Reporters Charley Schneider of The Houston Post and Nick Gearhardt of KHOU-TV (Channel 11), were with this group of officers. Schneider said that there were two officers and a TV newsman in front of him. He said that Officer Louis Kuba was directly behind him with his hand on Schneider's shoulder. Heavy fire continued from the dorm and Schneider suddenly felt Kuba's hand become limp. Turning, he saw the officer slumping backward into Gearhardt's outstretched arms, an expressionless look on his face and blood pouring from his forehead. Schneider reported in a Post article the following day, "There was no riot at TSU. It was war."  An ambulance rushed the wounded officer to Ben Taub General Hospital. He died at 8:38 a.m. from a bullet wound above his right eye. Quiet, easy-going, even-tempered, Officer Louis Raymond Kuba, only thirty-four days out of Class No. 34, was only twenty-five.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oakland, California, at least 40 anti-war protesters, including the folk singer Joan Baez, were arrested for taking part in a sit-in at a military induction centre. As many as 250 demonstrators had gathered to try and prevent conscripts from entering the building when the arrests were made. The 'Stop the Draft Week' protests are forming part of a nationwide initiative organised by a group calling itself 'the Resistance'. Accompanied by singing from Baez and others, the sitting protesters forced draftees to climb over them in order to get inside the building. As they entered they were handed leaflets asking them to change their minds, refuse induction and join the protests. Human barricade Police formed a human barricade to enable inductees to pass and then made their arrests. In New York, around 500 demonstrators marched to protest against the draft. Young men placed draft cards into boxes marked 'Resisters'. 181 draft cards and several hundred protest cards were presented to a US Marshal but he refused to accept them. The group then marched to a post office and posted them directly to the Attorney General in Washington. The anti-war movement took on an added gravity yesterday when Florence Beaumont, mother of two, burned herself to death. After soaking herself in petrol she set herself alight in front of the Federal Building, Los Angeles. Counter-demonstrations have been planned by the National Committee for Responsible Patriotism, based in New York.

He did not try the drug himself until 1967. Marie Kleinman, a graduate student in the medicinal chemistry group that Shulgin advised at San Francisco State University, finally convinced Shulgin to try the drug. In 1976, Shulgin shared his enthusiasm about MDMA with Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff, who had actually been using the drug since 1961, began giving MDMA to his patients, using small doses as an aid to therapeutic interaction. Zeff proselytized actively and introduced MDMA to hundreds of psychologists around the nation, including Ann Shulgin, whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981 [6].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saginaw St. from Dec. 27–31 in 1969, according to MLive-The Flint Journal archives.  FBI says otherwise about Flint meetings: FBI documents previously labeled "top secret" and released to the Vault said the War Council meetings in Flint was the last open meeting held by the Weatherman Group. "It was at this meeting that the decision was made to go underground and to engage in guerrilla warfare against the U.S. government," a page read with the heading "WUD 'Flint, Michigan War Council.'"That 'quiet' Weatherman Council in Flint exploded. Weather Underground leader Mark Rudd said in Flint during the group's "War Council" that people should expect violence that will make "the '60s look like a Sunday school picnic," according to a July 24, 1970 Flint Journal article. A federal grand jury in Detroit charged Rudd and 12 others who conspired during the 4-day meeting in Flint in 1969 to commit assassinations and bombings in four U.S. cities, according to the article in MLive-The Flint Journal's archives. The indictments claimed the group met at the Giant Ballroom on Saginaw Street to set up a coordinating agency that would guide bombings in Chicago, Detroit, New York City and Berkeley, Calif. The indictments followed a dozen previous charges unveiled in connection to "Days of Wrath" riots in Chicago. Weatherman members went "underground" following the Chicago indictments, thus the group was then known as Weather Underground. Investigators and law enforcement officials said the meetings were a "failure" at the time and that they were social in nature more than anything.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Becoming a dancer==
DanceWriting was first developed in 1966, when Sutton was only 15, training as a professional [[ballet]] dancer. She invented a stick figure notation for her own personal use. Four years later she went to [[Copenhagen, Denmark]] to train with the [[Royal Danish Ballet]]. Over the next two years she applied her system to recording the historic ballet steps of the Royal Danish Ballet, which were in danger of being forgotten from lack of recording. The first DanceWriting textbook, ''Sutton Movement Shorthand, The Classical Ballet Key, Key One,'' was produced in December 1973. Within a year, it became outdated as Sutton improved her system. In the fall of 1974, by special invitation, she taught her system to the members of the RDB.

In 1974, articles about Sutton's DanceWriting system came to the attention of [[Lars van der Leith]], a sign language researcher, and others who worked with him at the [[Audiologopædisk Forskningsgruppe]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]], and they asked for a demonstration. As a result, van der Leith and his colleagues requested Sutton to develop a version of her movement notation adapted to the recording of sign languages. As a result, SignWriting was developed; it has been used for writing not only [[Danish Sign Language]], but the private sign language of a [[deaf]] South Pacific islander (in 1975), and [[American Sign Language]].

==Center for Sutton Movement Writing, Inc==
Sutton has continually worked to improve her notation systems and now leads the ''Center For Sutton Movement Writing, Inc.'' to spread her system.

'''''Vedic Mathematics''''' is a book written by the Indian [[sannyasi|monk]] [[Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha]] and first published in 1965. It contains a list of [[mental calculation]] techniques claimed to be based on the [[Veda]]s. The mental calculation system mentioned in the book is also known by the same name or as "Vedic Maths". Its characterization as "Vedic" mathematics has been criticized by academics, who have also opposed its inclusion in the Indian school curriculum.

==History==

Although the book was first published in 1965, Tirthaji had been propagating the techniques since much earlier, through lectures and classes.&lt;ref name="SGDani1993"&gt;[[S. G. Dani]] (December 2006). "[http://www.tifr.res.in/~vahia/dani-vmsm.pdf Myths and reality : On ‘Vedic mathematics’]". Originally published as a 2-part article in Frontline, 22 October and 5 November 1993. The updated version appears in Kandasamy and Smarandache (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the book in 1957.&lt;ref name="WBFlorentin2006"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = W.B. Vasantha Kandasamy | author2 = Florentin Smarandache | title=Vedic Mathematics: Vedic Or Mathematics: A Fuzzy and Neutrosophic Analysis | url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/math/papers/0611/0611347.pdf | accessdate=23 May 2013 | date=December 2006 | publisher=American Research Press | isbn=978-1-59973-004-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} It was published in 1965, five years after his death as 367 pages in forty chapters. Reprints were made in 1975 and 1978 with fewer typographical errors.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical sketch by Manjula Trivedi, 1965 in book Vedic Mathematics, pages x, xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Several reprints have been made since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WBFlorentin2006"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Contents ==
The book contains sixteen ''[[sutra]]s'' and fifteen sub-sutras, each of which lists a mental calculation technique. The sixteen ''sutras'' are as follows:&lt;ref name="WBFlorentin2006"/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="RKThakur2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=R. K.

==Criticism==
Tirthaji claimed that he found the sutras after years of studying the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred ancient Hindu scriptures. However, the Vedas do not contain any of the "Vedic mathematics" sutras.&lt;ref name="SGDani1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/art-culture/the-fraud-of-vedic-maths The Fraud of Vedic Maths]. Hartosh Singh Bal. Open Magazine. 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Tirthaji’s description of the mathematics as Vedic is most commonly criticised on the basis that, thus far, none of the sūtras can be found in any extant Vedic literature (Williams, 2000). When challenged by Professor K.S. Shukla to point out the sutras in question in the [[Parishishta]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], Shukla reported that the Tirthaji said the sixteen sutras were not included in standard editions of the Parishishta and that they occurred in his own Parishishta and not any other.&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Shukla, ''Vedic mathematics&amp;nbsp;— the illusive title of Swamiji’s book'', Mathematical Education, Vol 5: No. 3, January–March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Shukla, ''Mathematics&amp;nbsp;— The Deceptive Title of Swamiji’s Book'', in Issues in Vedic Mathematics, (ed: H.C.Khare), Rashtriya Veda Vidya Prakashan and Motilal Banarasidass Publ., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Vasudeva Saran Agrawala, the editor of the first edition of Tirthaji's book, notes that there is no evidence that the sutras are "Vedic", as such, in their origin.&lt;ref name="WBFlorentin2006"/&gt;{{rp|6}} Similarly, [[S. G. Dani]] of [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay|IIT Bombay]] points out that the contents of the book have "practically nothing in common" with the mathematics of the [[Vedic period]] or even with subsequent developments in [[Indian mathematics]]. For example, multiple techniques in the book involve the use of decimal fractions, which were not known during the Vedic times: even the works of later mathematicians such as [[Aryabhata]], [[Brahmagupta]] and [[Bhaskara I|Bhaskara]] do not contain any decimal fractions. He contends that Tirthaji liberally interpreted three-word Sanskrit phrases to associate them with arithmetic.&lt;ref name="SGDani1993"/&gt;

Tirthaji's claim that the sutras are relevant to advanced mathematical techniques such as successive differentiation or analytical conics have also been dismissed by Dani. He terms "ludicrous" Tirthaji's claim that "there is no part of mathematics, [[pure mathematics|pure]] or [[applied mathematics|applied]], which is beyond their jurisdiction". He also points out that while Tirthaji's methods were not unique, they may have been invented by him independently, as Tirthaji held an MA in mathematics. Similar systems include the [[Trachtenberg system]] or the techniques mentioned in Lester Meyers's 1947 book ''High-speed Mathematics''.&lt;ref name="SGDani1993"/&gt;  [[Alex Bellos]] points out that several of the calculation tricks can also be found in certain European treatises on calculation from the [[Early Modern period|early Modern]] period.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;{{cite book |author=Alex Bellos |title=Alex's Adventures in Numberland |year=2010 |publisher=Bloomsbury |chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in schools ==

The book was previously included in the school syllabus of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="WBFlorentin2006"/&gt;{{rp|6}} Some schools and organizations run by [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] groups, including those outside India, have also included Tirthaji's techniques in their curriculum. The Hindu nationalists have also made several attempts to have Tirthaji's "Vedic mathematics" system included in the Indian school curriculum via the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] books.

A number of academics and mathematicians have opposed these attempts on the basis that the techniques mentioned in the book are simply arithmetic tricks, and not mathematics. They also pointed out that the term "Vedic" mathematics is incorrect, and there are other texts that can be used to teach a correct account of the [[Indian mathematics]] during the Vedic period. They also criticized the move as a [[saffronization]] attempt to promote religious [[majoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacw.net/DC/CommunalismCollection/ArticlesArchive/NoVedic.html Neither Vedic nor Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2001/08/14/stories/0214000d.htm Legitimisation of Vedic mathematics, astrology opposed]. The Hindu, 14 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dani points out that while Tirthaji's system could be used as a teaching aid, there was a need to prevent the use of "public money and energy on its propagation, beyond the limited extent". He pointed out that the authentic Vedic studies had been neglected in India even as Tirthaji's system received support from several Government and private agencies.&lt;ref name="SGDani1993"/&gt;

Proponents of Vedic Mathematics however argue that the methods are not merely mathematical tricks and that there is an underlying psychology because the aphorisms describe personal approaches to problem-solving. As pedagogic tools, the methods are useful because they invite students to deal with strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glover|first1=James|title=Everything Vedic in ‘Vedic Maths’|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/everything-vedic-in-vedic-maths/article6508218.ece|accessdate=4 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=17 October 2014|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5621">The '''War of the Theatres''' is the name commonly applied to a controversy from the later [[Elizabethan theatre]]; Thomas Dekker termed it the ''Poetomachia''. 

Because of an actual ban on satire in prose and verse publications in 1599 (the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]]), the satirical urge had no other remaining outlet than the stage. The resulting controversy, which unfolded between [[1599 in literature|1599]] and [[1602 in literature|1602]], involved the playwright [[Ben Jonson]] on one side and his rivals [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] (with [[Thomas Middleton]] as an ancillary combatant) on the other. The role [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] played in the conflict, if any, has long been a topic of dispute among scholars.

==Sequence of events==
The least disputed facts of the matter yield a schema like this:

# In his play [[Histriomastix (play)|''Histriomastix'']] (1599), Marston satirized Jonson’s pride through the character Chrisoganus.
# Jonson responded by satirizing Marston's wordy style in ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'' (1599), a play acted by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]. (Note: the order of these first two events has been questioned by James Bednarz, who argues that "(a) ''Histriomastix'' was deliberately launched in the final weeks of 1599 to serve as a critique of Jonson's first "comicall satire" ''Every Man Out'', and that (b) Jonson's disparagement of ''Histriomastix'' in ''Every Man Out'' (III.iv.29) was subsequently added to the acting script of his already completed play, before the end of the same year, as a rejoinder to Marston's initial attack."&lt;ref&gt; Bednarz, James. "Marston's Subversion of Shakespeare and Jonson: Histriomastix and the War of the Theaters." ''Medieval &amp; Renaissance Drama in England.'' Vol. VI. New York: AMS Press, 1993. 103-28&lt;/ref&gt;
# Marston, in turn, replied with ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600), a play acted by the [[Children of Paul's]], satirizing Jonson as Brabant Senior, a cuckold.
# In ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600), acted by the [[Children of the Chapel]], Jonson satirizes both Marston and Dekker. The former is thought to be represented by the character Hedon, a "light voluptuous reveller," and the latter by Anaides, a "strange arrogating puff."
# Marston next attacked Jonson in ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601), a play most likely acted by the Children of Paul's.
# Jonson responded with ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601), by the Children of the Chapel again, in which Jonson portrays the character representing Marston as vomiting bombastic and ridiculous words he has ingested.
# Dekker completed the sequence with ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601), which mocks Jonson ("Horace") as an arrogant and overbearing hypocrite. The play was acted by both the Children of Paul's and the Lord Chamberlain's Men.

Apparently Jonson and Marston later came to terms and even collaborated with [[George Chapman]] on the play ''[[Eastward Hoe]]'' in 1605. That play offended [[James I of England|King James]] with its anti-Scottish satire, a part apparently written by Marston. While Marston evaded capture, Jonson and Chapman ended up in jail as a result.

==Context==
Shakespeare probably alludes to The War of the Theatres in a scene between Hamlet and [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]:

:''Rosencrantz'': Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
:''Hamlet'': Is't possible?
:''Guildenstern'': O, there has been much throwing about of brains. (''[[Hamlet]]'' 2.2.362-9)

Scholars differ over the true nature and extent of the rivalry behind the Poetomachia. Some have seen it as a competition between theatre companies rather than individual writers, though this is a minority view. It has even been suggested that the playwrights involved had no serious rivalry and even admired each other, and that the "War" was a self-promotional publicity stunt, a "planned ... quarrel to advertise each other as literary figures and for profit."&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Halstead, summarised in Logan and Smith, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics see the Poetomachia as a mixture of personal rivalries and serious artistic concerns&amp;mdash;"a vehicle for aggressively expressing differences...in literary theory...[a] basic philosophical debate on the status of literary and dramatic authorship."&lt;ref&gt;James Bednarz, quoted in Hirschfeld, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Women's Affairs Advisor to the Chief of Staff Practices Marksmanship.jpg|thumb|IDF Women's Affairs Advisor Brigadier General Gila Kalifi-Amir practices her marksmanship skills, 2010]]

The '''Women's Affairs advisor to the [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]]''' ({{lang-he|יועצת הרמטכ״ל לענייני נשים}}, abbreviated to יוהל״ן '''Yohalan''') is a female officer in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] that is in charge of promoting conditions that allow for the optimal use of the capabilities of [[Women in the Israel Defense Forces|women serving in the IDF]]; promoting equal opportunities for women during their military service; and assimilating women into military leadership positions.&lt;ref name=equalityReportNov11&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.idf.il/1086-14000-EN/Dover.aspx | title=More female officers in more positions in the IDF | publisher=[[IDF spokesperson]] | date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position is currently being held by Brigadier-General [[Rachel Tevet-Weisel]].

==History==
{{see_also|Women in the Israel Defense Forces}}
The Woman's Affairs advisor dates back to the Women's Corps that existed from 1949 to 2001. The corps was responsible for women soldiers, including: their absorption, recruit training, and transfers to IDF [[Military unit|units]]. During their service, the WC provided them with various services through WC units attached to units in other corps. It also operated a women's soldiers-teachers unit, which taught new immigrants and developing regions.

Since the 1990s, the corps' authority began to gradually transfer into the regional commands and individual commanders, while the female soldiers-teachers unit was moved to the [[Education and Youth Corps]]. In 2001, the [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]], [[Shaul Mofaz]], announced the dismantling of the corps. Its command was replaced with a new Women's Affairs advisor to the [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]] position. The corps' last commander was Brigadier General [[Suzy Yogev]].

On September 1, 2001, Suzy Yogev initiated the founding of the Women's Affairs advisor position, the dismantling of the Chief Women's Officer Command, and transferring the authority of caring for individual women soldiers’ problems to respective commanders, and placing the authority for the women soldiers training base to [[GOC Army Headquarters]].

[[File:Orphic-egg.png|thumb|[[Jacob Bryant]]'s [[Orphic Egg]] (1774)]]The '''world egg''', '''cosmic egg''' or '''mundane egg''' is a [[mythology|mythological]] [[Motif (literature)|motif]] found in the [[Cosmogony|cosmogonies]] of many [[culture]]s  that descend from the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|proto-Indo-European culture]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leeming |first1=David Adams |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia, Book 1 |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=144 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=world+egg+indo+european&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4YNySlb_dO&amp;sig=ATKsPAzPzGNEqD5Y9LuSM0ejFNo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEiqjNz7fcAhUOaFAKHf5QAGAQ6AEIbDAS#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20egg%20indo%20european&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and other cultures and [[civilization]]s .  Typically, the world egg is a beginning of some sort, and the [[universe]] or some primordial being comes into existence by "hatching" from the [[egg]], sometimes lain on the [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]] waters of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna‐Britta Hellborn, "The creation egg", ''Ethnos: Journal of Anthropology'', 1, 1963, pp. 63-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/11799.html |title=Brewer, E.

== Vedic mythology ==
[[Image:HinducosmoMap3.svg|thumb|Vivasvan, Rahu, Bhūmi, Naraka, Ananta, Garbhodaksayi Vishnu|150px]]

[[Image:Hinducosm Map1.svg|thumb|This is one of many material universes, Brahmandas, which expand from Mahavishnu when He breathes.|150px|alt=One Brahmanda]]

The earliest idea of "egg-shaped cosmos" comes from some of the [[Sanskrit]] scriptures. The Sanskrit term for it is [[Brahmanda]] (ब्रह्माण्ड) which is derived from two words - '[[Brahma]]' (ब्रह्मा) the creator god in Hinduism and 'anda' (अण्ड) meaning 'egg'. Certain [[Purana]]s such as the [[Brahmanda Purana]] speak of this in detail.

The [[Rig Veda]] (RV 10.121) uses a similar name for the source of the universe: [[Hiranyagarbha]] (हिरण्यगर्भ) which literally means "golden fetus" or "golden womb". The [[Upanishads]] elaborate that the [[Hiranyagarbha]] floated around in emptiness for a while, and then broke into two halves which formed [[Dyaus]] (Heaven) and [[Prithvi]] (Earth). The Rig Veda has a similar coded description of the division of the universe in its early stages.

== Greek mythology ==
The '''[[Orphic Egg]]''' in the ancient Greek [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] is the cosmic egg from which hatched the primordial [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] deity [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]]/Protogonus (variously equated also with [[Zeus]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Eros]], [[Erikepaios]] and [[Bromius]]) who in turn created the other gods.&lt;ref&gt;West, M. L. (1983) ''The Orphic Poems''. Oxford:Oxford University Press. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; The egg is often depicted with a serpent wound around it.

Many threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] was believed to have been hatched from the [[World-Egg]] of [[Chronos]] (Time) and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (Necessity) or [[Nyx]] (Night). His older wife [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the [[sceptre]] to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]] before it passed to [[Cronus]] and then to Zeus, who retained it.

== Egyptian mythology ==
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians abided by a multiplicity of truths when it came to creation myths. For instance, the [[Hermopolis (Lower Egypt)|Hermopolitan]], [[Heliopolitans|Heliopolitan]], and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] theologies, were equally validated. Under the Hermopolitan theology, there is the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], which represents the conditions before the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] were created (Van Dijk, 1995).
An aspect within the Ogdoad is the Cosmic Egg, from which all things are born. Life comes from the Cosmic Egg; the sun god [[Ra]] was born from the primordial egg in a stage known as the first occasion (Dunand, 2004).

== Phoenician mythology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
A philosophical creation story traced to "the cosmogony of ''[[Taautus]]'', whom [[Philo of Byblos]] explicitly identified with the Egyptian [[Thoth]]&amp;mdash;"the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records"&amp;mdash; which begins with [[Erebus]] and Wind, between which ''[[Eros (god)|Eros]]'' 'Desire' came to be. From this was produced ''Môt'' which seems to be the Phoenician/Ge'ez/Hebrew/Arabic/Ancient Egyptian word for 'Death' but which the account says may mean 'mud'. In a mixed confusion, the germs of life appear, and intelligent animals called ''Zophasemin'' (explained probably correctly as 'observers of heaven') formed together as an egg, perhaps. The account is not clear. Then Môt burst forth into light and the heavens were created and the various elements found their stations.

Following the etymological line of [[Jacob Bryant]] one might also consider with regard to the meaning of ''Môt'', that according to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians ''[[Ma'at]]'' was the personification of the fundamental order of the universe, without which all of creation would perish. She was also considered the wife of Thoth.

== Chinese mythology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
In the myth of [[Pangu]], developed by [[Taoist]] [[monk]]s hundreds of years after [[Lao Zi]], the universe began as an egg.  A primeval [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[giant]] named [[Pangu]], born inside the egg, broke it into two halves: the upper half became the sky, while the lower half became the earth.  As the god grew taller, the sky and the earth grew thicker and were separated further.  Finally Pangu died and his body parts became different parts of the earth.

== Norse mythology ==
In the book ''Futhark'' by [[Edred Thorsson]], the cosmic egg is compared to the rune [[Hagalaz]] which is symbolic of the fertile void from whence everything is spawned. It is symbolic of the chasm [[Ginnungagap]] or the void in that the [[Hermaphrodite| hermaphroditic]] [[giant]] [[Ymir]] and the cow [[Auðumbla]] dwelt as primeval beings. Hagalaz, as well as representing elemental disruption or chaos, is the potential for the birth of good or evil depending on what sorts of being or entity fertilizes the egg. In magic rituals, users of [[Seiðr|seidr or galdr]] will take an egg and "fertilize" it with their desired outcome, whether it be good or evil, and then crack the egg to release what is built up inside.

: ''Hail is cold grain
: ''and shower of sleet
: ''and sickness of serpents.

== Finnish mythology ==
In the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] [[national epic]], there is a myth of the world being created from the fragments of an egg laid by a [[diving duck]] on the knee of [[Ilmatar]], [[goddess]] of the air:

: ''One egg's lower half transformed''
: ''And became the earth below,''
: ''And its upper half transmuted''
: ''And became the sky above;''
: ''From the yolk the sun was made,''
: ''Light of day to shine upon us;''
: ''From the white the moon was formed,''
: ''Light of night to gleam above us;''
: ''All the colored brighter bits''
: ''Rose to be the stars of heaven''
: ''And the darker crumbs changed into''
: ''Clouds and cloudlets in the sky.''

In many original folk poems, the duck - or sometimes an eagle - laid its eggs on the knee of [[Väinämöinen]].&lt;ref&gt;Martti Haavio: Väinämöinen: Suomalaisten runojen keskushahmo. Porvoo: WSOY, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polynesian mythology ==
In [[Cook Islands mythology]], deep within [[Avaiki]] (the Underworld), a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell, there dwelt in the deepest depths, the primordial mother goddess, [[Varima-te-takere]]. Her domain was described as being so narrow, that her knees touched her chin. It was from this place that she created the first man, [[Avatea]], a god of light, a hybrid being half man and half fish. He was sent to the Upperworld to shine light in the land of men, and his eyes were believed to be the sun and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Wyatt Gill]]|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n27/mode/2up|date=1876|publisher=London: Henry S. King &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dogon mythology ==

"''In the beginning, Amma, alone, was in the shape of an egg: the four collar bones were fused, dividing the egg into air, earth, fire, and water, establishing also the four cardinal directions. Within this cosmic egg was the material and the structure of the universe, and the 266 signs that embraced the essence of all things. The first creation of the world by Amma was, however, a failure. The second creation began when Amma planted a seed within herself, a seed that resulted in the shape of man. But in the process of its gestation, there was a flaw, meaning that the universe would now have within it the possibilities for incompleteness. Now the egg became two placentas, each containing a set of twins, male and female. After sixty years, one of the males, Ogo, broke out of the placenta and attempted to create his own universe, in opposition to that being created by Amma. But he was unable to say the words that would bring such a universe into being. He then descended, as Amma transformed into the earth the fragment of placenta that went with Ogo into the void. Ogo interfered with the creative potential of the earth by having incestuous relations with it. His counterpart, Nommo, a participant in the revolt, was then killed by Amma, the parts of his body cast in all directions, bringing a sense of order to the world. When, five days later, Amma brought the pieces of Nommo's body together, restoring him to life, Nommo became ruler of the universe. He created four spirits, the ancestors of the [[Dogon people]]; Amma sent Nommo and the spirits to earth in an ark, and so the earth was restored. Along the way, Nommo uttered the words of Amma, and the sacred words that create were made available to humans. In the meantime, Ogo was transformed by Amma into Yuguru, the Pale Fox, who would always be alone, always be incomplete, eternally in revolt, ever wandering the earth seeking his female soul. ''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amma and the Egg that Contains the Universe |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095408829 |website=Oxford Reference |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representations ==
* In the [[temple]] of [[Daibod]], [[Japan]], it is represented as a nest egg floating in an expanse of water.
* On the island of [[Cyprus]], the egg is represented as a gigantic egg-shaped vase.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040116104126/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/serpent/00403.php Northvegr: The Northern Way&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern mythology ==
In 1955 poet and writer Robert Graves published the mythography ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', a compendium of Greek mythology normally published in two volumes. Within this work Graves' imaginatively reconstructed "Pelasgian creation myth" features a supreme [[creator deity|creatrix]], [[Eurynome]], "The Goddess of All Things",&lt;ref name="Graves1955"/&gt; who arose naked from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] to part sea from sky so that she could dance upon the waves. Catching the [[Anemoi#Boreas|north wind]] at her back and, rubbing it between her hands, she warms the ''[[pneuma]]'' and [[spontaneous generation|spontaneously generates]] the serpent [[Ophion]], who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves, she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches "all things that exist... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures".&lt;ref name="Graves1955"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graves |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Graves |year=1990 |origyear=1955 |title=The Greek Myths |volume=1 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-001026-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKSxQQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern cosmology ==
The concept was resurrected by modern [[science]] in the 1930s and explored by theoreticians during the following two decades.  The idea comes from a perceived need to reconcile [[Edwin Hubble]]'s observation of an [[expanding universe]] (which was also predicted from [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]]) with the notion that the [[universe]] must be [[eternally old]]. Current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological models]] maintain that 13.8 billion years ago, the entire mass of the universe was compressed into a [[gravitational singularity]], the so-called cosmic egg, from which it expanded to its current state (following the [[Big Bang]]).

[[Georges Lemaître]] proposed in 1927 that the [[cosmos]] originated from what he called the ''primeval atom''.

In the late 1940s, [[George Gamow]]'s assistant [[Cosmology|cosmological]] researcher [[Ralph Alpher]], proposed the name [[ylem]] for the primordial substance that existed between the [[big crunch]] of the previous universe and the [[big bang]] of our own universe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ylem'' is closely related to the concept of [[supersymmetry]].  &lt;ref&gt;Edward Harrison: Masks of the Universe: Changing Ideas on the Nature of the Cosmos, Cambridge University Press, 08.05.2003, p. 224 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=tSowGCP0kMIC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=ylem+supersymmetrie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p36VfOjibz&amp;sig=LVrnIUJVcagTU5MYYDVf7b7B5-U&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAr7yZtJfdAhVGPBoKHfyODR4Q6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ylem%20supersymmetrie&amp;f=false online]) &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xiong Huizhen''' ({{zh|t=熊會貞|w='''''Hsiung Hui-chen'''''}}; died 1936) was a Chinese [[historical geographer]] and a disciple of the late-[[Qing dynasty]] scholar [[Yang Shoujing]]. He is known for completing the ''Shui jing zhu shu'', a monumental annotation of the 6th-century geographic classic ''[[Shui jing zhu]]''.

==Biography==
Xiong Huizhen was born in [[Zhijiang, Hubei|Zhijiang County]], [[Hubei]] Province, and studied under the prominent historical geographer and bibliophile Yang Shoujing, who was also a native of Hubei. Yang spent most of his life annotating the 6th-century geographic work ''[[Shui jing zhu]]''. Having completed 40 volumes of annotation, he died in 1915 without completing the work. Xiong carried on the project and wrote another 40 volumes. He also made the final editing of the entire work, painstakingly proofreading the annotations word by word.&lt;ref name=yeh&gt;{{cite book |last=Yeh |first=Wen-Hsin |title=The Alienated Academy: Culture and Politics in Republican China, 1919–1937 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2M5b3tR4BoC&amp;pg=PA35 |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |isbn=978-0-674-00284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took Xiong 22 years to complete the work, known as the ''Shui jing zhu shu''.&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.com.cn/chinese/archive/235410.htm |title=杨守敬与《水经注疏》的命运 |author=Wang Ping |date=20 November 2002 |publisher=China.com.cn |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused offers made by Japanese scholars to purchase the book. However, when he learned that the descendants of Yang Shoujing had secretly sold some manuscripts, he committed suicide by hanging himself in 1936.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt;

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] soon broke out in 1937. The Chinese government paid great attention to the protection of the manuscript as well as Yang Shoujing's precious book collection. Scholar [[Fu Sinian]] negotiated on behalf of the [[Academia Sinica]] and the Ministry of Education to purchase the manuscript from Yang's heir Yang Mianzhi for 3,000 dollars, and brought it to Hong Kong for safekeeping. It was eventually published in Taiwan the early 1950s, and in mainland China in 1957.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt;

The influential historian [[Gu Jiegang]] commented that the ''Shui jing zhu shu'' "brought to a point of culmination the textual research of ''The Classic of Waterways'' of the previous three centuries." He greatly admired Yang Shoujing and Xiong Huizhen for their "single-minded devotion" to the task, and Xiong's devotion to his master.&lt;ref name=yeh/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8449">'''Ze'ev Safrai''' ({{lang-he|זאב ספראי}}; born 1948, [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]) is an Israeli [[Professor]] in the Department for [[Israel Studies]] in [[Bar Ilan University]], as well as an author, lecturer and researcher of [[Israel]] in the [[Second Temple]] era . His main project is his authorship of the socio-historical commentary to the [[Mishnah]] called [[Mishnat Eretz Yisrael]] (literally [[Mishnah]] of [[Israel]]), which he began together with his late father Professor [[Shmuel Safrai]] and his late sister Professor Chana Safrai.

Since the [[Mishnah]] is a code of law, its textual style is very concise and lacking in socio-historical background. While some scholarly attempts have been made to understand the meaning of the Mishnah and some attempts have been made to sketch the biographies of the authorities the Mishnah mentions (by referring to talmudic and midrashic sources, for example)  Mishnat Eretz Yisrael is the only complete commentary to the Mishnah that uses socio-historical evidence of the time to provide context for the Mishnah's laws.

Of the expected 45 volumes, 22 have been completed.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae on Bar Ilan University Website (Hebrew and English)|url=http://lisa.biu.ac.il/files/lisa/shared/safrai_s-cv_1_.pdf|publisher=Lisa.biu.ac.il|accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in Jerusalem in 1948, he studied in Yeshivat Netiv Meir, volunteered for the [[Bnei Akiva]] religious (Jewish) youth movement, served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and then became a founding member of [[Ma'ale Gilboa|Kibbutz Ma'ale Gilboa]]. He received his doctorate from the [[Hebrew University]] on the subject of "Historical Geography of the land of Samaria" under the guidance of Professor [[Menachem Stern]] and Professor Zakariah Klai.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

He married Dina from [[Kibbutz Yavneh]] in 1974 and settled there. She manages sales of the Mishnat Eretz Yisrael commentary.&lt;ref name="MishEretzSite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yavnet.org.il/ViewPage.asp?pagesCatID=364&amp;siteName=kvYavne |title=משנת ארץ ישראל ספראי - קבוצת יבנה- קהילנט |publisher=Yavnet.org.il |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positions===

He was on the secretariats of the Trustees of Torah and Avodah (a religious movement), the [[Mafdal]] and on the permits committee of the Israel Archaeology Council.

Currently he is a member of Israel Place Naming Committee, a member on the managerial committee of Ashkelon College, the Achvah Academic College, [[Givat Washington]] College and Yaakov Herzog Centre.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

===Research===
Safrai describes himself as a 'servant' of the Mishnaic and Talmudic period. He works on all perspectives of the period, especially those areas where a combination of source types and methodological approaches are required, for instance the combination of the Sages' source and archaeological finds, or the Sages' sources and a socio-historical approach.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;
