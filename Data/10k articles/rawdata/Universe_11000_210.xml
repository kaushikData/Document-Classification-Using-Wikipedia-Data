An '''atmosphere''' (from [[Modern Greek]] ἀτμός ''(atmos)'', meaning 'vapour', and σφαῖρα ''(sphaira)'', meaning 'sphere'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29tmo%2Fs ἀτμός] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924182433/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29tmo%2Fs |date=2015-09-24 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510152357/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra%5E |date=2017-05-10 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) is a layer or a set of layers of [[gas]]es surrounding a [[planet]] or other [[solid|material body]], that is held in place by the [[gravity]] of that body. An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity it is subject to is high and the temperature of the atmosphere is low.

The [[atmosphere of Earth]] is composed of [[nitrogen]] (about 78%), [[oxygen]] (about 21%), [[argon]] (about 0.9%)  , carbon dioxide (0.03%) and other gases in trace amounts. Oxygen is used by most [[organism]]s for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]; nitrogen is [[nitrogen fixation|fixed]] by bacteria and [[lightning]] to produce [[ammonia]] used in the construction of [[nucleotides]] and [[amino acids]]; and [[carbon dioxide]] is used by [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] for [[photosynthesis]].  The atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by [[sunlight|solar]] [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], [[solar wind]] and [[cosmic rays]]. The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical [[Modification Detection Code|modification]] of the [[paleoatmosphere]] by living organisms.

The term [[stellar atmosphere]] describes the outer region of a star and typically includes the portion above the [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[photosphere]]. Stars with sufficiently low temperatures may have outer atmospheres with compound [[molecule]]s.

==Pressure==
 {{main|Atmospheric pressure}}
Atmospheric pressure at a particular location is the [[force]] per unit area perpendicular to a surface determined by the [[weight]] of the vertical column of atmosphere above that location. On Earth, units of air pressure are based on the internationally recognized [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm), which is defined as 101.325 k[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (760&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]] or 14.696 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]). It is measured with a [[barometer]].

[[Atmospheric pressure]] decreases with increasing altitude due to the diminishing mass of gas above. The height at which the pressure from an atmosphere declines by a factor of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (an [[irrational number]] with a value of 2.71828...) is called the [[scale height]] and is denoted by ''H''. For an atmosphere with a uniform temperature, the scale height is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the product of the mean [[molecular mass]] of dry air and the local acceleration of gravity at that location. For such a model atmosphere, the pressure declines exponentially with increasing altitude. However, atmospheres are not uniform in temperature, so estimation of the atmospheric pressure at any particular altitude is more complex.

==Atmospheric escape==
{{main|Atmospheric escape}}
[[Surface gravity]] differs significantly among the planets. For example, the large gravitational force of the giant planet [[Jupiter]] retains light gases such as [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] that escape from objects with lower gravity. Secondly, the distance from the Sun determines the energy available to heat atmospheric gas to the point where some fraction of its molecules' [[thermal motion]] exceed the planet's [[escape velocity]], allowing those to escape a planet's gravitational grasp. Thus, distant and cold [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Pluto]] are able to retain their atmospheres despite their relatively low gravities.

Since a collection of gas molecules may be moving at a wide range of velocities, there will always be some fast enough to produce a slow leakage of gas into space. Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones with the same thermal [[kinetic energy]], and so gases of low [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] are lost more rapidly than those of high molecular weight. It is thought that [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] may have lost much of their water when, after being [[Photodissociation|photo dissociated]] into hydrogen and oxygen by solar [[ultraviolet]], the hydrogen escaped. [[Earth]]'s [[magnetic field]] helps to prevent this, as, normally, the solar wind would greatly enhance the escape of hydrogen. However, over the past 3 billion years Earth may have lost gases through the magnetic polar regions due to auroral activity, including a net 2% of its atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Seki, K. | author2=Elphic, R. C. | author3=Hirahara, M. | author4=Terasawa, T. | author5=Mukai, T. | title=On Atmospheric Loss of Oxygen Ions from Earth Through Magnetospheric Processes | journal=Science | year=2001 | volume=291 | issue=5510 | pages=1939–1941 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5510/1939 | accessdate=2007-03-07 | doi=10.1126/science.1058913 | pmid=11239148 | bibcode=2001Sci...291.1939S | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091045/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5510/1939 | archivedate=2007-10-01 | df= | citeseerx=10.1.1.471.2226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The net effect, taking the most important escape processes into account, is that an intrinsic magnetic field does not protect a planet from atmospheric escape and that for some magnetizations the presence of a magnetic field works to increase the escape rate.&lt;ref name="Gunell et al., 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunell |first=H. |last2=Maggiolo |first2=R. |last3=Nilsson |first3=H. |last4=Stenberg Wieser |first4=G. |last5=Slapak |first5=R. |last6=Lindkvist |first6=J. |last7=Hamrin |first7=M. |last8=De Keyser |first8=J. |year=2018 |title=Why an intrinsic magnetic field does not protect a planet against atmospheric escape |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=614 |pages=L3 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832934 |bibcode = 2018A&amp;A...614L...3G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mechanisms that can cause [[atmospheric escape|atmosphere depletion]] are [[solar wind]]-induced sputtering, [[impact event|impact]] erosion, [[weathering]], and sequestration—sometimes referred to as "freezing out"—into the [[regolith]] and [[polar ice cap|polar caps]].

== Terrain ==
Atmospheres have dramatic effects on the surfaces of rocky bodies. Objects that have no atmosphere, or that have only an exosphere, have terrain that is covered in [[impact crater|craters]]. Without an atmosphere, the planet  has no protection from [[meteoroid]]s, and all of them collide with the surface as [[meteorites]] and create craters.

Most meteoroids burn up as [[meteors]] before hitting a planet's surface. When [[meteoroids]] do impact, the effects are often erased by the action of wind.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} As a result, craters are rare on objects with atmospheres.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

[[Wind erosion]] is a significant factor in shaping the terrain of rocky planets with atmospheres, and over time can erase the effects of both craters and [[volcanoes]]. In addition, since [[liquid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can not exist without pressure, an atmosphere allows liquid to be present at the surface, resulting in [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[ocean]]s. [[Earth]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are known to have liquids at their surface and terrain on the planet suggests that [[Mars]] had liquid on its surface in the past.

==Composition==
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Earth's atmospheric [[gas]]es scatter blue light more than other wavelengths, giving [[Earth]] a blue halo when seen from [[space]]]]

A planet's initial atmospheric composition is related to the chemistry and temperature of the local [[solar nebula]] during planetary formation and the subsequent escape of interior gases. The original atmospheres started with a rotating disc of gases that collapsed to form a series of spaced rings that condensed to form the planets. The planet's atmospheres were then modified over time by various complex factors, resulting in quite different outcomes.

The atmospheres of the planets [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] are primarily composed of [[carbon dioxide]], with small quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[oxygen]] and traces of other gases.

The composition of Earth's atmosphere is largely governed by the by-products of the life that it sustains. Dry air from [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and traces of hydrogen, helium, and other "noble" gases (by volume), but generally a variable amount of water vapor is also present, on average about 1% at sea level.

The low temperatures and higher gravity of the Solar System's [[giant planet]]s—[[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]—allow them more readily to retain gases with low [[molecular mass]]es. These planets have hydrogen–helium atmospheres, with trace amounts of more complex compounds.

Two satellites of the outer planets possess significant atmospheres. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], a moon of Saturn, and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a moon of Neptune, have atmospheres mainly of [[nitrogen]].  When in the part of its orbit closest to the Sun, [[Pluto]] has an atmosphere of nitrogen and methane similar to Triton's, but these gases are frozen when it is farther from the Sun.

Other bodies within the [[Solar System]] have extremely thin atmospheres not in equilibrium. These include the [[Moon]] ([[sodium]] gas), [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (sodium gas), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (oxygen), [[Io (moon)|Io]] ([[sulfur]]), and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] ([[water vapor]]).

The first exoplanet whose atmospheric composition was determined is [[HD 209458]]b, a gas giant with a close orbit around a star in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus]]. Its atmosphere is heated to temperatures over 1,000&amp;nbsp;K, and is steadily escaping into space. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulfur have been detected in the planet's inflated atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1=Weaver, D. | author2=Villard, R. | title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere | publisher=Hubble News Center | date=2007-01-31 | url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/ | accessdate=2007-03-11 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314043755/http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/ | archivedate=2007-03-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Earth===
{{main|Atmosphere of Earth}}
[[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] consists of a number of layers that differ in properties such as composition, temperature and pressure. The lowest layer is the [[troposphere]], which extends from the surface to the bottom of the [[stratosphere]]. Three quarters of the atmosphere's mass resides within the troposphere, and is the layer within which the Earth's terrestrial weather develops. The depth of this layer varies between 17&amp;nbsp;km at the equator to 7&amp;nbsp;km at the poles. The stratosphere, extending from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the [[mesosphere]], contains the [[ozone layer]]. The ozone layer ranges in altitude between 15 and 35&amp;nbsp;km, and is where most of the [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the Sun is absorbed. The top of the mesosphere, ranges from 35 to 85&amp;nbsp;km, and is the layer wherein most [[meteors]] burn up. The  [[thermosphere]] extends from 85&amp;nbsp;km to the base of the [[exosphere]] at 690&amp;nbsp;km and contains the [[ionosphere]], a region where the atmosphere is ionised by incoming solar radiation. The ionosphere increases in thickness and moves closer to the Earth during daylight and rises at night allowing certain frequencies of radio communication a greater range. The [[Kármán line]], located within the thermosphere at an altitude of 100&amp;nbsp;km, is commonly used to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and [[outer space]]. The [[exosphere]] begins variously from about 690 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km above the surface, where it interacts with the planet's [[magnetosphere]]. Each of the layers has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height.

===Others===
Other astronomical bodies such as these listed have known atmospheres.

==Circulation==
{{main|Atmospheric circulation}}
The circulation of the atmosphere occurs due to thermal differences when [[convection]] becomes a more efficient transporter of heat than [[thermal radiation]]. On planets where the primary heat source is solar radiation, excess heat in the tropics is transported to higher latitudes. When a planet generates a significant amount of heat internally, such as is the case for [[Jupiter]], convection in the atmosphere can transport thermal energy from the higher temperature interior up to the surface.

==Importance==
From the perspective of a planetary [[geologist]], the atmosphere acts to shape a planetary surface. [[Wind]] picks up [[dust]] and other particles which, when they collide with the terrain, erode the [[Terrain|relief]] and leave [[Deposition (sediment)|deposits]] ([[Aeolian processes|eolian]] processes). [[Frost line|Frost]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitations]], which depend on the atmospheric composition, also influence the relief. Climate changes can influence a planet's geological history. Conversely, studying the surface of the Earth leads to an understanding of the atmosphere and climate of other planets.

For a [[meteorologist]], the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is a factor affecting the [[climate]] and its variations.

For a [[biologist]] or [[paleontologist]], the Earth's atmospheric composition is closely dependent on the appearance of the life and its [[evolution]].

'''Blade element momentum theory''' is a theory that combines both [[blade element theory]] and [[momentum theory]]. It is used to calculate the local forces on a propeller or wind-turbine blade. Blade element theory is combined with momentum theory to alleviate some of the difficulties in calculating the induced velocities at the rotor.

This article emphasizes application of BEM to ground-based wind turbines, but the principles apply as well to propellers. Whereas the streamtube area is reduced by a propeller, it is expanded by a wind turbine. For either application, a highly simplified but useful approximation is the Rankine–Froude "momentum" or "actuator disk" model (1865,1889). This article explains the application of the "Betz limit" to the efficiency of a ground-based wind turbine.

A development came in the form of Froude's blade element momentum theory (1878), later refined by Glauert (1926). Betz (1921) provided an approximate correction to momentum "Rankine–Froude actuator-disk" theory to account for the sudden rotation imparted to the flow by the actuator disk (NACA TN 83, "The Theory of the Screw Propeller" and NACA TM 491, "Propeller Problems"). In blade element momentum theory, angular momentum is included in the model, meaning that the wake (the air after interaction with the rotor) has angular momentum. That is, the air begins to rotate about the z-axis immediately upon interaction with the rotor (see diagram below). Angular momentum must be taken into account since the rotor, which is the device that extracts the energy from the wind, is rotating as a result of the interaction with the wind.

==Rankine–Froude model==

The "Betz limit," not yet taking advantage of Betz' contribution to account for rotational flow with emphasis on propellers, applies the Rankine–Froude "actuator disk" theory to obtain the maximum efficiency of a stationary wind turbine. The following analysis is restricted to axial motion of the air:

[[File:Betz Model Figure One.png|center|500px]]

In our [[streamtube]] we have fluid flowing from left to right, and an actuator disk that represents the rotor. We will assume that the rotor is infinitesimally thin.&lt;ref name = "name2"&gt;Wind Energy Handbook: Burton, Jenkins&lt;/ref&gt; From above, we can see that at the start of the streamtube, fluid flow is normal to the actuator disk. The fluid interacts with the rotor, thus transferring energy from the fluid to the rotor. The fluid then continues to flow downstream. Thus we can break our system/streamtube into two sections: pre-acuator disk, and post-actuator disk. Before interaction with the rotor, the total energy in the fluid is constant. Furthermore, after interacting with the rotor, the total energy in the fluid is constant.

[[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's equation]] describes the different forms of energy that are present in fluid flow where the net energy is constant i.e. when a fluid is not transferring any energy to some other entity such as a rotor. The energy consists of static pressure, gravitational potential energy, and kinetic energy. Mathematically, we have the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + P + \rho g h = \mathrm{const.}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the static pressure energy, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration due to gravity, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the height above the ground. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume that gravitational potential energy is unchanging during fluid flow from left to right such that we have the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + P = \mathrm{const.}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if we have two points on a streamline, point 1 and point 2, and at point 1 the velocity of the fluid along the streamline is &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and the pressure at 1 is &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, and at point 2 the velocity of the fluid along the streamline is &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; and the pressure at 2 is &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, and no energy has been extracted from the fluid between points 1 and 2, then we have the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + P_1 = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + P_2
&lt;/math&gt;

Now let us return to our initial diagram. Consider pre-actuator flow. Far upstream, the fluid velocity is &lt;math&gt;v_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;; the fluid then expands as it approaches the rotor.&lt;ref name = "name"&gt;http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/16241/InTech-Aerodynamics_of_wind_turbines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with mass conservation, the mass flow rate must be constant. The mass flow rate, &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt;, through a surface of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{m} = \rho Av
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline. Thus, if mass flow rate is constant, increases in area must result in decreases in fluid velocity along a streamline. This means the kinetic energy of the fluid is decreasing. If the flow is expanding but not transferring energy, then Bernoulli applies. Thus the reduction in kinetic energy is countered by an increase in static pressure energy. Why a streamtube expands as it approaches an object is not explained in this document.

So we have the following situation pre-rotor: far upstream, fluid pressure is the same as atmospheric, &lt;math&gt;P_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;; just before interaction with the rotor, fluid pressure has increased and so kinetic energy has decreased. This can be described mathematically using Bernoulli's equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{\infty}^2 + P_{\infty} = \frac{1}{2}\rho \left(v_{\infty}(1 - a)\right)^2 + P_{D+}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have written the fluid velocity at the rotor as &lt;math&gt;v_{\infty}(1 - a)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the axial induction factor. The pressure of the fluid on the upstream side of the actuator disk is &lt;math&gt;P_{D+}&lt;/math&gt;. We are treating the rotor as an actuator disk that is infinitely thin. Thus we will assume no change in fluid velocity across the actuator disk. Since energy has been extracted from the fluid, the pressure must have decreased.

Now let us consider post-rotor: immediately after interacting with the rotor, the fluid velocity is still &lt;math&gt;v_{\infty}(1 - a)&lt;/math&gt;, but the pressure has dropped to a value &lt;math&gt;P_{D-}&lt;/math&gt;; far downstream, pressure of the fluid has reached equilibrium with the atmosphere; this has been accomplished in the natural and dynamically slow process of decreasing the velocity of flow in the stream tube in order to maintain dynamic equilibrium ( i.e. &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow P_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; far downstream. Assuming no further energy transfer, we can apply Bernoulli for downstream:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho \left(v_{\infty}(1 - a)\right)^2 + P_{D-} = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_w^2 + P_{\infty}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;
v_w  = &lt;/math&gt; The velocity far downstream in the Wake

Thus we can obtain an expression for the pressure difference between fore and aft of the rotor:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{D+} - P_{D-} = \frac{1}{2}\rho(v_{\infty}^2 - v_w^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

If we have a pressure difference across the area of the actuator disc, there is a force acting on the actuator disk, which can be determined from &lt;math&gt;F = \Delta PA&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho(v_{\infty}^2 - v_w^2)A_D
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_D&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the actuator disk. If the rotor is the only thing absorbing energy from the fluid, the rate of change in axial momentum of the fluid is the force that is acting on the rotor. The rate of change of axial momentum can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final axial velocities of the fluid, multiplied by the mass flow rate:

:&lt;math&gt;
F = \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{m}(v_{\infty} - v_{w}) = \rho A_Dv_D(v_{\infty} - v_{w}) = \rho A_D(1 - a)v_{\infty}(v_{\infty} - v_{w})
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can arrive at an expression for the fluid velocity far downstream:

:&lt;math&gt;
v_w = (1 - 2a)v_{\infty}
&lt;/math&gt;

This force is acting at the rotor. The power taken from the fluid is the force acting on the fluid multiplied by the velocity of the fluid at the point of power extraction:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Power}_{ext} = Fv_D = 2a(1 - a)^2v_{\infty}^3\rho A_D
&lt;/math&gt;

===Maximum Power===

Suppose we are interested in finding the maximum power that can be extracted from the fluid. The power in the fluid is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Power} = \frac{1}{2}\rho A v^3
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density as before, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid velocity, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of an imaginary surface through which the fluid is flowing. The power extracted from the fluid by a rotor in the scenario described above is some fraction of this power expression. We will call the fraction the power co-efficient, &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the power extracted, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Power}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Power}_{ext} = \mathrm{Power}\times C_p
&lt;/math&gt;

Our question is this: what is the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; using the Betz model?

Let us return to our derived expression for the power transferred from the fluid to the rotor (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Power}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;). We can see that the power extracted is dependent on the axial induction factor. If we differentiate &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Power}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{Power}_{ext}}{\mathrm{d}a} = 2v_{\infty}^3\rho A_D \times \left((1 - a)^2 - 2a(1- a)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

If we have maximised our power extraction, we can set the above to zero. This allows us to determine the value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; which yields maximum power extraction. This value is a &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we are able to find that &lt;math&gt;C_{P~max} = 16/27&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the rotor cannot extract more than 59 per cent of the power in the fluid.

==Blade element momentum theory==

Compared to the Rankine–Froude model, Blade element momentum theory accounts for the angular momentum of the rotor. Consider the left hand side of the figure below. We have a streamtube, in which there is the fluid and the rotor. We will assume that there is no interaction between the contents of the streamtube and everything outside of it. That is, we are dealing with an isolated system. In physics, isolated systems must obey conservation laws. An example of such is the conservation of angular momentum. Thus, the angular momentum within the streamtube must be conserved. Consequently, if the rotor acquires angular momentum through its interaction with the fluid, something else must acquire equal and opposite angular momentum. As already mentioned, the system consists of just the fluid and the rotor, the fluid must acquire angular momentum in the wake. As we related the change in axial momentum with some induction factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, we will relate the change in angular momentum of the fluid with the tangential induction factor, &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us consider the following setup.&lt;ref name="name2" /&gt;

[[File:Blade Element Momentum Setup.jpg|750px|center]]

We will break the rotor area up into annular rings of infinitesimally small thickness. We are doing this so that we can assume that axial induction factors and tangential induction factors are constant throughout the annular ring. An assumption of this approach is that annular rings are independent of one another i.e. there is no interaction between the fluids of neighboring annular rings.

===Bernoulli for rotating wake===

Let us now go back to Bernoulli:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + P_1 = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + P_2
&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline. The streamline may not necessarily run parallel to a particular co-ordinate axis, such as the z-axis. Thus the velocity may consist of components in the axes that make up the co-ordinate system. For this analysis, we will use cylindrical polar co-ordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,~\theta,~z)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;v^2 = v_r^2 + v_{\theta}^2 + v_z^2&lt;/math&gt;.

NOTE: We will in fact, be working in cylindrical co-ordinates for all aspects e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = F_r\hat{\mathbf{r}} + F_{\theta}\hat{\theta} + F_z\hat{\mathbf{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider the setup shown above. As before, we can break the setup into two components: upstream and downstream.

====Pre-rotor====

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{\infty} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_u^2 = P_{D+} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_D^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_u&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline far upstream, and &lt;math&gt;v_{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the fluid just prior to the rotor. Written in cylindrical polar co-ordinates, we have the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{\infty} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{\infty}^2 = P_{D+} + \frac{1}{2}\rho (v_{\infty}(1 - a))^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{\infty}(1 - a)&lt;/math&gt; are the z-components of the velocity far upstream and just prior to the rotor respectively. This is exactly the same as the upstream equation from the Betz model.

It should be noted that, as can be seen from the figure above, the flow expands as it approaches the rotor, a consequence of the increase in static pressure and the conservation of mass. This would imply that &lt;math&gt;v_r \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; upstream. However, for the purpose of this analysis, that effect will be neglected.

====Post-rotor====

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{D-} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_D^2 = P_{\infty} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_w^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_D&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the fluid just after interacting with the rotor. This can be written as &lt;math&gt;v_D^2 = v_{D,~r}^2 + v_{D,~\theta}^2 + v_{D,~z}^2&lt;/math&gt;. The radial component of the velocity will be zero; this must be true if we are to use the annular ring approach; to assume otherwise would suggest interference between annular rings at some point downstream. Since we assume that there is no change in axial velocity across the disc, &lt;math&gt;v_{D,~z} = (1 - a)v_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;. Angular momentum must be conserved in an isolated system. Thus the rotation of the wake must not die away. Thus &lt;math&gt;v_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; in the downstream section is constant. Thus Bernoulli simplifies in the downstream section:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_{D-} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{D,~z}^2 = P_{\infty} + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{w,~z}^2 =  P_{D-} + \frac{1}{2}\rho (v_{\infty}(1 - a))^2
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the Bernoulli equations up and downstream of the rotor are the same as the Bernoulli expressions in the Betz model. Therefore, we can use results such as power extraction and wake speed that were derived in the Betz model i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
v_{w, z} = (1 - 2a)v_{\infty}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Power} = 2a(1 - a)^2v_{\infty}^3\rho A_D
&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to calculate maximum power extraction for a system that includes a rotating wake. This can be shown to give the same value as that of the Betz model i.e. 0.59. This method involves recognising that the torque generated in the rotor is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta\mathbf{Q} = 2\pi r\delta r \times \rho U_{\infty}(1 - a) \times 2a'r\omega
&lt;/math&gt;

with the necessary terms defined immediately below.

===Blade forces===

Consider fluid flow around an airfoil. The flow of the fluid around the airfoil gives rise to lift and drag forces. By definition, lift is the force that acts on the airfoil normal to the apparent fluid flow speed seen by the airfoil. Drag is the forces that acts tangential to the apparent fluid flow speed seen by the airfoil. What do we mean by an apparent speed? Consider the diagram below:

[[File:Apparent speed seen by rotor blade.jpg|center]]

The speed seen by the rotor blade is dependent on three things: the axial velocity of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;v_{\infty}(1 - a)&lt;/math&gt;; the tangential velocity of the fluid due to the acceleration round an airfoil, &lt;math&gt;a'\omega r&lt;/math&gt;; and the rotor motion itself, &lt;math&gt;\omega r&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the apparent fluid velocity is given as below:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = \omega r(1 + a') \hat{\mathbf{\theta}} + v_{\infty}(1 - a)\hat{\mathbf{z}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the apparent wind speed is just the magnitude of this vector i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;
|\mathbf{v}|^2 = (\omega r (1 + a'))^2 + (v_{\infty}(1 - a))^2 = W^2
&lt;/math&gt;

We can also work out the angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; from the above figure:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sin\phi = \frac{v_{\infty}(1 - a)}{W}
&lt;/math&gt;

Supposing we know the angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we can then work out &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; simply by using the relation &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \phi - \beta&lt;/math&gt;; we can then work out the lift co-efficient, &lt;math&gt;c_L&lt;/math&gt;, and the drag co-efficient &lt;math&gt;c_D&lt;/math&gt;, from which we can work out the lift and drag forces acting on the blade.

Consider the annular ring, which is partially occupied by blade elements. The length of each blade section occupying the annular ring is &lt;math&gt;\delta r&lt;/math&gt; (see figure below).

[[File:Annular ring1.jpg|center]]

The lift acting on those parts of the blades/airfoils each with [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta L = \frac{1}{2}\rho NW^2 c \times c_L(\alpha)\delta r
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_L&lt;/math&gt; is the lift co-efficient, which is a function of the angle of attack, and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of blades. Additionally, the drag acting on that part of the blades/airfoils with chord &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following expression:

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta D = \frac{1}{2}\rho NW^2 c \times c_D(\alpha)\delta r
&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that these forces calculated are normal and tangential to the apparent speed. We are interested in forces in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; axes. Thus we need to consider the diagram below:

[[File:Lift and drag for a HAWT.jpg|center]]

Thus we can see the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta F_{\theta} = \delta L\sin\phi - \delta D\cos\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta F_z = \delta L\cos\phi + \delta D\sin\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the force that is responsible for the rotation of the rotor blades; &lt;math&gt;F_z&lt;/math&gt; is the force that is responsible for the bending of the blades.

Recall that for an isolated system the net angular momentum of the system is conserved. If the rotor acquired angular momentum, so must the fluid in the wake. Let us suppose that the fluid in the wake acquires a tangential velocity &lt;math&gt;v_{\theta} = 2a'\omega r&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the torque in the air is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
|\mathbf{\delta{Q}}| = \rho(2\pi r\delta r)U_{\infty}(1 - a)\times(2\Omega a'r^2)
&lt;/math&gt;
By the conservation of angular momentum, this balances the torque in the blades of the rotor; thus,
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho W^2Nc(c_l\sin\phi - c_d\cos\phi)r\delta r = \rho(2\pi r\delta r)U_{\infty}(1 - a)\times(2\Omega a'r^2)
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2} W^2Nc(c_l\sin\phi - c_d\cos\phi) = 4\pi U_{\infty}(1 - a)\times\Omega a'r^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Furthermore, the rate of change of linear momentum in the air is balanced by the out-of-plane bending force acting on the blades, &lt;math&gt;\delta F_z&lt;/math&gt;. From momentum theory, the rate of change of linear momentum in the air is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta F_z = \rho(2\pi r\delta r)U_{\infty}(1 - a)\times(v_\infty - v_w)
&lt;/math&gt;
which may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta F_z = \rho(4\pi r\delta r)U^2_{\infty}a(1 - a)
&lt;/math&gt;
Balancing this with the out-of-plane bending force gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2} W^2Nc(c_l\cos\phi + c_d\sin\phi) = \rho(4\pi r\delta r)U^2_{\infty}a(1 - a)
&lt;/math&gt;

Let us now make the following definitions:
:&lt;math&gt;
C_y = c_l\sin\phi - c_d\cos\phi
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
C_x = c_l\cos\phi + c_d\sin\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

So we have the following equations:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2} W^2NcC_y = 4\pi U_{\infty}(1 - a)\times\Omega a'r^2
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2}\rho W^2NcC_x =  4\pi\rho\left[(a'\Omega r)^2 +  U^2_{\infty}a(1 - a)\right]r
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Let us make reference to the following equation which can be seen from analysis of the above figure:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\sin\phi = \frac{U_{\infty}}{W}(1 - a) \rightarrow \sin^2\phi = \left(\frac{U_{\infty}}{W}(1-a)\right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Thus, with these three equations, it is possible to get the following result through some algebraic manipulation:&lt;ref name="name2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="name" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{a}{1 - a} = \frac{C_x\sigma_r}{4\sin^2\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can derive an expression for &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt; in a similar manner. This allows us to understand what is going on with the rotor and the fluid. Equations of this sort are then solved by iterative techniques.

The '''Bushveld''' is a [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|sub-tropical woodland]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Southern Africa]] named after the term ''[[veld]]''. It encompasses most of [[Limpopo Province]] and a small part of the [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]] of [[South Africa]], the Central and North-East Districts of [[Botswana]] and the Matabeleland South and part of the Matabeleland North provinces of [[Zimbabwe]]. [[Kruger National Park]] in South Africa has a number of 'Bushveld' camps.&lt;ref name="KNP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kruger National Park Camping |url=http://krugerparkbookings.com/category/kruger-national-park-camping/ |publisher=Kruger National Park Camping |accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The elevation of this region varies from 750 to 1,400 m and the annual rainfall from 350&amp;nbsp;mm in the west to 600&amp;nbsp;mm in parts of the northeast. There are four significant mountain ranges in this region:the [[Magaliesberg]] which runs from [[Rustenburg]] in the west to [[Bronkhorstspruit]] in the east and forms the southern border of the Bushveld; the [[Drakensberg]] [[escarpment]] that forms the eastern border of the Bushveld and runs from [[Tzaneen]] in the north to [[Belfast, South Africa|Belfast]] in the south; the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] range that is in the middle of the Bushveld and the [[Soutpansberg]] range just north of [[Louis Trichardt]]. The latter is the northernmost mountain range in South Africa.

==Flora and fauna==
As implied by the region's name, the Bushveld's well-grassed plains are dotted by dense clusters of trees and tall shrubs. The grasses found here are generally tall and turn brown or pale in [[winter]], which is the dry season throughout most of Southern Africa. The undisturbed portions of this habitat, such as much of the [[Waterberg Biosphere]], are home to many large [[mammal]] [[species]] including [[white rhino]], [[black rhino]], [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[kudu]], [[impala]] and a variety of further [[antelope]] species and other game.

==Geology==
{{main|Bushveld Igneous Complex}}
The Bushveld is one of the most [[mineral]]-rich regions of the world. This is due to the [[Bushveld igneous complex]], an extremely rich saucer-shaped geological formation that stretches over more than 50,000 square kilometers. This formation contains most of the world's reserves of minerals such as [[andalusite]], [[chromium]], [[fluorspar]], [[platinum]] and [[vanadium]]. The complex includes the [[Merensky Reef]], which is the world's biggest source of [[platinum]] as well as platinum-group metals.

==Farming==
As most of the region tends to be dry, the Bushveld is mostly [[beef cattle]] and [[game farm|game farming]] country, with only a few drought-resistant crops such as [[sorghum]] and [[millet]] being farmed, usually under [[irrigation]].

==Middleveld==
The term ''Middleveld'' is sometimes used to describe land lying between an altitude of 600m and 1200m&lt;ref name=""britannicaVeld"&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/veld#ref417811&lt;/ref&gt; and has been synonymous with the term ''Bushveld''.&lt;ref name="Agriculture1955"&gt;{{cite book|author=South Africa. Department of Agriculture|title=Bulletin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH7xThin5Y0C|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Larix3T.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Cable grue ''Larix 3T, installed on agricultural tractor]]

'''Cable logging,''' also referred to as [[skyline logging]], is a [[logging]] method primarily used on the West Coast of North America with [[yarder]], [[Loader (equipment)|loaders]], and [[grapple yarders]], but also in Europe (Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, France, Italy).

The cables can be rigged in several configurations.

There are two classes;
# [[High lead logging]], in which a simple loop of cable runs from the [[yarder]] out through pulley blocks anchored to stumps at the far end of the cut.
# [[Skyline logging|Skyline]], in which a carriage, pulled by hauling cables, runs along a skyline cable, providing vertical lift to the logs.

There are other varieties of loading systems as well. 

While skyline logging requires additional setup , the vertical lift of the skyline allows faster yarding, which can outweigh the additional labor costs, especially on larger harvest units.  

Since the 1980s  Grapple [[Yarders]] have become popular.

Skyline and grapple yarding, however, require more complex, and expensive equipment.   A traditional highlead or gravity system will function with just two cables, a skidding line.   As the names imply the skidding line is used to drag the logs in, and the haulback line is used to drag the skidding line back out for the next turn (or group of logs).

A skyline system will add a third line---the skyline whose function is to hold the skidding line and the haulback line off the ground or 'in the sky'.

The yarder itself is located on a landing, a flat area on top of the ridge that is being logged. After the trees are retrieved by the yarder, the limbs are bucked (removed) and the logs are then placed in piles awaiting transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5648">'''Carbon fiber testing''' is a material science test involving the testing of all [[carbon fiber]] containing materials. The results for the testing are used to select and design material composites, manufacturing processes and to ensured safety and integrity. Particularly safety-critical carbon fiber parts, such as structural parts in machines, vehicles, aircraft or architectural elements are subject to testing.

==Concepts==
Testing sciences classify three main disciplines for material testing that especially apply to carbon fiber materials. Most common are [[:wikt:destruction|destructive]] tests, such as stress, fatigue and micro sectioning tests. There are also methods that allow [[non-destructive testing]] (NDT), so the material can be still be used after testing. Common methods are [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], [[X-ray]], HF Eddy Current, Radio Wave testing or [[thermography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hodgkinson, J.M. |title=Mechanical Testing of Advanced Fibre Composites|journal=Woodhead Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-85573-312-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Structural Health Monitoring]] (SHM) methods allow the testing during application.

==Testing methods==
Carbon ([[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]] and reinforced polymers) are gaining importance as light-weight material. Particularly safety-critical carbon fiber parts, such as aircraft frames, need to be tested destructively (e.g. stress, fatigue) and non-destructively (e.g. fiber orientation, delamination, bonding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Erb, T.|title=Methodik zur Bewertung von Fehlern in Strukturbauteilen aus Faser-Kunststoffverbunden im Automobilbau|journal=University of Darmstadt|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, destructive tests are carried out to validate the mechanical properties, whereas [[Nondestructive testing|NDT]] are used to monitor and control the manufacturing process of the CFRP parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hufenbach, W.|year=2007|title=Textile Composite Construction and Manufacturing Technologies for Leight Weight Construction in Mechanical and Automotive Engineering|volume=SDV - Die Median AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; As carbon fiber composites are highly individual in shape and material composition novel NDT are emerging and sought for application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Unnthorsonn, R., Jonsson, M. P., Runarsson, T. P.|year=2004|title=NDT Methods for Evaluating Carbon Fibre Composites|journal=Comptest|volume=Bristol: University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicable technologies are radio wave testing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Heuer, H., Schulze, M.|year=2011|title=Eddy Current Testing of Carbon Fiber Materials by High Resolution|journal=International Workshop on SMART MATERIALS, STRUCTURES &amp; NDT in AEROSPACE, Conference NDT, Canada 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high frequency [[eddy current testing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authors=JEC Composites, Innovation Award NON DESTRUCTIVE TESTING|year=2013|title=Non-destructive test carbon fiber products (dry fabrics and composites) without coupling media|url=http://www.ndt.org/news.asp?ObjectID=50203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thermography]], shearography,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oster, R. |year=2012|title=Non-destructive testing methodologies on helicopter fiber composite components challenges today and in the future|journal=18th World Conference on Nondestructive Testing|volume=Conference Proceedings|pages=16–20|location=Durban, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; air coupled laser ultrasonics, terahertz scanning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Lopato, P., Chady, T., Sikora, R.|year=2011|title=Testing of composite materials using advanced NDT methods|journal=COMPEL: the International Jour-nal for Computation and Mathematics in Electrical and Electronic Engineering|volume=30|issue=4|pages=1260–1270|doi=10.1108/03321641111133172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical effects and defects==
The specifications for integrity of structurally relevant parts depend on the individual manufacturer. However, typically relevant quality criteria of the texture are fiber orientation, gaps, wrinkles, overlaps, distortion, undulation, uniformity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Heuer, H., Schulze, M.|year=2011|title=Eddy Current Testing of Carbon Fiber Materials by High Resolution|journal=International Workshop on SMART MATERIALS, STRUCTURES &amp; NDT in AEROSPACE, Conference NDT, Canada 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as defects in the matrix delamination, inclusion, cracks, curing, void, debonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Leckey, C. A. C., Parker, F. R.|year=2014|title=NDE and SHM Simulation for CFRP Composites|journal=American Society for Composites Technical Conference; 29th; 8-10 Sept. 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, basis weight or carbon fiber volume content are important properties.   
Generally, defects and effects in carbon fiber materials are classified according to their location as structural defects (carbon fiber related) and matrix defects (resin related). Carbon fiber related effects are tested with X-ray and high frequency testing methods whereas matrix effects are commonly tested with ultrasonic and thermographic methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5712">A '''corrosion inhibitor''' is a [[chemical compound]] that, when added to a liquid or gas, decreases the [[corrosion]] rate of a material, typically a [[metal]] or an [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Gräfen, Elmar-Manfred Horn, Hartmut Schlecker, Helmut Schindler "Corrosion" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.b01_08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of a corrosion inhibitor depends on fluid composition, quantity of water, and flow regime. A common mechanism for inhibiting corrosion involves formation of a coating, often a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer, which prevents access of the corrosive substance to the metal. Permanent treatments such as [[chrome plating]] are not generally considered inhibitors, however. Instead corrosion inhibitors are ''additives'' to the fluids that surround the metal or related object.

Corrosion inhibitors are common in industry, and also found in over-the-counter products, typically in spray form in combination with a [[lubricant]] and sometimes a [[penetrating oil]].

==Types==
[[File:CuBTApolymer.png|thumb|[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits corrosion of copper by forming an inert layer of this polymer on the metal's surface]]
The nature of the corrosive inhibitor depends on (i) the material being protected, which are most commonly metal objects, and (ii) on the corrosive agent(s) to be neutralized. The corrosive agents are generally oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Oxygen is generally removed by reductive inhibitors such as [[amine]]s and [[hydrazine]]s:
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In this example, [[hydrazine]] converts oxygen, a common corrosive agent, to water, which is generally benign. Related inhibitors of oxygen corrosion are [[hexamine]], [[phenylenediamine]], and [[dimethylethanolamine]], and their derivatives. [[Antioxidant]]s such as sulfite and [[ascorbic acid]] are sometimes used. Some corrosion inhibitors form a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating coating]] on the surface by [[chemisorption]]. [[Benzotriazole]] is one such species used to protect [[copper]]. For [[lubrication]], [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s are common - they deposit sulfide on surfaces.

The suitability of any given chemical for a task in hand depends on many factors, including their [[operating temperature]].

==Illustrative applications==
*Volatile amines are used in [[boiler]]s to minimize the effects of acid. In some cases, the amines form a protective film on the steel surface and, at the same time, act as an anodic inhibitor. An inhibitor that acts both in a cathodic and anodic manner is termed a ''mixed inhibitor''.
*[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits the corrosion and staining of copper surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;M. Finšgarand and I. Milošev "Inhibition of copper corrosion by 1,2,3-benzotriazole: A review" Corrosion Science 2010, Volume 52, Pages 2737-2749 {{doi|10.1016/j.corsci.2010.05.002}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*Corrosion inhibitors are often added to [[paint]]s. A [[pigment]] with anticorrosive properties is [[zinc phosphate]]. Compounds derived from [[tannic acid]] or zinc salts of organonitrogens (e.g. Alcophor 827) can be used together with anticorrosive pigments. Other corrosion inhibitors are Anticor 70, Albaex, Ferrophos, and Molywhite MZAP.
*[[Antiseptic]]s are used to counter [[microbial corrosion]]. [[Benzalkonium chloride]] is commonly used in [[oil field]] industry.
*In oil refineries, [[hydrogen sulfide]] can corrode steels so it is removed often using air and amines by conversion to [[polysulfide]]s.
===Fuels industry===
Corrosion inhibitors are commonly added to [[antifreeze (coolant)|coolant]]s, fuels, [[hydraulic fluid]]s, [[boiler water]], [[engine oil]], and many other fluids used in industry. For fuels, various corrosion inhibitors can be used. Some components include [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050218035909/http://www.octel-starreon.com/Products_RFA_Corrosion.htm Octel-Starreon Refinery Fuel Additives Corrosion Inhibitors for hydrocarbon fuels - corrosion inhibitor and corrosion protection to fuel distribution system]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DCI-4A, widely used in commercial and military [[jet fuel]]s, acts also as a [[lubricity]] additive. Can be also used for [[gasoline]]s and other [[distillate]] fuels.
* DCI-6A, for motor gasoline and distillate fuels, and for [[U.S. military]] fuels ([[JP-4]], [[JP-5]], [[JP-8]])
* DCI-11, for alcohols and gasolines containing [[oxygenate]]s
* DCI-28, for very low-pH alcohols and gasolines containing oxygenates
* DCI-30, for gasoline and distillate fuels, excellent for pipeline transfers and storage, caustic-resistant
* DMA-4 (solution of alkylaminophosphate in kerosene), for petroleum distillates

==History==
The crystal structures of simple ionic solids have long been rationalised in terms of [[Pauling's rules]], first set out in 1929 by [[Linus Pauling]].&lt;ref name="Paulingsrules"&gt;{{cite journal | author=  [[Linus Pauling|L. Pauling]] | year = 1929 | title = The principles determining the structure of complex ionic crystals | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages= 1010–1026 | doi= 10.1021/ja01379a006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For metals and semiconductors one has different rules involving valence electron concentration. However, prediction and rationalization are rather different things. Most commonly, the term crystal structure prediction means a search for the minimum-energy arrangement of its constituent atoms (or, for molecular crystals, of its molecules) in space. The problem has two facets: combinatorics (the "search phase space", in practice most acute for inorganic crystals), and energetics (or "stability ranking", most acute for molecular organic crystals).
For complex non-molecular crystals (where the "search problem" is most acute), major recent advances have been the development of the Martonak version of [[metadynamics]],&lt;ref name="Martonak2003"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 90 | page = 75502 | issue = 3 | year = 2003 | title = Predicting crystal structures: The Parrinello-Rahman method revisited | author = Martonak R., Laio A., Parrinello M. | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.90.075503 | arxiv = cond-mat/0211551 | bibcode = 2003PhRvL..90g5503M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Martonak2006"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 5 | year = 2006 | pages = 623–626 | title = Crystal structure transformations in SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from classical and ab initio metadynamics | author = Martonak R., Donadio D., Oganov A.

The latter are capable of solving the global optimization problem with up to around a hundred degrees of freedom, while the approach of metadynamics is to reduce all structural variables to a handful of "slow" collective variables (which often works).

==Molecular crystals==
Predicting organic crystal structures is important in academic and industrial science, particularly for [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[pigment]]s, where understanding [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] is beneficial. The crystal structures of molecular substances, particularly organic compounds, are very hard to predict and rank in order of stability. Intermolecular interactions are relatively weak and non-directional and long range.&lt;ref name=StoneTheoryofIntermolecularForces&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Anthony|title=The Theory of Intermolecular Forces|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in typical lattice and free energy differences between [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] that are often only a few kJ/mol, very rarely exceeding 10 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=Nyman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nyman, Jonas|author2=Day, Graeme M.|title=Static and lattice vibrational energy differences between polymorphs|journal=CrystEngComm|doi=10.1039/C5CE00045A|volume=17|pages=5154–5165|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal structure prediction methods often locate many possible structures within this small energy range. These small energy differences are challenging to predict reliably without excessive computational effort.

Since 2007, significant progress has been made in the CSP of small organic molecules, with several different methods proving effective.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | issue =   7171| pages = 771 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1038/450771a | title = Model predicts structure of crystals | author = K.

{{continuum mechanics}}
In [[physics]], the [[first law of thermodynamics]] is an expression of the [[conservation of energy|conservation of total energy]] of a system. The increase of the energy of a system is equal to the sum of work done on the system and the heat added to that system:

:&lt;math&gt;dE_t=dQ + dW&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy of a system.
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the work done on it.
* &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat added to that system.

In [[fluid mechanics]], the first law of thermodynamics takes the following form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=F. M. White|title=Viscous fluid flow|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2006|edition=3rd|pages=69&amp;ndash;72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt1960"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Truesdell|author2=Toupin|year=1960|chapter=The classical field theories|title=Encyclopedia of physics: Principles of classical mechanics and field theory|volume=III|page=609|editor=Flügge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D E_t}{D t}=\frac{D W}{D t} + \frac{D Q}{D t} \to \frac{D E_t}{D t} = \nabla\cdot({\mathbf \sigma\cdot v}) - \nabla\cdot{\mathbf q}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the  [[Cauchy stress tensor]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flow velocity]].
* and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat]] [[flux]] vector.

Because it expresses conservation of total energy, this is sometimes referred to as the '''energy balance equation''' of continuous media. The first law is used to derive the non-conservation form of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Computational fluid dynamics|author=Chung|pages=33–34|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf\sigma} = -p{\mathbf I} + {\mathbf T}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]]
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deviatoric stress tensor]]

That is, pulling is positive stress and pushing is negative stress.

== Compressible fluid ==

For a compressible fluid the left hand side of equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D E_t}{D t} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(E\mathbf v)&lt;/math&gt;

because in general
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf v\neq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Integral form ==

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \, dV =-\oint_{\partial V}E{\mathbf v}\cdot d{\mathbf A}+\oint_{\partial V}({\mathbf \sigma\cdot v})\cdot d{\mathbf A}-\oint_{\partial V}{\mathbf q}\cdot d{\mathbf A}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the change in the internal energy of the substance within a volume is the negative of the amount carried out of the volume by the flow of material across the boundary plus the work done compressing the material on the boundary minus the flow of heat out through the boundary. More generally, it is possible to incorporate source terms.&lt;ref name="tt1960"/&gt;

== Alternative representation ==
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\frac{D h}{D t}=\frac{D p}{D t}+ \nabla\cdot(k \, \nabla T)+\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is specific enthalpy, &lt;math&gt;\Phi={\mathbf \tau}:\nabla{\mathbf v}&lt;/math&gt; is dissipation function and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature. And where
* &lt;math&gt;E_t=\rho(e+\frac{1}{2}v^2-\mathbf{g\cdot r})&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. internal energy per unit volume equals mass density times the sum of: proper energy per unit mass, kinetic energy per unit mass, and gravitational potential energy per unit mass.

* &lt;math&gt;-\nabla\cdot{\mathbf q}=+\nabla\cdot(k\,\nabla T)&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. change in heat per unit volume (negative divergence of heat flow) equals the divergence of heat conductivity times the gradient of the temperature.

* &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot({\mathbf \sigma\cdot v})={\mathbf v\cdot\nabla\cdot\sigma}+\sigma :\nabla \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. divergence of work done against stress equals flow of material times divergence of stress plus stress times divergence of material flow.

* &lt;math&gt;\sigma :\nabla {\mathbf v}=\Phi - p\,\nabla\cdot{\mathbf v}&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. stress times divergence of material flow equals deviatoric stress tensor times divergence of material flow minus pressure times material flow.

* &lt;math&gt;h=e+\frac{p}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. enthalpy per unit mass equals proper energy per unit mass plus pressure times volume per unit mass (reciprocal of mass density).

* &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\sigma=\frac{DJ}{Dt}-\mathbf f&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;-p\,\nabla\cdot{\mathbf v}=\frac{Dp}{Dt}-\rho\frac{D}{Dt} \left( \frac{p}{\rho}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

A '''floating production storage and offloading''' ('''FPSO''') unit is a floating vessel used by the [[Oil platform|offshore oil and gas industry]] for the production and processing of [[hydrocarbon]]s, and for the storage of oil. A FPSO vessel is designed to receive hydrocarbons produced by itself or from nearby [[oil platform|platforms]] or [[subsea]] template, process them, and store oil until it can be offloaded onto a [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] or, less frequently, transported through a [[Pipe (material)|pipeline]]. FPSOs are preferred in frontier offshore regions as they are easy to install, and do not require a local pipeline infrastructure to export oil. FPSOs can be a conversion of an [[oil tanker]] or can be a vessel built specially for the application. A vessel used only to store oil (without processing it) is referred to as a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel.

Recent developments in LNG industry require relocation of conventional LNG processing trains into the sea to unlock remote, smaller gas fields that would not be economical to develop otherwise, reduce capital expenses, and impact to environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shell.com/about-us/major-projects/prelude-flng/a-revolution-in-natural-gas-production.html |title=A REVOLUTION IN NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION |publisher=Shell |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108164426/http://www.shell.com/about-us/major-projects/prelude-flng/a-revolution-in-natural-gas-production.html |archivedate=2016-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emerging new type of [[floating liquefied natural gas|FLNG]] facilities will be used. Unlike FPSOs apart of gas production, storage and offloading, they will also allow full scale deep processing, same as onshore LNG plant has to offer but squeezed to 25% of its footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shell.com.au/aboutshell/who-we-are/shell-au/operations/upstream/prelude/why-flng.html |title=Why FLNG? |publisher=Shell Australia|date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
First 3 FLNG's are under construction (as at 2016): [[Prelude FLNG]] (Shell), PFLNG1 and PFLNG2 ([[Petronas]]).

== History ==
Oil has been produced from offshore locations since the late 1940s. Originally, all [[oil platform]]s sat on the seabed, but as exploration moved to deeper waters and more distant locations in the 1970s, floating production systems came to be used.

The first oil FPSO was built in 1977 on the Shell Castellon field, located in the Spanish Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.offshore-technology.com/features/feature40937/&lt;/ref&gt; Today, over 270 vessels are deployed worldwide as oil FPSOs.

On July 29, 2009, Shell and Samsung announced an agreement to build up to 10 LNG FPSOs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.platts.com/Oil/News/7093122.xml?src=Oilrssheadlines1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014259/http://www.platts.com/Oil/News/7093122.xml?src=Oilrssheadlines1 |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at same Samsung Yard Flex LNG appeared to construct smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flexlng.com |title=Flex Lng |publisher=Flex Lng |date=2015-08-28 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2011, Royal Dutch Shell announced the planned development of a floating liquefied natural gas facility (FLNG), called [[Prelude FLNG|Prelude]] with 488 m long and 74 m wide, which is to be situated 200&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of Western Australia and is due for completion in around 2016, the largest vessel man-made ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ccaed4a-82ba-11e0-b97c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1NADgzzOH]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523070221/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ccaed4a-82ba-11e0-b97c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1NADgzzOH |date=May 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Dutch Shell (2013), LNG FPSO (Liquefied Natural Gas Floating production Storage and Offloading), [[Samsung Heavy Industries]] at a cost of $12 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/03/ship-lng-record-idUSL5N0JE3HE20131203 |title=Record-breaking gas ship launched, bigger one planned |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[Petronas]] made a contract of procurement engineering, construction, installation and commissioning, a project with the Technip and DSME consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chee Yew Cheang |url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/127313/Petronas_Cuts_First_Steel_for_FLNG_Facility#sthash.gzPQsC3d.dpuf |title=NEWS &amp;#124; Petronas Cuts First Steel for FLNG Facility &amp;#124; Rigzone |publisher=Rigzone.com |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit is destined for the Kanowit gas field off Sarawak, Malaysia. It is expected to be the World's First Floating Liquefaction Unit in operation when completed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oedigital.com/component/k2/item/3760-petronas-kanowit-field-flng-facility-under-construction |title=Petronas' Kanowit field FLNG facility under construction |publisher=OE Digital |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the opposite (discharge and regasification) end of the LNG chain, the first ever conversion of an [[LNG]] carrier, [[Golar LNG]] owned Moss type LNG carrier into an LNG floating storage and regasification unit was carried out in 2007 by [[Keppel Corporation|Keppel]] shipyard in Singapore.&lt;ref name=skips&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
Oil produced from offshore [[Oil platform|production platform]]s can be transported to the [[mainland]] either by pipeline or by tanker. When a tanker is chosen to transport the oil, it is necessary to accumulate oil in some form of storage tank, such that the oil tanker is not continuously occupied during oil production, and is only needed once sufficient oil has been produced to fill the tanker.&lt;ref name="investopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fpso-floating-production-storage-and-offloading.asp |title=FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) Definition |publisher=Investopedia |date=2015-06-10 |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Floating production, storage and offloading vessels are particularly effective in remote or deep water locations, where seabed pipelines are not cost effective. FPSOs eliminate the need to lay expensive long-distance pipelines from the processing facility to an onshore terminal. This can provide an economically attractive solution for smaller ''oil fields'', which can be exhausted in a few years and do not justify the expense of installing a pipeline. Furthermore, once the field is depleted, the FPSO can be moved to a new location.&lt;ref name="investopedia.com"/&gt;

== Types ==
A '''Floating Storage and Offloading unit''' ('''FSO''') is essentially a simplified FPSO, without the capability for oil or gas processing. Most FSOs are converted ''single hull'' [[supertankers]]. An example is ''[[Knock Nevis]]'', ex ''[[Seawise Giant]]'', which for many years was the world's largest ship. It was converted into an FSO for offshore use before being scrapped.

At the other end of the LNG logistics chain, where the natural gas is brought back to ambient temperature and pressure, specially modified ships may also be used as '''floating storage and regasification units''' ('''FSRUs'''). A LNG floating storage and regasification unit receives [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) from offloading [[LNG carrier]]s, and the onboard regasification system provides natural gas exported to shore through risers and pipelines.

=== Records ===
In addition to the historical records already mentioned, a few more are added in this section.

The FPSO operating in the deepest waters is the FPSO ''BW Pioneer'', built and operated by [[BW Offshore]] on behalf of [[Petrobras]] Americas INC. The FPSO is moored at a depth of 2,600 m in Block 249 Walker Ridge in the US [[Gulf of Mexico]] and is rated for {{convert|80000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}. The EPCI contract was awarded in October 2007 and production started in early 2012. The FPSO conversion was carried out at ''MMHE Shipyard Pasir Gudang'' in [[Malaysia]], while the topsides were fabricated in modules at various international vendor locations. The FPSO has a disconnectable turret (APL). The vessel can disconnect in advance of hurricanes and reconnect with minimal down time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/bw-pioneer-fpso-begins-producing-oil-and-gas-gulf |title=BW Pioneer: FPSO Begins Producing Oil And Gas In Gulf &amp;#124; Pipeline &amp; Gas Journal |publisher=Pipelineandgasjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073518/http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/bw-pioneer-fpso-begins-producing-oil-and-gas-gulf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A contract for an FPSO to operate in even deeper waters (2,900 m) for Shell's Stones field in the US Gulf of Mexico was awarded to [[SBM Offshore]] in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbmoffshore.com/?press-release=sbm-offshore-awarded-contracts-to-provide-worlds-deepest-disconnectable-fpso-for-shell-stones-in-gulf-of-mexico |title=Awarded Contracts to Provide World’s Deepest Disconnectable FPSO for Shell Stones in Gulf of Mexico |publisher=SBM Offshore |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the world's largest FPSO is the ''[[Kizomba deepwater project|Kizomba A]]'', with a storage capacity of {{convert|2.2|Moilbbl|m3}}. Built at a cost of over [[United States dollar|US$]] 800 million by [[Hyundai Heavy Industries]] in [[Ulsan]], [[Korea]], it is operated by [[Esso Exploration Angola]] ([[ExxonMobil]]). Located in 1200 meters (3,940&amp;nbsp;ft) of water at Deep water block 200 statute miles (320&amp;nbsp;km) offshore in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from [[Angola]], [[Central Africa]], it weighs 81,000 [[tonne]]s and is 285 meters long, 63 meters wide, and 32 meters high (935&amp;nbsp;ft by {{convert|207|ft|m|abbr=on}} by 105&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exxonmobileurope.com/Corporate/Newsroom/Publications/TheLamp_3_2005/story2.asp ]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first FSO in the Gulf of Mexico, The FSO ''Ta'Kuntah'', has been in operation since August 1998. The FSO, owned and operated by [[MODEC]], is under a service agreement with ''PEMEX'' Exploration and Production. The vessel was installed as part of the Cantarell Field Development. The field is located in the Bay of Campeche, offshore Mexico's Yucatán peninsula. It is a converted ULCC tanker with a SOFEC external turret mooring system, two flexible risers connected in a lazy-S configuration between the turret and a pipeline end manifold (PLEM) on the seabed, and a unique offloading system.  The FSO is designed to handle {{convert|800000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} with no allowance for downtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modec.com/fps/fpso_fso/projects/cantarell.html |title=FSO Ta'Kuntah - MODEC FPSO/FSO Projects - FPSOs &amp; FSOs - Floating Production Solutions |publisher=MODEC |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Skarv FPSO''', developed and engineered by ''Aker Solutions'' for ''BP Norge'', is one of the most advanced and largest FPSO deployed in the Norwegian Sea, offshore Mid [[Norway]]. ''Skarv'' is a gas condensate and oil field development. The development ties in five sub-sea templates, and the FPSO has capacity to include several smaller wells nearby in the future. The process plant on the vessel can handle about {{convert|19000000|m3/d|cuft/d}} of gas and {{convert|13500|m3/d|cuft/d}} of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eon-ruhrgas-norge.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-3F57EEE5-5B3326E4/er-norge/hs.xsl/2414.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122092016/http://www.eon-ruhrgas-norge.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-3F57EEE5-5B3326E4/er-norge/hs.xsl/2414.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-22 |title=Eon Ruhrgas Norge |publisher=Eon Ruhrgas Norge |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An 80&amp;nbsp;km gas export pipe ties into [[Åsgard]] transport system.

The ''EPcma'' contract covers detail engineering and procurement work for the FPSO topsides as well as construction management assistance to BP including hull and topside facilities. The production started in field on August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=50434 |title=NEWS &amp;#124; Aker Kvaerner Wins More Skarv Work &amp;#124; Rigzone |publisher=Rigzone.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; BP awarded the contract for fabrication of the ''Skarv'' FPSO hull to ''Samsung Heavy Industries'' in South Korea and the Turret contract to SBM. The FPSO has a length of 292 m, beam of 50.6 m and is 29 m deep, accommodates about 100 people in single cabins. The hull is delivered in January 2010.&lt;ref name="offshore-technology.com"/&gt;

[[File:Volin.jpg|thumb|An industrial flywheel]]
A '''flywheel''' is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently store [[rotational energy]]. Flywheels resist changes in rotational speed by their [[moment of inertia]]. The amount of energy stored in a flywheel is proportional to the square of its [[rotational speed]]. The way to change a flywheel's stored energy is by increasing or decreasing its rotational speed by applying a [[torque]] aligned with its axis of symmetry,

Common uses of a flywheel include:
* Smoothing the power output of an energy source. For example, flywheels are used in [[reciprocating engine]]s because the active torque from the individual pistons is intermittent.
* [[Flywheel energy storage|Energy storage systems]]
* Delivering energy at rates beyond the ability of an energy source. This is achieved by collecting energy in a flywheel over time and then releasing it quickly, at rates that exceed the abilities of the energy source.
* Controlling the orientation of a mechanical system, [[gyroscope]] and [[reaction wheel]]

Flywheels are typically made of steel and rotate on conventional bearings; these are generally limited to a maximum revolution rate of a few thousand RPM.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120629-reinventing-the-wheel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703101332/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120629-reinventing-the-wheel |archivedate=2012-07-03 |df= }}; "Flywheels move from steam age technology to Formula 1"; Jon Stewart | 1 July 2012, retrieved 2012-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;  High energy density flywheels can be made of carbon fiber composites and employ [[magnetic bearing]]s, enabling them to revolve at speeds up to 60,000 RPM (1&amp;nbsp;kHz).&lt;ref name="Kinergy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ricardo.com/en-GB/News--Media/Press-releases/News-releases1/2011/Breakthrough-in-Ricardo-Kinergy-second-generation-high-speed-flywheel-technology/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705032651/http://www.ricardo.com/en-GB/News--Media/Press-releases/News-releases1/2011/Breakthrough-in-Ricardo-Kinergy-second-generation-high-speed-flywheel-technology/ |archivedate=2012-07-05 |df= }}, "Breakthrough in Ricardo Kinergy ‘second generation’ high-speed flywheel technology"; Press release date: 22 August 2011. retrieved 2012-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon-composite flywheel batteries have recently been manufactured and are proving to be viable in real-world tests on mainstream cars. Additionally, their disposal is more eco-friendly than traditional lithium ion batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/news/10-tech-concepts-you-need-to-know-for-2012-2|title=10 Need-to-Know Tech Concepts for 2012|author=|date=3 January 2012|website=popularmechanics.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111095247/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/news/10-tech-concepts-you-need-to-know-for-2012-2|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:Landini VL30(Italien)2.JPG|thumb|A [[Landini (tractor)|Landini]] tractor with exposed flywheel]]
Flywheels are often used to provide continuous power output in systems where the energy source is not continuous. For example, a flywheel is used to smooth fast angular velocity fluctuations of the [[crankshaft]] in a reciprocating engine. In this case, a crankshaft flywheel stores energy when torque is exerted on it by a firing [[piston]], and returns it to the piston to compress a fresh charge of air and fuel. Another example is the [[friction motor]] which powers devices such as [[toy car]]s. In unstressed and inexpensive cases, to save on cost, the bulk of the mass of the flywheel is toward the rim of the wheel. Pushing the mass away from the axis of rotation heightens [[rotational inertia]] for a given total mass.
[[File:P307.jpg|thumb|Modern automobile engine flywheel]]

A flywheel may also be used to supply intermittent pulses of energy at power levels that exceed the abilities of its energy source. This is achieved by accumulating energy in the flywheel over a period of time, at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time when it is needed. For example, flywheels are used in [[power hammer]]s and [[riveting machines]].

Flywheels can be used to control direction and oppose unwanted motions, see [[gyroscope]]. Flywheels in this context have a wide range of applications from [[gyroscope]]s for instrumentation to [[ship stability]] and satellite stabilization ([[reaction wheel]]), to keep a toy spin spinning ([[friction motor]]), to stabilize magnetically levitated objects ([[Spin-stabilized magnetic levitation]])

== History ==

The principle of the flywheel is found in the [[Neolithic]] [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and the [[potter's wheel]], as well as circular sharpening stones in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Lynn White, Jr. 233"&gt;Lynn White, Jr., "Theophilus Redivivus", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 2. (Spring, 1964), Review, pp. 224–233 (233)&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the flywheel as a general mechanical device to equalize the speed of rotation is, according to the American medievalist [[Lynn White]], recorded in the ''De diversibus artibus'' (On various arts) of the German artisan [[Theophilus Presbyter]] (ca. 1070–1125) who records applying the device in several of his machines.&lt;ref name="Lynn White, Jr. 233"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White, Jr., "Medieval Engineering and the Sociology of Knowledge", ''The Pacific Historical Review'', Vol. 44, No. 1. (Feb., 1975), pp. 1–21 (6)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[James Watt]] contributed to the development of the flywheel in the [[steam engine]], and his contemporary [[James Pickard]] used a flywheel combined with a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] to transform reciprocating motion into rotary motion.

== Physics ==
[[File:Leonardo-Flywheel.ogg|thumb|A flywheel with variable moment of inertia, conceived by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]

A flywheel is a spinning wheel, or disc, or rotor, rotating around its symmetry axis. Energy is stored as [[kinetic energy]], more specifically [[rotational energy]], of the [[wikt:rotor|rotor]] :

* &lt;math&gt;E_k=\frac{1}{2} I \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; is the stored [[kinetic energy]], 
* ω is the [[angular velocity]], and
* &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the flywheel about its axis of symmetry. The moment of inertia is a measure of resistance to [[torque]] applied on a spinning object (i.e. the higher the moment of inertia, the slower it will accelerate when a given torque is applied).
* The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder is &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{1}{2} mr^2&lt;/math&gt;,
* for a thin-walled empty cylinder is &lt;math&gt;I = m r^2&lt;/math&gt;,
* and for a thick-walled empty cylinder is &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{1}{2} m({r_\mathrm{external}}^2 + {r_\mathrm{internal}}^2) &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freestudy.co.uk/dynamics/moment%20of%20inertia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105181252/http://www.freestudy.co.uk/dynamics/moment%20of%20inertia.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }} (page 10, accessed 1 Dec 2011, Moment of inertia tutorial&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; denotes mass, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; denotes a radius.

When calculating with [[SI]] units, the units would be for mass, [[kilograms]]; for radius, meters; and for angular velocity, [[radian]]s per [[second]] and the resulting energy would be in [[joule]]s.

Increasing amounts of rotation energy can be stored in the flywheel until the rotor shatters.
This happens when the [[hoop stress]] within the rotor exceeds the [[ultimate tensile strength]] of the rotor material. 
* &lt;math&gt; \sigma_t = \rho r^2 \omega^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt; \sigma_t &lt;/math&gt; is the tensile stress on the rim of the cylinder
* &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the cylinder
* &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the cylinder, and
* &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]] of the cylinder.

== Material selection ==

Flywheels are made from many different materials; the application determines the choice of material. Small flywheels made of lead are found in children’s toys. Cast iron flywheels are used in old steam engines. Flywheels used in car engines are made of cast or nodular iron, steel or aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flywheels: Iron vs. Steel vs. Aluminum|url=https://fidanza.com/aluminum-vs-steel/|website=Fidanza Performance|accessdate=6 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010183339/https://fidanza.com/aluminum-vs-steel/|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flywheels made from high-strength steel or composites have been proposed for use in vehicle energy storage and braking systems.

The efficiency of a flywheel is determined by the maximum amount of energy it can store per unit weight. As the flywheel’s rotational speed or angular velocity is increased, the stored energy increases; however, the stresses also increase. If the hoop stress surpass the tensile strength of the material, the flywheel will break apart. Thus, the tensile strength limits the amount of energy that a flywheel can store.

In this context, using lead for a flywheel in a child’s toy is not efficient; however, the flywheel velocity never approaches its burst velocity because the limit in this case is the pulling-power of the child. In other applications, such as an automobile, the flywheel operates at a specified angular velocity and is constrained by the space it must fit in, so the goal is to maximize the stored energy per unit volume. The material selection therefore depends on the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashby|first1=Michael|title=Materials Selection in Mechanical Design|date=2011|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-0-08-095223-9|pages=142–146|edition=4th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below contains calculated values for materials and comments on their viability for flywheel applications. CFRP stands for [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]], and GFRP stands for [[Fiberglass|glass-fiber reinforced polymer]].

The table below shows calculated values for mass, radius, and angular velocity for storing 500 J. The carbon-fiber flywheel is by far the most efficient; however, it also has the largest radius. In applications (like in an automobile) where the volume is constrained, a carbon-fiber flywheel might not be the best option.

For comparison, the energy density of petrol (gasoline) is 44.4 MJ/kg or 12.3 kWh/kg.

=== High-energy materials ===
For a given flywheel design, the kinetic energy is proportional to the ratio of the [[hoop stress]] to the material density and to the mass:

* &lt;math&gt;E_k \varpropto \frac{\sigma_t}{\rho}m &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma_t}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt; could be called the [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]]. The flywheel material with the highest specific tensile strength will yield the highest energy storage per unit mass. This is one reason why [[carbon fiber]] is a material of interest.

For a given design the stored energy is proportional to the hoop stress and the volume:

* &lt;math&gt;E_k \varpropto \sigma_tV &lt;/math&gt;

===Rimmed===

A rimmed flywheel has a rim, a hub, and spokes.&lt;ref&gt;Flywheel Rotor And Containment Technology Development, FY83. Livermore, Calif: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , 1983. pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Calculation of the flywheel's moment of inertia can be more easily analysed by applying various simplifications. For example:
* Assume the spokes, shaft and hub have zero moments of inertia, and the flywheel's moment of inertia is from the rim alone.
* The lumped moments of inertia of spokes, hub and shaft may be estimated as a percentage of the flywheel's moment of inertia, with the majority from the rim, so that &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{rim}=KI_\mathrm{flywheel}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if the moments of inertia of hub, spokes and shaft are deemed negligible, and the rim's thickness is very small compared to its mean radius (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;), the radius of rotation of the rim is equal to its mean radius and thus:

* &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{rim}=M_\mathrm{rim}R^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1554">'''Grenfell Cloth''' is a densely-woven [[cotton]] [[gabardine]] material used to make luxury and outdoor [[clothing]] since its creation in 1923. It was named after Sir [[Wilfred Grenfell]], a [[UK|British]] medical [[missionary]] working extensively in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. He required a cloth to be woven to protect himself from the snow, wind, wet and cold weather he encountered in his work.

The cloth is made from 600 [[Units of textile measurement#Thread count|thread-per-inch]] cotton originally by T. Haythornthwaite &amp; Sons [[Private company limited by shares|Ltd]] at Lodge Mill, [[Burnley]], in the United Kingdom.  It is similar to [[Byrd Cloth]].&lt;ref name="Stanton1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelby L.

After a spell under [[Japan]]ese ownership in the 80's and 90's, Grenfell Cloth garments are once again manufactured in Britain.  Grenfell is now based in [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13156">{{short description|A global scale tropical atmospheric circulation feature}}
[[File:Omega-500-july-era40-1979.png|thumb|300px|right|Vertical velocity at 500 hPa, July average in units of pascals per second. Ascent (negative values) is concentrated close to the solar equator; descent (positive values) is more diffuse.]]

The '''Hadley cell''', named after [[George Hadley]], is a global scale tropical [[atmospheric circulation]] that features air rising near the Equator, flowing poleward at 10–15 kilometers above the surface, descending in the subtropics, and then returning equatorward near the surface. This circulation creates the [[trade wind]]s, tropical rain-belts and [[hurricane]]s, subtropical deserts and the [[jet stream]]s.

In each hemisphere, there is one primary circulation cell known as a Hadley cell and two secondary circulation cells at higher [[latitudes]]; between 30° and 60° latitude known as the [[Ferrel cell]] and beyond 60° as the [[Polar vortex|Polar cell]].

==Mechanism==
The major driving force of [[atmospheric circulation]] is the uneven distribution of solar heating across the Earth, which is greatest near the equator and lesser at the poles. The atmospheric circulation transports energy polewards, thus reducing the resulting equator-to-pole temperature gradient. The mechanisms by which this is accomplished differ in tropical and extratropical latitudes.

Hadley cells exist on either side of the equator. Each cell encircles the globe latitudinally and acts to transport energy from the equator to about the 30th latitude. The circulation exhibits the following phenomena:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944522711|title=Global physical climatology|last=L.,|first=Hartmann, Dennis|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780123285317|location=|pages=165–76|oclc=944522711|date=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Warm, moist air converging near the equator causes heavy precipitation. This releases latent heat, driving strong rising motions.
* This air rises to the [[tropopause]], about 10–15 kilometers above sea level, where the air is no longer buoyant.
* Unable to continue rising, this sub-stratospheric air is instead forced poleward by the continual rise of air below.
* As air moves poleward, it both cools and gains a strong eastward component due to the [[Coriolis force|Coriolis effect]] and the conservation of [[angular momentum]]. The resulting winds form the subtropical [[Jet stream|jet streams]].
* At about 30° latitude on either side of the equator, the jet streams become so much faster than the surface wind speed that [[Baroclinity|baroclinic instability]] prevents the Hadley circulation from extending further poleward. This coincides with the beginning of the [[Ferrel cell|Ferrel cells]].
* At this latitude, the now cool, dry, high altitude air begins to sink. As it sinks, it warms adiabatically, decreasing its relative humidity.
* Near the surface, a frictional return flow completes the loop, absorbing moisture along the way. The Coriolis effect gives this flow a westward component, creating the [[trade winds]].
The Hadley circulation exhibits seasonal variation. During the solstitial seasons (DJF and JJA), the upward branch of the Hadley cell occurs not directly over the equator but rather in the summer hemisphere. In the annual mean, the upward branch is slightly offset into the northern hemisphere, making way for a stronger Hadley cell in the southern hemisphere. This evidences a small net energy transport from the northern to the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Hadley system provides an example of a thermally direct circulation. The thermodynamic efficiency of the Hadley system, considered as a heat engine, has been relatively constant over the 1979–2010 period, averaging 2.6%. Over the same interval, the power generated by the Hadley regime has risen at an average rate of about 0.54 TW per year; this reflects an increase in energy input to the system consistent with the observed increasing of tropical sea surface temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Junling Huang |author2=Michael B. McElroy |title=Contributions of the Hadley and Ferrel Circulations to the Energetics of the Atmosphere over the Past 32 Years|journal=Journal of Climate |issue=7| volume=27 |pages=2656–2666 |year=2014 |doi=10.1175/jcli-d-13-00538.1|bibcode = 2014JCli...27.2656H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, mean meridional circulation cells such as the Hadley circulation are not particularly efficient at reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient due to cancellation between transports of different types of energy. In the Hadley cell, both sensible and latent heat are transported equatorward near the surface, while potential energy is transported above in the opposite direction, poleward. The resulting net poleward transport is only about 10% of this potential energy transport. This is partly a result of the strong constraints imposed on atmospheric motions by the conservation of angular momentum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History of discovery==
[[File:Earth Global Circulation - en.svg|right|thumb|400px|Hadley cells within an idealized depiction of the Earth's atmospheric circulation as they may appear at [[equinox]].]]
In the early 18th century, [[George Hadley]], an English lawyer and amateur [[meteorologist]], was dissatisfied with the theory that the astronomer [[Edmond Halley]] had proposed for explaining the trade winds. What was no doubt correct in Halley's theory was that solar heating creates upward motion of equatorial air, and [[air mass]] from neighboring latitudes must flow in to replace the risen air mass. But for the westward component of the trade winds Halley had proposed that in moving across the sky the Sun heats the air mass differently over the course of the day. Hadley was not satisfied with that part of Halley's theory and rightly so. Hadley was the first to recognize that Earth's rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass as it moves relative to the Earth. Hadley's theory, published in 1735, remained unknown, but it was rediscovered independently several times. Among the re-discoverers was [[John Dalton]], who later learned of Hadley's priority. Over time the mechanism proposed by Hadley became accepted, and over time his name was increasingly attached to it. By the end of the 19th century it was shown that Hadley's theory was deficient in several respects. One of the first who accounted for the dynamics correctly was [[William Ferrel]]. It took many decades for the correct theory to become accepted, and even today Hadley's theory can still be encountered occasionally, particularly in popular books and websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anders Persson |title=Hadley's Principle: Understanding and Misunderstanding the Trade Winds |journal=History of Meteorology  |volume=3 |pages=17–42 |year=2006 |url=http://www.meteohistory.org/2006historyofmeteorology3/2persson_hadley.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadley's theory was the generally accepted theory long enough to make his name become universally attached to the circulation pattern in the tropical atmosphere. In 1980 [[Isaac Held]] and Arthur Hou developed the [[Held-Hou Model]] to describe the Hadley circulation.

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cloud formations in a famous image of Earth from Apollo 17, makes atmospheric circulation directly visible]]

==Major impacts on precipitation by latitude==
The region in which the equatorward moving air masses converge and rise, is known as the [[intertropical convergence zone]], or ITCZ. Within that zone develops a band of thunderstorms that produce high-precipitation.

Having lost most of its water vapor to condensation and precipitation in the upward branch of the Hadley cell circulation, the descending air is dry. As the air descends, low relative humidities are produced as the air is warmed [[adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]]ally by compression from the overlying air, producing a region of higher pressure. The subtropics are relatively free of the convection, or thunderstorms, that are common in the equatorial belt. Many of the world's deserts are located in these subtropical latitudes.  Although the deserts do not extend to the eastern side of the various continents because of ocean currents caused by the Trade Winds.

==Hadley cell expansion==
There is some evidence that the expansion of the Hadley cells is related to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;

The hypothesis, that a decline in solar activity reduces the latitudinal extent of the Hadley Circulation and decreases mid-latitudinal monsoon intensity, is matched by data, showing increased dryness in central west Africa and increase in precipitation in temperate zones north. Meanwhile, mid-latitudinal storm tracks in the temperate zones increased and moved equatorward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=van Geel B., Renssen, H., |chapter=Abrupt climate change around 2650 BP in North-West Europe:evidence for climatic teleconnections and a tentative explanation |editor= Issar, A.S.,Brown, N. |title= Water, Environment and Society in Times of Climatic Change |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht|year=1998 |pages=21–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1289">The '''Jebel Ali refinery''' was constructed from 1996 to 1999.  The refinery is operated by the Emirates National Oil Co. ([[ENOC]]), which is owned by the [[Government of Dubai]]. It is a 120 kbpd gas condensate refinery, and processes mainly [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] or light crude oil.  These inputs are processed to various products, including [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[naphtha]], [[jet fuel]], [[diesel oil]] and [[fuel oil]].  The plant consists of two 60 kbit/s condensate distillation units (often referred to as [[condensate splitter]]s) and five [[merox]] sweetening units. 

An upgrade - costing $850 million (US) - was implemented in 2010 for the production of [[reformate|reformat and low-sulfur naphtha through installation of a reformer and a hydrotreater.]] In 2014, a contract for a new upgrade project was awarded to [[KBR (company)|KBR]]. The upgrade will lead to the production of Euro V grade products.

In [[solid-state physics]], '''[[Jun Kondo|Kondo]] [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]]''' (also referred as '''Kondo [[semiconductors]]''' and '''[[heavy fermion]] semiconductors''') are understood as materials with strongly correlated electrons, that open up a narrow [[band gap]] (in the order of 10 meV) at low temperatures with the [[chemical potential]] lying in the gap, whereas in heavy fermions the chemical potential is located in the [[conduction band]]. The band gap opens up at low temperatures due to [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridization]] of localized electrons (mostly f-electrons) with conduction electrons, a correlation effect known as the [[Kondo effect]]. As a consequence, a transition from metallic behavior to insulating behavior is seen in resistivity measurements. The band gap could be either [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct or indirect]]. Most studied Kondo insulators are FeSi, Ce&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[SmB6|SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], YbB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and CeNiSn.

==Historical overview==
In 1969, Menth ''et al.'' found no magnetic ordering in [[Samarium hexaboride|SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] down to 0.35 K and a change from metallic to insulating behavior in the resistivity measurement with decreasing temperature. They interpreted this phenomenon as a change of the electronic configuration of Sm.&lt;ref&gt;''Magnetic and semiconducting properties of SmB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'', A. Menth, E. Buehler, and T.H. Geballe, 1969, Phys. Rev. Lett., 22(7):295-297&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel Aeppli and Zachary Fisk found a descriptive way to explain the physical properties of Ce&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CeNiSn in 1992. They called the materials Kondo insulators, showing Kondo lattice behavior near room temperature, but becoming semiconducting with very small energy gaps (a few Kelvin to a few tens of Kelvin) when decreasing the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;''Kondo Insulators'', G. Aeppli, Z. Fisk, 1992, Comments Cond. Mat. Phys. 16, 155-170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport properties==
At high temperatures the localized f-electrons form independent local magnetic moments. According to the Kondo effect, the dc-resistivity of Kondo insulators shows a logarithmic temperature-dependence. At low temperatures, the local magnetic moments are screened by the sea of conduction electrons, forming a so-called Kondo resonance. The interaction of the conduction band with the [[F-orbital|f-orbitals]] results in a hybridization and an energy gap &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{\mathrm{g}} &lt;/math&gt;. If the chemical potential lies in the hybridization gap, an insulating behavior can be seen in the dc-resistivity at low temperatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">'''Kootenay Lake Crossing''' was a powerline crossing of [[Kootenay Lake]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The idea was to move electricity from the Hydro dam on the Kootenay River
at Brilliant to the Cominco Sullivan Mine at Kimberley. The most direct route was across Kootenay Lake. It was with a [[Span (architecture)|span]] width of {{convert|3248|m}} the [[List of spans|longest powerline span]] of [[North America]] and was fixed on two {{convert|90|m}} tall [[electricity pylon]]s. Roebling cable provided the steel support cable for the conductor. The height of conductor over Kootenay Lake was {{convert|37|m}}.
There was a {{convert|100|m}} steel support tower on the east shore, and rock anchored shorter towers high up on the west shore.  Kootenay Lake Crossing was inaugurated in 1958, but was demolished in 1962 by explosives placed by the [[Freedomites|Sons of Freedom]] religious sect of the [[Doukhobor]]s.  The tower was rebuilt and the span lengthened in course. The powerline is still in operation today, but uses today on each site of the lake (for each phase a separate tower) situated at 49°42'2"N   116°51'59"W and at 49°42'29"N   116°54'44"W &lt;!--(is this the mentioned powerline crossing or are there other powerline crossings)--&gt;.

[[Image:Laminate.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pergo flooring project]]

'''Laminate flooring''' (also called '''floating wood tile''' in the [[United States]]) is a multi-layer synthetic [[flooring]] product fused together with a [[lamination]] process. Laminate flooring simulates [[wood]] (or sometimes [[stone]]) with a photographic [[applique]] layer under a clear protective layer. The inner core layer is usually composed of [[melamine resin]] and [[Fiberboard|fiber board]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laminate Flooring Pros and Cons|author=About.com |url=http://interiordec.about.com/od/laminatebasic1/a/laminatefloorsF.htm |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[European Standard]] No. [http://kronoloc.ipcoweb.com/user_images/European_Norm_Spec_EN13329.pdf EN 13329:2000] specifying laminate floor covering requirements and testing methods.

Laminate flooring has grown significantly in popularity, perhaps because it may be easier to install and maintain than more traditional surfaces such as [[Wood flooring|hardwood flooring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vfpldesigns.com/way-to-install-wooden-laminate-flooring-in-homes/ |title=Ultimate Guide to Laminate Flooring|author=Discovery Communications LLC|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may also have the advantages of costing less and requiring less skill to install than alternative flooring materials. It is reasonably durable, [[Hygiene|hygienic]] (several brands contain an antimicrobial resin), and relatively easy to maintain.

==Installation==
Laminate floors are reasonably easy for a [[do it yourself|DIY]] homeowner to install. Laminate flooring is packaged as a number of [[tongue and groove]] planks, which can be clicked into one another. Sometimes a glue backing is provided for ease of installation. Installed laminate floors typically "float" over the sub-floor on top of a foam/film underlayment, which provides moisture- and sound-reducing properties.  A small ({{convert|1-10|mm}}) gap is required between the flooring and any immovable object such as walls, this allows the flooring to expand without being obstructed.  [[Baseboard]]s (skirting boards) can be removed and then reinstalled after laying of the flooring is complete for a neater finish, or the baseboard can be left in place with the flooring butted into it, then small beading trims such as shoe moulding or the larger quarter-round moulding can be fitted to the bottoms of the baseboards. Saw cuts on the planks are usually required at edges and around cupboard and door entrances, but professional installers typically use door jamb undercut saws to cut out a space to a height that allows the flooring to go under the door jamb &amp; casing for a cleaner look.

Improper installation can result in peaking, in which adjacent boards form a V shape projecting from the floor, or gaps, in which two adjacent boards are separated from each other.

[[File:Laminate flooring assembly.JPG|thumb|Installation of laminate flooring - note underlay to allow for contraction, expansion, and moisture control and method for squaring and distancing from wall.]][[File:Laminate floor assembly - close up.JPG|thumb|Fitting individual laminate planks.]][[File:Laminate floor assembly - setting tongue and groove.JPG|thumb|Secure tongue-and-groove connections create floor that is both tight and flexible.]]

==Care==
It is important to keep laminate clean, as dust, dirt, and sand particles may scratch the surface over time in high-traffic areas.  It is also important to keep laminate relatively dry, since sitting water/moisture can cause the planks to swell, warp, etc., though some brands are equipped with water-resistant coatings. Water spills aren't a problem if they're wiped up quickly, and not allowed to sit for a prolonged period of time.

Adhesive felt pads are often placed on the feet of furniture on laminate floors to prevent scratching.

Inferior glueless laminate floors may gradually become separated, creating visible gaps between planks. It is important to "tap" the planks back together using the appropriate tool as gaps are noticed in order to prevent dirt filling the gaps, thus making it more difficult to put into place.

Quality glueless laminate floors use joining mechanisms which hold the planks together under constant tension which prevent dirt entering the joints and do not need "tapping" back together periodically.

==Advocacy==

The [[North American Laminate Flooring Association]] (NALFA) is a trade association of laminate flooring manufacturers and laminate flooring manufacturer suppliers in the United States and Canada. It is a standards developing organization accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher =ANSI | title =  Domestic Programs (American National Standards) Overview |  url = http://www.ansi.org/standards_activities/domestic_programs/overview.aspx?menuid=3 | accessdate = 3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop voluntary consensus standards for laminate flooring materials, and it has established testing and performance criteria that are used in North America.

NALFA issues a certification mark named the NALFA Certification Seal which signifies that the product has passed 10 performance tests, has been proven to meet these standards by an independent, third-party testing lab, and has been manufactured in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher =New York Times | title =  Under Your Feet |  url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/garden/07fix.html?_r=1 | accessdate = 3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification review includes:
# Static Load – Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist residual indentation resulting from a static load.
# Thickness Swell – Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist increase in thickness after being exposed to water.
# Light Resistance – Measures the ability of laminate flooring to retain its color when exposed to a light source having a frequency range approximating sunlight through window glass. It is not intended to show the resistance to continuous exposure to outdoor weathering conditions.
# Cleanability and Stain Resistance – Measures both the ease of cleanability and stain resistance of laminate flooring to common household substances.
# Large Ball Resistance – Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist fracture due to impact by a large diameter ball.
# Small Ball Resistance – Measures the ability of laminate flooring to resist fracture due to impact by a small diameter ball.
# Water Resistance – Measures the ability of the surface of laminate flooring to resist abrasive wear through the décor layer.
# Dimension Tolerance – Measures the dimensional variance between tiles of laminate flooring in a manufactured free standing (unrestricted) shape in respect to thickness, length, width, straightness and squareness.
# Castor Chair Resistance – Specifies a method for determining the change of appearance and stability of a laminate floor, including joints, under the movement of a [[castor chair]].
# Surface Bond – Measures the force required to delaminate or split away the surface of laminate flooring plank or tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher =NALFA | title =  Performance Testing Standards |  url = http://nalfa.com/ansi_standards.php | accessdate = 3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential health effects and LEED status==
Laminate flooring is often made of [[melamine resin]], a compound made with [[formaldehyde]]. The formaldehyde is more tightly bound in Melamine-Formaldehyde (MF) than it is in [[Urea-Formaldehyde (UF)]], reducing emissions and potential health effects. Thus [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] v2.2's EQ Credit 4.4 precludes the use of UF, but allows the use of MF.

Laminated flooring is commonly used in LEED residential and commercial applications.

==History==

Laminate flooring was invented in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.pergo.co.uk/en-GB/history-laminate-flooring
|title=Pergo: the story of laminate
|author=Pergo
|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by the Swedish company {{illm|Perstorp (company)|sv|Perstorp AB}}, and sold under the brand name Pergo. They had been making floor surfaces since 1923. The company first marketed its product to Europe in 1984, and later to the United States in 1994. Perstorp spun off its flooring division as the separate company named Pergo, now a subsidiary of [[Mohawk Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Mohawk to acquire Pergo for $150 million in cash
|author=Saabira Chaudhuri
|publisher=marketwatch.com
|date=29 October 2012
|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pergo is the most widely known laminate flooring manufacturer, but the trademark [[PERGO]] is not synonymous for all laminate floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Laminate Flooring and Ratings|url=http://blog.finsahome.co.uk/history-laminate-flooring/|website=Finsa Home|accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glueless laminate flooring was invented in 1996 by the Swedish company Välinge Aluminium (now [[Välinge Innovation]]) and sold under the names of Alloc and Fiboloc. However, a system for holding flooring panels together was also developed in parallel by the Belgian company [[Unilin]] released in 1997 and sold under the name of {{illm|Quick-Step flooring|nl|Quick-Step (merknaam)}}.

The two companies have been in a great number of legal conflicts over the years, and today most, if not all glueless locking flooring is made under license from either Välinge, Unilin, or even a combination of both.

Conversely, planes that are ''not'' lattice planes have ''aperiodic'' intersections with the lattice called [[quasicrystal]]s; this is known as a "cut-and-project" construction of a quasicrystal (and is typically also generalized to higher dimensions).&lt;ref&gt;J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3446">A '''liquid dielectric''' is a [[dielectric]] material in liquid state. Its main purpose is to prevent or rapidly quench [[electric discharge]]s. Dielectric liquids are used as [[electrical insulator]]s in [[high voltage]] applications, e.g. [[transformer]]s, [[capacitor]]s, high voltage [[Electrical cable|cable]]s, and [[switchgear]] (namely [[high voltage switchgear]]). Its function is to provide [[electrical insulation]], suppress [[corona discharge|corona]] and [[arcing]], and to serve as a [[coolant]].

A good liquid dielectric should have high [[dielectric strength]], high thermal stability and chemical inertness against the construction materials used, non-flammability and low [[toxicity]], good [[heat transfer]] properties, and low cost.

Liquid dielectrics are self-healing; when an [[electric breakdown]] occurs, the discharge channel does not leave a permanent conductive trace in the fluid.

The electrical properties tend to be strongly influenced by dissolved gases (e.g. [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]], dust, fibers, and especially ionic impurities and [[moisture]]. Electrical discharge may cause production of impurities degrading the dielectric's performance.&lt;ref name="hveng"&gt;{{cite book|title=High Voltage Engineering|author1=Naidu, S.|author2=Kamaraju, V.|date=2009|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill Education Private Limited|isbn=9780070669284|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FGowlP_lKK8C&amp;pg=PA85|page=85|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of dielectric liquids are [[transformer oil]], [[perfluoroalkane]]s, and [[purified water]].

'''Marja-Sisko Aalto''' (born July 29, 1954) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] minister of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. She was the vicar of the [[Imatra]] parish from 1986 to 2010.&lt;ref name="hs1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Juhani Saarinen |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135241007244 |title=Kirkkoherra odotti vuosikymmeniä muutosta miehestä naiseksi - HS.fi - Kotimaa |publisher=HS.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Aalto told the media that she was a [[Transwoman|trans woman]] and was having a [[sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment]] operation. This caused a great controversy in the Church. The bishop of Mikkeli, Voitto Huotari, commented that there is no juridical obstacle for Aalto continuing as a vicar, but that there will be problems.&lt;ref name="hs1"/&gt;

In 2009 almost 600 members left the Imatra parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juhani Saarinen |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135251932118 |title=Lähes 600 imatralaista erosi seurakunnasta - HS.fi - Kotimaa |publisher=HS.fi |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 Aalto returned to the job of vicar after spending a year on leave. In March 2010, she requested to be allowed to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/alueet/etela-karjala/2010/03/marja-sisko_aalto_eroaa_virastaan_1532508.html |title=Marja-Sisko Aalto eroaa virastaan &amp;#124; Yle Uutiset |publisher=yle.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323051748/http://yle.fi/alueet/etela-karjala/2010/03/marja-sisko_aalto_eroaa_virastaan_1532508.html |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merton Street''' is a historic and picturesque [[cobbled street]] in central [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford]] | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | chapter=Merton Street | year=1988 | page=256 | isbn=0-333-39917-X | editor-last=Hibbert |editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Hibbert }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/high/tour/south/merton_street.html Merton Street], [http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/high/ High Street, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt; It joins the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] at its northeastern end, between the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] (together with the [[Examination Schools]]) and the [[Eastgate Hotel]] at the historic east gate of the city. It then runs east-west, parallel and to the south of the High Street for most of its length.

==Location==
[[Merton College]], one of Oxford's older colleges, is situated to the south of the street. To the west of Merton, [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]], one of Oxford's smallest colleges, also fronts onto the street. At the very western end, actually in [[Oriel Square]], is an entrance to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], Oxford's largest college. At the eastern end can be found the notorious 'Pink House', as well as an entrance to [[University College, Oxford|University College]].

[[Logic Lane]] (through University College, which backs onto the street) and [[Magpie Lane, Oxford|Magpie Lane]], both narrow lanes, lead off the street to the north. Also located here is the [[Merton Street tennis court]], a rare example of an extant [[real tennis]] court. To the south is [[Merton Grove]] (opposite Magpie Lane), providing pedestrian access between Merton College and Corpus Christi College to [[Christ Church Meadow]] to the south.

The street is designated the [[A420 road|A420]] due to the blockage of the High Street to normal traffic. To the west it continues through Oriel Square, where [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] is located.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Despite being cobbled, the street has been repaired by [[Oxford City Council]] using [[asphalt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/5197997.Repairs__messing_up__historic_city_ctreet/ | title=Repairs 'messing up' historic city street | first=Dan | last=Heard | date=27 March 2010 | newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] | accessdate=14 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The part of modern-day Merton Street adjoining the High Street used to be known as '''Coach &amp; Horses Lane''', named after a public house on the west side of the lane.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; From the early 18th to the late 19th century, it became known as '''King Street'''.

The rest of the street (the part running east-west) was originally known as '''St John Baptist's Street''', named after the church which is now Merton College's chapel. In 1751, the whole street had become King Street, but by 1772 just the east-west part was called Merton Street. The entire street became known as Merton Street only in the 20th century.

==Notable residents==
[[Siegfried Sassoon]] briefly took rooms in no 14 during 1919, on the recommendation of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Moorcroft Wilson]], ''Siegfried Sassoon: the Journey from the Trenches'' (Duckworth, 2003) {{ISBN|0715633244}} p33&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Michael Brock]] (1920–2014) and his wife (and co-editor) Eleanor lived in the street in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="oxford-mail"&gt;{{cite news| title=Eminent dean and scholar whose historical work is published soon | url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/11227960.Eminent_dean_and_scholar_whose_historical_work_is_published_soon/ | newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] | date=22 May 2014 | accessdate=26 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] had rooms in Merton Street towards the end of his life in the early 1970s.

McKubre still has bits of glass embedded in his side from the cold fusion experiment that exploded that day in his lab (the blast had nothing to do with fusion; hydrogen mixed with oxygen, creating the equivalent of rocket fuel).
}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKubre was the director of the Energy Research Center at  [[SRI International]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/wired25.html?pg=25|title=Michael McKubre &amp; Edmund Storms Give Birth To The Cool|first=Michael|date=November 1998|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=|last2=Storms|first2=Edmund|issue=6.11|author=Wieners}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a native of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Weinberger, 2004"/&gt;

==Career==
From 1989 to 2002, he researched cold fusion at SRI International.&lt;ref name="kuer"/&gt; Unlike other researchers in the same field, he obtained mainstream funding during all his research: first from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]], then from the Japanese government, and in 2002 he had funding from the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="kuer"&gt;Interview of McKubre and Beaudette, by [[KUER-FM]] from [[University of Utah]], [http://audio.kuer.org:8000/file/rw112702.mp3 audio file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324003439/http://audio.kuer.org:8000/file/rw112702.mp3 |date=2005-03-24 }}, 2002-11-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 he and other cold fusion researchers asked the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) to give a new review to the field of cold fusion, and he co-authored a report with all the available experimental and theoretical evidence since the 1989 review. The 2004 review concluded that "while significant progress has been made in the sophistication of [[calorimeter]]s since the review of this subject in 1989, the conclusions reached by the reviewers today are similar to those found in the 1989 review. " &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=U.S. Department of Energy |ref=DOE2004r |year=2004 |title=Report of the Review of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions |location=Washington, DC |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |url=http://www.science.doe.gov/Sub/Newsroom/News_Releases/DOE-SC/2004/low_energy/CF_Final_120104.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226210800/http://www.science.doe.gov/Sub/Newsroom/News_Releases/DOE-SC/2004/low_energy/CF_Final_120104.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, he was still making experiments with palladium cells at SRI International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/201003261|title=Chemistry Roundup|work=[[Science Friday]]|date=2010-03-26|accessdate=2012-02-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304193814/http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/201003261|archivedate=2012-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborates with the [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] laboratory, where the most reliable palladium is being produced.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; McKubre more recently took part as one of the 22 physicists of the [[Steorn]] "jury".

==Personal life==
In January 1992 a cold fusion cell exploded in an SRI lab. One of McKubre's collaborators was killed and three people including McKubre were wounded.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sheldon&gt;{{cite journal

'''Myristamine oxide''' is an [[amine oxide]] based [[zwitterionic]] [[surfactant]] with a C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; (tetradecyl) alkyl tail. It is used as a foam stabilizer and hair conditioning agent in some [[shampoo]]s and [[Hair conditioner|conditioners]]. Like other amine oxide based surfactants it is [[antimicrobial]], being slightly more effective than [[lauryldimethylamine oxide]] against the common bacteria ''S. aureus'' and ''E. coli''.&lt;ref name=birnie /&gt;

[[Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic]] performance monitoring systems serve several purposes. They are used to track trends in a single [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic (PV) system]], to identify faults in or damage to [[Solar panel|solar panels]], to compare the performance of a system to design specifications or to compare PV systems at different locations. This range of applications requires various sensors and monitoring systems, adapted to the intended purpose. Sensors and monitoring systems are standardized in IEC 61724-1&lt;ref name="IEC_61724_1_2017"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/33622|title=IEC 61724-1:2017 – Photovoltaic system performance – Part 1: Monitoring|date=2017|publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC)|edition=1.0|access-date=2018-05-16|orig-year=1998-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825184511/https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/33622|archive-date=2017-08-25|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classified into three levels of accuracy, denoted by the letters “A”, “B” or “C”, or by the labels “High accuracy”, “Medium accuracy” and “Basic accuracy”. For example, Class A is appropriate for large commercial solar plants, while Class C is more appropriate for small residential installations. 

== Irradiance sensors ==
On-site irradiance measurements are an important part of PV performance monitoring systems. Irradiance can be measured in the same orientation as the PV panels, so-called plane of array (POA) measurements, or horizontally, so-called global horizontal irradiance (GHI) measurements. Typical sensors used for such irradiance measurements include thermopile [[Pyranometer|pyranometers]], PV reference devices and [[photodiode]] sensors. To conform to a specific accuracy class, each sensor type must meet a certain set of specifications. These specifications are listed in the table below.

If an irradiance sensor is placed in POA, it must be placed at the same tilt angle as the PV module, either by attaching it to the module itself or with an extra platform or arm at the same tilt level. Checking if the sensor is properly aligned can be done with portable tilt sensors or with an integrated tilt sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hukseflux.com/product/sr30-pyranometer|title=SR30 pyranometer {{!}} compliant with IEC 61724-1 Class A requirements|website=www.hukseflux.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
The standard also specifies a required maintenance schedule per accuracy class. Class C sensors need little to no additional maintenance. Class B sensors need to be re-calibrated every 2 years and require a heater to prevent precipitation or condensation. Class A sensors need to be re-calibrated once per year, require cleaning once per week, require a heater and require ventilation (for thermopile pyranometers).

== Satellite remote sensing of irradiance ==
PV performance can also be estimated by satellite [[remote sensing]]. These measurements are indirect because the satellites measure the solar radiance reflected off the earth surface. In addition, the radiance is filtered by the spectral [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. This method is typically used in non-instrumented class B and class C monitoring systems to avoid costs and maintenance of on-site sensors. If the satellite-derived data is not corrected for local conditions, an error in radiance up to 10% is possible&lt;ref name="IEC_61724_1_2017" /&gt;.

A '''remote manipulator''', also known as a '''telefactor''', '''telemanipulator''', or '''waldo''' (after the short story "[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]" by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] which features a man who invents and uses such devices),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=23 Technovelgy telemanipulator page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a device which, through [[Electronics|electronic]], [[hydraulic]], or [[Machine|mechanical]] linkages, allows a [[hand]]-like mechanism to be controlled by a [[human]] operator. The purpose of such a device is usually to move or manipulate hazardous materials for reasons of [[safety]], similar to the operation and play of a [[claw crane]] game.

==History==
In 1945, the company Central Research Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destaco.com/crl-products-equipment.html CRL history]&lt;/ref&gt; was given the [[contract]] to develop a remote manipulator for the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].  The intent was to replace devices which manipulated highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] materials from above a sealed chamber or [[hot cell]], with a mechanism which operated through the side wall of the chamber, allowing a researcher to stand normally while working.

The result was the '''Master-Slave Manipulator Mk. 8''', or MSM-8, which became the iconic remote manipulator&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destaco.com/telemanipulators.html Telemanipulator page]&lt;/ref&gt; seen in newsreels and movies, such as the ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]'' or ''[[THX 1138]]''.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]] claimed a much earlier origin for remote manipulators.&lt;ref name="CMK"&gt;{{Citation | last=Heinlein | first=Robert A. | author-link=Robert A. Heinlein | chapter=Science fiction: its nature, faults and virtues| date= | year=1957 | editor-last=Davenport | editor-first=Basil | title=The Science Fiction Novel | location=Chicago |publisher=Advent | publication-date=1959| isbn=
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that he got the idea for "waldos" after reading a 1918 article in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' about "a poor fellow afflicted with [[myasthenia gravis]] ... [who] devised complicated lever arrangements to enable him to use what little strength he had."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11548">Renewable energy sources are important for [[Azerbaijan]], however there is lack of practicing renewable energy except hydro energy. One of the alternative sources of energy is the wind energy. It is also best profitable due to the cost, ecological cleanness and its renewable properties compared to other alternative energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/events/2013/ESCC-Meeting-KAZ/005_104_209_Alternative-and-Renewable-Energy-Sources-in-Azerbaijan.pdf|title=Alternative and renewable energy sources in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anl.az/down/meqale/ses/2010/may/120338.htm|title=Alternativ və bərpa olunan enerji mənbələrindən istifadə|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable energy sources in Azerbaijan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/business/101789.html|title=Azerbaijan reveals potential of renewable energy sources|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== Windmills ===
Azerbaijan is one of those countries where windmills could be perfect fit due to geographical location. In particular, the Absheron peninsula, coastline of Caspian Sea and islands in the northwestern part of [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]-[[Dashkasan District|Dashkesan]] zone in the west of Azerbaijan and the Sharur-Julfa area of the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]  are favorable areas. In 1999, Japan's Tomen Company, together with the Azerbaijan Scientific Research Institute of Power Engineering and Energy, installed two towers with 30 and 40 meters in Absheron, average annual wind speed was determined to be 7.9-8.1 m/sec and feasibility study about the installation of windmills with a total capacity of 30 MWt had been prepared in [[Qobustan (town)|Qobustan]] region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Solar panels ===
Solar panel is also one of the most favorable sources in the world, and it is especially promising for sunny areas. The natural climate of Azerbaijan also provides extensive opportunities to increase the production of electricity and thermal energy by utilizing solar energy. Thus, the amount of sunny hours is 2400–3200 hours in Azerbaijan during the year, this means that the amount of solar rays falling on the territory of Azerbaijan is superior compared other countries that can be estimated as one of the efficiency criteria for attracting investments in the use of solar energy. The development of utilization of solar energy can partly solve energy problems in several regions of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Water Energy ===
From ecological point of view, water is the purest energy in the world. The production of electricity from this source is being increased since 1990. The specific weight of production power of hydroelectric power plants is currently 17.8 percent in the total energy system of the Republic. There are wide opportunities for mastering hydropower resources that have not been used so far in the country. As a result of the construction of hydroelectric power plants, floodwater is regulated, electricity is ecologically produced, and new irrigation systems are created. The rivers in the territory of Azerbaijan are favorable for small hydropower stations.

There was no connection between Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's energy system and the main energy system of the Republic, that is why medium, small and micro hydroelectric power stations need to be set up in the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Biomass ===
Biomass is also an alternative source of energy. There are following sources of biomass in Azerbaijan: industrial waste which has ability to burn, wastes from forestry and wood processing field, agricultural crops and organic compounding wastes, wastes of household and communal areas, wastes from polluted areas by oil and oil products.

According to the research, most of the production of waste is composed of biomass products in all sectors of the economy. It is possible to obtain gas, liquid and solid biomass which are used in electricity generation from those biomass substances. Thus, more than 2.0 million tonnes of solid and industrial wastes were thrown to neutralization zones every year in [[Azerbaijan]]. Solid and industrial wastes processing can partially eliminate the difficulties of warming up of public buildings in Baku and major industrial cities of the country.

The underground temperature is widely used in many countries in industry, agriculture, household and communal fields and in medicine. The territory of Azerbaijan is rich of thermal waters. They cover large areas such as the Greater and [[Lesser Caucasus]] Mountains, the [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron peninsula]], the Talysh mountain-slope zone, the Kura basin and territories around the [[Caspian Sea]] and Guba region.  It is possible to cover part of thermal energy needs in household and other areas by utilizing thermal waters in the mentioned areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Thermal energy and Hydroelectric power station ===
There is high potential of alternative energy sources in Azerbaijan, and perspectives on especially the creation of wind, solar, and small hydroelectric power stations: Thermal and Hydroelectric power stations are more important to cover Azerbaijan's energy needs. Statistical data shows that this amount changes between 0.01-0.05 percent on alternative and renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources ==
''Main article:'' [[State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (Azerbaijan)|State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources]]

The [[State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources (Azerbaijan)|State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources]] of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan dated February 1, 2013, for improving the management system in the field of alternative and renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/business/51415.html|title=Azerbaijan aims to boost alternative energy sector|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter of the State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources was approved by the Decree of the Head of State on February 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.president.az/articles.php?item_id=20090716064638302&amp;sec_id=29|title=Official website of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Regulation, the Agency is the central executive body that carries out state policy and its regulation and efficient use of it in the field of alternative and renewable energy in  Azerbaijan, effective organization of activities on alternative and renewable energy sources, coordination of activities in this field and state control.

The Agency participates in the formation of uniform state policy in the relevant area, provides for carrying out of this policy as well as the development of alternative and renewable energy, the creation of infrastructure, the application of alternative and renewable energy in the economy and social sectors, energy production on State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources, to carry out of events related to energy consumption and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.area.gov.az/page/3|title=about Agency|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Annual report ==
In 2014, 1480.0 million kWh of electricity was generated in the country by all renewable energy sources. This, according to estimated calculations, along with saving of 298,5 thousand tons of mazut or 429.2 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas, prevents spreading to the atmosphere 919,400 tonnes or 763,900 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.area.gov.az/public/uploads/Hesabat/Hesabat-2014.pdf|title=2014-cü ildə Azərbaycan Respublikasında alternativ və bərpa olunan enerji və ondan səmərəli istifadə olunması sahəsində görülmüş işlər barədə Dövlət Agentliyinin hesabatı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, 1816.0 million kilowatt/hours of electricity was generated by all alternative and renewable energy sources (21.5 percent more than in the previous year), and 6315.3 percent of thermal energy (15.9 percent more than in the previous year). This has resulted on savings of 464.7 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas on average and, prevents spreading to the atmosphere 827.2 thousand tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Calculated based on “ The method of calculating the amount of gases the thermal effect  spreading to atmosphere” approved by the [[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources]] dated 18.01.2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.area.gov.az/public/uploads/Hesabat/Hesabat-2015.pdf|title=2015-ci ildə Azərbaycan Respublikasında alternativ və bərpa olunan enerji və ondan səmərəli istifadə olunması sahəsində görülmüş işlər barədə Dövlət Agentliyinin hesabatı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to collecting data from the preliminary official statistical and economic subjects, in 2016, 2,141.9 million kilowatt/hours electricity, or 9.3 percent of 23,073.9 million kilowatt/hours of electricity produced by the all sources in country were the total amount of alternative and renewable energy sources. Compared with the previous year, the total production of electricity amounted to 100.8%, and its production on The State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources was 117.1%. 4212.4 Gcal of thermal energy was generated on the State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources, which means an increase of 2.0% compared to the previous year. Efficient utilization of State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources has resulted  548.7 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas savings and, to prevent spreading to the atmosphere 976.7 thousand tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Calculated based on “The method of calculating the amount of gases the thermal effect spreading to atmosphere” approved by the [[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources]] dated 18.01.2006) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.area.gov.az/public/uploads/NK%20hesabat-%202016%20illik.pdf|title=2016-cı ildə Azərbaycan Respublikasında alternativ və bərpa olunan enerji və ondan səmərəli istifadə olunması sahəsində görülmüş işlər barədə Alternativ və Bərpa Olunan Enerji Mənbələri üzrə Dövlət Agentliyinin hesabatı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/meetings/2015/December_9_Baku_SEA_for_the_National_Strategy/SEA_AZ_Draft_Report_2015.pdf|title=“Alternativ və Bərpa olunan Enerji mənbələrindən istifadə üzrə, 2015-2020”Strategiyası|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIMPLE detector is based on [[superheating|superheated]] droplet detectors (SDDs), a suspension of 1–2% superheated liquid C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; droplets (~30&amp;nbsp;μm radius) in a viscoelastic 900&amp;nbsp;ml gel matrix, which undergo transitions to the gas phase upon energy deposition by incident radiation. The [[refrigerant]], [[freon]], is used as the active mass.

In effect, each droplet behaves as a miniature [[bubble chamber]]. Once a [[nucleation]] has occurred, the acoustic shock wave is picked up by microphones. Each acquired signal is then fully discriminated in terms of acoustic external noise, gel-associated noise and most recently [[particle identification|particle discrimination]]. The detectors are typically operated at ~200&amp;nbsp;[[kilopascal|kPa]] and ~280&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]. Due to the construction technique, SSDs are almost insensitive to [[background radiation]], and their sensitivity can be adjusted by controlling the temperature and pressure of each device.

== Results ==
The final phase II analysis was published in Physical Review Letters in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Final Analysis and Results of the Phase II SIMPLE Dark Matter Search|date = 18 May 2012|journal = Phys.

The '''San Gabriel Mountains Regional Conservancy''' (SGMRC) is a regional environmental organization located in the foothill area of the eastern [[San Gabriel Valley]].  It is concerned with the conservation of land, land use planning, publication of studies, watershed management, land management, and education.

SGMRC is currently the only environmental organization focused on: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1)sustainable, regional stakeholder involvement through the [[WIN (Watershed Integrated Network)]] Model; 
(2) the [[Nature Center Network]], including multi-purpose and integrated community outreach for watershed education, including workshops and library/ technology approaches;  and 
(3) the connectivity, sustainability, capacity building model for the [[San Gabriel Valley Conservancies Network]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Greater [[San Gabriel Valley]] is served, between the 14 and 15 Freeways – east/west, and the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] to the [[Puente Hills]] – north/south.  The SGMRC watershed study/plan (''[[Reconnecting the San Gabriel Valley]]'') covered {{convert|640|sqmi|km2}} of the Upper [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] and its tributaries, the largest single watershed study in [[Los Angeles County]].  The Greater [[San Gabriel Valley]] includes almost a third of the population of [[Los Angeles County]].  

The SGMRC was established in 1997 as a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit corporation.

The SGMRC currently operates three nature centers:

*[[Glendora Conservancy Nature Center]]
*[[Santa Fe Dam Nature Center]]
*[[Galster Park Nature Center]]

The '''Sanmen Nuclear Power Station''' ({{zh|c=三门核电站}}) is a [[nuclear power station]] in [[Sanmen County]], [[Zhejiang]], [[China]]. 
Sanmen is the first implementation of the [[AP1000]] [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) developed by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]]. 

==History==

The contract for the plant was agreed in July 2007.&lt;ref name=bwire-20070724/&gt; 
Announcement of the project start came roughly twelve months after Westinghouse won a bidding contest over other companies. The contract for the new plant involved [[The Shaw Group]] (now Chicago Bridge and Iron), a minority shareholder in Westinghouse. Westinghouse is controlled by Japanese [[Toshiba]]. The Shaw Group will provide engineering, procurement, commissioning, information management and project management services.&lt;ref name=bwire-20070724&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070724005653/en/Westinghouse-Shaw-Sign-Historic-Contracts-Provide-AP1000 |title=Westinghouse and Shaw Sign Historic Contracts to Provide Four AP1000 Nuclear Power Plants in China |publisher=Business Wire |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first pair of reactors were estimated to cost more than 40&amp;nbsp;billion [[Renminbi|yuan]] (US$5.88&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/19/content_11217433.htm | title= China starts building 3rd-generation nuclear power reactors using Westinghouse technologies | date= April 19, 2009 |work= | publisher= Xinhua | accessdate= 2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MUSTARD.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Segmented regression|SegReg]] program: yield of mustard ([[colza]]) and soil salinity]]
'''Soil salinity control''' relates to controlling the problem of soil salinity and reclaiming salinized agricultural land.

The aim of soil salinity control is to prevent [[soil degradation]] by [[salination]] and [[land reclamation|reclaim]] already salty (saline) soils. Soil reclamation is also called soil improvement, rehabilitation, remediation, recuperation, or amelioration.

The primary man-made cause of [[Soil salinity|salinization]] is [[irrigation]]. [[river|River water]] or [[groundwater]] used in irrigation contains salts, which remain behind in the soil after the water has [[evaporation|evaporated]].

The primary method of controlling soil salinity is to permit 10-20% of the irrigation water to [[Leaching model|leach]] the soil,that will be drained and discharged through an appropriate [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]]. The salt concentration of the [[Watertable control|drainage water]] is normally 5 to 10 times higher than that of the irrigation water, thus salt export matches salt import and it will not accumulate.

==The soil salinity problem==

[[soil salinity|Salty (saline) soils]] are [[soil]]s that have a high [[salt]] content.  The predominant salt is normally [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl, "table salt"). [[Saline soils]] are therefore also ''sodic soils'' but there may be sodic soils that are not saline, but [[alkaline soils|alkaline]].

According to a study by UN University, about {{convert|62|e6ha|e3sqmi e6acre|abbr=none}}, representing 20% of the world's irrigated lands are affected, up from {{convert|45|e6ha|e3sqmi e6acre|abbr=unit}} in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="physorg102014"/&gt;  In the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], home to over 10% of the world's population, crop yield losses for [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] grown on salt-affected lands could be 40%, 45%, 48%, and 63%, respectively.&lt;ref name="physorg102014"/&gt;

Salty soils are a common feature and an [[Environmental impact of irrigation|environmental problem]] in [[irrigated land]]s in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions, resulting in poor or little crop production.&lt;ref&gt;I.P. Abrol, J.S.P Yadav, and F. Massoud 1988. Salt affected soils and their management, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Soils Bulletin 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The problems are often associated with high [[water table]]s, caused by a lack of natural [[subsurface drainage]] to the underground. Poor subsurface drainage may be caused by insufficient transport capacity of the [[aquifer]] or because water cannot exit the aquifer, for instance if the aquifer is situated in a [[topographical]] depression.

Worldwide, the major factor in the development of saline soils is a lack of precipitation.  Most naturally saline soils are found in [[arid|(semi)arid regions]] and [[semi arid|climates]] of the earth.

===Primary cause===
[[File:Soil Salinity2.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated saline land with poor crop stand]]
The primary cause of man-made salinization is the salt brought in with irrigation water. All irrigation water derived from rivers or groundwater, however 'sweet', contains salts that remain behind in the soil after the water has evaporated.

For example, assuming irrigation water with a low salt concentration of 0.3 g/l (equal to 0.3&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ corresponding to an electric conductivity of about 0.5 FdS/m) and a modest annual supply of irrigation water of 10,000 m³/ha (almost 3&amp;nbsp;mm/day) brings 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg salt/ha each year. In the absence of sufficient natural drainage (as in waterlogged soils) and without a proper leaching and [[drainage]] program to remove salts, this would lead to a high soil salinity and reduced [[crop yield]]s in the long run.

Much of the water used in irrigation has a higher salt content than in this example, which is compounded by the fact that many irrigation projects use a far greater annual supply of water. [[Sugar cane]], for example, needs about 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha of water per year. As a result, irrigated areas often receive more than 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha of salt per year and some receive as much as 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha/year.

===Secondary cause===
The secondary cause of salinization is [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] in irrigated land. Irrigation causes changes to the natural [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of irrigated lands. Large quantities of water in irrigation projects are not consumed by plants and must go somewhere. In irrigation projects it is impossible to achieve 100% irrigation efficiency where all the irrigation water is consumed by the plants. The maximum attainable irrigation efficiency is about 70% but usually it is less than 60%. This means that minimum 30%, but usually more than 40% of the irrigation water is not evaporated and it must go somewhere.

Most of the water lost this way is stored underground which can change the original [[geohydrology|hydrology]] of [[aquifer|local aquifers]] considerably. Many aquifers cannot absorb and transport these quantities of water and so the [[water table]] rises leading to water logging.

Waterlogging causes three problems: 
* The shallow water table and lack of [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] of the root zone reduces the yield of most crops
* It leads to an accumulation of salts brought in with the irrigation water as their removal through the aquifer is blocked
* With the upward [[seepage]] of [[groundwater]] more salts are brought into the soil and the salination is aggravated

Aquifer conditions in irrigated land and the groundwater flow have an important role in soil salinization,&lt;ref name="Balances"&gt;ILRI, 2003.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Salt affected area===
Normally, the salinization of agricultural land affects a considerable area of irrigation projects, on the order of 20 to 30%. When the agriculture in such a fraction of the land is abandoned, a new salt and [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] is attained, a new equilibrium is reached, and the situation becomes stable.

In India alone, thousands of square kilometres have been severely salinized. China and Pakistan do not lag much behind (perhaps China has even more salt affected land than India). A regional distribution of the 3,230,000&amp;nbsp;km² of saline land worldwide is shown in the following table derived from the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World.&lt;ref&gt;R.Brinkman, 1980.

[[File:GOHANA2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[CumFreq]] program: spatial variation of soil salinity]]

===Spatial variation===
Although the principles of the processes of salinization are fairly easy to understand, it is more difficult to explain why certain parts of the land suffer from the problems and other parts do not, or to [[predict]] accurately which part of the land will fall victim. The main reason for this is the variation of natural conditions in time and space, the usually uneven distribution of the irrigation water, and the seasonal or yearly changes of [[agricultural practices]]. Only in lands with undulating [[topography]] is the prediction simple: the depressional areas will degrade the most.

The preparation of salt and water balances&lt;ref name="Balances" /&gt; for distinguishable sub-areas in the [[irrigation]] project, or the use of agro-hydro-salinity models,&lt;ref name="Snellen"&gt;[http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/toolsalt.pdf SaltMod: ''a tool for interweaving of irrigation and drainage for salinity control'']. In: W.B.Snellen (ed.), Towards integration of irrigation, and drainage management. ILRI Special report, p. 41-43. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; can be helpful in explaining or predicting the extent and severity of the problems.

==Diagnosis==

El Guindy, ''Crop yields, watertable depth and soil salinity in the Nile Delta, Egypt''. In: Annual report 1983. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:rice egypt.png|thumb|250px|The rice crop in Egypt has a similar salt tolerance as maize. &lt;ref&gt; On line collection of salt tolerance data of agricultural crops from measurements in farmers' fields [https://www.waterlog.info/croptol.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; ]]

===Measurement===
Soil salinity is measured as the salt [[concentration]] of the soil [[solution]] in tems of g/l or [[electric conductivity]] (EC) in [[Siemens (unit)|dS/m]]. The relation  between these two units is about 5/3 : y g/l =&gt; 5y/3 dS/m. [[Seawater]] may have a salt concentration of 30 g/l (3%) and an EC of 50 dS/m.

The standard for the determination of soil salinity is from an extract of a saturated paste of the soil, and the EC is then written as ECe. The extract is obtained by [[centrifugation]]. The salinity can more easily be measured, without centrifugation, in a 2:1 or 5:1 water:soil mixture (in terms of g water per g dry soil) than from a saturated paste. The relation between ECe and EC&lt;sub&gt;2:1&lt;/sub&gt; is about 4, hence : ECe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;EC&lt;sub&gt;1:2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2003, ''This paper discusses soil salinity''. Lecture notes, International Course on Land Drainage International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/salinity.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Soils are considered saline when the ECe &gt; 4.&lt;ref&gt;L.A.Richards (Ed.), 1954. Diagnosis and improvement of saline and alkali soils. USDA Agricultural Handbook 60. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=10158&amp;page=2 On internet]&lt;/ref&gt; When 4 &lt; ECe &lt; 8, the soil is called slightly saline, when 8 &lt; ECe &lt; 16 it is called (moderately) saline, and when ECe&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;16 severely saline.

===Crop tolerance===
Sensitive crops lose their vigor already in slightly saline soils, most crops are negatively affected by (moderately) saline soils, and only salinity resistant crops thrive in severely saline soils. The University of Wyoming &lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan D. Blaylock, 1994, ''Soil Salinity and Salt tolerance of Horticultural and Landscape Plants. [http://www.wyomingextension.org/agpubs/pubs/WY988.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government of Alberta &lt;ref name="Albert"&gt;Government of Alberta, [http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3303 ''Salt tolerance of Plants'']&lt;/ref&gt; report data on the salt tolerance of plants.

==Principles of salinity control==
[[Drainage system (agriculture)|Drainage]] is the primary method of controlling soil salinity. The system should permit a small fraction of the irrigation water (about 10 to 20 percent, the drainage or leaching fraction) to be drained and discharged out of the irrigation project.
&lt;ref name="Hoorn"&gt;J.W. van Hoorn and J.G. van Alphen (2006), Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (Ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, p. 533-600, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In irrigated areas where salinity is stable, the salt concentration of the drainage water is normally 5 to 10 times higher than that of the irrigation water. Salt export matches salt import and salt will not accumulate.

When reclaiming already salinized soils, the salt concentration of the drainage water will initially be much higher than that of the irrigation water (for example 50 times higher). Salt export will greatly exceed salt import, so that with the same drainage fraction a rapid desalinization occurs. After one or two years, the soil salinity is decreased so much, that the salinity of the drainage water has come down to a normal value and a new, favorable, equilibrium is reached.

In regions with pronounced [[dry season|dry]] and [[wet season]]s, the drainage system may be operated in the wet season only, and closed during the dry season. This practice of checked or controlled drainage saves irrigation water.

The discharge of salty drainage water may pose ''environmental problems'' to downstream areas. The environmental hazards must be considered very carefully and, if necessary mitigating measures must be taken. If possible, the drainage must be limited to wet seasons only, when the salty effluent inflicts the least harm.

==Drainage systems==
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|left|250px|Parameters of a horizontal drainage system]]
[[File:WellDrain2.png|thumb|right|250px|Parameters of a vertical drainage system]]
Land drainage for soil salinity control is usually by ''horizontal drainage system'' (figure left), but ''vertical systems'' (figure right) are also employed.

The drainage system designed to evacuate salty water also lowers the [[water table]]. To reduce the cost of the system, the lowering must be reduced to a minimum. The highest permissible level of the water table (or the shallowest permissible depth) depends on the irrigation and agricultural practices and kind of crops.

In many cases a seasonal average water table depth of 0.6 to 0.8 m is deep enough. This means that the water table may occasionally be less than 0.6 m (say 0.2 m just after an irrigation or a rain storm). This automatically implies that, in other occasions, the water table will be deeper than 0.8 m (say 1.2 m). The fluctuation of the water table helps in the breathing function of the soil while the expulsion of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[plant]] [[root]]s and the inhalation of fresh [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is promoted.

The establishing of a not too deep water table offers the additional advantage that excessive field irrigation is discouraged, as the crop yield would be negatively affected by the resulting elevated water table, and irrigation water may be saved.

The statements made above on the optimum depth of the water table are very general, because in some instances the required water table may be still shallower than indicated (for example in rice paddies), while in other instances it must be considerably deeper (for example in some [[orchard]]s). The establishment of the optimum depth of the water table is in the realm of [[Watertable control|agricultural drainage criteria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Drainage Criteria'', Chapter 17 in: H.P.Ritzema (2006), Drainage Principles and Applications, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}. On line : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/chap17.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soil leaching==
[[File:SoilLeaching2.jpg|thumb|250px|Water balance factors in the soil]]
The [[vadose zone]] of the [[soil]] below the soil surface and the [[watertable]] is subject to four main [[hydrology|hydrological]] inflow and outflow factors:&lt;ref name="Balances" /&gt;
*[[Infiltration (hydrology)|Infiltration]] of rain and [[irrigation]] water (Irr) into the soil through the soil surface (Inf) :
*Inf = Rain + Irr
*[[Evaporation]] of soil water through plants and directly into the air through the soil surface (Evap)
*[[Percolation]] of water from the unsaturated zone soil into the groundwater through the watertable (Perc)
*[[Capillary rise]] of [[groundwater]] moving by capillary suction forces into the unsaturated zone(Cap)
In [[steady state]] (i.e. the amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone does not change in the long run) the [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of the unsaturated zone reads: Inflow = Outflow, thus:
*Inf + Cap = Evap + Perc &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; or :
*Irr + Rain + Cap = Evap + Perc
and the ''salt balance'' is
*Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc = Evap.Fc.Ce + Perc.Cp + Ss
where Ci is the salt [[concentration]] of the irrigation water, Cc is the salt concentration of the capillary rise, equal to the salt concentration of the upper part of the groundwater body, Fc is the fraction of the total evaporation transpired by plants, Ce is the salt concentration of the water taken up by the plant roots, Cp is the salt concentration of the percolation water, and Ss is the increase of salt storage in the unsaturated soil. This assumes that the rainfall contains no salts. Only along the coast this may not be true. Further it is assumed that no [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or surface drainage occurs.&lt;br&gt;
The amount of  removed by plants (Evap.Fc.Ce) is usually negligibly small: Evap.Fc.Ce = 0
[[File:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|250px|Leaching curves, calibrating leaching efficiency]]
The salt concentration Cp can be taken as a part of the salt concentration of the soil in the unsaturated zone (Cu) giving: Cp=Le.Cu, where Le is the [[Leaching model|leaching efficiency]]. The leaching efficiency is often in the order of 0.7 to 0.8,&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan and M.A.Senna, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict drainage and salinity control in the Nile delta. In: Annual Report 1989, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands, p. 63-74. See ''Case Study Egypt'' in the SaltMod manual : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/saltmod.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but in poorly [[soil structure|structured]], heavy [[clay]] soils it may be less. In the Leziria Grande polder in the delta of the Tagus river in Portugal it was found that the leaching efficiency was only 0.15.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Vanegas Chacon, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict desalinization in the Leziria Grande Polder, Portugal. Thesis. Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Assuming that one wishes to avoid the soil salinity to increase and maintain the soil salinity Cu at a desired level Cd we have: &lt;br&gt;
Ss = 0, Cu = Cd and Cp = Le.Cd. Hence the salt balance can be simplified to:
*Perc.Le.Cd = Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc
Setting the amount percolation water required to fulfill this salt balance equal to Lr (the ''leaching requirement'')
it is found that:
*Lr = (Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc) / Le.Cd .
Substituting herein Irr = Evap + Perc &amp;minus; Rain &amp;minus; Cap and re-arranging gives :
*Lr = [ (Evap&amp;minus;Rain).Ci + Cap(Cc&amp;minus;Ci) ] / (Le.Cd &amp;minus; Ci) &lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt;
With this the irrigation and drainage requirements for salinity control can be computed too.&lt;br&gt;
In irrigation projects in [[arid|(semi)arid zones]] and [[semi arid|climates]] it is important to check the leaching requirement, whereby the ''field irrigation efficiency'' (indicating the fraction of irrigation water percolating to the underground) is to be taken into account.&lt;br&gt;
The desired soil salinity level Cd depends on the crop tolerance to salt. The [[University of Wyoming]],&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt; USA, and the [[Government of Alberta]],&lt;ref name= "Albert" /&gt; Canada, report crop tolerance data.

==Strip cropping: an alternative==
[[File:StripCropping.jpg|thumb|250px|Hydrological principles of ''strip cropping'' to control the depth of the water table and the soil salinity]]
In irrigated lands with scarce water resources suffering from drainage (high water table) and soil salinity problems, [[strip cropping]] is sometimes practiced with strips of land where every other strip is irrigated while the strips in between are left permanently [[fallow]].&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2000.  ''Irrigation, groundwater, drainage and soil salinity control in the alluvial fan of Garmsar''. Consultancy assignment to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/garmsar.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the water application in the irrigated strips they have a higher [[watertable]] which induces [[Groundwater|flow of groundwater]] to the unirrigated strips. This flow functions as subsurface drainage for the irrigated strips, whereby the water table is maintained at a not-too-shallow depth, [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of the soil is possible, and the soil salinity can be controlled at an acceptably low level.

In the unirrigated (sacrificial) strips the soil is dry and the groundwater comes up by [[capillary rise]] and evaporates leaving the salts behind, so that here the soil salinizes. Nevertheless, they can have some use for [[livestock]], sowing salinity resistant [[grasses]] or [[weed]]s. Moreover, useful salt resistant trees can be planted like [[Casuarina]], [[Eucalyptus]] or [[Atriplex]], keeping in mind that the trees have deep rooting systems and the salinity of the wet subsoil is less than of the topsoil. In these ways [[wind erosion]] can be controlled. The unirrigated strips can also be used for [[salt]] harvesting.

==Soil salinity models==
{{Expand section|date=October 2007}}
[[File:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|250px|SaltMod components]]
The majority of the computer models available for water and solute transport in the soil (e.g. SWAP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swap.alterra.nl/ SWAP model]&lt;/ref&gt; DrainMod-S,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod/models.html DrainMod-S model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025223837/http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod/models.html |date=2008-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UnSatChem,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8966 UnSatChem model]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hydrus (software)|Hydrus]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc-progress.com/en/default.aspx?hydrus-3d Hydrus model]&lt;/ref&gt; ) are based on Richard's [[differential equation]] for the movement of water in unsaturated soil in combination with Fick's differential [[convection–diffusion equation]] for [[advection]] and [[Fick's laws of diffusion|dispersion]] of salts.

The models require input of soil characteristics like the relations between variable unsaturated [[soil moisture]] content, water tension, [[water retention curve]], unsaturated [[hydraulic conductivity]], dispersivity and [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]. These relations vary to a great extent from place to place and from time to time and are not easy to measure. Further, the models are difficult to [[calibration|calibrate]] under farmer's field conditions because the soil salinity here is spatially very variable. The models use short time steps and need at least a daily, if not an hourly, data base of [[hydrology|hydrological]] phenomena. Altogether this makes model application to a fairly large [[project]] the job of a team of specialists with ample facilities.

Simpler models, like [[SaltMod]],&lt;ref name="Snellen" /&gt; based on monthly or seasonal water and soil balances and an empirical capillary rise function, are also available. They are useful for long-term salinity predictions in relation to [[irrigation]] and [[drainage]] practices.

LeachMod,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterlog.info/leachmod.htm LeachMod]&lt;/ref&gt; using the SaltMod principles, helps in analyzing leaching experiments in which the soil salinity was monitored in various root zone layers while the model will optimize the value of the leaching efficiency of each layer so that a fit is obtained of observed with simulated soil salinity values.

Spatial variations owing to variations in [[topography]] can be simulated and predicted using salinity cum [[groundwater model]]s, like [[SahysMod]].

==Design and development==
Freddie To was a member of the [[Kremer prize]] committee who started his own project to produce a [[human-powered aircraft]] to compete for the prize. Its structure comprised a wooden frame covered with heat-shrunk [[Solarfilm]] [[model aircraft]] film. The wing was built in three sections, a centre section and two outer wing panels to simply storage and transport. The wing [[spar (aviation)|spar]] is a laminated [[spruce]] girder box-spar design. The tail surfaces are quickly removable for storage.&lt;ref name="flightglobal" /&gt; The resulting aircraft, at {{convert|230|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, proved too heavy for human-powered flight and so To converted it to solar power.

A nose-mounted pod powerplant was installed consisting of four {{convert|1|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} permanent magnet 36 V [[Direct current|DC]], 12 A Bosch electric motors, powered by a {{convert|65|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} [[Nickel-cadmium battery]] pack of 24 cells with a total capacity of 25 AH, connected in series to give a maximum (open-circuit) output voltage of approximately 29 V. The motors drive a {{convert|63|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} two-bladed propeller via a 3:1 bicycle-chain reduction gear. The propeller turns at a maximum of 1,100 rpm, decreasing with battery discharge. Power is controlled with a simple on/off switch. 

To recharge the batteries, 750 solar cells of 3 inch diameter were installed at a cost of £6,000. At that time solar cells were very expensive. They were the most costly part of the aircraft and had to be limited in capacity to remain within the project budget of [[Pound sterling|£]]16,000.&lt;ref name="flightglobal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astroflight" /&gt;

The output from the solar cells is not sufficient to sustain flight. Before flight they are used to charge the batteries. The batteries then provide power for takeoff and initial climb. The installed batteries provide for a climb of eight minutes plus a two-minute cruise allowance.&lt;ref name="flightglobal" /&gt;

==Operational history==
The first flight attempt took place at [[Lasham Airfield]], [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom]] on 19 December 1978. The propeller pitch was incorrectly set and the attempt achieved only a short hop. At the hands of pilot Ken Stewart, a successful flight took place on 13 June 1979, covering just under {{convert|0.75|mi|km|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="flightglobal" /&gt; The aircraft lifted off at {{convert|18|to|20|kn|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and reached {{convert|35|kn|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in height. A second flight on the same day by Bill Maidment achieved a speed of {{convert|42|kn|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. All flights were made on battery power that had been supplied on the ground from the installed solar cells.&lt;ref name="flightglobal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astroflight" /&gt;

A planned flight across the [[English Channel]] was abandoned when it was found that the aircraft did not meet its endurance targets.&lt;ref name="astroflight" /&gt;

[[File:3D coordinate system.svg|thumb|right|A right-handed three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] used to indicate positions in space.&lt;!--(See diagram description for needed correction.)--&gt;]]
'''Space''' is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which [[Physical body|objects]] and events have relative position and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068962/space|title=Space – Physics and Metaphysics|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical space is often conceived in three [[linear]] [[dimension]]s, although modern [[physics|physicists]] usually consider it, with [[time]], to be part of a boundless four-dimensional [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] known as [[spacetime]]. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical [[universe]]. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a [[conceptual framework]].

Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' of [[Plato]], or [[Socrates]] in his reflections on what the Greeks called ''[[khôra]]'' (i.e. "space"), or in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of ''topos'' (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space ''qua'' extension" in the ''Discourse on Place'' (''Qawl fi al-Makan'') of the 11th-century Arab polymath [[Alhazen]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to Plato's ''Timaeus'' in the Loeb Classical Library, [[Harvard University]], and to his reflections on ''khora''. See also Aristotle's ''Physics'', Book IV, Chapter 5, on the definition of ''topos''. Concerning Ibn al-Haytham's 11th century conception of "geometrical place" as "spatial extension", which is akin to [[Descartes]]' and Leibniz's 17th century notions of ''extensio'' and ''analysis situs'', and his own mathematical refutation of Aristotle's definition of ''topos'' in natural philosophy, refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]), Vol. 17 (2007), pp. 57–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the [[Renaissance]] and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of [[classical mechanics]]. In [[Isaac Newton]]'s view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.&lt;ref&gt;French, A. J.; Ebison, M. G. (1986). ''Introduction to Classical Mechanics''. Dordrecht: Springer, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[natural philosopher]]s, notably [[Gottfried Leibniz]], thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their [[distance]] and [[direction (geometry)|direction]] from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian [[George Berkeley]] attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision''. Later, the [[metaphysic]]ian [[Immanuel Kant]] said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' as being a subjective "pure ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' form of intuition".

In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], in which space is conceived as ''curved'', rather than ''flat''. According to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], space around [[gravitational field]]s deviates from Euclidean space.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1995). ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. New York: Dove. (Original edition: ''Philosophical Foundations of Physics''. New York: Basic books, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[tests of general relativity]] have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.

== Philosophy of space ==

=== Galilei ===
[[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] theories about space, matter and motion are at the foundation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], which is understood to have culminated with the publication of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in 1687.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42855123|title=Space from Zeno to Einstein : classic readings with a contemporary commentary|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|others=Huggett, Nick.|isbn=058505570X|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=42855123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the most influential in Physics, it emerged from his predecessors' ideas about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janiak|first=Andrew|year=2015|title=Space and Motion in Nature and Scripture: Galileo, Descartes, Newton|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|volume=51|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the pioneers of [[modern science]], Galilei revised the established [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] ideas about a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] cosmos. He backed the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that the universe was [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]], with a stationary sun at the center and the planets—including the Earth—revolving around the sun. If the Earth moved, the Aristotelian belief that its natural tendency was to remain at rest was in question. Galilei wanted to prove instead that the sun moved around its axis, that motion was as natural to an object as the state of rest. In other words, for Galilei, celestial bodies, including the Earth, were naturally inclined to move in circles. This view displaced another Aristotelian idea—that all objects gravitated towards their designated natural place-of-belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47691120|title=Time and space|last=1958–|first=Dainton, Barry,|date=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773523022|location=Montreal|oclc=47691120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== René Descartes ===
[[René Descartes|Descartes]] set out to replace the Aristotelian worldview with a theory about space and motion as determined by [[natural law]]s. In other words, he sought a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundation or a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] explanation for his theories about matter and motion. [[Cartesian space]] was [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] in structure—infinite, uniform and flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and Space|last=Dainton|first=Barry|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined as that which contained matter; conversely, matter by definition had a spatial extension so that there was no such thing as empty space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Cartesian notion of space is closely linked to his theories about the nature of the body, mind and matter.  He is famously known for his "cogito ergo sum" (I think therefore I am), or the idea that we can only be certain of the fact that we can doubt, and therefore think and therefore exist. His theories belong to the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition, which attributes knowledge about the world to our ability to think rather than to our experiences, as the [[Empiricism|empiricists]] believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/428970574|title=Descartes : a very short introduction|last=Tom.|first=Sorell,|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191540363|location=Oxford|oclc=428970574}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited a clear distinction between the body and mind, which is referred to as the [[Mind–body dualism|Cartesian dualism]].

=== Leibniz and Newton ===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]|upright|thumb]]
Following Galilei and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the [[philosophy of space and time]] revolved around the ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], a German philosopher-mathematician, and [[Isaac Newton]], who set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places taken together".&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Fifth letter to Samuel Clarke. By H. G. Alexander (1956). ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 55–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Unoccupied regions are those that ''could'' have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised [[abstraction]] from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be [[continuous probability distribution|continuous]] but must be [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]].&lt;ref&gt;Vailati, E. (1997). ''Leibniz &amp; Clarke: A Study of Their Correspondence''. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. (1992). ''Philosophy of Physics''. Boulder: Westview Press, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the [[identity of indiscernibles]], there would be no real difference between them. According to the [[principle of sufficient reason]], any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|[[Isaac Newton]]|upright|thumb]]
Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on [[observation]] and experimentation. For a [[Relational theory|relationist]] there can be no real difference between [[inertial frame of reference|inertial motion]], in which the object travels with constant [[velocity]], and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial motion]], in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates [[force]]s, it must be absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the example of [[Bucket argument|water in a spinning bucket]] to demonstrate his argument. Water in a [[bucket]] is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Newton_bucket.html|title=Newton's bucket|work=st-and.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.

=== Kant ===
[[Image:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
In the eighteenth century the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed a theory of [[knowledge]] in which knowledge about space can be both ''a priori'' and ''[[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, knowledge about space is ''synthetic'', in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=John Randolph |authorlink=John Lucas (philosopher) |title= Space, Time and Causality |page=149 |isbn=0-19-875057-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===
{{main|Non-Euclidean geometry}}

[[Image:Sphere closed path.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Spherical geometry]] is similar to [[elliptical geometry]]. On a [[sphere]] (the [[Surface (topology)|surface]] of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) there are no [[parallel line]]s.]]Euclid's ''Elements'' contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the [[parallel postulate]], has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] on which there is a straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a point ''P'' not on ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', there is exactly one straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the plane that passes through the point ''P'' and is parallel to the straight line ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1830 though, the Hungarian [[János Bolyai]] and the Russian [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called [[hyperbolic geometry]]. In this geometry, an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parallel lines pass through the point ''P''. Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180° and the ratio of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]] is greater than [[pi]]. In the 1850s, [[Bernhard Riemann]] developed an equivalent theory of [[elliptical geometry]], in which no parallel lines pass through ''P''. In this geometry, triangles have more than 180° and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than [[pi]].

=== Gauss and Poincaré ===
[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]]]
[[Image:Young Poincare.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Henri Poincaré]]]]

Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time, once non-Euclidean geometries had been formalised, some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], a German mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space. He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle, and there are reports that he actually carried out a test, on a small scale, by [[triangulation|triangulating]] mountain tops in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]], a French mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century, introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Jammer, Max (1954). ''Concepts of Space. The History of Theories of Space in Physics''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties, known as a [[sphere-world]]. In this world, the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere. With a suitable falloff in temperature, if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle, they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane, rather than a spherical surface.&lt;ref&gt;A medium with a variable index of refraction could also be used to bend the path of light and again deceive the scientists if they attempt to use light to map out their geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and, Poincaré argued, the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not. For him, which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of [[Conventionalism|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science''. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Euclidean geometry]] is simpler than non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed the former would always be used to describe the 'true' geometry of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Einstein ===
[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]]]]
In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published his [[special theory of relativity]], which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as ''[[spacetime]]''. In this theory, the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers—which has [[relativity of simultaneity|the result]] that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to [[time dilation|tick more slowly]] than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are measured [[length contraction|to be shortened]] in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.

Subsequently, Einstein worked on a [[general theory of relativity]], which is a theory of how [[gravity]] interacts with spacetime. Instead of viewing gravity as a [[Force field (physics)|force field]] acting in spacetime, Einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sklar, L. ''Philosophy of Physics''. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the general theory, time [[gravitational time dilation|goes more slowly]] at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. Scientists have studied the behaviour of [[binary pulsar]]s, confirming the predictions of Einstein's theories, and non-Euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime.

== Mathematics ==
{{main|Three-dimensional space}}
{{distinguish|Space (mathematics)}}
In modern mathematics [[Mathematical space|spaces]] are defined as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] with some added structure. They are frequently described as different types of [[manifold]]s, which are spaces that locally approximate to Euclidean space, and where the properties are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the manifold. There are however, many diverse mathematical objects that are called spaces. For example, [[vector space]]s such as [[function space]]s may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different from Euclidean space, and [[topological space]]s replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness.

== Physics ==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
Space is one of the few [[fundamental quantity|fundamental quantities]] in [[physics]], meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present. On the other hand, it can be related to other fundamental quantities. Thus, similar to other fundamental quantities (like time and [[mass]]), space can be explored via [[measurement]] and experiment.

Today, our [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] space is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional [[spacetime]], called [[Minkowski space]] (see [[special relativity]]).  The idea behind space-time is that time is [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to each of the three spatial dimensions.

=== Relativity ===
{{main|Theory of relativity}}
Before [[Einstein]]'s work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein's discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–[[spacetime]]. It turns out that distances in [[Spacetime#Space-like interval|space]] or in [[Spacetime#Time-like interval|time]] separately are not invariant with respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space-time along [[space-time interval]]s are—which justifies the name.

In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space-time. One can freely move in space but not in time. Thus, time and space coordinates are treated differently both in [[special relativity]] (where time is sometimes considered an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] coordinate) and in [[general relativity]] (where different signs are assigned to time and space components of [[spacetime]] [[metric tensor|metric]]).

Furthermore, in [[Einstein's general theory of relativity]], it is postulated that space-time is geometrically distorted- ''curved'' -near to gravitationally significant masses.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John A. ''A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime''. Chapters 8 and 9, [[Scientific American]], {{ISBN|0-7167-6034-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of this postulate, which follows from the equations of general relativity, is the prediction of moving ripples of space-time, called [[gravitational wave]]s. While indirect evidence for these waves has been found (in the motions of the [[Hulse–Taylor binary]] system, for example) experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations. LIGO scientists reported the [[first observation of gravitational waves|first such direct observation of gravitational waves]] on 14 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castelvecchi|first1=Davide|last2=Witze|first2=Alexandra|title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=Nature News|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL"&gt;{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys.

=== Cosmology ===
{{main|Shape of the universe}}
Relativity theory leads to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] question of what shape the universe is, and where space came from. It appears that space was created in the [[Big Bang]], 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Cosmic Detectives
|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cosmic_detectives

|accessdate = 26 April 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and has been expanding ever since. The overall shape of space is not known, but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]].

== Spatial measurement ==
{{main|Measurement}}
The measurement of ''physical space'' has long been important. Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the [[SI|International System of Units]], (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used.

Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the [[speed of light|distance traveled by light in a vacuum]] during a time interval of exactly 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the [[special theory of relativity]] in which the [[speed of light]] plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature.

== Geographical space ==
{{See also|Spatial analysis}}

[[Geography]] is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing places on [[Earth]], utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations. [[Cartography]] is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device. [[Geostatistics]] apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data of Earth to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena.

Geographical space is often considered as land, and can have a relation to [[ownership]] usage (in which space is seen as [[property]] or territory). While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership, other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership, while still other cultures such as [[Australian Aboriginals]], rather than asserting ownership rights to land, invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land. [[Spatial planning]] is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level, with decisions made at regional, national and international levels. Space can also impact on human and cultural behavior, being an important factor in architecture, where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures, and on farming.

Ownership of space is not restricted to land. Ownership of [[airspace]] and of [[International waters|waters]] is decided internationally. Other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spaces—for example to the radio bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] or to [[cyberspace]].

[[Public space]] is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community, and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all, while [[private property]] is the land culturally owned by an individual or company, for their own use and pleasure.

[[Abstract space]] is a term used in [[geography]] to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity. When modeling activity or behavior, it is a conceptual tool used to limit [[extraneous variables]] such as terrain.

== In psychology ==
Psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century. Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of [[psychology]]. Psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an object's physical appearance or its interactions are perceived, see, for example, [[visual space]].

Other, more specialized topics studied include [[amodal perception]] and [[object permanence]]. The [[perception]] of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival, especially with regards to [[hunting]] and [[self preservation]] as well as simply one's idea of [[personal space]].

Several space-related [[phobia]]s have been identified, including [[agoraphobia]] (the fear of open spaces), [[wikt:astrophobia|astrophobia]] (the fear of celestial space) and [[claustrophobia]] (the fear of enclosed spaces).

The understanding of three-dimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using [[visual perception#Unconscious inference|unconscious inference]], and is closely related to [[hand-eye coordination]]. The visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions is called [[depth perception]].

== In the Social Sciences ==
Space has been studied in the social sciences from the perspectives of [[Marxism]], [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[urban theory]] and [[critical geography]]. These theories account for the effect of the history of colonialism, transatlantic slavery and globalization on our understanding and experience of space and place. The topic has garnered attention since the 1980s, after the publication of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s ''The Production of Space .'' In this book, Lefebvre applies Marxist ideas about the production of commodities and accumulation of capital to discuss space as a social product. His focus is on the multiple and overlapping social processes that produce space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henri Lefebvre on Space : Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory.|last=Stanek|first=Lukasz|publisher=Univ of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Condition of Postmodernity,'' [[David Harvey]] describes what he terms the "[[time-space compression]]." This is the effect of technological advances and capitalism on our perception of time, space and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0025.xml|title=Time-Space Compression – Geography – Oxford Bibliographies – obo|access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the modes of production and consumption of capital affect and are affected by developments in transportation and technology. These advances create relationships across time and space, new markets and groups of wealthy elites in urban centers, all of which annihilate distances and affect our perception of linearity and distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spaces of Capital : Towards a Critical Geography|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Thirdspace,'' [[Edward Soja]] describes space and spatiality as an integral and neglected aspect of what he calls the "[[trialectics of being]]," the three modes that determine how we inhabit, experience and understand the world. He argues that critical theories in the Humanities and Social Sciences study the historical and social dimensions of our lived experience, neglecting the spatial dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33863376|title=Thirdspace : journeys to Los Angeles and other real-and-imagined places|last=W.|first=Soja, Edward|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1557866740|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=33863376}}&lt;/ref&gt; He builds on Henri Lefebvre's work to address the dualistic way in which humans understand space—as either material/physical or as represented/imagined. Lefebvre's "lived space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22624721|title=The production of space|last=1901–1991.|first=Lefebvre, Henri,|date=1991|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631140484|location=Oxford, OX, UK|oclc=22624721}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soja's "thridspace" are terms that account for the complex ways in which humans understand and navigate place, which "firstspace" and "Secondspace" (Soja's terms for material and imagined spaces respectively) do not fully encompass.

[[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]]'s concept of [[Third Space Theory|Third Space]] is different from Soja's Thirdspace, even though both terms offer a way to think outside the terms of a [[Binary opposition|binary]] logic. Bhabha's Third Space is the space in which hybrid cultural forms and identities exist. In his theories, the term [[Hybridity|hybrid]] describes new cultural forms that emerge through the interaction between colonizer and colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/824119565|title=Postcolonial studies : the key concepts|last=1946–|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943–, Tiffin, Helen., Ashcroft, Bill, 1946–|isbn=9780415661904|edition= Third|location=London|oclc=824119565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angular velocity of the workpiece (rev/min) is called the "&lt;span style="color:#1e90ff;"&gt;spindle speed&lt;/span&gt;" by machinists. Its tangential linear equivalent at the workpiece surface (m/min or [[w:surface feet per minute|sfm]]) is called the "&lt;span style="color:#0000cd;"&gt;cutting speed&lt;/span&gt;", "&lt;span style="color:#0000cd;"&gt;surface speed&lt;/span&gt;", or simply the "&lt;span style="color:#0000cd;"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;" by machinists. The "feeds" may be for &lt;span style="color:purple;"&gt;the X-axis&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="color:#EE82EE;"&gt;the Z-axis&lt;/span&gt; (typically mm/rev or inch/rev for lathe work; sometimes measured as mm/min or inch/min). Notice that as the tool plunges closer to the workpiece's center, the ''same'' spindle speed will yield a ''decreasing'' surface (cutting) speed (because each rev represents a smaller [[circumference|circumferential]] distance, but takes the same amount of time). Most [[CNC]] lathes have [[w:G-code#G96|constant surface speed]] to counteract that natural decrease, which speeds up the spindle as the tool plunges in.]]
[[File:StimUmfangsfraesen2B.png|thumb|Milling cutter paused after taking a cut. Arrows show the vectors of various velocities collectively known as speeds and feeds. The circular arrow represents the angular velocity of the spindle (rev/min), called the "spindle speed" by machinists. The tangential arrow represents the tangential linear velocity (m/min or [[w:surface feet per minute|sfm]]) at the outer diameter of the cutter, called the "cutting speed", "surface speed", or simply the "speed" by machinists. The arrow colinear with the slot that has been milled represents the linear velocity at which the cutter is advanced laterally (usually mm/min or inch/min for milling; may also be measured as mm/rev or inch/rev). This velocity is called the "feed" by machinists.]]

The phrase '''speeds and feeds''' or '''feeds and speeds''' refers to two separate [[Velocity|velocities]] in [[machine tool]] practice, '''cutting speed''' and '''feed rate'''. They are often considered as a pair because of their combined effect on the cutting process. Each, however, can also be considered and analyzed in its own right.

''Cutting speed'' (also called ''surface speed'' or simply ''speed'') is the speed difference ([[relative velocity]]) between the [[Cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]] and the surface of the workpiece it is operating on. It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time, typically [[surface feet per minute]] (sfm) or [[meter]]s per [[minute]] (m/min).{{sfn|Smid|2008|pp=74,85–90}} ''Feed rate'' (also often styled as a [[Compound (linguistics)|solid compound]], ''feedrate'', or called simply ''feed'') is the relative velocity at which the cutter is advanced along the workpiece; its vector is [[perpendicular]] to the vector of cutting speed. Feed rate units depend on the motion of the tool and workpiece; when the workpiece rotates (''e.g.'', in [[turning]] and [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]]), the units are almost always distance per [[Spindle (tool)|spindle]] revolution (inches per revolution [in/rev or ipr] or millimeters per revolution [mm/rev]).{{sfn|Smid|2008|pp=74,91–92}} When the workpiece does not rotate (''e.g.'', in [[Milling machine|milling]]), the units are typically distance per time (inches per minute [in/min or ipm] or millimeters per minute [mm/min]), although distance per revolution or per cutter tooth are also sometimes used.{{sfn|Smid|2008|pp=74,91–92}}

If variables such as cutter geometry and the rigidity of the machine tool and its tooling setup could be ideally maximized (and reduced to negligible constants), then only a lack of [[Power (physics)|power]] (that is, kilowatts or horsepower) available to the [[Spindle (tool)|spindle]] would prevent the use of the maximum possible speeds and feeds for any given workpiece material and cutter material. Of course, in reality those other variables are dynamic and not negligible; but there is still a correlation between power available and feeds and speeds employed. In practice, lack of rigidity is usually the limiting constraint.

The phrases "speeds and feeds" or "feeds and speeds" have sometimes been used [[metaphor]]ically to refer to the execution details of a plan, which only skilled technicians (as opposed to designers or managers) would know.

== Cutting speed ==
Cutting speed  may be defined as the rate  at the workpiece surface, irrespective of the machining operation used. A cutting speed for mild steel of 100&amp;nbsp;ft/min  is the same whether it is the speed of the  cutter passing over the  workpiece, such as in a turning operation, or the speed of the  cutter moving past a  workpiece, such as in a milling operation. The cutting conditions will affect the value of this surface speed for mild steel.

Schematically, speed at the workpiece surface can be thought of as the [[tangent]]ial speed at the tool-cutter interface, that is, how fast the material moves past the cutting edge of the tool, although "which surface to focus on" is a topic with several valid answers. In drilling and milling, the outside diameter of the tool is the widely agreed surface. In turning and boring, the surface can be defined on either side of the depth of cut, that is, either the starting surface or the ending surface, with neither definition being "wrong" as long as the people involved understand the difference. An experienced machinist summed this up succinctly as "the diameter I am turning from" versus "the diameter I am turning to."&lt;ref name="Gosselin_2016-05"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gosselin |first=Jim |year=2016 |title=Calculating surface footage and RPMstscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the "from", not the "to", and explains why, while acknowledging that some others do not. The logic of focusing on the largest diameter involved (OD of drill or end mill, starting diameter of turned workpiece) is that this is where the highest tangential speed is, with the most heat generation, which is the main driver of [[tool wear]].&lt;ref name="Gosselin_2016-05"/&gt;

There will be an optimum cutting speed for each material and set of machining conditions, and the spindle speed ([[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]) can be calculated from this speed. Factors affecting the calculation of cutting speed are:

* The material being machined (steel, brass, tool steel, plastic, wood) (see table below)
* The material the cutter is made from ([[Carbon steel]], [[high speed steel]] (HSS), [[tungsten carbide|carbide]], [[ceramic]]s)
* The economical life of the cutter (the cost to regrind or purchase new, compared to the quantity of parts produced)

Cutting speeds are calculated on the assumption that optimum cutting conditions exist. These include:

* Metal removal rate (finishing cuts that remove a small amount of material may be run at increased speeds)
* Full and constant flow of [[cutting fluid]] (adequate cooling and chip flushing)
* Rigidity of the machine and tooling setup (reduction in vibration or chatter)
* Continuity of cut (as compared to an ''interrupted cut'', such as machining square section material in a lathe)
* Condition of material (mill scale, hard spots due to [[white cast iron]] forming in castings)

The cutting ''speed'' is given as a set of constants that are available from the material manufacturer or supplier. The most common materials are available in reference books or charts, but will always be subject to adjustment depending on the cutting conditions. The following table gives the cutting speeds for a selection of common materials under one set of conditions. The conditions are a tool life of 1 hour, dry cutting (no coolant), and at medium feeds, so they may appear to be incorrect depending on circumstances. These cutting speeds may change if, for instance, adequate coolant is available or an improved grade of HSS is used (such as one that includes [[cobalt]]).

=== Machinability rating ===
{{Main|Machinability}}The machinability rating of a material attempts to quantify the machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized value]]. The [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI) determined machinability ratings for a wide variety of materials by running turning tests at 180 [[surface feet per minute]] (sfpm). It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%. The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighed averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and tool life for each material. Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material and a value more than 100% would be easier.

Machinability ratings can be used in conjunction with the [[Tool wear#Tool Life Expectancy|Taylor tool life equation]], {{math|1=''VT&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''C''}} in order to determine cutting speeds or tool life. It is known that B1112 has a tool life of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that in order to maintain the same tool life (60 minutes), the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).

When calculating for copper alloys, the machine rating is arrived at by assuming the 100 rating of 600 SFM. For example, phosphorus bronze (grades A–D) has a machinability rating of 20. This means that phosphor bronze runs at 20% the speed of 600 SFM or 120 SFM. However, 165 SFM is generally accepted as the basic 100% rating for "grading steels".{{sfn|Brown &amp; Sharpe 2|pp=120, 224, 225}}

== Spindle speed ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
The '''spindle speed''' is the rotational frequency of the spindle of the machine, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). The preferred speed is determined by working backward from the desired surface speed (sfm or m/min) and incorporating the diameter (of workpiece or cutter).

The spindle may hold the:
* Material (as in a [[screw machine (automatic lathe)|screw machine]])
* [[Drill bit]] in a [[drill]]
* [[Milling cutter]] in a milling machine
* Router bit in a [[wood router]]
* Shaper cutter or knife in a [[wood shaper]] or spindle moulder
* [[Grinding wheel]] on a [[grinding machine]].
* Or it may hold the [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]], which then holds the workpiece in a [[Lathe (metal)|lathe]]. In these cases the tool is often a stationary [[tool bit]], although there are plenty of exceptions, such as in [[Threading (manufacturing)#Thread milling|thread milling]].

Excessive spindle speed will cause premature tool wear, breakages, and can cause tool chatter, all of which can lead to potentially dangerous conditions. Using the correct spindle speed for the material and tools will greatly enhance tool life and the quality of the surface finish.

For a given machining operation, the cutting speed will remain constant for most situations; therefore the spindle speed will also remain constant. However, facing, forming, parting off, and recess operations on a lathe or screw machine involve the machining of a constantly changing diameter. Ideally this means changing the spindle speed as the cut advances across the face of the workpiece, producing constant surface speed (CSS). Mechanical arrangements to effect CSS have existed for centuries, but they were never applied commonly to machine tool control. In the pre-[[CNC]] era, the ideal of CSS was ignored for most work. For unusual work that demanded it, special pains were taken to achieve it. The introduction of CNC-controlled lathes has provided a practical, everyday solution via automated CSS. By means of the machine's software and [[Variable-frequency drive|variable speed electric motor]]s, the lathe can increase the RPM of the spindle as the cutter gets closer to the center of the part.

Grinding wheels are designed to be run at a maximum safe speed, the spindle speed of the grinding machine may be variable but this should only be changed with due attention to the safe working speed of the wheel. As a wheel wears it will decrease in diameter, and its effective cutting speed will be reduced. Some grinders have the provision to increase the spindle speed, which corrects for this loss of cutting ability; however, increasing the speed beyond the wheels rating will destroy the wheel and create a serious hazard to life and limb.

Generally speaking, spindle speeds and feed rates are less critical in woodworking than metalworking. Most woodworking machines including [[Saw|power saws]] such as [[circular saw]]s and [[band saw]]s, [[jointer]]s, [[Thickness planer]]s rotate at a fixed RPM. In those machines, cutting speed is regulated through the feed rate. The required feed rate can be extremely variable depending on the [[horsepower|power]] of the motor, the hardness of the wood or other material being machined, and the sharpness of the cutting tool.

In woodworking, the ideal feed rate is one that is slow enough not to bog down the motor, yet fast enough to avoid burning the material. Certain woods, such as [[black cherry]] and [[maple]] are more prone to burning than others. The right feed rate is usually obtained by "feel" if the material is hand fed, or by trial and error if a power feeder is used. In [[thicknesser]]s (planers), the wood is usually fed automatically through rubber or corrugated steel rollers. Some of these machines allow varying the feed rate, usually by changing [[pulley]]s. A slower feed rate usually results in a finer surface as more cuts are made for any length of wood.

Spindle speed becomes important in the operation of routers, spindle moulders or shapers, and drills. Older and smaller routers often rotate at a fixed spindle speed, usually between 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. While these speeds are fine for small router bits, using larger bits, say more than {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} or 25 millimeters in diameter, can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. [[Drilling#Drilling in wood|Drilling wood]] generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal, and the speed is not as critical. However, larger diameter drill bits do require slower speeds to avoid burning.

Cutting feeds and speeds, and the spindle speeds that are derived from them, are the ''ideal'' cutting conditions for a tool. If the conditions are less than ideal then adjustments are made to the spindle's speed, this adjustment is usually a reduction in RPM to the closest available speed, or one that is deemed (through knowledge and experience) to be correct.

Some materials, such as machinable wax, can be cut at a wide variety of spindle speeds, while others, such as [[stainless steel]] require much more careful control as the cutting speed is critical, to avoid overheating both the cutter and workpiece. Stainless steel is one material that [[work hardening|work hardens]] very easily, therefore insufficient feed rate or incorrect spindle speed can lead to less than ideal cutting conditions as the work piece will quickly harden and resist the tool's cutting action. The liberal application of cutting fluid can improve these cutting conditions; however, the correct selection of speeds is the critical factor.

=== Spindle speed calculations ===
Most metalworking books have [[nomogram]]s or tables of spindle speeds and feed rates for different cutters and workpiece materials; similar tables are also likely available from the manufacturer of the cutter used.

The spindle speeds may be calculated for all machining operations once the SFM or MPM is known. In most cases we are dealing with a cylindrical object such as a milling cutter or a workpiece turning in a lathe so we need to determine the speed at the periphery of this round object. This speed at the periphery (of a point on the circumference, moving past a stationary point) will depend on the rotational speed (RPM) and diameter of the object.

One analogy would be a [[skateboard]] rider and a [[bicycle]] rider travelling side by side along the road. For a given surface speed (the speed of this pair along the road) the rotational speed (RPM) of their wheels (large for the skater and small for the bicycle rider) will be different. This rotational speed (RPM) is what we are calculating, given a fixed surface speed (speed along the road) and known values for their wheel sizes (cutter or workpiece).

The following formulae{{sfn|Culley|1988}} may be used to estimate this value.

==== Approximation ====
The exact RPM is not always needed, a close approximation will work (using 3 for the value of &lt;math&gt; {\pi }&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt;RPM = {Cutting Speed\times 12 \over \pi \times Diameter}&lt;/math&gt;

e.g. for a cutting speed of 100&amp;nbsp;ft/min (a plain HSS steel cutter on mild steel) and diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;inches (the cutter or the work piece)

:&lt;math&gt;RPM = {Cutting Speed\times 12 \over \pi \times Diameter} = {12 \times 100 ft/min \over 3 \times 10 inches} = {40 revs/min}&lt;/math&gt;

and, for an example using metric values, where the cutting speed is 30 m/min and a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;mm,

:&lt;math&gt;RPM = {Speed \over \pi \times Diameter} = { 1000 \times 30 m/min \over 3 \times 10 mm} = {1000 revs/min}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Accuracy ====
However, for more accurate calculations, and at the expense of simplicity, this formula can be used:

:&lt;math&gt;RPM = {Speed \over Circumference}={Speed \over \pi \times Diameter}&lt;/math&gt;

and using the same example

:&lt;math&gt;RPM = {100 ft/min \over \pi \times 10 \, inches \left ( \frac{1 ft}{12 \, inches} \right )} = {100 \over 2.62} = 38.2 revs/min&lt;/math&gt;

and using the same example as above

:&lt;math&gt;RPM = {30 m/min \over \pi \times 10 \, mm \left ( \frac{1 m}{1000 \, mm} \right )} = {1000*30 \over \pi*10} = 955 revs/min&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''RPM'' is the rotational speed of the cutter or workpiece.
* ''Speed'' is the recommended cutting speed of the material  in meters/minute or feet/min
* ''Diameter''  in millimeters or inches.

== Feed rate ==
Feed rate is the velocity at which the cutter is fed, that is, advanced against the workpiece. It is expressed in units of distance per revolution for turning and boring (typically ''inches per revolution'' [''ipr''] or ''millimeters per revolution''). It can be expressed thus for milling also, but it is often expressed in units of distance per time for milling (typically ''inches per minute'' [''ipm''] or ''millimeters per minute''), with considerations of how many teeth (or flutes) the cutter has then determining what that means for each tooth.

Feed rate is dependent on the:

* Type of tool (a small drill or a large drill, high speed or carbide, a boxtool or recess, a thin form tool or wide form tool, a slide knurl or a turret straddle knurl).
* Surface finish desired.
* Power available at the spindle (to prevent stalling of the cutter or workpiece).
* Rigidity of the machine and tooling setup (ability to withstand vibration or chatter).
* Strength of the workpiece (high feed rates will collapse thin wall tubing)
* Characteristics of the material being cut, chip flow depends on material type and feed rate. The ideal chip shape is small and breaks free early, carrying heat away from the tool and work.
* [[Threads per inch]] (TPI) for taps, die heads and threading tools.
* Cut Width.  Any time the width of cut is less than half the diameter, a geometric phenomenon called Chip Thinning reduces the actual chipload.  Feedrates need to be increased to offset the effects of chip thinning, both for productivity and to avoid rubbing which reduces tool life.

When deciding what feed rate to use for a certain cutting operation, the calculation is fairly straightforward for single-point cutting tools, because all of the cutting work is done at one point (done by "one tooth", as it were). With a milling machine or jointer, where multi-tipped/multi-fluted cutting tools are involved, then the desirable feed rate becomes dependent on the number of teeth on the cutter, as well as the desired amount of material per tooth to cut (expressed as chip load).  The greater the number of cutting edges, the higher the feed rate permissible: for a cutting edge to work efficiently it must remove sufficient material to cut rather than rub; it also must do its fair share of work.

The ratio of the spindle speed and the feed rate controls how aggressive the cut is, and the nature of the [[swarf]] formed.

===Formula to determine feed rate===

This formula{{sfn|Smid|2003|p=90}} can be used to figure out the feed rate that the cutter travels into or around the work.  This would apply to cutters on a milling machine, drill press and a number of other machine tools.  This is not to be used on the lathe for turning operations, as the feed rate on a lathe is given as ''feed per revolution.''

&lt;math&gt;FR = {RPM \times T \times CL} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*''FR'' = the calculated feed rate in inches per minute or mm per minute.
*''RPM'' = is the calculated speed for the cutter.
*''T'' = Number of teeth on the cutter.
*''CL'' = The ''chip load'' or ''feed per tooth''.  This is the size of chip that each tooth of the cutter takes.

==Depth of cut==
Cutting speed and feed rate come together with ''depth of cut'' to determine the ''material removal rate'', which is the volume of workpiece material (metal, wood, plastic, etc.) that can be removed per time unit

==Interrelationship of theory and practice==
Speed-and-feed selection is analogous to other examples of applied science, such as [[meteorology]] or [[pharmacology]], in that the theoretical modeling is necessary and useful but can never fully predict the reality of specific cases because of the massively multivariate environment. Just as weather forecasts or drug dosages can be modeled with fair accuracy, but never with complete certainty, machinists can predict with charts and formulas the approximate speed and feed values that will work best on a particular job, but cannot know the exact optimal values until running the job. In CNC machining, usually the programmer programs speeds and feedrates that are as maximally tuned as calculations and general guidelines can supply. The operator then fine-tunes the values while running the machine, based on sights, sounds, smells, temperatures, tolerance holding, and tool tip lifespan. Under proper management, the revised values are captured for future use, so that when a program is run again later, this work need not be duplicated.

As with meteorology and pharmacology, however, the interrelationship of theory and practice has been developing over decades as the theory part of the balance becomes more advanced thanks to information technology. For example, an effort called the Machine Tool Genome Project is working toward providing the computer modeling (simulation) needed to predict optimal speed-and-feed combinations for particular setups in any internet-connected shop with less local experimentation and testing.{{sfn|Zelinski|2011}} Instead of the only option being the measuring and testing of the behavior of its own equipment, it will benefit from others' experience and simulation; in a sense, rather than 'reinventing a wheel', it will be able to 'make better use of existing wheels already developed by others in remote locations'.

==Academic research examples==

Speeds and feeds have been studied scientifically since at least the 1890s. The work is typically done in engineering laboratories, with the funding coming from three basic roots: [[corporation]]s, [[government]]s (including their [[military|militaries]]), and [[university|universities]]. All three types of institution have invested large amounts of money in the cause, often in [[collaborative partnerships]]. Examples of such work are highlighted below.

In the 1890s through 1910s, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] performed [[Tool bit#FW Taylor single-point cutter R and D|turning experiments]]{{sfn|Taylor|1907}} that became famous (and seminal). He developed [[tool wear#Tool Life Expectancy|Taylor's Equation for Tool Life Expectancy]]. 

Scientific study by Holz and De Leeuw of the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company{{sfn|Woodbury|1972|pp=79–81}} did for milling cutters what [[Tool bit#FW Taylor single-point cutter R and D|F. W. Taylor had done for single-point cutters]].

"Following World War II, many new alloys were developed. New standards were needed to increase [U.S.] American productivity. Metcut Research Associates, with technical support from the Air Force Materials Laboratory and the Army Science and Technology Laboratory, published the first Machining Data Handbook in 1966. The recommended speeds and feeds provided in this book were the result of extensive testing to determine optimum tool life under controlled conditions for every material of the day, operation and hardness."&lt;ref name="Gosselin_2016-05"/&gt;

{{harvnb|Flórez-Orrego|Varela-Jiménez|Escobar-Atehortua|López-Ochoa|2010}}, studied the effect of the variation of cutting parameters in the surface integrity in turning of an AISI 304 stainless steel. They found that the feed rate has the greatest impairing effect on the quality of the surface, and that besides the achievement of the desired roughness profile, it is necessary to analyze the effect of speed and feed on the creation of micropits and microdefects on the machined surface. Moreover, they found that the conventional empirical relation that relates feed rate to roughness value does not fit adequately for low cutting speeds.

Subaru cars are known for their use of a [[flat engine|boxer engine]] layout in most vehicles above 1500&amp;nbsp;cc. The [[Symmetrical All Wheel Drive]] drive-train layout was introduced in 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the [[Subaru BRZ|BRZ]], introduced in 2012 via a partnership with Toyota, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a [[rear-wheel-drive]] structure. Subaru also offers [[turbocharged]] versions of their passenger cars, such as the [[Impreza WRX]] and the [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy GT]].

In Western markets, the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers. Marketing is targeted towards specific niches centered on those who desire the company's signature drive train engine, all-wheel/rough-road capabilities or affordable sports car markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-08/subaru-s-412-surge-leads-carmaker-to-debate-niche-status-cars |title=Subaru’s 412% Surge Leads Carmaker to Debate Niche Status |work=Bloomberg Business |first1=Ma |last1=Jie |first2=Yuki |last2=Hagiwara |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Subaru'' is the Japanese name for the [[Pleiades]] star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subaru-global.com/origin_name.html |title=Origins of Subaru name |publisher=Subaru-global.com |date=|accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411083646/http://www.subaru-global.com/origin_name.html |archivedate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:Subaru pleiades.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Former logo on a [[Subaru 360]] showing six stars in an arrangement similar to the [[Pleiades]] open star cluster]]

=== Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI) and Subaru's first cars ===
Fuji Heavy Industries started out as the Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by [[Chikuhei Nakajima]]. In 1932, the company was reorganized as ''[[Nakajima Aircraft Company]], Ltd'' and soon became a major manufacturer of [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] for Japan during World War II. At the end of the Second World War Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. In 1946, the company created the [[Fuji Rabbit]], a [[motor scooter]], with spare aircraft parts from the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fujirabbit.com/pages/frame_history.html |title=Fuji Rabbit.com |publisher=Fuji Rabbit.com |date=|accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211004722/http://www.fujirabbit.com/pages/frame_history.html |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese government's 1950 Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act, anti-[[zaibatsu]] legislation. Between 1953 and 1955, five of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form ''Fuji Heavy Industries''. These companies were: ''Fuji Kogyo'', a scooter manufacturer; [[Coach (vehicle)|coachbuilders]] ''Fuji Jidosha''; engine manufacturers ''Omiya Fuji Kogyo''; [[chassis]] builders ''Utsunomiya Sharyo'' and the ''Tokyo Fuji Dangyo'' [[trading company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subaru Heritage |url=http://www.subaru-global.com/ourstory/heritage.html |website=Subaru Global |publisher=Subaru Corporation |access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Subaru 1500.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Subaru 1500, a.k.a. the P-1]]

[[Kenji Kita]], [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1. Kita canvassed the company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals were appealing enough. In the end he gave the company a Japanese name that he "had been cherishing in his heart": Subaru, which is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster. The first Subaru car was named the [[Subaru 1500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subaru-global.com/origin_name.html |title=Inspiration of naming first Subaru vehicle |publisher=Subaru Global |date=|access-date=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731200632/http://www.subaru-global.com/origin_name.html |archivedate=2013-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only twenty were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues. Subsequently, the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled [[Subaru 360|360]] (1958), the [[Subaru Sambar|Sambar]] (1961), and the [[Subaru 1000|1000]] (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965).

[[File:1958 Subaru 360 01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|1958 Subaru 360]]

===Later partnerships===
[[Nissan]] acquired a 20.4% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Eisaku Sato]]. Nissan would utilize FHI's bus manufacturing capability and expertise for their [[Nissan Diesel]] line of buses. In turn many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing [[keiretsu]]. The Subaru automatic transmission, known as the [[List of Subaru transmissions|4EAT]], is also used in the first generation [[Nissan Pathfinder]]. While under this arrangement with Nissan, Subaru introduced the [[Subaru R-2|R-2]] (1969), the [[Subaru Rex|Rex]] and the [[Subaru Leone|Leone]] (1971), the [[Subaru BRAT|BRAT]] (1978), [[Subaru Alcyone|Alcyone]] (1985), the [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]] (1989), the [[Subaru Impreza|Impreza]] (1993) (and its WRX subtype), and the [[Subaru Forester|Forester]] (1997).

Upon Nissan's acquisition by [[Renault]], its stake in FHI was sold to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 1999. Troy Clarke, of General Motors served as representative to Fuji Heavy Industries on their corporate board. During that time, Subaru introduced 
the [[Subaru Baja|Baja]] (2003), and the [[Subaru Tribeca|Tribeca]] (2005). 
The Subaru Forester was sold as a Chevrolet Forester in [[India]] in exchange for the [[Opel Zafira]] being sold as a [[Subaru Traviq]] in [[Japan]]. Also, the Chevrolet Borrego concept was presented in 2002, a crossover coupe/pickup truck being derived from the Japanese-market Legacy Turbo platform. During the brief General Motors period, a [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] [[Subaru Impreza|Impreza]] was sold in the United States as the [[Saab 9-2X]].

GM liquidated their holdings in FHI in 2005. Nearly all Saab-Subaru joint projects were dropped at that time, other than Subaru supplying parts for the Saab 9-2x.&lt;ref name="toybuy2005"/&gt; [[Toyota Motors]] bought a little over 40% of GM's former FHI stock, amounting to 8.7% of FHI. 
(The rest of GM's shares went to a Fuji stock buy-back program.)&lt;ref name="toybuy2005"&gt;{{cite web

===Marketing ===
Some of the advertising slogans Subaru has used in the past include "Inexpensive, and built to stay that way" (USA 1970s – early 1980s), "The World's Favourite Four Wheel Drive" (in the UK), "Plus on y pense, plus on a le gout de la conduire" (Literally: "The more one thinks, the more one has the taste (or desire, impulse, drive) of driving it") in French Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;Subaru Legacy Canada sales brochure printed January 1990&lt;/ref&gt; "We built our reputation by building a better car", "What to Drive", "The Beauty of All-Wheel Drive", "Driven by What's Inside", "Think, Feel, Drive", "Love. It's what makes Subaru, a Subaru" (USA early 2010s) and currently "Confidence in Motion" in North America, "All 4 The Driver" in Australia, and "Uncommon Engineering, Uncommon Stability, Uncommon Roadholding, Uncommon Sense" in the UK and "Technology that gives you Confidence in Motion" in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korzeniewski |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/04/25/what-really-makes-a-subaru-a-subaru-love/ |title='&amp;#39;What really makes a Subaru a Subaru?

In the 1990s, an ad firm hired by Subaru found the all wheel drive cars were popular among [[lesbian]]s. The company started including subtle marketing to this demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/10/14/497958151/episode-729-when-subaru-came-out |title=When Subaru Came Out |work=National Public Radio |location=US |date=2016-10-14 |access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayyasi"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mayyasi |first1=Alex |title=How an Ad Campaign Made Lesbians Fall in Love with Subaru |url=https://priceonomics.com/how-an-ad-campaign-made-lesbians-fall-in-love-with/ |work=Priceonomics |location=US |date=2016-05-23 |access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Automotive Lease Guide, Subaru ranked second place in vehicles that have the highest overall predicted resale values among all industry and all luxury vehicles for MY 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.alg.com/Newsroom?pid=92 |title=Automotive Lease Guide announcement for MY 2009 |work=ALG |location=US |date=2008-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707110252/https://www.alg.com/Newsroom?pid=92 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are derived after carefully studying segment competition, historical vehicle performance and industry trends. According to a study done by [[J.D. Power and Associates]] for the 2008 Customer Retention Study, Subaru ranked at 50.5%, which was above the national average of 48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdpower.com/corporate/news/releases/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2008265 |title=2008 Customer Retention Study &amp;#124; J.D.

Subaru launched an animation series [[Wish Upon the Pleiades]] {{nihongo|''Hōkago no Pleiades''|''放課後のプレアデス''|Hōkago no Pureadesu|lit. 'After School Pleiades'}} developed jointly with [[Gainax]]. The 4-part mini episode series was released on [[YouTube]] on February 1, 2011. It featured a [[magical girl]] plot with Subaru as a leading protagonist.

==Current operations==
Subaru's corporate headquarters are located in [[Ebisu, Shibuya|Ebisu, Tokyo]].

===Manufacturing facilities===
Subaru is distinct from many of its Japanese competitors in that as of early 2016 it still made almost 75% of its cars sold internationally in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Thomas |title=Subaru’s secret: Marginalized foreign workers power a Japanese export boom |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/japan-subaru/ |accessdate=2016-08-28 |agency=Reuters |date=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subaru's facilities designated to automotive manufacturing are located in [[Ōta, Gunma|Ōta]], [[Gunma Prefecture]], consisting of four locations. Subaru-chō is where the Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86 is built, having been re-purposed from ''kei'' car production, Yajima Plant is where all current Subaru cars are built, Otakita Plant is where commercial ''kei'' trucks are built (originally a factory location of [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]]), and Oizumi Plant in [[Oizumi, Gunma|Oizumi]], [[Gunma Prefecture]], is where engines and transmissions are built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fhi.co.jp/english/outline/inoutline/domestic/index.html |title=Facilities {{!}} Domestic facilities |publisher=Fuji Heavy Industries  |location=Japan |access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subaru's only overseas manufacturing facility is located in [[Lafayette, Indiana]]; the factory is called [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.]]. Due to continued sales growth in North American markets, vehicle production capacity at the Lafayette assembly plant is set to expand to 390,000 vehicles annually. Under the current strategic plan, Subaru will have a total production capacity of 1,026,000 vehicles per year at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2015 Annual Report |url=https://www.fhi.co.jp/english/ir/report/pdf/ar/ar_2015e.pdf |publisher=Fuji Heavy Industries |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2016-08-29 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subaru in Canada===

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

In 1976, Canadians got their first exposure to Subaru vehicles when Subaru Auto Canada Limited (SACL) began offering the [[Subaru Leone]]. In 1989, the privately owned SACL was purchased by the Toronto-based Subaru Canada, Inc. who, under the guidance of parent company [[Fuji Heavy Industries]], began an expansion process that would eventually see over 100 Subaru Dealers in operation across the country.

Subaru Canada, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Fuji Heavy Industries]] of Japan. Headquartered in [[Mississauga, Ontario]], the company markets and distributes Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories through a network of 88 authorized dealers throughout Canada.

===Subaru in Asia===
In Asian countries outside of Japan, Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories are supplied by Motor Image Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Hong Kong]]-based Tan Chong International Limited under businessman Glenn Tan.

Subaru has entered the [[Philippines|Philippine]] operations started in 1996 under the Columbian Motors Philippines ownership but withdrew in 2000. It returned in 2006 under a new ownership by Motor Image Pilipinas, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://motorimage.net/PH/aboutus/news.php?type=article&amp;id=78 |title=Subaru – About Us &gt; News and Events |publisher=Motor Image, Philippines |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subaru has eleven dealerships in the country: Greenhills, [[Fort Bonifacio]], [[Parañaque|Manila Bay]], [[Alabang]], [[Davao City|Davao]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Batangas]], and [[Pampanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.topgear.com.ph/news/motor-image-ph-to-open-4-new-subaru-dealerships-in-2013 |title=Motor Image PH to open 4 new Subaru dealerships in 2013 |publisher=Top Gear Philippines |date=2012-12-08 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subaru in the United Kingdom===

In 1974 [[Robert Edmiston]] was finance director at sports car manufacturer Jensen Motors. When the company went bankrupt, he used a {{currency|6,000|GBP}} redundancy payout to set up [[International Motors]]{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, which acquired the UK franchise for Subaru and [[Isuzu]]. The [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]] based company is still the parent for Subaru in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://subaru.co.uk/offers/outback/low-monthly-payments-on-the-subaru-outback-range/terms-and-conditions/ |title=Terms and Conditions {{!}} Latest Outback offers |publisher=Subaru |location=UK |access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;!-- this reference doesn't really cover it --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subaru in the United States===
{{Main|Subaru of America}}

[[Subaru of America]] was established in 1968 in Philadelphia by [[Malcolm Bricklin]] and Harvey Lamm. It relocated to [[Pennsauken, New Jersey]] shortly thereafter and moved to its current headquarters in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] when Fuji Heavy Industries acquired full ownership. Subaru of America operates regional offices, zone offices and parts distribution centers throughout the United States.  Subaru of America also operates port facilities on both the West and East coasts.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=Subaru's company history, policies, attitudes, viewpoints, and basic info|url=http://www.subaru.com/company/index.html|publisher=Subaru of America, Inc|accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Subaru and then-partner Isuzu opened a joint factory in [[Lafayette, Indiana]] called Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, or SIA, which initially manufactured the [[Subaru Legacy]] and [[Isuzu Rodeo]]. In 2001 Isuzu sold their stake in the plant to FHI for $1 due to flagging sales and it was renamed [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.]] SIA has been designated a backyard wildlife [[habitat]] by the [[National Wildlife Federation]] and has achieved a zero-landfill production designation (the first automotive assembly plant in the United States to earn that designation).&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

According to the [[Kelley Blue Book]] in 2015, two Subaru models [[Subaru Forester|Forester]] and the [[Subaru Outback|Outback]] in the United States had very short inventory time (the time between being received by a dealer to being sold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://247wallst.com/autos/2016/04/30/subaru-sales-so-strong-dealer-run-out-of-cars/ |title=Subaru outsells itself |first=Douglas |last=McIntyre |work=247wallstreet |location=US |date=2016-04-30 |access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auto Show 069.jpg|thumb|[[Subaru Impreza WRC]]]]

[[Subaru Rally Team Japan]] led by Noriyuki Koseki (founder of [[Subaru Tecnica International]], STI) ran [[Subaru Leone]] coupé, sedan DL, [[Subaru Leone|RX]] [[Subaru Leone|(SRX)]] and [[Subaru Leone|RX Turbo]] in the World Rally Championship between 1980 and 1989. Drivers for individual rallies included [[Ari Vatanen]], [[Per Eklund]], [[Shekhar Mehta]], Mike Kirkland, [[Possum Bourne]] and Harald Demut. Mike Kirkland finished 6th overall and won the A Group at the 1986 [[Safari Rally]]. That year Subaru was one of the only manufacturers combining 4WD and turbo after [[Audi#Rallying|Audi]]'s successful [[Quattro (four-wheel drive system)|quattro]] system had been introduced in 1980, but Audi withdrew from the WRC after safety concerns and Ford's serious accident early in the 1986 season.  Subaru changed the rally model to Legacy RS for the 1990–1992 period and took part in the first complete season in the World Rally Championship with the same model in 1993.

Modified versions of the [[Subaru Impreza WRX|Impreza WRX]] and [[Subaru Impreza WRX STi|WRX STi]] have been competing successfully in [[rallying]]. Drivers [[Colin McRae]] ([[1995 World Rally Championship season|1995]]), [[Richard Burns]] ([[2001 World Rally Championship season|2001]]) and [[Petter Solberg]] ([[2003 World Rally Championship season|2003]]) have won [[World Rally Championship]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|drivers' titles]] with the [[Subaru World Rally Team]] and Subaru took the [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|manufacturers' title]] three years in a row from 1995 to [[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]]. Subaru's World Rally Championship cars are prepared and run by [[Prodrive]], the highly successful British motorsport team. Several endurance records were set in the early and mid-nineties by the [[Subaru Legacy]]. The [[Subaru Justy]] also holds the world record for the fastest sub 1.0L car without a turbo: 123.224&amp;nbsp;mph average, it was set in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://dp.subaru.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Subaru was briefly involved in [[Formula One]] circuit racing when it bought a controlling interest in the tiny Italian [[Enzo Coloni Racing Car Systems|Coloni team]] for the [[1990 Formula One season|1990 season]]. The Coloni 3B's 12-cylinder engine was badged as a Subaru and shared the boxer layout with the company's own engines, but was an existing design built by Italian firm [[Motori Moderni]]. The cars were overweight and underpowered and the partnership broke down before the season finished.&lt;ref&gt;Subaru Performance magazine version 4.3&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of rally racing and the [[Import scene]] in the US, the introduction of the highly anticipated [[Subaru Impreza WRX]] in 2001 was successful in bringing high-performance AWD compact cars into the sports car mainstream. Subaru supplies a factory-backed team, [[Subaru Rally Team USA]] for [[Rally America]] and has won the driver's title six times, most recently in 2011 with [[David Higgins (rally driver)|David Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vtcar.com/2011-07-19/2975/ |title=David Higgins Wins 2011 Rally America National Championship |publisher=Vermont Sports Car |location=US |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Grassroots Motorsports]]'' awarded Subaru with the Editors' Choice Award in 2002.{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On 16 December 2008, it was announced that Subaru would no longer be competing in the World Rally Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Subaru pull out of World Rallying |newspaper=Japan Times |date=2008-12-16 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/world_rally/7785299.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made by Subaru’s parent company, [[Fuji Heavy Industries]] (FHI), partly as a result of the economic downturn but also because it was felt Subaru had achieved its sporting and marketing objectives. Mr [[Ikuo Mori]] denied that alterations to the WRC technical regulations in 2010 or a rumoured deterioration in the working relationship with [[Prodrive]] had any impact on the decision. He also said that the possibility of a Subaru car back in the top category of WRC in the future is not zero, but for this moment there can be no assumption of a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.com/news/subaru-doesnt-rule-out-wrc-return/?fid=8544&amp;page=2327 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930172822/http://www.wrc.com/news/subaru-doesnt-rule-out-wrc-return/?fid=8544&amp;page=2327 |archive-date=2013-09-30 |title=Subaru doesn’t rule out WRC return |work=WRC |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2013-10-06 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, Cusco Racing have entered an Impreza sedan and a [[Subaru BRZ|BRZ]] in the [[Super GT]] championship. In 2008, the Impreza was the first 4-door and first 4WD vehicle to win a race.

Starting in 2006, Subaru of America (SOA), as the official distributor of Subaru vehicles in the United States participates in the [[Subaru Road Racing Team]] (SRRT) with a [[Subaru Legacy]] 2.5 GT Spec-B in the [[Grand-Am]] Street Tuner class.  In 2010, SRRT campaigns a [[Subaru Impreza WRX STI]] in the Grand Sport class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carsession.com/car-news/subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-srrt-racecars.html |title=Subaru Impreza WRX STI SRRT racecars |work=Carsession.com |location=US |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, SRRT switched from the hatchback to a 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan.

On 4 May 2012, [[Subaru Rally Team USA]] announced that a new rallycross team, Subaru [[Puma SE|Puma]] Rallycross Team USA will participate in the 2012 [[Global RallyCross Championship]] season with [[Dave Mirra]], [[Bucky Lasek]], and [[Sverre Isachsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.global-rallycross.com/drivers-teams/ |title=Drivers &amp;amp; Teams |work=Global Rally Cross |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also competed in the [[2014 FIA World Rallycross Championship]].

In 2011, [[Mark Higgins (driver)|Mark Higgins]] used a stock Impreza to set a lap record at the [[Isle of Man TT]] course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a17416/isle-of-madness/ |title=Isle of Madness – 2011 Isle of Man Subaru Record Breaking Run |first=Jonathan |last=Elfalan |work=Road and Track |location=US |date=2011-07-13 |access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Higgins again broke the record in a modified WRX STI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/Subaru-Isle-of-Man-video-TT-record-2016 |title=New onboard video: Subaru's record-breaking Isle of Man TT lap |first=Matt |last=Burt |work=Autocar |location=US |date=2016-06-28 |access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
===Diesel===
The 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt International Motor Show]] saw Subaru introduce a [[Flat engine|horizontally opposed]], water-cooled, [[common rail]] [[turbodiesel]] using a [[variable geometry turbocharger]] called the Subaru EE engine, the first of its type to be fitted to a passenger car. Volkswagen had experimented with this idea during the 1950s and made two air-cooled boxer [[prototype]] diesel engines that were not turbocharged. VW installed one engine in a [[Volkswagen Beetle|Type 1]] and another in a [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]].&lt;ref name="ltv-vwc.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/ws_aug-sept-2003/diesel-beetle.html|title=The Diesel Beetle|accessdate=2008-04-03|work=ltv-vwc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subaru engine was rated at {{convert|110|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} with a displacement of 2.0 litres. In March 2008 Subaru offered the Legacy sedan and wagon and the Outback wagon with 2.0 litre turbodiesel in the [[European Union|EU]] with a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name="autobloggreen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/03/07/geneva-motor-show-subaru-diesel-boxer-engine/|title=Geneva Motor Show: Subaru diesel boxer engine|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=autobloggreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paultanturbodiesel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2007/09/17/subaru-turbodiesel-boxer-110kw147hp/ | title=Subaru's 2.0L Turbodiesel Boxer – 110kW/147hp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 Subaru announced that the diesel Forester and diesel Impreza will be introduced at the 2008 [[Paris Motor Show]], with Forester sales to begin October 2008 and diesel Impreza sales to start January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neff |first=John |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/09/05/paris-preview-subaru-debuts-boxer-diesel-forester-and-impreza/ |title=Euro-spec Impreza diesel introduction |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forester and Impreza will have a 6-speed manual transmission, whereas the Legacy and Outback have 5-speed manual transmissions.

===Electric vehicles===
In June 2006, Fuji Heavy Industries, Inc. (FHI) launched its [[Subaru Stella]] [[Plug-in electric vehicle]] which is a [[kei car]] equipped with a [[lithium-ion]] battery pack. The vehicle has a short range of {{Convert|56|mi}} but it actually costs more than the [[Mitsubishi i-EV|Mitsubishi iMiEV]], at {{currency|4,380,000|JPY}} ({{currency|44,860|USD}}), including Japanese Government [[consumption tax]]es with an exemption of $2,240. It will also qualify for a rebate from the Japanese Government of up to $14,200, bringing the price down to $30,660&lt;!-- prices in USD because source article was for US readers --&gt;. The vehicle is much like the i-MiEV, with a 47-kilowatt motor and a quick-charge capability, but the two-door mini-car has a boxy shape. FHI plans to start delivery in late July and plans to sell 170 vehicles by March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12572 |title=EERE News: Mitsubishi and Subaru Launch Electric Cars in Japan |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Subaru is currently testing two electric vehicles called the [[Subaru G4e]] and the [[Subaru R1e]].

The [[Subaru Hybrid Tourer]] Concept is a four-seat vehicle with [[gull-wing door]]s that combines a 2-liter turbocharged direct-injection gasoline engine with a continuously variable transmission and two axle-mounted motors. A lithium-ion battery pack provides energy storage for the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=15580 |title=EERE News: Honda CR-Z Concept Hybrid Debuts at the Tokyo Motor Show |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, Subaru, along with [[Suzuki]], [[Daihatsu]] and [[Hino Motors]], joined the nascent EV C.A. Spirit venture to collaborate on electric vehicle technology development. The project was launched by Toyota, [[Mazda]] and automotive component manufacturer [[Denso]] in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Suzuki, Hino, Subaru and Daihatsu Join Toyota-Led EV Project - World Industrial Reporter |url=https://worldindustrialreporter.com/suzuki-hino-subaru-and-daihatsu-join-toyota-led-ev-project/ |website=World Industrial Reporter |accessdate=2018-08-18 |date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Subaru among the few makes lacking any electric models - in the U.S., the short-lived Crosstrek hybrid was on the market from 2014-2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Edelstein |first1=Stephen |title=Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid discontinued for 2017 model year |url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1106428_subaru-crosstrek-hybrid-discontinued-for-2017-model-year |website=Green Car Reports |accessdate=2018-08-18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the company expects to launch a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) with the 2019 model year, based in large part on technology from shareholder Toyota's [[Prius Prime]] platform, and to be only available in California/ZEV markets. A full EV is in the works and promised for 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greimel |first1=Hans |last2=Okamura |first2=Naoto |title=To electrify, Subaru leans on its friends |url=https://autoweek.com/article/green-cars/electrify-subaru-leans-its-friends |website=autoweek.com |publisher=Automotive News |accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronics ===
Since the 2005 model year, Subaru has adopted the [[CAN bus]] technology for the USA and Canada markets. Starting in the 2007 model year, all Subaru vehicles use the CAN technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Typically, two CAN-buses are used on vehicles: a high-speed CAN running at 500&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for powertrain communication, and a low-speed CAN running at 125&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for body control functions and instrument panels. A body-integrated unit (BIU) is used between these two networks.

[[Clarion (company)|Clarion]] and [[Harman Kardon]] are among the audio, video, and navigation technology suppliers for Subaru products in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarion announced in 2015 that it was introducing its "Smart Access" platform, formerly only offered on Clarion's aftermarket products, to the units to be installed in certain Subaru 2015 models in North America. Smart Access is able to work with the driver's smartphone (either iPhone or Android) and allows access to various car-safe apps running on the phone via the car's built-in infotainment screen.

In 2008, Subaru introduced their EyeSight driver assistance and safety system. Unlike most such systems, which use radar or sonar sensors, EyeSight uses dual video cameras mounted at the top of the windshield. Depth information is derived from the parallax between two video signals and used to judge the distance to the next vehicle for features such as pre-collision braking and adaptive cruise control. The company has continued to improve the technology, which now includes lane-keeping assistance. EyeSight is now available on most Subaru models (usually in higher trim levels) and is standard on the [[Subaru Ascent]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

=== Subaru Global Platform (SGP) ===
Subaru debuted its new chassis design, dubbed the Subaru Global Platform, with the release of the 2017 Impreza. Having spent over a billion dollars on research and development the company plans to extend the architecture to all of its other models, with the exception of the BRZ which is co-developed with Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterlyon/2016/09/21/subarus-new-impreza-cost-1b-was-it-worth-it/#5881576a69d1|title=Subaru's New Impreza Cost $1B -- Was It Worth It?|last=Lyon|first=Peter|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By incorporating high-strength steel into the chassis updated vehicles will have stiffer bodies that increase safety through greater impact absorption while also improving ride comfort. Another focus of the new platform is modularity, allowing Subaru to reduce development costs by streamlining production throughout its network of facilities. The platform will be able to accommodate a variety of powertrains, including gasoline, hybrid, and fully electric designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/subaru-global-platform-debuts-will-underpin-all-future-subarus|title=Subaru Global Platform Debuts, Will Underpin All Future Subarus|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Environmental record==
[[File:'09 Subaru Legacy Wagon PZEV (MIAS).JPG|thumb|USA-spec Subaru Legacy PZEV]]

Subaru claims to have implemented advanced policies which include recycling, reducing harmful emissions, and educating their employees. Their efforts have helped them in their environmental initiatives. The Subaru plant in Lafayette, Indiana (SIA) was the first auto assembly plant to achieve zero landfill status;&lt;ref name="subaru1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subaru.com/company/environmental-policy.html |title=Subaru's environmental record |publisher=Subaru.com |date=|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; nothing from the manufacturing process goes into a landfill. The company has developed a recycling plan for the "end-of-life" of their cars. Most of their modern products use highly recyclable materials throughout the vehicle, in the engine, transmission, suspension and elsewhere in each vehicle leaving Subaru with a 97.3% recycling ratio rate for their end-of-life vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhi.co.jp/english/envi/csr/envi/recycle.html |title=Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. &gt; CSR / Environment &gt; Environmental Report ｜Automobile Recycling |publisher=Fhi.co.jp |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from the Subaru website stated "In 2006, SIA was awarded the United States Environmental Protection Agency´s Gold Achievement Award as a top achiever in the agency's WasteWise program to reduce waste and improve recycling." The website also stated that "It also became the first U.S. automotive assembly plant to be designated a wildlife habitat."

'''''The Greenhouse Conspiracy''''' is a documentary film broadcast by [[Channel 4]] in the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 August 1990, as part of the ''[[Equinox (television)|Equinox]]'' series, which criticised the theory of [[global warming]] and asserted that scientists critical of global warming theory were denied funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/444184 |title=The Greenhouse Conspiracy (1990) |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest instances of the suggestion of a [[global warming conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to promote false claims supporting global warming. Although the title of the program implied the existence of a conspiracy, when interviewed on the program [[Patrick Michaels]] played down the idea, saying, "It may not quite add up to a conspiracy, but certainly a coalition of interests has promoted the greenhouse theory: scientists have needed funds, the media a story, and governments a worthy cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fufor.twoday.net/stories/3428768/ |accessdate=21 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527135745/http://fufor.twoday.net/stories/3428768/ |archivedate=27 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4742">A '''tracer-gas leak testing''' method is a [[nondestructive testing]] method that detects [[gas leaks]]. A variety of methods with different sensitivities exist. Tracer-gas leak testing is used in the [[petrochemical industry]], the [[automotive industry]], and in the manufacture of [[semiconductors]], among other uses.

==Types==
Several tracer-gas leak testing methods exist, including:
* Detection of leaks using [[helium mass spectrometer]], which provides high sensitivity
* [[Hydrogen leak testing]], which provides the best mobility
* Refrigerant gas leak detection, for refrigeration applications

== Method selection ==

=== Typical leakage rates ===
The nature of the product or the process and the process gases will set the leak rate requirement:
{| class="wikitable"
!System
!Allowed leak rate ([[mbar]] [[Litre|l]]/s)
|-
|Chemical process equipment
|10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;–1
|-
|Beverage can
|10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; –10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Vacuum pumped system
|10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|IC-package
|10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Airbag cartridge
|10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Pacemaker
|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Closed vacuum system
|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

=== Sensitivity of methods ===
Based on the target leak rate, the table below will help to choose the most suitable method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vicleakdetection.com/global-engineers-of-airvacuumtracer-gas-leak-detection-systems/leak-detection-sensitivity-guide/|title=Leak Detection Sensitivity Guide - VIC Leak Detection|work=VIC Leak Detection|access-date=2017-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Typical applications of tracer-gas leak testing include:
* In [[Petrochemical plant|petrochemical plants]], [[Cracking (chemistry)|hydrocracking]], vapocracking, [[catalytic reforming]], and [[steam reforming]] are all [[hydrogen]]-based processes, in which were hydrogen leak testing is required.
* When manufacturing [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]], all processes taking place in a process chamber at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum – diffusion, oxidation, [[LPCVD]], [[PECVD]], [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD]] and [[ion implantation]] – require helium or hydrogen leak testing.
* In vehicles, [[airbag|airbags]] have to be tested for leaks so they remain functional for a long time. As well as airbags, the [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]] system, fuel system, and exhaust system require testing for leaks.
* [[Pacemakers]] and [[Catheter|catheters]] have to be tested for efficacy and longevity.
* On planes, tracer-gas leak testing is used to quickly and safely locate fuel leaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,,2209288,00.html|title=MoD accused over spy plane deaths|last=Townsend|first=Mark|date=2007-11-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-15|last2=correspondent|first2=defence|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to check [[Emergency oxygen system|oxygen distribution]] devices and [[cabin pressurization]] systems.
* Refrigeration and air conditioning must have the lowest possible rate of loss of [[refrigerant]] gases (contributing to [[ozone depletion]]).
* Sewage and drinking water networks, to reduce loss of water and make sure drinking water is not contaminated by sewage.

==Standards==
{{See also|Leak detection#Rules and regulations}}
Several standards apply to leak testing and more specifically to tracer-gas leak testing methods, for example:
* BS EN 1779:1999; leak tightness by indication or measurement of gas leakage,
* BS EN 13185:2001 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Tracer gas method,
* BS EN 13192:2002 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Calibration of reference leaks for gases.

[[File:Trouee dArenberg - Paris-Roubaix 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The straight cobbled road in the ''Forest of Arenberg'' in [[2008 Paris–Roubaix]]]]
The '''Trouée d'Arenberg''' or '''Tranchée de Wallers-Arenberg''' (English: ''Trench of Arenberg'') is a 2.4&amp;nbsp;km long cobbled road in the municipality of [[Wallers]] in [[Northern France]], in the [[Nord (French department)|Département Nord]]. The road's official name is ''La Drève des Boules d'Hérin'' ''("Bullet Alley of Hérin")'' and crosses the ''Forêt de Raismes-Saint-Amand-Wallers'', outside France better known as the '''Forest of Arenberg'''. It is best known from the annual [[classic cycle races|cycling classic]] [[Paris–Roubaix]] held in April, where it is one of the most difficult passages of the race.

==Characteristics==
Officially, the 2,400&amp;nbsp;meters of cobbles were laid in the time of Napoleon I, in the late 18th century, crossing the large forest of Saint-Amand-Wallers, close to Wallers and just west of [[Valenciennes]]. The road is straight and narrow (3&amp;nbsp;m), dropping slightly when entering the forest from the village of Arenberg, then rising in the second half. The altitude is 25m at the start and 19m at the end. The cobbles are extremely difficult to ride because of their irregularity. Many fans have taken away cobbles as souvenirs, leading to a regular check-up of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://old.rtbf.be/rtbf_2000//bin/view_something.cgi?type=article&amp;id=0125697_article&amp;menu=0125705_menulist&amp;pub=www.rtbf.portail/bad| publisher=Radio Television Belgium RTBF| title=Les pavés classés de Paris–Roubaix| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619103007/http://old.rtbf.be/rtbf_2000/| archivedate=2008-06-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

François Doulcier, the president of ''Les Amis de Paris-Roubaix'', the voluntary association which takes care of the race's cobblestones, said that "objectively speaking, it’s the worst-maintained sector of cobbles in the whole race", giving three reasons: the rough and grooved surface of the stones, resulting from poor cutting; the wide gaps between the stones; and the uneven laying of the cobbles. These difficulties mean that riders have to carefully balance the need to avoid accidents and mechanical problems with riding at high speed.&lt;ref name=eurosport /&gt;

It has been noted that the road's layout, as a long straight surrounded by trees, is unique among Paris-Roubaix's cobbled ''secteurs'': Doulcier has stated that "it gives the impression that you’re standing in a cathedral. Even if it were tarmacked over, it would be impressive".&lt;ref name=eurosport /&gt;

==Paris–Roubaix==
[[File:Paris-Roubaix Trouée d'Arenberg.jpg|thumb|right|Surface of the Trouée]]
The Trench of Arenberg was first included in Paris–Roubaix in 1968 and has become an iconic location of the cobbled classic. It is one of three "five star" sections of ''pavé'', together with the sections of [[Mons-en-Pévèle]] and  [[Carrefour de l'Arbre]] which come later in the race.

The introduction of the ''secteur'' was in response to the resurfacing of many cobbled roads after World War II with [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] or [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. This change had a significant effect on the parcours of the [[cobbled classics]]: by the 1965 edition of Paris-Roubaix cobbled sections only accounted for 22km of the 265.5km route. As a result the race was becoming easier, with the 1967 edition being won by [[Jan Janssen]] in a small group sprint of 15 riders. In reaction to this race director [[Jacques Goddet]] asked [[Albert Bouvet]], a recently retired rider who had been appointed course designer for the race, to find new cobbled ''secteurs'' to add to the parcours.&lt;ref name=eurosport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/cycling/paris-roubaix/2017/arenberg-a-trip-to-the-heart-of-hell_sto6117660/story.shtml |title=Arenberg: a trip to the heart of hell |last=Vergne |first=Laurent |year=2017 |website=[[Eurosport]] |access-date=9 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was proposed for Paris–Roubaix by former professional cyclist [[Jean Stablinski]], who had worked in the mine under the woods of Arenberg. The mine closed in 1990 (later being used by director [[Claude Berri]] to shoot his film ''[[Germinal (1993 film)|Germinal]]'')&lt;ref name=eurosport /&gt; and the cobbled passage is now classified. Although almost 100&amp;nbsp;km from Roubaix, the sector usually proves decisive and as Stablinski stated, "Paris–Roubaix is not won in Arenberg, but from there the group with the winners is selected". A memorial to Stablinski stands at one end of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/Cyclisme/Paris_Roubaix/Audio_Video/2008/04/07/article_hommage-a-jean-stablinski.shtml| title=Video of the inauguration of the memorial to Jean Stablinski| publisher=La Voix Des Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his desire to increase the difficulty of the race, Goddet was initially reluctant to include the Arenberg due to its extreme difficulty. However it was included in the 1968 race, and the field raced through it without any problems. Despite this, it was removed from the race in 1974 and only returned in [[1983 Paris–Roubaix|1983]] as a generally permanent fixture on the parcours. The race's passage through the Arenberg was broadcast on live television for the first time [[1984 Paris–Roubaix|the following year]], where the field was led by [[Gregor Braun]] and Roubaix native [[Alain Bondue]], who were team-mates on the local [[La Redoute (cycling team)|La Redoute]] team and who both finished in the top five of the race.&lt;ref name=eurosport /&gt;

The abandonment of the mines caused sections of the road to subside. In 1998 [[Johan Museeuw]], leading the [[UCI Road World Cup|World Cup]], crashed heavily on the Trouée and broke his [[kneecap]], nearly spelling the end of his career. In 2001 French rider [[Philippe Gaumont]] broke his [[femur]] after falling at the beginning of the Trouée when leading the peloton and never returned to racing at the highest level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beaudin|first1=Matthew|title=The Course: Paris–Roubaix and its cobbles|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2013/04/news/the-course-paris-roubaix-and-its-cobbles_280753|website=velonews.com|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Trouée d'Arenberg was left out in 2005, as conditions had deteriorated beyond safety limits. Regional and local councils spent €250,000 to restore the road and add 50&amp;nbsp;cm to its width. The section was included again in 2006.

Because of its difficulty, it is considered a crucial site of the race, although at 85 kilometers, it is relatively far from the finish in [[Roubaix]]. [[Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle]], twice a winner of the race, has said that "when you leave the Arenberg badly placed or in the red it’s then that you know that you won’t be in the mix in the final... Once out of the forest you may not have won the race, but you’ll certainly know if you have lost it". [[Thierry Gouvenou]], a former winner of [[Paris–Roubaix Espoirs]], suggested that "the race can clearly be split between what happens before and what happens after the Arenberg. Because until you have crossed the threshold of the Trench it’s not even worth thinking about what comes next".&lt;ref name=eurosport /&gt;

It is also the only site of the race where [[guard rail]]s are placed, as the road is narrow and fans gather in large numbers to see the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2004/worldcup04/roubaix04/?id=tales| publisher=Cyclingnews| date=2004-04-11| title=Tales from the pavé on the road to Roubaix| author=John Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier years of the section's inclusion, riders were often able to avoid riding on the cobbles by using the verges on the edge of the road - Gouvenou claimed that riders only had to ride 400 of the ''secteur'''s 2400 metres on the cobblestones - however in the 1990s the barriers were introduced to prevent crashes. According to Doulcier, over 10,000 fans watch the race on the Arenberg every year.&lt;ref name=eurosport /&gt;

==Tour de France==
The Trouée d'Arenberg was never included in the [[Tour de France]], but two stages of the Tour have finished in the village of Arenberg, at the forest's entrance. In [[Tour de France 2010|2010]] cobble specialist [[Thor Hushovd]] won the third stage with seven cobbled sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cycling News|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/97th-tour-de-france-gt/stage-3/results|title=Carnage on the cobbles!|date=2010-07-06|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=2010-07-06|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100707232151/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/97th-tour-de-france-gt/stage-3/results|archivedate= 7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tour de France 2014|2014]] [[Lars Boom]] won the fifth stage of the Tour near the entrance of the Trouée ahead of [[Jakob Fuglsang]] and [[Vincenzo Nibali]].

[[File:Aluminizing tank.jpg|thumb|Aluminising vacuum chamber at [[Mont Mégantic Observatory]] used for re-coating telescope mirrors.]]

'''Vacuum deposition''' is a family of processes used to deposit layers of material atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule on a solid surface. These processes operate at pressures well below [[atmospheric pressure]] (i.e., [[vacuum]]). The deposited layers can range from a thickness of one atom up to millimeters, forming freestanding structures. Multiple layers of different materials can be used, for example to form [[optical coating]]s. The process can be qualified based on the vapor source; [[physical vapor deposition]] uses a liquid or solid source and [[chemical vapor deposition]] uses a chemical vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1533/9780857094698.1|chapter=Overview of coating technologies|title=Surface Modification by Solid State Processing|pages=1–24|year=2014|last1=Quintino|first1=Luisa|isbn=9780857094681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The vacuum environment may serve one or more purposes:
* reducing the particle density so that the [[mean free path]] for collision is long
* reducing the particle density of undesirable atoms and molecules (contaminants)
* providing a low pressure plasma environment
* providing a means for controlling gas and vapor composition
* providing a means for mass flow control into the processing chamber.

Condensing particles can be generated in various ways:
* thermal evaporation, [[Evaporation (deposition)]]
* [[sputtering]]
* [[cathodic arc deposition|cathodic arc vaporization]]
* [[laser ablation]]
* decomposition of a chemical vapor precursor, [[chemical vapor deposition]]

In reactive deposition, the depositing material reacts either with a component of the gaseous environment (Ti + N → TiN) or with a co-depositing species (Ti + C → TiC). A plasma environment aids in activating gaseous species (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2N) and in decomposition of chemical vapor precursors (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 4H). The plasma may also be used to provide ions for vaporization by sputtering or for bombardment of the substrate for sputter cleaning and for bombardment of the depositing material to densify the structure and tailor properties ([[ion plating]]).

== Types ==
When the vapor source is a liquid or solid the process is called [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD). When the source is a chemical vapor precursor, the process is called [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). The latter has several variants: ''low-pressure chemical vapor deposition'' (LPCVD), [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD), and ''plasma-assisted CVD'' (PACVD). Often a combination of PVD and CVD processes are used in the same or connected processing chambers.

== Applications ==
* [[electric current|Electrical conduction]]: [[metallic film]]s, [[Transparent_conducting_film#Transparent_conducting_oxides|transparent conductive oxides]] (TCOs), [[superconducting film]]s &amp; coatings
* [[Semiconductor]] devices: semiconductor films, electrically insulating films
* [[Solar cell]]s.
* Optical films: [[anti-reflective coating]]s, [[filter (optics)|optical filters]]
* Reflective coatings: [[mirror]]s, [[hot mirror]]s
* [[tribology|Tribological]] coating: hard coatings, erosion resistant coatings, solid film lubricants
* [[Energy conservation]] &amp; generation: [[low emissivity]] glass coatings, solar absorbing coatings, mirrors, solar [[thin film]] [[solar cell|photovoltaic cells]], ''smart'' films
* [[Magnetic film]]s: [[magnetic storage|magnetic recording]]
* [[Diffusion barrier]]: [[gas permeation barrier]]s, [[vapor permeation barrier]]s, [[Solid-state physics|solid state]] [[diffusion barrier]]s
* [[Corrosion]] protection:
* [[automotive industry|Automotive]] applications:  lamp reflectors and trim applications
* Vinyl record pressing, manufacture of gold and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum records]]

A thickness of less than one [[micrometre]] is generally called a [[thin film]] while a thickness greater than one micrometre is called a coating.

The '''Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage''' is a 1963 treaty that governs issues of liability in cases of [[nuclear accident]].
It was concluded at [[Vienna]] on 21 May 1963 and entered into force on 12 November 1977. The convention has been amended by a 1997 protocol. The depository is the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].

As of February 2014, the convention has been ratified by 40 states. [[Colombia]], [[Israel]], [[Morocco]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]] have signed the convention but have not ratified it. [[Slovenia]] has [[denunciation|denounced]] the treaty and withdrawn from it.

{{other uses|Scale (disambiguation)}}
A '''weighing scale''' (or '''weighing balance''') is devices to measure [[weight]] or [[mass]]. They are also known as '''mass scales''', '''weight scales''', '''mass balance''', '''weight balance''', or simply '''scale''', '''balance''', or '''balance scale'''.

The '''traditional scale''' consists of two plates or bowls suspended at equal distance of a [[Lever|fulcrum]]. One plate holds an object of unknown [[mass]] (or [[weight]]), while known masses are added to the other plate until [[static equilibrium]] is achieved and the plates level off, which happens when the mass on each plates is equal. A '''spring scale''' will make use of a [[spring (device)|spring]] of known [[stiffness]] to determine mass (or weight). Suspending a certain mass will extend the spring by a certain amount depending on the spring's stiffness (or [[spring constant]]). The heavier the object, the more the spring stretches, as described in [[Hooke's law]]. Other types of scale making use of different physical principles also exist.

Some of scales can be [[calibrate]]d to read in units of force (weight) such as [[newton (unit)|newtons]] instead of units of mass such as [[kilogram]]s. Scales and balances are widely used in commerce and many are sold and packaged by mass.

==Balance scales==&lt;!--Linked from [[Law]]--&gt;
===History===
[[File:Weighing of the heart3.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' depicts a scene in which a scribe's heart is weighed against the [[Maat|feather of truth]].]]
The  balance scale is such a simple device that its usage likely far predates the evidence. What has allowed archaeologists to link artifacts to weighing scales are the stones for determining absolute mass. The balance scale itself was probably used to determine relative mass long before absolute mass.&lt;ref name="averyweigh-tronix1947"/&gt;

The oldest evidence for the existence of weighing scales dates to c. 2400–1800 B.C. in the Indus River valley (modern-day Pakistan). Prior to that, no banking was performed due to lack of scales. Uniform, polished stone cubes discovered in early settlements were probably used as mass-setting stones in balance scales. Although the cubes bear no markings, their masses are multiples of a common denominator. The cubes are made of many different kinds of stones with varying densities. Clearly their mass, not their size or other characteristics, was a factor in sculpting these cubes.&lt;ref name="jstor44"&gt;{{cite web|author=Petruso, Karl M|title="Early Weights and Weighing in Egypt and the Indus Valley", M Bulletin |publisher=Boston Museum of Fine  Arts|volume=79|year=1981|pages=44–51|jstor=4171634|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, scales can be traced to around 1878 B.C., but their usage probably extends much earlier. Carved stones bearing marks denoting mass and the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for gold have been discovered, which suggests that Egyptian merchants had been using an established system of mass measurement to catalog gold shipments or gold mine yields. Although no actual scales from this era have survived, many sets of weighing stones as well as murals depicting the use of balance scales suggest widespread usage.&lt;ref name="jstor44"/&gt; In China, the earliest weighing balance excavated was from a tomb of the [[State of Chu]] of the Chinese [[Warring States Period]] dating back to the 3rd to 4th century BC in Mount Zuojiagong near [[Changsha]], Hunan. The balance was made of wood and used bronze masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ancient Engineers' Inventions: Precursors of the Present (History of Mechanism and Machine Science) |last=Rossi |first=Cesare  |last2=Russo  |first2=Flavio  |last3=Russo  |first3=Ferruccio  |year=2009 |isbn=978-9048122523 |publication-date=May 11, 2009 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reconstruction Designs of Lost Ancient Chinese Machinery |last= Yan |first=Hong-Sen |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |publication-date=November 18, 2007 |pages=53-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations on the balance scale, including devices like the cheap and inaccurate ''bismar'' (unequal-armed scales),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isasc.org/Tutorial/Scale-Types.html |title=ISASC |publisher=ISASC |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to see common usage by c. 400 B.C. by many small merchants and their customers. A plethora of scale varieties each boasting advantages and improvements over one another appear throughout recorded history, with such great inventors as Leonardo da Vinci lending a personal hand in their development.&lt;ref name="averyweigh-tronix2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.4 |title=The History of Weighing |publisher=Averyweigh-tronix.com |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302145347/http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/main.aspx?p=1.1.3.4 |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even with all the advances in weighing scale design and development, all scales until the seventeenth century AD were variations on the balance scale.  The standardization of the weights used – and ensuring traders used the correct weights – was a considerable preoccupation of governments throughout this time.

The original form of a balance consisted of a beam with a fulcrum at its center. For highest accuracy, the fulcrum would consist of a sharp V-shaped pivot seated in a shallower V-shaped bearing. To determine the mass of the object, a combination of reference masses was hung on one end of the beam while the object of unknown mass was hung on the other end (see [[balance (ability)|balance]] and [[steelyard balance]]). For high precision work, such as empirical chemistry, the center beam balance is still one of the most accurate technologies available, and is commonly used for calibrating test masses.

=== Mechanical balances===
The '''balance''' (also '''balance scale''', '''beam balance''' and '''laboratory balance''') was the first mass measuring instrument invented.&lt;ref name="averyweigh-tronix1947"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/download.aspx?did=6249 |title=Download – A Short History to Weighing: AWTX Museum Book |publisher=Averyweigh-tronix.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302145357/http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/download.aspx?did=6249 |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its traditional form, it consists of a pivoted horizontal [[lever]] with arms of equal length{{spaced ndash}}the [[Beam (structure)|beam]]{{spaced ndash}}and a weighing pan&lt;ref&gt;Or "scale", "scalepan" or the obsolete "basin" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FuAwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1069&amp;dq=bason+balance+scale&amp;lr= ''A Practical Dictionary of the English and German Languages'' (1869), p.&amp;nbsp;1069]).&lt;/ref&gt; suspended from each arm (hence the plural name "''scales''{{-"}} for a weighing instrument). The unknown mass is placed in one pan and standard masses are added to the other pan until the beam is as close to [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] as possible. In precision balances, a more accurate determination of the mass is given by the position of a sliding mass moved along a graduated scale. Technically, a balance compares [[weight]] rather than mass, but, in a given [[gravitational field]] (such as [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]), the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, so the standard masses used with balances are usually labeled in [[units of mass]] (e.g. [[Gram|g]] or [[Kilogram|kg]]).

[[File:1KG weight India.jpg|thumb|left|1KG Mass used in India]]


Unlike spring-based scales, balances are used for the precision measurement of mass as their accuracy is not affected by variations in the local gravitational field. (On Earth, for example, these can amount to ±0.5% between locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodgeman |first=Charles, Ed. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 44th Ed. |publisher=Chemical Rubber Publishing Co. |year=1961 |location=Cleveland, USA |pages= |url= |doi= |isbn=}} pp.&amp;nbsp;3480–3485.&lt;/ref&gt;) A change in the strength of the gravitational field caused by moving the balance does not change the measured mass, because the [[Moment (physics)|moments of force]] on either side of the beam are affected equally. A balance will render an accurate measurement of mass at any location experiencing a constant gravity or acceleration.

Very [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] measurements are achieved by ensuring that the balance's [[fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] is essentially [[friction]]-free (a [[knife]] edge is the traditional solution), by attaching a [[wikt:pointer|pointer]] to the beam which [[Amplifier|amplifies]] any [[Absolute deviation|deviation]] from a balance position; and finally by using the [[lever]] principle, which allows [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] masses to be applied by [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of a small mass along the measuring arm of the beam, as described above. For greatest accuracy, there needs to be an allowance for the [[buoyancy]] in air, whose effect depends on the densities of the masses involved.

[[File:Balance scales in China 02.jpg|thumb|Aluminum, mass-produced balance scale ([[steelyard balance]]) sold and used throughout China: the scale can be inverted and held by the larger ring beneath the user's right hand to produce greater leverage for heavier loads ([[Hainan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]])]]

To reduce the need for large reference masses, an off-center beam can be used. A balance with an off-center beam can be almost as accurate as a scale with a center beam, but the off-center beam requires special reference masses and cannot be intrinsically checked for accuracy by simply swapping the contents of the pans as a center-beam balance can. To reduce the need for small graduated reference masses, a sliding weight called a poise can be installed so that it can be positioned along a calibrated scale. A poise adds further intricacies to the calibration procedure, since the exact mass of the poise must be adjusted to the exact lever ratio of the beam.

For greater convenience in placing large and awkward loads, a platform can be ''floated'' on a cantilever beam system which brings the proportional force to a ''noseiron'' bearing; this pulls on a ''stilyard rod'' to transmit the reduced force to a conveniently sized beam.
 
One still sees this design in portable beam balances of 500&amp;nbsp;kg capacity which are commonly used in harsh environments without electricity, as well as in the lighter duty mechanical bathroom scale (which actually uses a spring scale, internally). The additional pivots and bearings all reduce the accuracy and complicate calibration; the float system must be corrected for corner errors before the span is corrected by adjusting the balance beam and poise. &lt;!-- Such systems are typically accurate to at best 1/10,000 of their capacity, unless they are expensively engineered.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} unnecessary as technical finepoint ---&gt;

[[File:Balance scale IMGP9755.jpg|thumb|A [[Roberval balance]]. The pivots of the parallelogram understructure makes it insensitive to load positioning away from center, so improves its accuracy, and ease of use. ]]

====Roberval balance====
{{main article|Roberval balance}}
In 1669 the Frenchman [[Gilles Personne de Roberval]] presented a new kind of balance scale to the French Academy of Sciences.  This scale consisted of a pair of vertical columns separated by a pair of equal-length arms and pivoting in the center of each arm from a central vertical column, creating a parallelogram.  From the side of each vertical column a peg extended.  To the amazement of observers, no matter where Roberval hung two equal weight along the peg, the scale still balanced.  In this sense, the scale was revolutionary: it evolved into the more-commonly encountered form consisting of two pans placed on vertical column located above the fulcrum and the parallelogram below them.  The advantage of the Roberval design is that no matter where equal weights are placed in the pans, the scale will still balance.

[[File:Gear balance.jpg|thumb|left|A gear balance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.besslerwheel.com/forum/download.php?id=14967&amp;order=user_id&amp;sid=e055c056e43d2d7da87d910766c9ff39 A rare document on "gear balance".]&lt;/ref&gt;: A = Axle, F = Frame, G = Generator, GL = geared linkage, WL = weighted lever; counter weight added for balance, all the gear linkages free running on the rotating frame]]Further developments have included a "gear balance" in which the parallelogram is replaced by any odd number of interlocking gears greater than one, with alternating gears of the same size and with the central gear fixed to a stand and the outside gears fixed to pans, as well as the "sprocket gear balance" consisting of a bicycle-type chain looped around an odd number of [[sprocket]]s with the central one fixed and the outermost two free to pivot and attached to a pan.

Because it has more moving joints which add friction, the Roberval balance is consistently less accurate than the traditional beam balance, but for many purposes this is compensated for by its usability.

====Microbalance====
{{main article|Microbalance}}
A microbalance is an instrument capable of making precise measurements of mass of objects of relatively small mass: of the order of a million parts of a gram.

====Analytical balance====
{{main article|Analytical balance}}
[[File:Analytical balance mettler ae-260.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mettler digital analytical balance with 0.1 mg readability]]
An '''analytical balance''' is a class of balance designed to measure small [[mass]] in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an analytical balance (0.1 [[milligram|mg]] or better)  is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that [[dust]] does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically [[vented balance safety enclosure]], which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1&amp;nbsp;μg without fluctuations or loss of product.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Also, the sample must be at [[room temperature]] to prevent natural [[convection]] from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading.  Single-pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass on the same side of the beam to which the sample is added.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Electronic analytical scales measure the force needed to counter the mass being measured rather than using actual masses. As such they must have calibration adjustments made to compensate for gravitational differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aandd.jp/support/materials/product_training1_balances.pdf |title=A&amp;D training material|publisher=Sandd.jp |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use an electromagnet to generate a force to counter the sample being measured and outputs the result by measuring the force needed to achieve balance. Such measurement device is called electromagnetic force restoration sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.sensorsmag.com/articles/0602/27/main.shtml |title=Sensors Mag |publisher=Archives.sensorsmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pendulum balance scales====
Pendulum type scales do not use springs. This design uses pendulums and operates as a balance and is unaffected by differences in gravity. An example of application of this design are scales made by the Toledo Scale Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utoledo.edu/library/canaday/findingaids1/MSS-153.pdf |title=Finding Aid : The Toledo Scale Collection |publisher=Utoledo.edu |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Probative]]--&gt;
The scales (specifically, a two-pan, beam balance) are one of the traditional symbols of [[justice]], as wielded by statues of [[Lady Justice]]. This corresponds to the use in metaphor of matters being "held in the balance". It has its origins in ancient Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Scales are also the symbol for the astrological sign [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].

==Force-measuring (weight) scales==

===History===
[[File:A Simple Balance.jpg|thumb|A simple balance from the 19th century]]
Although records dating to the 1700s refer to spring scales for measuring mass, the earliest design for such a device dates to 1770 and credits Richard Salter, an early scale-maker.&lt;ref name="jstor44"/&gt; Spring scales came into wide usage in the United Kingdom after 1840 when R. W. Winfield developed the candlestick scale for weighing letters and packages, required after the introduction of the [[Uniform Penny Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brass, Brian|year=2006|title="Candlesticks, Part 1", Equilibrium, No. 1|pages=3099–3109|url=http://www.isasc.org/Equilibrium/Back_Issues/2006-1.pdf|publisher=Isasc.org|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postal workers could work more quickly with spring scales than balance scales, because they could be read instantaneously and did not have to be carefully balanced with each measurement.

By the 1940s, various electronic devices were being attached to these designs to make readings more accurate.&lt;ref name="jstor44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="averyweigh-tronix2"/&gt; [[Load cell]]s – transducers that convert force to an electrical signal – have their beginnings as early as the late nineteenth century, but it was not until the late twentieth century that their widespread usage became economically and technologically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omega.com/prodinfo/loadcells.html |title=Load Cells |publisher=Omega.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical scales===
A mechanical scale or balance is used to describe a weighing device that is used to measure the mass, force [[exertion]], tension and resistance of an object without the need of a power supply. Types of mechanical scale include spring scales, hanging scales, [[Triple beam balance|triple beam balances]] and force gauges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inscale-scales.co.uk/blog/guide-to-choosing-best-mechanical-scale/|title=A Guide to Choosing the Best Mechanical Scale|last=|first=|date=|work=Inscale Scales ?&gt;|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206203111/https://www.inscale-scales.co.uk/blog/guide-to-choosing-best-mechanical-scale/|archive-date=2017-12-06|dead-url=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spring scales====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
{{main article|Spring scale}}
A [[spring scale]] measures mass by reporting the distance that a [[spring (device)|spring]] deflects under a load. This contrasts to a ''balance'', which compares the [[torque]] on the arm due to a sample weight to the [[torque]] on the arm due to a standard reference mass using a horizontal [[lever]]. Spring scales measure [[force]], which is the [[tension (physics)|tension]] [[force]] of constraint acting on an object, opposing the local [[gravity|force of gravity.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inscale-scales.co.uk/blog/guide-to-choosing-best-mechanical-scale/|title=A Guide to Choosing the Best Mechanical Scale - Inscale|last=|first=|date=|website=Inscale Scales|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206203111/https://www.inscale-scales.co.uk/blog/guide-to-choosing-best-mechanical-scale/|archive-date=2017-12-06|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually [[Calibration|calibrated]] so that measured force translates to mass at earth's gravity. The object to be weighed can be simply hung from the spring or set on a pivot and bearing platform.

In a spring scale, the spring either stretches (as in a hanging scale in the produce department of a [[grocery store]]) or compresses (as in a simple bathroom scale). By [[Hooke's law]], every spring has a proportionality constant that relates how hard it is pulled to how far it stretches. Weighing scales use a [[spring (device)|spring]] with a known spring constant (see [[Hooke's law]]) and measure the displacement of the spring by any variety of mechanisms to produce an estimate of the [[gravity|gravitational]] force applied by the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-law.html|title=What is Hooke's Law?|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rack and [[pinion]] mechanisms are often used to convert the linear spring motion to a dial reading.

Spring scales have two sources of error that balances do not: the measured mass varies with the strength of the local gravitational force (by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth), and the elasticity of the measurement spring can vary slightly with temperature. With proper manufacturing and setup, however, spring scales can be rated as legal for commerce.  To remove the temperature error, a commerce-legal spring scale must either have temperature-compensated springs or be used at a fairly constant temperature. To eliminate the effect of gravity variations, a commerce-legal spring scale must be calibrated where it is used.

====Hydraulic or pneumatic scale====
It is also common in high-capacity applications such as crane scales to use hydraulic force to sense mass. The test force is applied to a piston or diaphragm and transmitted through hydraulic lines to a dial indicator based on a [[pressure gauge|Bourdon tube]] or electronic sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=California Department of Food and Agriculture Division of Measurement Standards|title=A brief history of weights and measures|url=https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/dms/trainingmodules/Module_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital scales===
Electronic digital scales display weight as a number, usually on a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD).  They are versatile because they may perform calculations on the measurement and transmit it to other digital devices.  In a digital scale, the force of the weight causes a spring to deform, and the amount of deformation is measured by one or more [[transducer]]s called [[strain gauge]]s.  A strain gauge is a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] whose [[electrical resistance]] changes when its length changes.  Strain gauges have limited capacity and larger digital scales may use a [[hydraulic]] transducer called a [[load cell]] instead.  A voltage is applied to the device, and the weight causes the current through it to change.  The current is converted to a digital number by an [[analog-to-digital converter]], translated by digital logic to the correct units, and displayed on the display. Usually the device is run by a [[microprocessor]] chip.   

====Digital bathroom scale====
A digital bathroom scale is a scale on the floor which a person stands on.  The weight is shown on an LED or LCD display.   The digital electronics may do more than just display weight, it may calculate body fat, [[body mass index|BMI]], lean mass, muscle mass, and water ratio.  Some modern bathroom scales are wirelessly connected and have features like smartphone integration, cloud storage, and fitness tracking.    They are usually powered by a button cell, or battery of AA or AAA size.

==== Digital kitchen scale ====
Digital kitchen scales are used for weighing food in a kitchen during cooking. These are usually light-weight and compact.

====Strain gauge scale====
In electronic versions of spring scales, the deflection of a beam supporting the unknown mass is measured using a [[strain gauge]], which is a length-sensitive [[electrical resistance]]. The capacity of such devices is only limited by the resistance of the beam to deflection. The results from several supporting locations may be added electronically, so this technique is suitable for determining the mass of very heavy objects, such as trucks and rail cars, and is used in a modern [[weighbridge]].

====Supermarket and other retail scale====
These scales are used in the modern [[bakery]], [[grocery]], [[delicatessen]], [[seafood]], [[meat]], [[produce]] and other perishable goods departments. Supermarket scales can print labels and receipts, mark mass and count, unit price, total price and in some cases tare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aflak Electronics Weighing Scale|url=http://aflak.com.sa/newweb/html/eng/weighingscale.html|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern supermarket scales print an [[RFID]] tag that can be used to track the item for tampering or returns. In most cases, these types of scales have a sealed calibration so that the reading on the display is correct and cannot be tampered with. In the USA, the scales are certified by the [[National Type Evaluation Program]] (NTEP), in South Africa by the [[South African Bureau of Standards]] and in the UK by the [[International Organization of Legal Metrology]].

===Testing and certification===
{{see also|Verification and validation}}
[[File:Inspected scale 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Scales used for trade purposes in the [[Florida]], as this scale at the checkout in a [[cafeteria]], are inspected for accuracy by the [[FDACS|FDACS's Bureau of Weights and Measures]].]]

Most countries regulate the design and servicing of scales used for commerce. This has tended to cause scale technology to lag behind other technologies because expensive regulatory hurdles are involved in introducing new designs. Nevertheless, there has been{{When|date=September 2015}} a trend to "digital load cells" which are actually strain-gauge cells with dedicated analog converters and networking built into the cell itself. Such designs have reduced the service problems inherent with combining and transmitting a number of 20 millivolt signals in hostile environments.

Government regulation generally requires periodic inspections by licensed technicians, using masses whose calibration is traceable to an approved laboratory. Scales intended for non-trade use, such as those used in bathrooms, doctor's offices, kitchens (portion control), and price estimation (but not official price determination) may be produced, but must by law be labelled "Not Legal for Trade" to ensure that they are not re-purposed in a way that jeopardizes commercial interest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In the United States, the document describing how scales must be designed, installed, and used for commercial purposes is [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] ''Handbook 44''. Legal For Trade (LFT) certification usually approve the readability as repeatability/10 to ensure a maximum margin of error of 10%.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Because gravity varies by over 0.5% over the surface of the earth, the [[Units of weight|distinction between force due to gravity and mass]] is relevant for accurate calibration of scales for commercial purposes. Usually the goal is to measure the [[mass]] of the sample rather than its force due to gravity at that particular location.

Traditional mechanical balance-beam scales intrinsically measured mass. But ordinary electronic scales intrinsically measure the [[gravitational force]] between the sample and the earth, i.e. the [[weight]] of the sample, which varies with location. So such a scale has to be re-calibrated after installation, for that specific location, in order to obtain an accurate indication of mass.

====Sources of error====
Some of the sources of [[errors and residuals in statistics|error]] in weighing are:
* [[Buoyancy]] – Objects in air develop a buoyancy force that is directly proportional to the volume of air displaced. The difference in density of air due to barometric pressure and temperature creates errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrew.ucsd.edu/co2qc/handbook/sop21.pdf |title=Applying air buoyancy corrections |publisher=Andrew.ucsd.edu |date=September 29, 1997 |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907221014/http://andrew.ucsd.edu/co2qc/handbook/sop21.pdf |archivedate=September 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Error in mass of reference weight
* Air gusts, even small ones, which push the scale up or down
* [[Friction]] in the moving components that causes the scale to reach equilibrium at a different configuration than a frictionless equilibrium should occur.
* Settling airborne dust contributing to the weight
* Mis-calibration over time, due to drift in the circuit's accuracy, or temperature change
* Mis-aligned mechanical components due to [[thermal expansion]] or contraction of components
* [[Magnetic fields]] acting on ferrous components
* Forces from [[electrostatic field]]s, for example, from feet shuffled on carpets on a dry day
* Chemical reactivity between air and the substance being weighed (or the balance itself, in the form of [[corrosion]])
* [[Condensation]] of atmospheric water on cold items
* [[Evaporation]] of water from wet items
* [[Convection]] of air from hot or cold items
* Gravitational differences for a scale which measures force, but not for a balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/nbs93-4.pdf |title=Practical Uncertainty Limits to the Mass Determination of a Piston-Gage Weight |format=PDF |publisher=Nist.gov|date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vibration and seismic disturbances

==Hybrid spring and balance scales==

[[File:Elastica arm scale.jpg|thumb|The prototype of an elastic arm scale measuring a mass.]]
===Elastic arm scale===

In 2014 a concept of hybrid scale was introduced, the elastically deformable arm scale,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni/paper/elastic_scale_bosi_misseroni_dalcorso_bigoni.pdf F. Bosi, D. Misseroni, F. Dal Corso and D. Bigoni, An Elastica Arm Scale. Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 470, 20140232.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a [[Steelyard balance|steelyard]]) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless sliding sleeve. The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because [[Configurational mechanics|configurational forces]] develop at the two edges of the sleeve as a consequence of both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear [[kinematics]] of the elastic rod.  This mass measuring device can also work without a [[counterweight]].

'''Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative Ltd''' is a [[Community wind energy|community-owned]] [[Industrial and Provident Society]] that owns 100% of the Westmill Wind Farm which is an onshore [[wind farm]] near the village of [[Watchfield]] in the [[Vale of White Horse]], [[England]]. It has five 1.3 MW [[wind turbine]]s erected in a line along the disused runway of the former [[RAF Watchfield]]. The wind farm has a power output of up to 6.5 MW, projected to produce as much electricity in a year as used by more than 2,500 homes. The turbines were erected in 8 days and the first fully month of generation was March 2008. It has an open day usually in June each year.

The [[wind energy cooperative]] was established in 2004 and has more than 2,000 members. The wind farm is intended to help to reduce dependence on [[fossil fuel]]s whose emissions are considered to contribute to [[climate change]]. In 2007 Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative received a [[Schumacher Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schumacher.org.uk/schumacher_award_2007.htm Adam Twine: Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westmill.coop/westmill_windfarm.asp Westmill Wind Farm]&lt;/ref&gt; Westmill Wind Farm was originally developed by Adam Twine who was in the later stages assisted by [[Energy4All]], a company founded to enable community owned renewable energy projects by [[Baywind Energy Co-operative]].

Westmill Sustainable Energy Trust (WeSET) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weset.org WeSET www.weset.org]&lt;/ref&gt; is a charity formed in 2010 that receives 0.5% of the wind farm's revenue each year. Its objective is to encourage and promote the deployment of sustainable energy, in particular (but not exclusively) within a 25-mile radius from Westmill Wind Farm. Its website has educational material and details of how to visit Westmill Wind Farm.

The community-owned [[Westmill Solar Park]] is located on an adjoining site. [[Westmill Woodland Burial Ground]], a [[natural burial]] site, is also close to the wind farm.
