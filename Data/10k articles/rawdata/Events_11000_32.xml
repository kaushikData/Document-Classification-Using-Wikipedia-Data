Blue denotes a Democratic hold, dark red denotes a Republican hold, and light red denotes a Republican pickup.]]

The '''2003 Texas redistricting''' refers to a controversial mid-decade state plan that defined new [[redistricting|Congressional districts]]. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2004|2004 elections]], this redistricting resulted in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] taking a majority of [[Texas|Texas's]] [[United States House of Representatives|House]] seats for the first time since [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Opponents challenged the plan in three suits, combined when the case went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry]]'' (2006).

On June 28, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the statewide redistricting as constitutional, with the exception of [[Texas' 23rd congressional district]], which it held was [[gerrymander|racially gerrymandered]] in violation of Section 2 of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]], apparently to try to protect a Hispanic Republican representative. A three-judge Federal District Court redrew District 23 and four other nearby districts: 15, 21, 25, and 28. In November 2006, a special election was held in the new districts. All incumbents won except in District 23. There, Republican incumbent Henry Bonilla was forced into a December run-off after a jungle primary; he lost to Democratic challenger [[Ciro Rodriguez]].

==Overview==
After [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] won control of the [[Texas Legislature|Texas state legislature]] in 2002 for the first time in 130 years, they intended to work toward establishing a majority of [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seats from Texas held by their party. After the 2002 election, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had a 17–15 edge in House seats representing Texas, although the state's voters voted for Republicans in congressional races by a 55–45 margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 Election Statistics |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2002/2002Stat.htm#43 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jkP17Q5S?url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2002/2002Stat.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C, introduced in the Texas House by Representative [[Phil King (Texas politician)|Phil King]] of [[Weatherford, Texas|Weatherford]]. In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats' 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=05-204|title=Cases and Codes|publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested they had considerably surpassed their margin of preference among voters.

On June 28, 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion that threw out one of the districts in the plan as a violation of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] because of [[racial gerrymandering]]. It ordered the lower court to produce a remedial plan, which it did in Plan 1440C. The Supreme Court ruling was not considered to seriously threaten Republican gains from the 2004 elections.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/washington/28cnd-scotus.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|work=The New York Times|title=Justices Back Most G.O.P. Changes to Texas Districts|date=June 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991–2003 evolution and Tom DeLay's role==
The Texas Legislature had last enacted a Congressional redistrict plan in 1991, following the 1990 census. At the time, Democrats held both the governor's seat (with [[Ann Richards]]) and control of both state legislative branches. By the 2000 census, Republicans had recaptured the state executive branch, having elected Governor [[George W. Bush]] and Lt. Governor [[Rick Perry]], as well as control of the Texas Senate. Democrats maintained their majority in the Texas House of Representatives.

In 2001, Democrats and Republicans were unable to agree on new district maps to respond to the latest census. The Republican minority recommended the issue be submitted to a panel of judges, per state law. The judges, being "hesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of another",&lt;ref name=test&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-204.pdf], League of United Latin American Citizens, et al. v. Perry, Governor of Texas, et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; drew a new map which left many of the 1991 districts intact. It yielded a 17 to 15 Democratic majority in Texas's US House delegation after the 2002 elections.

For Texas House and Senate redistricting, the [[Texas Constitution]] provides that the [[Legislative Redistricting Board (Texas)|Legislative Redistricting Board]] (LRB) convenes when the state legislature is unable to approve, for either body, a redistricting plan in the first legislative session following the National Census. In June 2001, the task of redistricting passed to the LRB after the state legislature failed to pass a redistricting plan for either the House or Senate.&lt;ref name="Bickerstaff46"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bickerstaff|first=Steve|title=Lines in the Sand: Congressional Redistricting in Texas and the Downfall of Tom Delay|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2007|isbn=0-292-71474-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LRB consists of five statewide officials, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House, the Attorney General, the State Comptroller, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Four of these five officials were Republican, and the resulting redistricting plans were seen as favorable to Republicans.

In September 2001, then [[House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]] (TX-22) organized [[Texans for a Republican Majority]] (TRMPAC), a [[political action committee]] designed to gather campaign funds for Republican candidates throughout Texas—in particular with an eye to gaining control of the House Speakership, then held by Democrat [[Pete Laney]]. TRMPAC was modeled closely after DeLay's [[Americans for a Republican Majority]] (ARMPAC), a federal-level organization created to raise funds for Republicans during the 2000 national elections.&lt;ref name="Bickerstaff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bickerstaff|first=Steve|title=Lines in the Sand: Congressional Redistricting in Texas and the Downfall of Tom Delay|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2007|isbn=0-292-71474-2|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, as has been well documented in the media, DeLay played a key role in the ongoing Texas redistricting effort. 

In 2002, after winning a majority of seats in the State House of Representatives, Republicans gained complete control of the legislature. With the urging of Governor [[Rick Perry]] and Tom Delay, who had assumed the position of US House Majority Leader in January 2003, the Republican majority introduced legislation to redraw the court-drawn districts from 2001.

Lacking sufficient votes to stop the new plan, 52 Democratic members fled the state to prevent a quorum in the Texas House, effectively preventing a vote from taking place during the regular session. The 52 Democrats, known as the "[[Killer Ds]]", returned to the state when time had expired for the bill. But in the summer of 2003, Governor [[Rick Perry]] called a series of special legislative sessions in order to continue the redistricting effort. With control of more than one-third of the seats in the State Senate, the Democrats invoked a [[two-thirds rule]], preventing a vote on the redistricting plan during the first special session. Half an hour after ending the first special session, Governor Perry called a second special session. This time, due to the calendaring of the redistricting bill, the two-thirds rule would not come into play. Eleven of the twelve Democratic state senators left the state to prevent a quorum. The Senators assembled in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] and were referred to as the [[Texas Eleven]]. After a month-long stand off, Senator [[John Whitmire]] returned to the State Senate. The redistricting plan was passed in a third special legislative session. After the 2004 elections, Texas' U.S. House delegation had a Republican majority, 21-11, for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The demographics of the Republican Party in Texas, and across the South, had markedly changed by then, being made up primarily of conservative whites.

An article in the March 6, 2006, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, written by [[Jeffrey Toobin]], quoted Texas's junior Republican Senator [[John Cornyn]] as saying, "Everybody who knows Tom knows that he's a fighter and a competitor, and he saw an opportunity to help the Republicans stay in power in Washington." Toobin reported that DeLay left Washington and returned to Texas to oversee the project while final voting was underway in the state legislature, and that "several times during the long days of negotiating sessions, DeLay personally shuttled proposed maps among House and Senate offices in Austin."&lt;ref name = "DrawingTheLine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=Drawing the Line – Will Tom Delay's Redistricting in Texas Cost Him His Seat?|work=The New Yorker|date=February 6, 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/06/060306fa_fact|accessdate=February 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' editor Paul Burka, writing in the magazine's May 2006 issue, characterized the measure as "DeLay's midcensus congressional redistricting plan" and said, "[I]n order to increase his Republican majority in Congress, he [DeLay] resorted to a midcensus redistricting plan."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Burka, ''Texas Monthly'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Justice Department review ==
[[Image:TravisCountyDistricts.png|thumb|right|300px|U.S. congressional districts covering [[Travis County, Texas]] (outlined in red) in 2002, left, and 2004, right. In 2003, the majority of Republicans in the Texas legislature redistricted the state. The plan diluted the voting power of Democratic residents of this county by distributing its residential areas among majority-Republican districts.]]

At the time of the 2003 redistricting, Texas was under the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|pre-clearance]] requirements of Section 5 of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The State of Texas obtained pre-clearance from the US Department of Justice for its 2003 Congressional redistricting plan.

But in December 2005, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported, "Justice Department lawyers concluded that the landmark Texas congressional redistricting plan spearheaded by Rep. Tom DeLay violated the Voting Rights Act, according to a previously undisclosed memo," uncovered by the newspaper.&lt;ref name="DOJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/01/AR2005120101927.html|title=Justice Staff Saw Texas Districting As Illegal|work=The Washington Post|date=December 2, 2005|accessdate=June 20, 2010|first=Dan|last=Eggen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document, endorsed by six Justice Department attorneys, said
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he redistricting plan illegally diluted black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts ... The State of Texas has not met its burden in showing that the proposed congressional redistricting plan does not have a discriminatory effect.&lt;ref name="DOJ"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, according to the ''Post'', Justice Department lawyers "found that Republican lawmakers and state officials who helped craft the proposal were aware it posed a high risk of being ruled discriminatory compared with other options". Texas legislators proceeded with the new plan "because it would maximize the number of Republican federal lawmakers in the state".&lt;ref name="DOJ"/&gt;

The article noted that senior [[political appointee]]s in the Justice Department had overridden the position and findings by the Civil Rights Division's career civil service staff lawyers and analysts, and approved the redistricting.&lt;ref name="DOJ"/&gt;

==Criticism of the plan==
Democrats criticized the 2003 redistricting plan, citing the lack of precedent for redistricting twice in a decade (a so-called "mid-decade" redistricting) and argued that it was conducted for purely political gain by the Republican Party. Public comments by some Republicans lent support to this latter claim, since many discussed their expectations of picking up several Republican seats. Some minority groups argued the plan was unconstitutional, as it would dilute their influence and possibly violate the "[[one-person-one-vote]]" principle of redistricting. Republicans argued that, since most voters in the state were Republicans, that they be represented by a majority-Republican Congressional delegation in Washington.

The 2004 elections under the new redistricting resulted in Texas Republicans gaining a majority of House seats by a 21–11 margin, nearly a 2/1 ratio in terms of seats (66% of seats). This was significantly larger than the 61/38 voting ratio of Republicans to Democrats in the Presidential race. It was much more lopsided than the total results in the 32 House races, which resulted in 56/40/3 for Republican to Democratic voting (the two main parties did not both run candidates in four districts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/tx |title=Texas 2004 Election Results |quote=GOP 3,833,932; Dems 2,709,749; Others 217, 460 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Supreme Court review==
The US Supreme Court issued an opinion on the case in ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry]]'' on June 28, 2006. While the Court said states are free to redistrict as often as desired, the justices ruled that [[Texas's 23rd congressional district]] was invalid, as it violated Section 2 of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] by [[racial gerrymandering]]. This decision required lawmakers to adjust boundaries in line with the Court's ruling.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt;

A three-judge panel, under an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals, oversaw the redistricting. On June 29, 2006, a U.S. District Judge ordered both sides to submit proposed maps by July 14, respond to their opponents' maps by July 21, and be prepared to hold oral arguments on August 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Castro|first=April|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4013182.html|title=July 14 deadline set on redistricting plans|work=Houston Chronicle|date=June 29, 2006|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redistricting targeted Democrats==
The 2003 redistricting targeted ten districts with white Democratic incumbents, avoiding the seven districts with minority Democratic incumbents.&lt;ref name="Bickerstaff98-101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bickerstaff|first=Steve|title=Lines in the Sand: Congressional Redistricting in Texas and the Downfall of Tom Delay|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2007|pages=98–101|isbn=0-292-71474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  '''[[Max Sandlin]]''' ([[Texas's 1st congressional district|TX-1]]) was defeated in [[United States House elections, 2004|2004]] by Republican [[Louie Gohmert]].
*  '''[[Jim Turner (politician)|Jim Turner]]''' ([[Texas's 2nd congressional district|TX-2]]) did not seek reelection in 2004. His seat was won by Republican [[Ted Poe]].
*  '''[[Ralph Hall]]''' ([[Texas's 4th congressional district|TX-4]]) changed his party affiliation to Republican and was reelected in 2004.
*  '''[[Nick Lampson]]''' ([[Texas's 9th congressional district|TX-9]]) was moved to the 2nd District as a result of the redistricting and was defeated by Ted Poe. He relocated to the [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]] area in 2006 and ran for the seat being vacated by [[Tom DeLay]] (who had resigned due to pending [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and [[money laundering]] charges). He won election to the historically Republican [[Texas's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]] that year, but in 2008 he was defeated by the Republican [[Pete Olson]].
*  '''[[Lloyd Doggett]]''' ([[Texas's 10th congressional district|TX-10]]) was moved to the [[Texas's 25th congressional district|25th district]], created as a narrow strip running from Austin south to the Mexican border, and derisively called the "[[fajita]] strip" for containing a majority of Hispanics. Doggett won re-election in the new district after defeating District Court Judge [[Leticia Hinojosa]] from McAllen. After a Supreme Court ruling found the nearby 23rd district violated the [[Voting Rights Act]], the 25th district was redrawn for the 2006 election, where Rep. Doggett again prevailed.
*  '''[[Chet Edwards]]''' ([[Texas's 11th congressional district|TX-11]]) was moved into the [[Texas's 17th congressional district|17th district]], which had a higher percentage of Republican voters in its new form. Despite this, the Democrat Edwards was re-elected in 2004, 2006 and 2008. In 2010 he was defeated by Republican [[Bill Flores]].
*  '''[[Charlie Stenholm]]''' ([[Texas's 17th congressional district|TX-17]]) was shifted into the heavily Republican [[Texas's 19th congressional district|19th district]]. He unsuccessfully ran against that district's Republican incumbent, [[Randy Neugebauer]].
*  '''[[Martin Frost]]''' ([[Texas's 24th congressional district|TX-24]]) saw his district split off into several newly drawn Dallas-area districts intended to favor and elect Republicans. He changed his residency to run in the [[Texas's 32nd congressional district|32nd district]] and lost to the district's Republican incumbent, [[Pete Sessions]]. Frost's old district, in its redrawn form, was won by [[Kenny Marchant]], a Republican state legislator from [[Carrollton, Texas|Carrollton]].
*  '''[[Chris Bell (politician)|Chris Bell]]''' ([[Texas's 25th congressional district|TX-25]]) had his district renumbered as the [[Texas's 9th congressional district|9th district]], which was gerrymandered into a [[minority-majority]] district. Bell lost the Democratic primary to [[Al Green (Texas)|Al Green]], [[NAACP]] president of Texas, who easily won the general election.
*  '''[[Gene Green]]''' ([[Texas's 29th congressional district|TX-29]]) was reelected in 2004. Of the Democrats affected by redistricting, Green is the only one who won reelection without being shifted to another district or changing parties. He was the only white Democrat left among representatives from the Houston area, and he represented a Latino-majority district until his retirement in 2018.

The redistricting appeared intended to protect [[Henry Bonilla]], a Hispanic Republican of [[Texas's 23rd congressional district|TX-23]]. He had faced a stiff challenge from conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Henry Cuellar]] in 2002. It also neutralized liberal Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]]. This was done by putting the two Democrats in the same district and forcing them to run against each other for the Democratic nomination (Cuellar won). 

In 2006, however, the Supreme Court ruling required redrawing the boundaries for TX-23. It resulted in a special election, in which Bonilla faced six Democratic candidates and an independent in a [[jungle primary]]. He was defeated by Democrat [[Ciro Rodriguez]] in the run-off.

'''50/50 Day''' is a free day and global initiative for people to engage in conversation about working towards a more gender-balanced world in all sectors of society: business, politics, culture, home, and more. The first 50/50 Day was May 10, 2017 which had over 11,000 events in 146 countries. Participating groups viewed the twenty minute film, [[50/50 (2016 film)|50/50: Rethinking the Past, Present, and Future of Women in Power]], which explores the 10,000 year history of women + power — from setbacks and uprisings, to the bigger context of where we are today. Participants were also given free printed discussion materials catered to different ages, and joined an online global Q&amp;A conversation featuring 24 speakers including The Honorable [[Joyce Banda]] (Former President of Malawi), [[Margaret Cho]] (Actress and Comedian), The Honorable [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir|Vigdis Finnbogadóttir]] (Former President of Iceland), and [[Eva Longoria]] (Actress and Activist). The next 50/50 Day will be on April 26, 2018. 50/50 Day’s model was based off an annual global day called [[Character Day]]. 

==History==

50/50 Day was co-created in 2017 by [[Tiffany Shlain]], the co-founder of the non-profit Let it Ripple: Mobile Films for Global Change, founder of the [[Webby Awards]], and the co-founder of the [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Gabe|title=Calling All Mensches — It's Time For Your 15 Minutes of Fame/|url=http://forward.com/schmooze/311355/calling-all-mensches-its-time-for-your-15-minutes-of-fame/|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=Forward|date=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Sawyer Steele and Julie Hermelin.&lt;ref name="prochoiceamerica.org" /&gt; 50/50 Day uses the short film, ''50/50: The Past Present &amp; Future of Women + Power'', which explores the 10,000-year history of women and power,&lt;ref name="Marin Independent Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liberatore|first1=Paul|title=Documentary film ‘50/50’ looks at the history of women’s fight for equality|url=http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20161126/NEWS/161129872|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=Marin Independent Journal|date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a starting point for a day-long internet-linked question and answer session with a number of women and men with achievements in their professions and philanthropic work which relate to the topic. Shlain and Let it Ripple produced 50/50 Day, and invited companies, museums, schools, organizations, and homes around the world to screen the film, and then open discussions via a simultaneous online video conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiffany Shlain and 50/50 Day Push for Worldwide Gender Equity|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/forum/2017/05/05/tiffany-shlain-and-5050-day-push-for-worldwide-gender-equity/|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=KQED Radio|date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airport-to-airport mutual aid programs provide expert assistance and material support to an airport that has been affected by a natural or manmade disaster on a voluntary basis from other airports.&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"&gt;IEM Inc. (2012). ''Airport-to-Airport Mutual Aid Program Guidebook''. Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) Report 73. Washington, DC: Transportation Research Board, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AirportsHelpingAirports&gt;Smith, JF, McCosby, F, Wareham, S. (2010). "Airports Helping Airports: Disaster Operations Groups". ''Airport Magazine'', 21(7), pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been described as "airports helping airports." &lt;ref name="WESTDOG. 2007"&gt;WESTDOG. (2007). "WESTDOG Mutual Aid Plan: Airports Helping Airports". Portland, OR: Port of Portland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AirportsHelpingAirports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seadogops.wordpress"&gt;SEADOG. (2013). "Southeast Airports Disaster Operations Group: Airports Helping Airports". [http://seadogops.wordpress/about/]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first example in the world was the Southeast Airports Disaster Operations Group (SEADOG), which was founded in 2004-2005 under the leadership of [[Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport|Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport]] and [[Orlando International Airport]].&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt; The initial emphasis of SEADOG was assistance to airports recovering from hurricanes. SEADOG's first mobilization was to [[Pensacola International Airport]] after [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004. SEADOG's most notable mobilizations were to [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]] and [[Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 and to [[Jack Brooks Regional Airport]] to assist with urban search and rescue operations after [[Hurricane Ike]] hit Galveston and Houston in 2008. More than 20 airports from all over the U.S. contributed assistance through SEADOG after Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt; SEADOG has a dedicated website.&lt;ref name="seadogops.wordpress"/&gt;

In 2007, the Western Airports Disaster Operations Group (WESTDOG) was formed under the leadership of [[Portland International Airport]].&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WESTDOG. 2007"/&gt; WESTDOG's mission was nearly identical to that of SEADOG although WESTDOG's primary focus is earthquakes, but there are minor administrative differences between the two disaster operations groups (DOGs). Unlike SEADOG, joining WESTDOG requires a formal resolution by the airport authority, port authority, city, or county that owns the airport. WESTDOG has a written operations manual&lt;ref name="WESTDOG. 2007"/&gt; and a dedicated website (WESTDOG 2011-2013).

The fundamental principles of airport-to-airport mutual aid are that no one can help an airport as well as someone from another airport, no mandatory requirement to send assistance, no self-deployment, matching of specific needs for skilled airport personnel and equipment to volunteered personnel and equipment, and self-sufficiency of the deployed assistance teams. Since the DOGs are mutual aid programs, there are no financial arrangement built into the program. If an airport deploys through SEADOG or WESTDOG in a disaster that is the subject of a Presidential disaster declaration, then reimbursement and liability coverage under the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Stafford Act]] and using the procedures of the [[Emergency Management Assistance Compact]] (EMAC) apply.&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WESTDOG. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moseng, R. 2013"&gt;Moseng, R. (2013). "Airport to Airport Mutual Aid Programs--Disaster Operations Group Concept". Agenda item 8 at Thirteenth Meeting of Directors of Civil Aviation of the Central Caribbean (C/CAR/DCA/13), Havana, Cuba, 28–31 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Both SEADOG and WESTDOG depend on coordinating airports that volunteer for that role. SEADOG has four airports that coordinate geographic regions and three specialized coordinators for aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), law enforcement and security, and rapid engineering assessment. The airports serving in these roles have indefinite terms. WESTDOG has a primary coordinating airport and a secondary coordinating airport that serve one-year terms, with the secondary airport moving up into the primary role after one year. Both DOGs have created permanent communications systems for the dissemination of alerts and the management of volunteered resources and matching of volunteers to need.&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt; SEADOG and WESTDOG communicate closely and collaborate. They had their first joint SEADOG-WESTDOG Annual Conference at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] on 16–18 October 2013.&lt;ref name="seadogops.wordpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faithgroup.sharepointsite.com"&gt;WESTDOG. (2011-2013). [https://faithgroup.sharepointsite.com/WESTDOG]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "WESTDOG".&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no DOGs in any other region of the United States (IEM et al. 2012). However, airports outside the southeastern and western states have provided aid through SEADOG. Membership in SEADOG or WESTDOG is open to any airport regardless of location in the United States.&lt;ref name="seadogops.wordpress"/&gt;&lt;ref name="faithgroup.sharepointsite.com"/&gt;

There is a third airport-to-airport mutual aid program, the Colorado Aviation Recovery Support Team (CARST). Established by the Colorado Airport Operators Association (CAOA),{{when|date=July 2014}} CARST provides specialized, highly experienced airport and aviation professions to help an airport or community deal with issues involved in recovering from a crash.&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Airport Operators Association. (2009). "Colorado Airports Recovery Resource Program". Presentation to CAOA 2009 Spring Conference. Colorado Springs, CO: CAOA.&lt;/ref&gt; CARST grew out of experiences with the Avjet crash at [[Aspen–Pitkin County Airport|Aspen-Pitken County Airport (ASE/KASE)]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft accident brief: Gulstream III, N303GA, Aspen, CO, {{date|2001-3-29|mdy}} |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |year=2003 |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2003/AAB0203.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407074415/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2003/AAB0203.pdf |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies published a guidebook for how to establish, manage, and sustain an airport-to-airport mutual aid program. It is ACRP Report 73.&lt;ref name="IEM Inc. 2012 pp. 1-3"/&gt;

There are no airport-to-airport mutual aid programs outside the United States, but the feasibility of an airport-to-airport mutual aid program for Latin America and the Caribbean has begun to be considered by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)]] of the [[United Nations|United Nations (UN)]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]], and several other organizations.&lt;ref name="Moseng, R. 2013"/&gt; Many observers have believed that mutual aid could not operate across national borders because of barriers created by legal, language, and cultural differences and delays created by work rules, customs and duties, and immigration. It has been proposed that inclusion of airlines, national agencies, and international agencies and industry associations such as the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), [[Airports Council International]] (ACI), and [[American Association of Airport Executives]] (AAAE) can overcome such barriers by sharing their day-to-day expertise operating internationally.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Formalization of the proposal is expected in 2014.&lt;ref name="Moseng, R. 2013"/&gt; If the DOG for Latin America and the Caribbean is implemented in full or as a pilot project in a subregion such as the Caribbean Basin or Central America, it will probably be the first cross-border airport-to-airport mutual aid program in the world outside the United States.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

An '''algorave''' is an event where people dance to music generated from algorithms, often using [[live coding]] techniques, and short for "algorithmic rave."&lt;ref name="livecoding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/blog/article/16150/1/what-on-earth-is-livecoding|title=What on earth is livecoding?|author=Dazed|work=Dazed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex McLean]] of [[Slub (band)|Slub]] and [[Nick Collins (composer)|Nick Collins]] coined the word "algorave", with the first event to be held under that name taking place in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Cheshire

An '''algorave''' is an event where people dance to music generated from algorithms, often using [[live coding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="livecoding"/&gt; Algoraves can include a range of styles, including a complex form of minimal techno, and the movement has been described as a meeting point of hacker philosophy, geek culture, and clubbing.&lt;ref name="wired201309"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/09/play/algorave|title=Hacking meets clubbing with the 'algorave'|work=Wired UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although algorave musicians have been compared with DJs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/culture/77242/programmation-dj-musique-algorithme|title=Les programmeurs sont les nouveaux DJ|work=Slate.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are in fact live musicians or improvisers, creating music live, usually by writing or modifying code, rather than mixing recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diprosper.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/algoravestuding-the-relation-between-digital-and-analogue-ways/|title=Algorave|work=in-corporeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an algorave the computer musician may not be the main point of focus for the audience and instead attention may be centered on a screen that displays [[live coding]], that is the process of writing source code, so the audience can not just dance or listen to the music generated by the source code but also to see the process of programming.

==History==
Algorithmic approaches have long been applied in electronic dance music from the 1970s when [[Brian Eno]] established randomised musical practises which evolved into [[generative music]] over the course of his long career. This in turn influenced [[rave culture]] and [[techno]] of the 1990s by [[Farmers Manual]], [[Autechre]], and [[Aphex Twin]]. The [[Anti EP]] was an explicit response to the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] - specifically the track "flutter" as a means of creating "non-repetitive beats" at raves which had been outlawed by the wording of the Act. The [[snare rush]] famously featured on the [[Girl/Boy EP]] of 1996 is an earlier form of digital algorhythmic coding and featured in [[drum and bass]] influenced electronic music of the early to mid 1990s, this approach later evolving into [[glitch]] music. Traditional use of algorithms include [[Maypole]] dancing, where they are applied to the dance itself as a form of [[Algorithmic Choreography]] and [[bell-ringing]]. The first self-proclaimed "algorave" was held in London as a warmup concert for the [[SuperCollider]] Symposium 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc2012.org.uk/2012/03/live-algorave-video-highlights/|title=Live AlgoRave – video highlights - SuperCollider Symposium 2012|work=sc2012.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?345648|title=RA: Supercollider 2012 Warm Up – Live Algorave at Nnnnn, London (2012)|work=Resident Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the name was first coined in 2011, after live coders [[Nick Collins (composer)|Nick Collins]] and [[Alex McLean]] tuned into a [[happy hardcore]] pirate radio station on the way to a performance in the UK.&lt;ref name="wired201309"/&gt; Since then, algorave has been growing into an international movement, with algoraves having been held mainly in Europe and Asia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/550866|title=Algorave ++ Noise|author=|date=|website=Resident Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and few events in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/492764|title=Algorave|author=|date=|website=Resident Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ArmadaDe Lindo|title=armada de lindo, august 9 2013|date=2014-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ScVcSLkis|accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegridto.com/blog-post/5-things-you-missed-at-all-caps|title=The Grid TO|work=thegridto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivo2012.cenart.tv/ |title=/*vivo*/ 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908032423/http://vivo2012.cenart.tv/ |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Esquire961101.gif|thumb|Larter on the cover of ''Esquire'' portraying the fictional Allegra Coleman.{{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 4 May 2017}}]] --&gt;
'''Allegra Coleman''' was a fictional celebrity invented by writer Martha Sherrill for the purposes of a hoax magazine article. Then model (later actress) [[Ali Larter]] portrayed the imaginary model in Sherrill's feature, which appeared in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' (November 1996).

== History ==
In a parody of celebrity profiles, the article described Coleman's role in an upcoming movie with [[Woody Allen]], her tempestuous relationship with [[David Schwimmer]] (including a scandal involving nude photographs taken by [[paparazzi]]) and her friendship with [[Deepak Chopra]].

The hoax was revealed by ''Esquire'' editor [[Edward Kosner]] in a press release to the news wire services.

Sherrill later wrote a satirical novel on Hollywood life that featured Allegra Coleman as a prominent character. The novel, ''My Last Movie Star,'' was published by [[Random House]] in 2003.

The article was photographed by photographer Troy House who knew Ali Larter from previous jobs and approached her about doing the parody.

==Reaction==
Some response to the affair focused on its ethics; Schwimmer's friends were reported to have complained about the invasion of privacy involved in using the actor's fame.{{fact|date=November 2017}} Writing in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', [[David Futrelle]] commented that the article seemed to hearken back to ''Esquire'''s mid-1960s heyday.  A writer on [[Suck.com]] noted that the Coleman satire was essentially indistinguishable from the normal run of the magazine's celebrity reporting.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

The article written about Coleman as the new "It Girl" prompted calls from studios and talent scouts eager to offer Coleman scripts.  The incident jump-started Ali Larter's acting career, and she went on to appear in TV shows (including the [[Niki Sanders]] role in NBC's ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'') and movies (including ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' and ''[[Final Destination]]'').

'''Antifest''' is a name for a [[punk rock]] festival taking place in [[Svojšice (Pardubice District)|Svojšice]] in [[Czech Republic]]. It is organised in the middle of summer, and the first one took place in 1995. In the beginning the full title was Anti-society Fest, but presently Antifest is in common use. Beside [[punk rock]] bands a significant number of [[ska]], [[psychobilly]] and [[rockabilly]] bands appear during the fest.

2005 edition (11th) was the first one to last for three days, previously the festival took two days. This event is organised by Agency 92.

Major European bands are appearing during the festival, performing on two stages. Visitors also come from different parts of Europe, mainly from [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and [[Poland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">The so-called '''Bombay Cyclone of 1882''' or '''Great Bombay Cyclone''' is a [[hoax]] (or otherwise fictitious) historical event. Supposedly, the [[cyclone]] struck [[Bombay]] on 6 June 1882. Though it is widely reported, even in scientific literature, historical research shows that it did not in fact happen.

==Example accounts of the supposed event==
The supposed cyclone is mentioned in academic literature from at least 1976.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Mantell and A. M. Mantell, ''Our Fragile Water Planet: An Introduction to the Earth Sciences'' (New York: Springer, 1976), p. 94 (no source cited).&lt;/ref&gt; Its entry in the 2008 edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones'' reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''The Great Bombay Cyclone of June 6, 1882:''' One of few truly great Indian cyclones to have formed over the Arabian Sea, the Great Bombay Cyclone--engorged with 110-MPH (177-km/h) winds and an 18-foot (6-m) surge--reportedly claimed more than 100,000 lives when it came ashore at Bombay right before daybreak.&lt;ref&gt;David Longshore, ''Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones'', new edn (New York: Facts on File, 2008), p. 258 (no source cited).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A 2014 academic article claims that: 'the deadliest [[storm surge]] of Arabian sea was Great Bombay  Cyclone, took  place in 1882 causing 100,000 {{sic|causalities}}. It is one of ten deadliest tropical cyclones of the known history of the world'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Rana, Q. Zaman, M. Afzal, M . A. Haroon, '[http://www.pmd.gov.pk/rnd/rndweb/rnd_new/journal/vol11_issue21_files/6.pdf Characteristics of Sea Surface Temperature of the Arabian Sea Coast of Pakistan and Impact of Tropical Cyclones on SST]', ''Pakistan Journal of Meteorology'' 11.21 (July 2014), 61-70 (p. 62), citing H. K. Yusuf, S. Dasgupta, and M. H. Khan, 'August Climate Change: An Emerging Threat To Agriculture and Food Security in Bangladesh', in ''International Symposium on Climate Change and Food Security in South Asia, Dhaka, Bangladesh'' (2008), pp. 25-30. If this is substantially the same paper as the almost identically-titled slides at https://web.archive.org/web/20121002172713/http://www.wamis.org/agm/meetings/rsama08/Bari101-Yusuf-Climate-Change.pdf (slide 20), then Yusuf et al.'s source was https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc.php (link now dead), but the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080328045433/http://metocph.nmci.navy.mil:80/jtwc.php March 2008 version of the page] at archive.org does not contain the relevant data.&lt;/ref&gt; Another account, published in 2017, says that
&lt;blockquote&gt;the city of Bombay was all but destroyed by a monster cyclone that slammed into the Maharashtra region on June 6th 1882. This was one of the few great storms to emerge from the Arabian Sea. The super storm covered an enormous area as it came ashore at dawn bringing with it 110 mile per hour winds and an 18 foot tidal surge that inundated much of the region around Bombay ... The resultant winds, flooding and damage to buildings killed more the 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W Simpson, ''Star of Greece'' (Adelaide: Clippership Press, 2017), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It appears in other academic literature besides: some further examples are referenced here.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Anthes, ''Tropical Cyclones: Their Evolution, Structure and Effects'' (Boston, MA: American Meteorological Society, 1982) , p. 4 (table 1.2), citing R. L. Southern, '[http://www.bom.gov.au/jshess/docs/1979/southern.pdf The Global Socio-Economic Impact of Tropical Cyclones]', ''Australian Meteorological Magazine'', 27 (1979), 175–95 (no page reference cited, but the relevant page is Table 3, p. 178; Southern's citation for his table simply says 'from various sources').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Emanuel, ''Divine Wind: The History and Science of Hurricanes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 264 (no source cited).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shubhendu S. Shukla, '[http://www.ijser.in/archives/v1i1/MDMxMzA5MTE=.pdf Disaster Management: “Managing the Risk of  Environmental Calamity”]', ''International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Research (IJSER)'', 1.1 (September 2013), 1-18 (p. 14; no source cited).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exposure of hoax==
[[Amitav Ghosh]] reports that research by [[Adam Sobel]], along with a consultation by [[Murali Ranganathan]] of the contemporary Bombay newspaper ''[[Kaiser-i-Hind (newspaper)|Kaiser-i-Hind]]'' for the relevant period, shows no contemporary record of the event. If a storm of anything like the reported magnitude had happened, it would have killed about an eighth of Bombay's population, and would have been widely reported. There does appear to have been a storm with heavy rain and strong winds on 4 June 1882, but it does not answer to descriptions of the supposed cyclone of 6 June. Bombay's biggest cyclone event of the nineteenth century in fact appears to have been 'in 1854, when "property valued at half-a-million pounds sterling" was destroyed in four hours and a thousand people were killed'.&lt;ref&gt;Amitav Ghosh, ''The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable'' (London: Penguin, 2016), chapter 10, citing [Stephen Meredith Edwardes], ''The Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island'', 3 vols (Bombay: The Times Press, 1909), [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.55898 I] 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Sobel, '[http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31808&amp;articlexml=ALL-AT-SEA-WHAT-MUMBAI-NEEDS-TO-LEARN-02122015014034 All at Sea: What Mumbai Needs to Learn from Superstorm Sandy]', ''The Times of India (Delhi)'' (2 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote, "Another convincing demonstration that crime, while it may not 'pay,' can be turned to profitable uses by the makers of action films is given by ''Canon City,'' a tough semi-documentary job about a prison break in Colorado ... Crane Wilbur has held to a realistic line for much of the prison action and in some of the outside episodes. His actors—especially Jeff Corey, who plays the leader of the 'break'—are generally tough, convincing fellows with nothing to recommend in charm. And the movement is swift and dynamic, not unlikely in such affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Bosley. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critic Dennis Schwartz said of the film, "An unspectacular true story (it's dated) about a prison break that is told in a semi-documentary style. Its saving grace is that it is well presented ...This minor work has some resemblance to film noir through the characterization of Sherbondy as someone who is not a hardened criminal, but got into trouble both on the outside and then inside of prison because he made the wrong friends."&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/canoncity.htm Schwartz, Dennis].

"'''Cartoon Wars Part II'''" is the fourth episode in the [[South Park (season 10)|tenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 143rd episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 12, 2006. After "[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]", it is the second part of a two-episode story-arc, which focuses on [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s efforts to get the television series ''[[Family Guy]]'' cancelled, by exploiting fears of retaliation by [[Muslim]]s to an impending ''Family Guy'' episode in which the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] will appear, in violation of [[Aniconism in Islam|some interpretations of Muslim law]]. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] instead urges the president of the network airing ''Family Guy'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], to air the episode in an exercise of free speech.

The episodes were inspired by the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]], which began in response to a Danish newspaper's printing of cartoons depicting Muhammed in early 2006, leading to worldwide protests and occasionally violent demonstrations and riots. It also comes from ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]'s general dislike of ''Family Guy'', which they viewed as overly reliant on [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] as humor and less on story. During production, the duo ran into reluctance from [[Comedy Central]] and parent company [[Viacom]], who felt their insistence to depict Muhammad disregarded concerns for public safety. Parker and Stone argued that the network was giving in to hypothetical violence, labeling them hypocrites due to their satirizing of other religions in the past. The network interference was written into the episode's storyline.

Comedy Central eventually aired the episode with a black title card during the Muhammad sequence, censoring the depiction. While the episode's censorship did attract headlines, it received more attention for its lampooning of ''Family Guy''. The episode received positive reviews from television critics.

==Plot==
[[Eric Cartman]] has an intense dislike for the television program ''[[Family Guy]]''. When he learns that an episode of the show is to feature a depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, he exploits fears of retaliation to urge Fox, the network on which ''Family Guy'' airs, to pull the episode. Cartman pretends to be a sickly [[Denmark|Danish]] kid with a broken leg, telling the Fox executives that his father was killed by terrorists during the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] and pleading that they pull the ''Family Guy'' episode. His story touches the executives, who encourage him to try to persuade the writers to yield. [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], who likes ''Family Guy'', arrives at the Fox Studio to foil Cartman's plans, but is knocked unconscious by an ally of Cartman's, a kid resembling [[Bart Simpson]] who, also wanting to destroy ''Family Guy'', restrains Kyle in a supply shed.

Cartman is introduced to the ''Family Guy'' writing staff, who turn out to be a group of [[manatee]]s. The staff, who live in a large tank, pick up "idea balls" from a large pile of them, each of which has a different noun, a verb or a [[popular culture|pop culture]] reference written on it, and deliver them, five at a time, to a machine that then forms a ''Family Guy'' cutaway gag based on those ideas. The manatees refuse to work if any idea ball is removed from their tank, making censorship an unfeasible practice with them. Cartman secretly removes a ball from their tank, causing them to stop working, and then convinces the Fox president that the manatees are spoiled, and abusing the executives' generosity. Cartman convinces the president that they need to show them who's boss. The president decides to pull the new ''Family Guy'' episode shortly before airtime. Cartman feels victorious, but Kyle shows up, saying he convinced the Bart-like kid to set him free.

After a physical altercation between Cartman and Kyle, they both go to the Fox president's office. Kyle tells the president that Cartman has duped him into pulling the episode, and despite Cartman's brandishing of a gun, Kyle implores the president not to censor the episode. The network president ultimately decides, in spite of threats of violence from both Cartman and Islamic terrorists, that ''Family Guy'' should be aired, and without censorship. The ''Family Guy'' episode airs, and features Muhammad in a cutaway gag, handing Peter a "[[salmon]] [[football helmet]]", but the scene with Muhammad was cut by [[Comedy Central]], and is replaced by a black screen and a title card reading, "In this shot, Mohammed hands a football helmet to ''Family Guy''. Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network."

Terrorist leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], reminding America that it was warned not to show Muhammad, initiates [[Al-Qaeda]]'s retaliation — a crudely animated video depicting President [[George W. Bush]], [[Carson Kressley]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Katie Holmes]], and [[Jesus Christ]] defecating on each other and the American flag. After the video ends, al-Zawahiri gloats of their "retaliation" by saying they "burned" the Americans and that it "was way funnier than Family Guy."

And if you're saying that this is the one thing we can't do, besides [[Tom Cruise]], because they're threatening violence, well, then, I guess that's what everyone should do. Then if the Catholics don't want us ripping on Jesus anymore, they should just threaten you with violence, and they'll get their way.' That's why it is such a [[slippery slope]] and such a dangerous path to go down.|source=— [[Trey Parker]], 2006&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; |salign=right}}
The episode was largely inspired by the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]],&lt;ref name="today"/&gt; in which twelve editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad, were published in the Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', leading to protests around the world in early 2006, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries. The duo had wanted to create an episode centering on Muhammad months before that particular controversy flared.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Parker gathered the episode’s title from a headline on a television news broadcast of the controversy: "Breaking news: Cartoon wars. Muslims angered over cartoon."&lt;ref name="ign1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt; After the incidents, Parker and Stone wanted to include Muhammad "just […] standing there", as a harmless and not overtly offensive depiction.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; They felt "100% sure" that Comedy Central would back them up on their efforts, due to the duo's tendency to tackle serious subjects with humor and satire in the past.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

The network was "bummed" when they learned of their intentions, but nonetheless, as ''South Park'' as a franchise made the network exorbitant amounts of money, they could not tell them no.&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt; According to Stone, Comedy Central was initially supportive of their vision, but backed away when executives in higher positions at parent company [[Viacom]] denied the request.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; As a result, "Cartoon Wars Part II" is largely based around real-life censorship they faced in producing the episode. The duo argued with [[Comedy Central]] that refusing to show images of Muhammad would be giving into violence; they were partially fascinated with this territory due to its creation of a new taboo, one informed by threats.&lt;ref name="part1"/&gt; In the episode, Kyle's impassioned plea to the president of Fox is culled from Parker and Stone's conversations with Comedy Central executives, and he even refers to the Fox president as "Doug", in reference to Comedy Central executive [[Doug Herzog]].&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Gillespie, Nick; Walker, Jesse (December 2006). [http://reason.com/archives/2006/12/05/south-park-libertarians/2 "South Park Libertarians - Trey Parker and Matt Stone on liberals, conservatives, censorship, and religion"]. ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''. p. 3 of 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The network's reluctance to allow the images to be shown factored into the duo's decision to make the episode a two-parter; "Well, they’re still not letting us show Muhammed […] we'll argue about it for another week", said Parker.&lt;ref name="part1"/&gt; While the duo agreed that the network had the right to air whatever they want, they viewed their censorship as "wimpy".&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt;

Part of Parker and Stone's anger came from the fact that "[[Super Best Friends]]", a 2001 episode of ''South Park'', featured images of Muhammad uncensored as a superhero, and aired without censorship for several years on both Comedy Central and in local syndication.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The duo struggled to come up with how to present Comedy Central's refusal to broadcast the images as a real situation and not a joke. Parker later related previous South Park episodes, "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]" (2000) and "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]" (2005), which parodied [[NAMBLA]] and [[Scientology]], respectively, as similar situations.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; "You have to make sure, when you're doing that kind of subject matter, you want people to know what you're doing is a joke and then what really is real, you know, you're trying to make fun of", said Parker.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; The duo, instead of settling on the black title card, toyed with "putting some really incredible quote up or making a big speech. At the end of the day it felt a little too high and mighty, so we ended up doing the driest thing possible."&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
"Cartoon Wars Part II" contains several cultural references. The episode parodies the Fox animated sitcom ''[[Family Guy]]'', which was revived from cancellation the previous year and attracted immense popularity. Parker stated, "we totally understand that people love it, that's why we put it in the show, we understand that it speaks to some people and it can just be a simple laugh and that's great and we certainly don't think it should be taken off the air or anything like that, we just don't respect it in terms of writing", later referring to the writers behind the show as "smart" but emphatically criticizing their overuse of "gag-humor".&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt;

In referencing ''Family Guy'', the episode also brings another Fox television sitcom into the equation: ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Following the airing of the episode's first part, the duo received flowers from the producers of ''The Simpsons'' and phone calls from those involved with ''[[King of the Hill]]'' at Fox (who remarked, in reference to their mocking of ''Family Guy'', "you're doing God's work").&lt;ref name="ign1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Goldman |title=''South Park'': Matt and Trey Speak Out, Part 1 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/17/south-park-matt-and-trey-speak-out-part-1?page=1 |archivedate=May 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506075721/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/17/south-park-matt-and-trey-speak-out-part-1?page=1 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 5, 2014 |date=July 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt; Parker claimed that the majority of [[Hollywood]] at the time disliked the success of ''Family Guy'', both for what was viewed as subpar, lazy writing and for petty, jealous reasons, regarding its high ratings.&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt; As Parker and Stone immensely respected ''The Simpsons'', they incorporated the reactions into the episode, with Cartman meeting [[Bart Simpson]], with whom he shares a dislike of ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt; The duo also inserted a reference to the staff at ''King of the Hill''. "There was this animation solidarity moment, where everyone did come together over their hatred of ''Family Guy''", Parker joked.&lt;ref name="part2"&gt;[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]] and [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]. (2007). Commentary for "Cartoon Wars Part II", in ''South Park: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. Paramount Home Video/Comedy Central.&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode's opening is [[Self-referential humor|self-referential]]; it is an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the controversy that erupted when the duo opened the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] of ''South Park'' in 1998 not with the conclusion to the "[[Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut]]" [[cliffhanger]], but with an entirely different, unrelated episode revolving around the [[Story within a story|show-within-a-show]] characters Terrance and Phillip ("[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]").&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Despite the controversy surrounding the image of Muhammad, the episode received high acclaim. Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] gave the episode a perfect review, with a score of 10 out of 10, saying, "The really ironic thing here is that ''South Park'' actually already did show Mohammed prominently, in the "[[Super Best Friends]]" episode in 2001. Clearly Matt and Trey are also commenting on how times have changed, and how the acts of select extremists can create such specific fears in the powers that be; hammering home their point was the episode's conclusion, which featured terrorists responding to ''Family Guy'' with a cartoon of their own, showing Jesus defecating on George W. Bush and the American flag, which pointedly was shown without being censored." This episode also won an IGN Editors Choice Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/701/701605p1.html Eric Goldman "South Park: 'Cartoon Wars, Part 2' Review" IGN.com April 13, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 review of the episode from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' is part of a series that examines episodes that "exemplify the spirit of its time and the properties that make television a unique medium". Noel Murray writes that the episode "slyly deals with censorship and public pressures of varying degrees—including some that are fairly discreet".&lt;ref name="av"&gt;{{cite web|author=Noel Murray|title=South Park, "Cartoon Wars"|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/isouth-parki-cartoon-wars-55943|work=[[The A.V.

===Controversy===
The situation became one of [[life imitating art]]; in the week prior to the episode's airing, the teaser advertisement referenced the situation: "Will television executives take a stand for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out?"&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt; Comedy Central’s decision to censor the image was due to concerns for public safety. The network issued a short statement the day following the episode’s airing: “In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision.”&lt;ref name="today"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozell|first=L.

Following the episode’s airing, the ending attracted publicity, often misrepresenting and simplifying the segment’s theme and message and sensationalizing the appearances of Jesus and President George W. Bush.&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt; The episode aired during the Holy Week for Christians, prompting outrage from that community over the portrayal of Jesus.&lt;ref name="today"/&gt; [[L. Brent Bozell III|Brent Bozell]], founder of the conservative organization [[Parents Television Council]], criticized [[Viacom]] for celebrating insults to [[Christianity]] through the satirical anti-American scene in this episode, as well as another animated series insulting [[Catholicism]], ''[[Popetown]]'', which aired on [[MTV Central|MTV Germany]], another Viacom-owned network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozell |first=L.

"The ultimate hypocrite is not Comedy Central — that's their decision not to show the image of Muhammad or not — it's Parker and Stone", he said.&lt;ref name="today"/&gt; "Like little whores, they'll sit there and grab the bucks. They'll sit there and they'll whine and they'll take their shot at Jesus. That's their stock in trade."&lt;ref name="today"/&gt; In response to these criticisms, Parker and Stone agreed with these groups, noting that while images of Muhammed were forbidden, it instead appeared to be “open season” on Jesus, hence their depiction to illustrate the hypocrisy of the network.&lt;ref name="part2"/&gt; The duo subsequently made Donohue a villain in the 2007 episode "[[Fantastic Easter Special]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vitello|first=Paul|title=A 'Marine' for Catholics Sees a Time of Battle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/nyregion/15donohue.html|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode became notorious not for its lampooning of censorship and the Muhammad controversy, but for its criticism of ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref name="part1"/&gt; "You’d think [Muhammad] would be the flashpoint.

(2007). Commentary for "Cartoon Wars Part I", in ''South Park: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. Paramount Home Video/Comedy Central.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the episode's broadcast, ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' approached the duo to print their uncensored, original image of Muhammad in an issue, but Comedy Central would not approve of the request.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; "''Harper's'' is in every [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], every [[Borders Group|Borders]] in the country now. I saw it in the airport. It has all the Danish cartoons, and nothing happened. The risks were totally overestimated, I thought", said Stone.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

At a [[Television Critics Association]] (TCA) discussion in July 2006, Herzog responded to criticism directed at him:

{{bquote|I don't feel unlike Matt and Trey to a certain degree. You feel bad, but it's a big judgment call made on behalf of, as Matt said, a big media company. The ramifications are Matt and Trey being pissed at you and Matt calling you a coward in ''Daily Variety''. […] But you know, it's just a tough [situation]. Did we over react? For sure. And I think history will probably show that, we hope. We'd like to think. And in a perfect world we would have liked to have done it -- [It was] a judgment call; one of the very few, although there seem to have been a lot over the last six months. Matt and Trey enjoy, I think, a very fair amount of creative freedom. But it really just comes down to a judgment call. And like I said, I think history might show we overreacted, but we're willing to live like that.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;}}

Stone referred to the episode's censorship as "really, beyond creatively disappointing […] because we thought we could do something really important."&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Goldman |title=''South Park'': Matt and Trey Speak Out, Part 2 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/19/south-park-matt-and-trey-speak-out-part-2?page=1 |archivedate=May 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506075538/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/19/south-park-matt-and-trey-speak-out-part-2?page=1 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 5, 2014 |date=July 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Curtain Theatre is labelled in the top right of this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
'''The Curtain Theatre''' was an [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] playhouse located in Hewett Street, [[Shoreditch]] (part of the modern [[London Borough of Hackney]]), just outside the [[City of London]]. It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1624.&lt;ref&gt;N. W. Bawcutt, ''The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama: The Records of Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels, 1623-1673'', Oxford, 1996, pp. 141, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curtain was built some {{Convert|200|yd|}} south of London's first playhouse, [[The Theatre]], which had opened a year before, in 1576. It was called the "Curtain" because it was located near a plot of land called Curtain Close, not because of the sort of front curtain associated with modern theatres, but of its proximity of the City walls, curtain or [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] referring to the part of city walls between two [[bastion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Quincy Adams, ''Shakespearean Playhouses'', Boston, 1917, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Its remains were rediscovered in archaeological excavation in 2012.  The most significant find was that the Curtain was rectangular not round.  They found a {{Convert|14|m||adj=on}} stage, and evidence of a tunnel under the stage and galleries at the first floor level. Finds included a ceramic bird whistle; ceramic money boxes for collecting entry fees; beads likely for decorating stage costumes and a small statue of Bacchus.

==History==
The Curtain Theatre was built in 1577 in [[Shoreditch]], and was London's second playhouse. Little is known of the companies that performed there, or of the plays they performed. The first clear mention of the Curtain is in 1584, when the [[City of London]] petitioned the parish of [[Shoreditch]] to shut down their playhouses.&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt;{{rp|63}} The proprietor appears to have been Henry Lanman, described as a "gentleman": in 1585, Lanman made an agreement with the proprietor of the Theatre, [[James Burbage]], to use the Curtain as a supplementary house, or "easer," to the more prestigious older playhouse. From 1597 to 1599, it became the premier venue of [[Shakespeare's]] Company, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], who had been forced to leave their former playing space at The Theatre after the latter closed in 1596. It was the venue of several of Shakespeare's plays, including ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (which gained "Curtain plaudits") and ''Henry IV'' [[Henry IV, Part 1|Part I]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2|Part II]]. The Lord Chamberlain's Men also performed [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' here in 1598, with Shakespeare in the cast.&lt;ref&gt;E.K. Chambers, ''The Elizabethan Stage'' volume III, Oxford, 1923, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year Jonson gained a certain notoriety by killing actor [[Gabriel Spencer]] in a duel in nearby [[Hoxton|Hoxton Fields]].

The Lord Chamberlain's Men departed the Curtain when the [[Globe Theatre]], which they built to replace the Theatre, was ready for use in 1599.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EvSLt5GaPjwC| title= Making Shakespeare: From Stage to Page|last=Stern| first=Tiffany| isbn=978-0415319652| publisher=[[Routledge]]| page=15| date=February 2004|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was able to afford to open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in ''Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews'' on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman’s business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage’s business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a pooling arrangement for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; He died in 1606&lt;ref&gt;William Ingram, ''The Business of Playing: The Beginnings of the Adult Professional Theater in Elizabethan London'', Cornell University Press, 1992, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that the theatre had been re-arranged into a shareholder’s enterprise before his death at some point. [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], one of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] member [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]] did the same in 1624.&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare's company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting there. Otherwise, it would be very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he did better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage's father [[Richard Burbage|Richard]] had shares in the theatre at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Collier"/&gt;{{rp|144}}

The London theatres, including the Curtain, were closed for much of the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to the bubonic plague.{{sfn|Chambers|1930|pp=44–7}} In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates' court demanding that no plays take place at the Curtain or the Theatre that year.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DpsNAAAAQAAJ| title=The works of William Shakespeare |publisher=General Books |last=Collier |first=John Payne |author-link=John Payne Collier |isbn=9780217290210| date=2012|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} The Curtain was named in [[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London'' in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Theatrical City: Culture, Theatre and Politics in London, 1576-1649| last1=Smith| first1=David L.| last2= Strier| first2=Richard| last3=Bevington| first3=David| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| date=2002| page=50| isbn=0521526159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600, the [[Privy Council]] tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Curtain theatre,&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt; and in 1603, the Curtain became the playhouse of [[Queen Anne's Men]] (formerly known as [[Worcester's Men]], and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they'd played [[Thomas Heywood|Heywood's]] ''A Woman Kill'd With Kindness'' in February of that year).&lt;ref name="Bowsher"/&gt;{{rp|64}} In 1607, ''The Travels of the Three English Brothers,'' by [[William Rowley|Rowley]], [[John Day (dramatist)|Day]], and [[George Wilkins|Wilkins]], was performed at the Curtain.

The Curtain was in use from 1577 until at least 1624, after which its ultimate fate is obscure as there is no record of it after 1627. The reasons for its closure are not known.

==Site and rediscovery==
The Curtain was believed to have been built near [[The Theatre]], but the exact location was for many years unknown.&lt;ref name="SO"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shakespeare-online.com/theatre/thecurtain.html| title= The Curtain| publisher=Shakespeare Online|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/curtain-elizabethan-theatre.htm| title= Curtain Elizabethan Theatre|  publisher=Elizabethan Era Online| access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a commemorative plaque was erected at 18 Hewett Street.&lt;ref name="Bowsher"&gt;{{cite book|title= Shakespeare's London Theatreland: Archaeology, History and Drama| last=Bowsher| first=Julian |publisher=[[Museum of London Archaeology]]| date=July 2012| isbn=9781907586125}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Curtain Theatre |url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-the-curtain-theatre.htm |date=28 Feb 2007 |publisher=London Borough of Hackney | accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, archaeologists from [[Museum of London Archaeology|MOLA]] (Museum of London Archaeology) announced that they had discovered the remains of the theatre during trial excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Remains of Shakespeare’s Curtain Theatre discovered in Shoreditch|publisher=[[Museum of London Archaeology]]|date=6 June 2012 |url=http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/NewsProjects/CurtainTheatre.htm |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian20120605"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/06/shakespeare-curtain-theatre-shoreditch-east-lonfon |title=Shakespeare's Curtain theatre unearthed in east London |work=The Guardian |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |last=Kennedy |first=Maev}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 plans were submitted to develop the site with a 40-storey tower of 400 apartments plus Shakespeare museum, 250-seat outdoor auditorium and park, with the archaeological remains visible in a glass enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Curtain lifts on open-air stage at Shakespeare theatre site in Shoreditch|work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=24 January 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/curtain-lifts-on-openair-stage-at-shakespeare-theatre-site-in-shoreditch-8464712.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thestageshoreditch.com/|title=The Stage, Shoreditch|last=|first=|date=12 April 2016|website=The Stage, Shoreditch|publisher=|access-date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the project is expected in 2019.

In May 2016, excavators announced that the theatre was purpose built and, unusually, the theatre was rectangular rather than round or polygonal.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/nov/10/shakespeare-write-henry-v-suit-london-theatre-the-curtain-odd-shape|title=Did Shakespeare write Henry V to suit London theatre's odd shape?|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=2016-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walls survived up to {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} high in places; MOLA identified the courtyard, where theatregoers stood, and the inner walls, which held the galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/500-year-old-shakespeare-prop-7994127|title=500-year-old Romeo And Juliet prop found in dig at Shakespeare's Curtain Theatre|last=Bishop|first=Rachel|date=2016-05-18|work=mirror|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had timber galleries with mid and upper areas for wealthier audience members, and a courtyard made from compacted gravel for those with less to spend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wharf.co.uk/news/local-news/theatre-revelations-shed-light-shakespeares-12177048|title=Will theatre revelations shed light on Shakespeare's secrets?|last=Broadbent|first=Giles|date=2016-11-15|work=thewharf|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The galleries were straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/21/478962867/archaeologists-find-early-shakespeare-theater-was-rectangular|title=Archaeologists Find Early Shakespeare Theater Was Rectangular|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also uncovered was a fragmentary ceramic bird whistle, dating from the late 16th century. This raised the question of whether the bird whistle was merely a Tudor toy or a prop for plays that needed sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Bird whistle from first Romeo and Juliet|last=Furness|first=Hannah|date=18 March 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, a tunnel structure - accessed by doors on either end of the stage - was unearthed, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Fragments of ceramic money boxes were found, which would have been used to collect entry fees from theatregoers, before being taken to an office to be smashed and the money counted - this office was known as the ‘box office’, which is the origin of the term we use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2016/11/10/curtain-theatre-shakespeare-shoreditch-excavation-mysteries-unearthed/|title=Mysteries unearthed in Shoreditch excavation of Shakespeare's Curtain Theatre|last=Loeb|first=Josh|date=2016-11-10|website=Hackney Citizen|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1558">The '''Edict of Roussillon''' ({{lang-fr|Édit de Roussillon}}) was a 1564 [[edict]] decreeing that the year would begin on January 1 in [[France]].

During a trip to various parts of his kingdom, the King of France, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], found that depending on the [[diocese]], the year began either at [[Christmas]] (at [[Lyon]], for instance) or on 25 March (as at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]]), on 1 March, or at [[Easter]].

In order to standardise the date for the new year in the entire kingdom, he added an article to an edict given at [[Paris]] in January 1563 which he promulgated at [[Roussillon, Isère|Roussillon]] on 9 August 1564. It started being applied on January 1, 1567.

The 42 articles that comprised this edict concerned justice, except the last four, added during the king's stay at Roussillon.

It was article 39 that announced a January 1 start date for every year henceforth.

The first '''Freedom from Hunger Day''' was held on September 28, 2006 to increase awareness about global hunger and promote Freedom from Hunger's empowerment of women around the world. The event included walk-through exhibits of regions where [[Freedom from Hunger]] operates - India, Latin America, West Africa, and the Philippines - where visitors enjoyed native food and entertainment. In addition, Freedom from Hunger provided children with passports that included historical and cultural information from each region that were stamped at each exhibit.

As a result of the event's success, [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]] confirmed September 28 as "Freedom From Hunger Day",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= In Recognition of Freedom from Hunger Day September 28, 2006 | url= http://www.yolocounty.org/agendas/2006/100306/202.pdf | publisher= [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]] | format= PDF | date= 28 September 2006 | accessdate= 2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the State of California declared the date as an official day of awareness and, in the Sacramento area, the event won a gold public relations award.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Catalyst | chapter= Connecting Through Freedom from Hunger Day World Tour | chapterurl= https://www.freedomfromhunger.org/pdfs/fall07.pdf | date= Fall 2007 | publisher= Freedom from Hunger | pages= 1 &amp; 4 | mode=cs1 | accessdate= 2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom from Hunger Day 2007==
2007's Freedom from Hunger Day also included an extensive online component. On September 28, Freedom from Hunger's [http://www.freedomfromhunger.org home page] was devoted to this day of awareness. The website included video clips taken by the staff, sound bites of women sharing dreams for themselves and their families, a live video conference with Freedom from Hunger's President Chris Dunford, and timed release of podcasts throughout the day. In honor of Freedom from Hunger Day, the website offered visitors the opportunity to send a free e-card to raise awareness about ending hunger. 

In addition, Freedom from Hunger invited the public to host parties in their homes by providing a party pack that includes an original board game, DVD, fliers, buttons, literature, and a CD of international music.

==Freedom from Hunger Day 2008==
The 2008 online observance of Freedom from Hunger Day was held from September 25 to 28, 2008.  Freedom from Hunger's homepage was replaced by a page devoted to Freedom from Hunger Day.  The new landing page will feature actions that website visitors can take in the face of the [[Food crisis |Global Food Crisis]].  Freedom from Hunger Day was a featured action on the [[Care2]] network.

==Freedom from Hunger Day 2009==
2009's Freedom from Hunger day included extensive online content. 

==Freedom from Hunger Day 2010==
This year's Freedom from Hunger day is also going to be observed online. We{{Who|date=March 2015}} will take over the home page and post videos of Freedom from Hunger in action where our volunteers and overseas staff will share their experiences. You will also hear directly from the women that we reach - as they share their hopes and dreams for their families and how Freedom from Hunger is working with them to make those goals a reality.

Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.&lt;ref name="Wessells" /&gt;

The earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek [[Greek mythology|mythology]] (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Despite this, several Roman [[Legionary|legionaries]] were known to have enlisted aged 14 in the [[Imperial Roman army]], such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]], and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan |first=Ross |authorlink=Ross Cowan |ref=harv |title=Roman Legionary AD 69–161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKudCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2013 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=978-1780965871 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides ("[[squires]]"), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called [[Children's Crusade]] in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Young boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813–1814, pg.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as "The Infants of the Emperor". These soldiers were in their mid-teens.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pope, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous "[[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]]".

During the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|ship's magazine]] to the gun crews. These children were called "powder monkeys."{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Child soldier in the US Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright|Drummer boy [[John Clem]] during the American Civil War.]]

During the American Civil War a young boy, Bugler John Cook, served in the US Army at the age of 15 and received the Medal of Honor for his acts during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Slinger, P. W. Children at War. New York: Pantheon Books, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other minors, including 11-year-old [[Willie Johnston (Medal of Honor recipient)|Willie Johnston]], have also received the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lewis D. Eigen |title=Unfortunately Child Soldiers are Nothing New |publisher=Scriptamus.wordpress.com |year=2009 |url=http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new/ |access-date=23 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323201709/https://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/child-soldiers-are-unfortunately-nothing-new/ |archive-date=23 March 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the [[cantonist]]s, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In the final stages of the Paraguayan War, children fought in the Battle of Acosta Ñu against the Allied forces of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The day is commemorated as a national holiday in Paraguay.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

During the Boshin War, the pro-''shōgun'' Aizu Domain formed the {{nihongo|''[[Byakkotai]]''|白虎隊|extra="[[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] Force"}}, which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed ''seppuku'' while [[Iinuma Sadakichi|one was unsuccessful]]. He was saved by a local peasant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==World War I==
[[File:Momčilo Gavrić i major Stevan Tucović.jpg|thumb|Momčilo Gavrić and another soldier reporting to major Stevan Tucović, 1916.]]

The youngest known soldier of World War I was [[Momčilo Gavrić (soldier)|Momčilo Gavrić]], who joined the 6th Artillery Division of the Serbian Army at the age of 8, after Austro-Hungarian troops in August 1914 killed his parents, grandmother, and seven of his siblings.&lt;ref name="novosti"&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/drustvo/aktuelno.290.html:451827-Momcilo-Gavric---najmladji-vojnik-Prvog-svetskog-rata Momčilo Gavrić – najmlađi vojnik Prvog svetskog rata] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326180109/http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/drustvo/aktuelno.290.html:451827-Momcilo-Gavric---najmladji-vojnik-Prvog-svetskog-rata |date=26 March 2018 }} ("Večernje novosti", 31 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AuntieMabel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wenzel|first1=Marian|last2=Cornish|first2=John|title=Auntie Mabel's war: an account of her part in the hostilities of 1914–18|year=1980|publisher=Allen Lane|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BiografskiRecnik&gt;{{cite book|title=Srpski biografski rečnik, vol II|year=2004|publisher=Budućnost|page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, boys [[Youngest British soldier in World War I|as young as 12]] were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a [[Bantam (military)|Bantam]] battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was [[Claude Choules]], who enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]] at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as "Çanakkale", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the "15'liler" or "The 15s" company, with no known survivors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Spanish Civil War==
Many child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War:
{{quote|The centuria was an untrained mob composed mostly of boys in their teens. Here and there in the militia you came across children as young as eleven or twelve, usually refugees from Fascist territory who had been enlisted as militiamen as the easiest way of providing for them. As a rule, they were employed on light work in the rear, but sometimes they managed to worm their way to the front line, where they were a public menace. I remember one little brute throwing a hand-grenade into the dug-out fire 'for a joke'. At Monte Pocero I do not think there was anyone younger than fifteen, but the average age must have been well under twenty. Boys of this age ought never to be used in the front line, because they cannot stand the lack of sleep which is inseparable from trench warfare. At the beginning it was almost impossible to keep our position properly guarded at night. The wretched children of my section could only be roused by dragging them out of their dug-outs feet foremost, and as soon as your back was turned they left their posts and slipped into shelter; or they would even, in spite of the frightful cold, lean up against the wall of the trench and fall fast asleep.|||George Orwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George |last=Orwell |title=Homage to Catalonia {{!}} Chapter 3 |url=http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318152354/http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html |archivedate=18 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{main|Military use of children in World War II}}

In [[World War II]] children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war.

==After World War II: Historical examples by region==
These are historical examples. For instances of children in the military today, see [[Children in the military]].

=== Africa ===

==== Algeria ====
During the [[Algerian Civil War|Algerian civil war]] (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by [[Islamism|Islamist]] armed groups fighting the government.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Global Report on Child Soldiers|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=child-soldiers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government-allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=c5f157d3-4b56-457c-a2d8-31601ffc1b9e|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2004|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2004|website=child-soldiers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by [[conscription]]) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Burundi ====
Children were kidnapped and used extensively during the civil war of 1993–2005.&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=26c0549d-aa35-4f1a-8e34-5956f8e2ec51|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 (Burundi)|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International)|first=|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=77–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 hundreds of child soldiers were in the [[Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People|Forces Nationales pour la Libération]] (FNL), an armed rebel, Hutu group.&lt;ref name="CSUCS-13"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Children between the ages of 10 and 16 were also conscripted by the Burundese military.&lt;ref name="CSUCS-13" /&gt;

After the Arusha peace accord of 2001 and the Pretoria agreement of 2003 eventually brought the conflict to an end in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://africacenter.org/spotlight/burundi-why-the-arusha-accords-are-central/|title=Burundi: Why the Arusha Accords are Central|last=Nantulya|first=P|date=2015-08-05|work=Africa Center for Strategic Studies|access-date=2018-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321133507/http://africacenter.org/spotlight/burundi-why-the-arusha-accords-are-central/|archive-date=21 March 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new constitution committed to not using children in direct combat.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; The parties to the conflict no longer recruited children in large numbers, but many remained active in the FNL, which had denounced the peace accord.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;

By 2006, a [[Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration|reintegration program]] organized by [[UNICEF]] had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; According to Child Soldiers International:&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school. Some 1,800 former child soldiers received occupational training.

Between 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/TD|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Chad|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330013128/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/TD|archive-date=30 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-29|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the [[United Front for Democratic Change]] (''Front Uni pour le Changement'', FUC), local self-defense forces known as ''Tora Boro'' militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0107/|title=They Came Here to Kill Us|date=January 2007|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328114459/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0107//|archive-date=28 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0707/|title=Early To War|date=July 2007|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016121224/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0707/|archive-date=16 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited.

During [[First Ivorian Civil War|Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war]] of 2002–2004, "children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides",&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ''Patriotic Youth –'' armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=26c0549d-aa35-4f1a-8e34-5956f8e2ec51|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Attempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; After President [[Laurent Gbagbo]] refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/245&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict (2013)|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2013|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2015/409&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eritrea ====
During its [[Eritrean War of Independence|30-year war for independence with Ethiopia]] (1961–1991) the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front|Eritrean People’s Liberation Front]] was "widely acknowledged" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now [[Child Soldiers International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|title=Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=|page=162|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402040002/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|archive-date=2 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|two-year border war]] with Ethiopia in 1998.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;, but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2002/03/30852-un-envoy-reports-no-evidence-child-soldiering-ethiopia-and-eritrea|title=UN envoy reports no evidence of ‘child soldiering’ in Ethiopia and Eritrea|last=|first=|date=2002-03-26|work=UN News|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708074728/https://news.un.org/en/story/2002/03/30852-un-envoy-reports-no-evidence-child-soldiering-ethiopia-and-eritrea|archive-date=8 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrc-eritrea.org/report-on-child-rights-violations-in-eritrea/|title=Report on Child Rights Violations in Eritrea|last=Human Rights Concern Eritrea|first=|date=19 November 2013|website=hrc-eritrea.org|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718154539/http://hrc-eritrea.org/report-on-child-rights-violations-in-eritrea/|archive-date=18 July 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethiopia ====
According to the [[Child Soldiers International|Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 2001 there were "credible reports" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|two-year border war]] with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000:&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|title=Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=|page=165|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402040002/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|archive-date=2 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence of child deployment on the [[Front line|front lines]] and in [[Human wave attack|massive waves]] across mine fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large [[prisoner of war]] camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The main opposition group in the 1990s, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]], also systematically recruited children, including by force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/ET|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Ethiopia|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525062600/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/ET|archive-date=25 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberia ====
{{further|Second Liberian Civil War#Child soldiers}}
[[File:Liberian rebels (second civil war).png|thumb|Unidentified rebel fighters during the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], 1999–2003.]]
In Liberia’s civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given [[Diazepam|valium]] before a battle, known as "bubbles" or "10-10".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=5774&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Boy+soldiers)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B1995|title=Boy Soldiers|last=Frankel|first=Mark|date=14 August 1995|work=Newsweek|access-date=19 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033458/http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=5774&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Boy+soldiers)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B1995|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

United Nations [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration]] programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children and families affected by armed conflicts in Africa|last=Corbin|first=Joanne|publisher=NASW Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

By 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; {{As of|2018}}, children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SL|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Sierra Leone|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517010103/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SL|archive-date=17 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-16|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of child soldiers in Liberia was epitomised by The Small Boys Unit, established by Liberian President [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The boys were not provided with sustenance, but were expected to engage in "snake patrol", looting surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Taylor and others were later tried before the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] because of his involvement in recruiting child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2004|last=|first=|publisher=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=31-112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rwanda ====
[[File:Nyanzale displaced persons camp children.jpg|thumb|Displaced children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at risk of recruitment by Rwandese armed groups and local armed bandits.]]
An estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda genocide]] when many children were involved in committing atrocities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 5,000 children were in the national army,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age.&lt;ref name=":101"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/The%20Use%20of%20Children%20as%20Soldiers%20in%20Africa%20report.pdf|title=The Use of Children as Soldiers in Africa report|last=Jaffré|first=Françoise|date=21 January 2015|website=ReliefWeb|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220092236/https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/The%20Use%20of%20Children%20as%20Soldiers%20in%20Africa%20report.pdf|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&lt;ref name="CSUCS-12"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====Sierra Leone====
{{Main|Child soldiers in Sierra Leone}}
During the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) and the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC), and the pro-government [[Civil Defence Forces]] (CDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/11/armed-conflict-sierra-leone|title=The Armed Conflict in Sierra Leone|last=Human Rights Watch|first=|date=2012-04-11|work=|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022164329/https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/11/armed-conflict-sierra-leone|archive-date=22 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

After 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration]] programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In June 2007 the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/Press/pressrelease-062007.pdf|title="Guilty Verdicts in the Trial of the AFRC Accused"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029201800/http://www.sc-sl.org/Press/pressrelease-062007.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(104&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, press release from the Special Court for Sierra Leone, 20 June 2007; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062000952.html?hpid=moreheadlines "Sierra Leone Convicts 3 of War Crimes"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003183441/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062000952.html?hpid=moreheadlines |date=3 October 2018 }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', 20 June 2007 (hosted by ''[[The Washington Post]]''); {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6221112.stm|title=First S Leone war crimes verdicts|date=20 June 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122151146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6221112.stm|archive-date=22 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Salvadoran Civil War|civil war between 1980 and 1992]] the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the ''[[Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación Nacional|Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National]]'' (FMLN)'','' recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A fifth of the army’s personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/experiences-and-psychocial-impact-of-the-el-salvador-civil-war-on-child-soldiers|title=Experiences and psychocial impact of the El Salvador civil war on child soldiers|last=Santacruz|first=Maria|last2=Arana|first2=Rubi|date=2002|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522043014/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/experiences-and-psychocial-impact-of-the-el-salvador-civil-war-on-child-soldiers|archive-date=22 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-21|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Cambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the ''[[The Cambodia Daily|Cambodia Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Cambodia Daily|last=|first=|date=2001|work=Cambodia Daily|access-date=2018-05-21|via=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers: 'Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many children had fled the ''Khmer Rouge'' without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Meanwhile, the ''Khmer Rouge'' had collapsed with the death of its leader, [[Pol Pot]], in 1998.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|demobilisation programmes]] were inadequate, according to [[UNICEF]], failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to the UN: "Child soldiers in Chechnya were reportedly assigned the same tasks as adult combatants, and served on the front lines soon after joining the armed forces."&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/country52/1996_13.htm|title=UN Commission on Human Rights – The situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation (Mar 96)|publisher=.umn.edu|accessdate=12 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211102551/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/country52/1996_13.htm|archive-date=11 February 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 under-18s were still believed to be involved in a range of armed groups in the war against Russia; some allegedly took part in suicide bombings.&lt;ref name="CSGR2004-217"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-soldiers.org/document_get.php?id=966|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217103244/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document_get.php?id=966|archive-date=2004-12-17|dead-url=yes}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.29&amp;nbsp;MB)}} [[Child Soldiers International]] p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinnernet''' is an annual networking event for [[Internet]] professionals held in [[Ohalo]],  [[Israel]].
==History==
The first Kinnernet event was held in the spring of 2003. Organised by [[Yossi Vardi]], founding investor of [[ICQ]], Kinnernet is a [[think tank]] on the Internet, with some 250 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article701933.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928012525/http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article701933.ece|archivedate=28 September 2011|date=4 April 2006|title=Bubble 2.0|work=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference is [[invitation-only]] and [[self-organized]], originally inspired by [[Tim O'Reilly]]'s [[Foo Camp]].

Some discussion points become topics at TheMarker, a two-day Internet business conference in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://comvention.themarker.com/ The Marker.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304114251/http://comvention.themarker.com/ |date=March 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[2010 FIFA World Cup]]''' generated various [[Controversy|controversies]], including some from before the tournament started. Most centred on [[Referee (association football)|refereeing]].

==Qualification==

===France vs. Republic of Ireland===
{{Main|France 1–1 Ireland (18 November 2009)}}
{{Wikinews|Ireland requests replay of FIFA World Cup play-off with France}}{{Wikinews|FIFA to make changes after Thierry Henry handball}}
In the second leg of the qualification play-off match between France and the Republic of Ireland on 18 November 2009, French captain [[Thierry Henry]], unseen by the referee and other match officials, illegally handled the ball twice in the lead up to the winning goal.  The incident caused widespread debate about FIFA Fair Play, and how matches should be refereed at the highest level.  The [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) requested a replay of the game on grounds of fairness, but was denied by FIFA under the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]].&lt;ref name=FIFA20Nov09FIFAStatementOnFAIRequest&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, FIFA called an extraordinary general meeting of the Executive Committee to discuss various issues, with the Henry incident high on the agenda. FIFA announced they would be setting up an inquiry into technology and extra officials in the game, but they did not announce a widely expected move of the fast-tracked introduction of goal-line referee's assistants, already being trialed in the [[UEFA Europa League]], and confirmed the competition in South Africa would be officiated as normal with a referee, two assistants, and a fourth official.&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of fair Play, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] said:
:''"I appeal to all the players and coaches to observe this fair play. In 2010 we want to prove that football is more than just kicking a ball but has social and cultural value...So we ask the players 'please observe fair play' so they will be an example to the rest of the world".''&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09FIFAToInvestigateHenry&gt;{{cite news

On 5 June 2015 it was determined that the [[Football Association of Ireland]] were paid €5 million by FIFA not to protest Thierry Henry handball.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jun/04/jack-warner-fifa-corruption-i-have-kept-quiet-i-will-do-so-no-more-live&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria vs. Egypt===

==Animal sacrifices==
Plans to slaughter a cow at each stadium to be used for the World Cup generated concern among [[animal rights]] groups. The Makhonya Royal Trust proposed the concept stating the cattle killing event was a "true African" way of blessing the tournament.&lt;ref name = "cow1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8388001.stm World Cup stadium 'cow sacrifice' plan sparks row.] BBC News website, updated at 16:22 GMT, Tuesday, 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"We must have a cultural ceremony of some sort, where we are going to slaughter a beast. We sacrifice the cow for this great achievement and we call on our ancestors to bless, to grace, to ensure that all goes well. The World Cup will be on the African continent and we will make sure that African values and cultures are felt by the visitors."''&lt;ref name = "cow1" /&gt;

The issue of cattle sacrifice was discussed by a High Court. Judge Nic Van der Reyden said the matter needed to be taken up by politicians.&lt;ref name = "ct"&gt;[http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5486198 Sangomas sacrifice ox to bless the World Cup stadiums.] Cape Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ox was slaughtered at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium on 25 May. A place was created within the Soccer City precinct to act as a "kraal" where the ox was slaughtered. After that, the senior traditional healers walked into the stadium in song, drum-beating and dance, where they continued to bless the inside of the stadium with rituals.&lt;ref name = "ct" /&gt;

==Group stage==

===Brazil vs. Côte d'Ivoire===
Brazilian striker [[Luís Fabiano]] handled the ball twice in the build-up to Brazil's second goal, which helped Brazil win the match 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8750795.stm|title=World Cup 2010: Eriksson tips Brazil to win Cup|date=20 June 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian midfielder [[Kaká]] was sent off late in the game for a collision with Ivorian midfielder [[Abdul Kader Keïta|Kader Keïta]]. Replays showed Keïta had run into Kaká's side, deliberately striking Kaká's shoulder, and then fell to the ground holding his face in a successful attempt to have Kaká sent off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8750797.stm|title=World Cup 2010: Red-carded Kaka will focus on form|date=21 June 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA vs. Slovenia===
With the match tied 2–2 in the 86th minute, [[Maurice Edu]] of the United States appeared to score the winning goal from a set piece, but referee [[Koman Coulibaly]] disallowed the goal and awarded a free-kick to Slovenia.  Because Coulibaly had blown for the free-kick before the goal had been scored, he was not required to (and did not) explain the call on the pitch or to FIFA officials afterwards.  Replays showed numerous Slovenian players pulling and hanging on Americans, fighting for position in the box, but no foul or offsides by the Americans was apparent to justify disallowing the goal.  US striker [[Robbie Findley]] was also given a mysterious yellow card, which resulted in him missing the next match against Algeria. Although the match ended in a 2–2 draw, the United States ultimately went on to win the group. Coulibaly received a "poor" performance review for the match and was selected to only one additional match in the tournament, as the 4th referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/408418-2010-world-cup-soccergate-koman-coulibaly-costs-us-and-may-be-out|title=USA vs. Slovenia 2010 World Cup: Koman Coulibaly Costs the U.S. and May Be Out|date=19 June 2010|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia vs. Serbia===
After the previous two matches, both had a chance of qualifying. However, with the other game being Ghana vs. Germany, Serbia seemingly had the better chance to advance to the next round (due to a superior head-to-head record against likely group winners Germany). During the last minutes of the match, with Serbia losing 2-1, Australia's Tim Cahill clearly hit the ball with his hand in the box, but the officials decided not to award a penalty for Serbia, and play continued;&lt;ref name=BBC-WC2010Serbia&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8757433.stm World Cup 2010: Missed handball enrages Serbia manager Page last updated at 22:28 GMT, Wednesday, 23 June 2010 23:28 UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozwatch.sportsblog.com/posts/2076329/australia_____2010_soccer_world_cup.html Australia – 2010 Soccer World Cup], April 01, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; also Serbia had a late goal disallowed for what appeared to be a questionable offside.&lt;ref name=BBC-WC2010Serbia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/soccer-news/index.ssf/2010/06/world_cup_2010_serbia_vs_austr.html World Cup 2010 final score: Australia 2, Serbia 1.] (The Star-Ledger) By Colin Stephenson, on June 23, 2010 at 1:40 PM, updated June 23, 2010 at 10:19 PM&lt;/ref&gt; With Ghana losing to Germany 1–0, a second goal would have given Serbia runners-up spot in the group and advancement to the Round of 16.&lt;ref name=BBC-WC2010Serbia/&gt;

=={{anchor|Refereeing}}Round of 16==
On 27 June, during two round of 16 matches, two incidents occurred that led to renewed debate over the lack of video technology in refereeing&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7857729/England-v-Germany-Fifa-want-better-refereeing-not-goal-line-technology.html "England v Germany: Fifa want 'better refereeing' not goal-line technology"], ''The Telegraph'', June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h9y-b56t_1howS_ADlYIZ1KNnCOw "Mondial: le but refusé à Lampard va relancer le débat sur la vidéo"], AFP, June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8766423.stm "World Cup 2010: Lampard calls for goal-line technology"], BBC, June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/scottishpremier/7857822/World-Cup-2010-Gordon-Smith-calls-for-use-of-goal-line-technology.html "World Cup 2010: Gordon Smith calls for use of goal-line technology"], ''The Telegraph'', June 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/27/world-cup-2010-goal-line-technology "World Cup 2010: Sports minister joins calls for goal-line technology"], ''The Guardian'', June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;– the disallowing of England midfielder [[Frank Lampard]]'s goal against Germany, and an Argentinian goal against Mexico that was allowed despite being scored from an offside position.

During England's 4–1 loss to Germany, Lampard's shot hit the crossbar and then crossed the [[Association football pitch#Other markings|goal-line]] before bouncing back out to German goalkeeper [[Manuel Neuer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/pictures/7857609/England-v-Germany-Frank-Lampard-denied-goal-by-Uruguayan-linesman-in-pictures.html?image=3 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=England v Germany: Frank Lampard denied goal by Uruguayan linesman - in pictures | date=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linesman [[Mauricio Espinosa]] and referee [[Jorge Larrionda]] did not award the goal but subsequent replays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_of_wales/8768512.stm | work=BBC News | title=FAW boss rejects technology idea | date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and photographic evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7857382/England-v-Germany-Frank-Lampards-disallowed-goal-highlights-stupidity-of-Fifas-ruling.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=England v Germany: Frank Lampard's disallowed goal highlights stupidity of Fifa | first=Kevin | last=Garside | date=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed the ball had indeed crossed the goal-line. This incident reignited demands for [[goal-line technology]].

During the Argentina vs. Mexico match [[Carlos Tevez]] scored from an offside position from within the Mexican penalty box when the game stood at 0–0. Although against FIFA's ruling, the big screens inside [[Soccer City]] showed replays of Tevez more than a yard offside when [[Lionel Messi]] played the ball towards him. The goal stood, causing uproar and protests from the Mexican players. Referee [[Roberto Rosetti]] stuck with his decision. Argentina subsequently won the match 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_52 "Argentina 3-1 Mexico"], ''BBC'', June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Argentinian goal, BBC commentators wrote that "[[Assistant referee (association football)|linesman]] Stefano Ayroldi [...] somehow allowed [[Carlos Tevez]]'s goal to stand before a ridiculous situation developed where he, referee [[Roberto Rosetti]] and everyone in the stadium watched replays on the huge screens show exactly how far offside Tevez was"; pundit [[Alan Hansen]] added: "Before today I was not an advocate of technology in football, but now I am a convert."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_52/default.stm Argentina - Mexico], BBC, June 27, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press]] sports columnist John Leicester reacted to the match between England and Germany by writing:
:''" FIFA fears that technology would undermine the authority of referees and their assistants. But the reverse is in fact happening. Match officials are being made to look like idiots because they are not getting the help that they need. [...] [B]alls, as Lampard proved, can bounce in and out of goal so quickly that a linesman can miss it if he's not paying attention, blinks, is screened or for whatever reason is looking away. That's why technology is needed. And the time to introduce it was yesterday. [[Sepp Blatter|Blatter]] has some explaining to do."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i_r_vkj6ZxEsCPQkqGvwSqM9SVfAD9GJQC2G0 "FIFA, don't ignore the Blunder in Bloemfontein"], Associated Press, June 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The press spoke of:
:''"two great victories [...] overshadowed by controversies emanating from two crucial mistakes made by match officials".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/editorials/article523873.ece/World-Cup-errors-highlight-need-for-technology-rethink "World Cup errors highlight need for technology rethink"], ''The Times'' (South Africa), June 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] stated that he deplored the "evident referee mistakes" in England vs. Germany and Mexico vs. Argentina matches, and apologised to the English and Mexican football federations ("the two federations directly concerned by referee's mistakes"). He added: "It is obvious that after the experiences so far at this World Cup it would be a nonsense not to re-open the file on goal-line technology. [...] We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high-level referees. [...] I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8771294.stm "World Cup 2010: Blatter sorry for disallowed goal"], BBC, June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/29/world-cup-2010-sepp-blatter-technology "World Cup 2010: Sepp Blatter says sorry to England for disallowed goal"], ''The Guardian'', June 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suárez handball==
[[File:Suárez Forlan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Luis Suárez]] (left)]]
In a [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Uruguay vs Ghana|quarter-final match]] against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguayan]] striker [[Luis Suárez]] handled the ball to prevent a last minute Ghana goal.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/04/luis-suarez-world-cup-villian-hand-of-god |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Luis Suarez is new World Cup villain after 'hand of God' claim |first=Jamie |last=Doward |date=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez was shown a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]] and Ghana's [[Asamoah Gyan]] missed the resulting penalty kick. Ghana subsequently lost the match, 4–2, in the penalty shootout.

The African press named Uruguay public enemy No.1 and described them as cheats.

Ghana's coach [[Milovan Rajevac]] argued that Suárez's actions were "really shocking," describing the result as a "football injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/uruguay/7870586/World-Cup-2010-Uruguays-Luis-Suarez-revels-in-second-coming-of-Hand-of-God.html|title=World Cup 2010: Uruguay's Luis Suárez revels in second coming of Hand of God|last=Chadband|first=Ian|date=3 July 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=3 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguay's coach [[Óscar Tabárez]] defended Suárez: "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use. ... We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, he stuck his hand out, but it's not cheating. What else do you want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty? We try to be dignified, and if we lose a match, we look for the reasons for it. You shouldn't look to third parties."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt; FIFA reviewed the possibility of increasing Suárez's ban but decided against punishing him for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, asking the question of whether players in that situation should be condemned as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players would do the same thing in the 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulfletcher/2010/07/luis_suarez_hero_or_villain.html#228885|title=Luis Suarez – hero or villain?|last=Fletcher|first=Paul|date=3 July 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/10537133.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Ghana calls for Fifa rule change |date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French team discord==
[[File:NAnelka.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolas Anelka]] was sent home from the World Cup, and was one of five players summoned to the FFF for discord]]
The [[France national football team|French team]] had significant troubles with team dissension at the World Cup. The press was strongly critical of both players and coaches. This followed a highly disappointing [[UEFA Euro 2008]] first round exit, and a difficult [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification campaign]]. After [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|controversially winning their play-off meeting]] with [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], the French players appeared aloof to the public as they headed straight for the dressing room instead of signing autographs. Several players were questioned by police just prior to the Finals in South Africa, following a raid on a Paris nightclub renowned for arranging dates between wealthy clients and underage prostitutes. Before the tournament began, the [[French Football Federation]] (FFF) announced that head coach [[Raymond Domenech]] would leave his position at the end of the tournament.&lt;ref name="news.nationalpost.com"&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/22/world-cup-le-collapse-scandalizes-france/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Striker [[Nicolas Anelka]] delivered a profanity-laden criticism at Domenech as the team was losing to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8749698.stm |title = World Cup 2010: Nicolas Anelka sent home after bust-up  |work=The Guardian |date=19 June 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anelka was sent home after refusing to apologize. The next day, captain and left wingback [[Patrice Evra]] was caught on camera in a heated argument with trainer Robert Duverne, which eventually led to intervention by others in the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

In turn, managing director Jean-Louis Valentin then resigned in disgust at the players' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

On the orders of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], Sports Minister [[Roselyne Bachelot]] held an emotional meeting with the team where she admonished the players saying "How would you like people to remember you? What image do you want to leave behind?".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i6DlEmqjhIryg_eszxSEz0bfscuAD9GGC1LG0 Bachelot reduces French World Cup players to tears.] , [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705145706/http://www.worldcup.cbssports.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,13041~2083296,00.html archived online.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625052402/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i6DlEmqjhIryg_eszxSEz0bfscuAD9GGC1LG0 |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reportedly reduced the players, especially the younger ones, to tears and they applauded her. Later at an impromptu media briefing at the Free State Stadium, Bachelot said "I told the players they had tarnished the image of France. It is a morale disaster for French football. I told them they could no longer be heroes for our children. They have destroyed the dreams of their countrymen, their friends and supporters." The players apologized to Domenech and resumed practice the next day. Patrice Evra was dropped for the final group game.&lt;ref name="news.nationalpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/france/7846138/World-Cup-2010-French-sports-minister-blasts-France-squad-over-protest.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=World Cup 2010: French sports minister blasts France squad over protest | date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallout continued after the team's return to France, with FFF President [[Jean-Pierre Escalettes]] announcing his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8756210.stm|title=World Cup 2010: French chief quits after fiasco|date=28 June 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escalettes has stated that Anelka would never be picked again for the national team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foreign.peacefmonline.com/sports/201007/55041.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Former defender [[Lilian Thuram]] has said "I asked for the players to be severely punished and for Patrice Evra never to come back into the France team.

After the expulsion of Anelka and ensuing training strike, Evra and Ribéry were summoned for failing in their duties as captain and vice captain, Toulalan was seen as the originator of the statement read out by coach Domenech to the media, while Abidal was accused of refusing to play in the final group match. After the hearing, Anelka was banned from playing for France for 18 games, Evra was banned for five, Ribéry for three, and Toulalan for one, while Abidal escaped punishment. Anelka dismissed the sanction as irrelevant, considering himself already retired from international football.&lt;ref name=BBC18Aug2010AnelkaLaughs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8893705.stm|title=Nicolas Anelka laughs at 'nonsense' 18-match French ban |publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 August 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian17Aug2010AnelkaSuspended&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/17/nicolas-anelka-banned-for-18-matches-france|title=Nicolas Anelka suspended for 18 matches by France over World Cup revolt|publisher=The Guardian|date=17 August 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010 | location=London | first=Lizzy | last=Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final==
{{main|2010 FIFA World Cup Final#Reaction}}
The final was particularly controversial due to the high number of yellow cards issued (fourteen, resulting in one sending-off). The most notable incident was [[Nigel de Jong]]'s kick into the midriff of Alonso, punished only with a booking from referee [[Howard Webb]], who subsequently admitted he should have shown a red card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Wilson |title=I should have shown Nigel de Jong a red card, says Howard Webb |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/25/howard-webb-world-cup-final |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 August 2010 | accessdate= 23 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*October&amp;nbsp;30, 2010&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Tomas]] skirts the southern coast of Barbados as a strong [[tropical storm]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Upon striking the island and the rest of the [[Windward Islands|Windward archipelago]], Tomas becomes the latest hurricane on record in a calendar year to impact the region. At [[Grantley Adams International Airport]], a wind gust of 105&amp;nbsp;mph (165&amp;nbsp;km/h) is documented. The same station measured {{convert|11.56|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain. The strong winds knock down power lines and damage homes; an estimated 1,200&amp;nbsp;residences sustain damage as a result of Tomas. Overall damage amounts to US$8.5&amp;nbsp;million, though no deaths are reported.&lt;ref name=TomasTCR&gt;{{cite report|title=Hurricane Tomas|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL212010_Tomas}}|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=18 August 2013|author=Pasch, Richard J.|author2=Kimberlain, Todd B.|author3=National Hurricane Center|location=[[Miami, Florida]]|format=PDF|date=March 7, 2011|type=Preliminary Tropical Cyclone Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12609">The following people have been identified as victims of the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].

The victims of the phone hacking fall broadly into three categories, as identified by [[Nick Davies]] writing in the Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/10/phone-hacking-victims-list]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, there are those people who have been approached and warned by Scotland Yard that there was hard evidence of their voicemail being accessed without authority. Some were warned at the time of the original inquiry in 2006. Others were warned only after the Guardian revived the story in July 2009. Scotland Yard refuse to say how many were warned at either time. They have said that they also approached and warned people in four 'national security' categories if there was reasonable grounds to suspect that their voicemail might have been accessed without authority - members of the royal household, the military, the police and the government. But here again, they refuse to say how many people they warned in each of those categories.

Second, there are those who have taken the initiative to approach Scotland Yard and to ask whether the police hold any evidence that they were targeted in any way by Mulcaire. Scotland Yard are holding the results of an analysis of phone records which, we now know, revealed "a vast number" of people who had had their voicemail accessed; and also a spreadsheet which summarises the contents of the mass of paperwork, audio tapes and computer records which police seized from Mulcaire and which, the Guardian discovered, included 4,332 names or partial names; 2,987 mobile phone numbers; 30 audio tapes of varying length; and 91 PIN codes of a kind which are needed to access voicemail with the minority of targets who change the factory settings on their mobile phones.

Third, there are 120 people who were identified by three mobile phone companies who followed up on Scotland Yard's original investigation and found that some of their users had had their voicemail accessed from numbers used by Glenn Mulcaire. Orange say they warned none of those whom they identified; Vodafone say they warned customers 'as appropriate'; O2 say they warned all of their customers whom they identified.

The '''McAfrika''' was a [[hamburger]] sold by the [[fast food]] restaurant chain [[McDonald's]] in [[Norway]] and "traded"&lt;ref name="Virtually Useless Information" /&gt; as a Limited Edition Olympic Games Burger. It attracted significant public criticism as a result of its name and the timing of its launch.&lt;ref name="Virtually Useless Information"&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtually Useless Information | publisher=West Side Publishing | year=2010 | ISBN=978-1-60553-916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="business insider"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/failed-mcdonalds-items-2011-8?op=1 | title=12 McDonald's Menu Items That Failed Spectacularly | publisher=Business Insider | date=30 August 2011 | accessdate=2013-06-07 | author=Bhasin, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
The McAfrika sandwich contained beef, cheese, and tomatoes wrapped in [[pita bread]]. McDonald's claimed it was based upon an authentic African recipe.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/24/famine.andrewosborn | title=New from McDonald's: the McAfrika burger (don't tell the 12m starving) | work=The Guardian | date=24 August 2002 | accessdate=2013-06-07 | author=Osborn, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==
The McAfrika was released in 2002, just as a major famine was occurring in [[Malawian food crisis|Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Zambia]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Oliver |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/25/famine.qanda |title=Famine in southern Africa &amp;#124; Global development |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.delish.com/food-fun/mcdonalds-mcafrika-fast-food-flops#slide-8 | title=We're Not Lovin' It! Fast Food's Most Famous Flops | accessdate=2013-06-07 | author=Borja, Sahara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the burger was immediately criticized for being grossly insensitive, especially since it was released in Norway, one of the richest nations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Norwegian 'Miracle'|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/07/the_norwegian_miracle.html|accessdate=13 June 2013|newspaper=[[American Thinker]]|date=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We're Rich, You're Not.

[[Norwegian Church Aid]] and the [[Norwegian Red Cross]], which were both conducting humanitarian operations in southern Africa at the time, said that McDonald's decision was insensitive, crass and ill-considered.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Linn Aas-Hansen said that "it's inappropriate and distasteful to launch a hamburger called McAfrika when large portions of southern Africa are on the verge of starvation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/24/famine.andrewosborn|title=New from McDonald's: the McAfrika burger (don't tell the 12m starving)|last=Osborn|first=Andrew|date=2002-08-23|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARE Norway demanded that McDonald's withdraw the burger.&lt;ref name=Bevanger&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2217450.stm|title='McAfrika' burger not to everyone's taste|last=Bevanger|first=Lars|date=26 August 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Norwegian Church Aid protested the McAfrika burgers by giving out "catastrophe crackers" to customers entering Norwegian McDonald's outlets.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

Support for McDonald's came from the organization African Youth in Norway who appreciated Africa name being used in a positive manner instead of as a continent of war and poverty.&lt;ref name=Bevanger/&gt;

==McDonald's response==
McDonald's did not withdraw the burger, instead offering it until September 2002, just as planned in its campaign.&lt;ref name=Bevanger/&gt; However, as a conciliatory gesture, it allowed aid agencies to put up posters and donation boxes in McDonald's restaurants where the McAfrika was being sold. Furthermore, McDonald's spokesperson Margaret Brusletto apologized for the timing of the launch, saying "We acknowledge that we have chosen an unfortunate time to launch this new product."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

==2008 re-launch==
The McAfrika was re-launched in 2008 to promote the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] for a short time, and attracted a similarly negative response.&lt;ref name="business insider" /&gt;

{{Culture of Scotland}}A '''mòd''' is a festival of [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] song, arts and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=mod+gaelic+scotland+-ministry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS_OHyiN_WAhVCa1AKHdu8Dw4Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mod%20gaelic%20scotland%20-ministry&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia.

Mòds are run under the auspices of [[An Comunn Gàidhealach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA471&amp;dq=mod+An+Comunn+G%C3%A0idhealach+-ministry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUmrfRid_WAhXDbFAKHZekA9YQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mod%20An%20Comunn%20G%C3%A0idhealach%20-ministry&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vol. 1-|last=Koch|first=John T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781851094400|location=|pages=471|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from a Gaelic word for a parliament or congress in common use during the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].
A Mòd largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events (in Gaelic, both solo and [[choir]]s), and traditional music including [[fiddle]], [[bagpipe]] and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children and adult's poetry reading, storytelling and [[Bible]] reading, and categories such as Ancient Folk Tale or Humorous [[Monologue]]. Children can also present an original [[drama]], and there are competitions in written [[literature]].  Unlike the National Mòd, local mòds usually only last a day or two. They attract a much smaller crowd and the only notable social event is the winners' [[ceilidh]]. As there are fewer competitions than in the National Mòd, this ceilidh is often more like a traditional ceilidh with dancing and guest singers between the winners' performances.  Culturally, mods are comparable to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[eisteddfod]], but without the ancient roots or the fanciful nineteenth-century "druidic" pageantry of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].

'''''Our Country's Good''''' is a 1988 play written by British playwright, [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]], adapted from the [[Thomas Keneally]] novel ''[[The Playmaker]]''.  The story concerns a group of [[Royal Marines]] and [[Convictism in Australia|convicts]] in a [[penal colony]] in [[New South Wales]], in the 1780s, who put on a production of ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]''.

It was first staged at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, on 10 September 1988, directed by [[Max Stafford-Clark]].  It ran on Broadway in 1991.

== Background ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
In the 1780s, [[Convictism in Australia|convicts]] and [[Royal Marines]] were sent to Australia as part of the first [[penal colony]] there.  The play shows the class system in the convict camp and discusses themes such as sexuality, punishment, the [[Georgian Era|Georgian]] judicial system, and the idea that it is possible for "theatre to be a humanising force".

As part of their research, Stafford-Clark and Wertenbaker went to see a play performed by convicts at [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], which proved inspiring: "in prison conditions, theatre can be hugely heartening and influential and indeed in prison your options are so limited you can become a born-again Christian, a gym-queen constantly working out, a bird watcher or you become passionate about theatre."  The convicts were, at least momentarily, civilized human beings, and they had taken their work very seriously: &lt;blockquote&gt;The convicts knew their lines absolutely because they had nothing else to do and they didn't want to waste time with pleasantries; as soon as you came into the room they started rehearsing. The two hours were very intense because the time was so valuable and we saw immediately how doing a play could become absolutely absorbing if you were incarcerated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the characters in the play are based on real people who sailed with the [[First Fleet]], though some have had their names changed. Wertenbaker was able to read the journals of First Fleet members in order to portray them accurately.

== Synopsis ==
In the hold of the convict ship ''Sirius'', the convicts witness an (off-stage) flogging and express fear about their future. In [[Sydney Cove]], an unnamed [[Aboriginal Australian]] witnesses the arrival of the first fleet. Throughout the play, he comments on the British settlement's effect on the indigenous populations, reacting with curiosity, confusion, and finally fear.

Some time after arriving in Sydney, Governor Arthur Philip, Captain David Collins, Captain Watkin Tench, and Midshipman Harry Brewer debate the purpose of prison: should it be to punish or rehabilite?; and the nature of criminal tendencies: are they innate or acquired? When Tench mentions that the convicts consider hanging to be "entertainment," Philip wonders if they could be offered something else. He suggests that the convicts could stage a play, but nevertheless orders Harry to find a hangman and execute three men who have been convicted of stealing food.

After hanging two of the thieves, Harry is plagued by guilt, especially as one of the thieves, Handy Baker, was Harry's rival for the affection of Duckling Smith, a young convict woman. Harry tells Second Lieutenant Ralph Clark about the Governor's idea to have the convicts stage a play and Ralph decides to take this project on, hoping to get the Governor to notice him.

Ralph chooses [[George Farquhar]]'s [[restoration comedy]] ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]'' and holds [[audition]]s. Some of the convicts who audition are Meg Long, an aged prostitute; Robert Sideway, a flamboyant [[pickpocket]]; the shy Mary Brenham; her more outspoken friend Dabby Bryant; and the hardened criminal Liz Morden. Ralph offers Mary the main female role of Silvia and reluctantly agrees that Dabby can play Rose. Liz Morden is offered the role of Melinda.

One evening, the officers discuss theatre, punishment, criminality and morality, and debate the value of Ralph's project. [[Robert Ross (Royal Marines officer)|Major Ross]], his acolyte Captain Campbell, and the pragmatic Captain Tench express conservative opinions and oppose the play, which is defended vehemently by Philip, Collins and Ralph Clark. Collins conducts a vote and with the majority in favour, Ralph is allowed to start rehearsals.

Duckling complains that Harry is always watching her, leaving her no freedom. To appease her, he says that he will let her take part in the play. Dabby and Mary start learning their lines. Mary feels inadequate to play a noble lady, as she is ashamed of having sold herself to a sailor on the ship for food. Dabby argues that Mary was no virgin and that she might otherwise not have survived the voyage. Liz interrupts them and demands to be included, but Dabby becomes resentful when it becomes clear that Liz can't read. Their fight is broken up by James “[[Jack Ketch|Ketch]]” Freeman, the hangman. Freeman visits Ralph in his tent, claims that he is innocent of the murder that got him transported to Australia. He explains why he agreed to take on the office of hangman; having been convicted for stealing food, he was told “hang or be hanged”. He finally begs Ralph for a part in the play. A [[Jew]]ish convict, John Wisehammer, engages Mary in a conversation about the meanings and sounds of words; she suggests he also take part in the play.

At the first rehearsal, two actors, Kable and Arscott, are missing; Sideway overacts, and Liz can't act at all. A convict named Black Caesar arrives and asks to play a servant. The rehearsal is interrupted by Ross and Campbell, who inform Ralph that Cable and Arscott have escaped. Ross arrests Caesar, who initially went with the escapees but came back. He also arrests Wisehammer, because Cable was last seen near Wisehammer’s hut; and Liz, accused of helping Cable steal food from the stores. The rehearsal is left in shambles.

In prison, Liz tells Wisehammer her life story. Wisehammer protests that he is innocent. Caesar dreams of making another escape attempt and returning to [[Madagascar]]. John Arscott, who has been recaptured, desperately cries out that escape is impossible. Sideway, Duckling and Mary arrive in prison so they can continue to rehearse.

Ralph tells Philip that, because half of his actors are in prison, he wants to stop the play, but Philip exhorts him to continue trying, making Ralph see the much larger meaning that the play has for the colony. Philip especially advocates for Liz Morden, as he wants to make an example of her – through redemption.

In his tent, Harry Brewer sees the ghosts of the two men he hanged, including his rival Handy Baker. He shouts for Duckling, but when she arrives, he cannot trust her, saying that the "ghost" told him that Handy and Duckling had been on the beach together.

On Philip’s orders, Ross brings Wisehammer, Caesar, and Liz to the second rehearsal. Nobody feels comfortable rehearsing in Ross's presence and Ralph tries to get him to leave. This just infuriates Ross. He starts humiliating the convicts, forcing Sideway to show his flogging scars, Dabby to imitate a dog and Mary to show the tattoo high up on her inner thigh. As the rehearsal continues, Sideway and Liz begin to enter more fully into their parts, boldly using the full length of the room and interacting with the others. The words of the play take a double meaning highly significant to the situation. In response, Ross orders Campbell to flog Arscott as punishment for his escape; the sounds of the flogging and Arscott's cries end the rehearsal.

Liz has been sentenced to death for stealing food. Freeman reluctantly measures her for hanging. Harry, who oversees the process, still hears the ghosts of the dead. It becomes clear that Liz did not defend herself at her trial, but just as 'Ketch' and Harry are about to leave, she asks Harry to tell Ralph that she did not steal the food. As they question her as to why she didn't speak up, Harry collapses.

As Kable is not back, Ralph has taken over his part in ''The Recruiting Officer''. It is clear by now that Wisehammer and Ralph are rivals for Mary’s affection, just as they are for Silvia’s in the Farquhar play. Dabby complains that she can't relate to her character, but Wisehammer argues that a play should teach you something new. Arscott remarks that the play allows him to forget about own situation, contrasting with Dabby, who wants to play herself. The arrival of Ketch Freeman ends the rehearsal, as the others refuse to act with a hangman.

In Harry Brewer’s tent, Duckling promises love and fidelity to Harry, only to discover that he has just died. She collapses.

Mary is rehearsing on her own. Ralph joins her. Reciting their lines in the play, they end up confessing their love.

Philip, Ross, Collins, Campbell and Ralph discuss Liz Morden one more time. Philip is afraid of a miscarriage of justice, as the evidence against her is flimsy. Liz is given a last chance to defend herself. She finally speaks, saying that she knew Cable wanted to steal the food, but she wasn’t present when he did. Collins orders a retrial. Despite her situation, Liz surprises everyone present by politely promising to perform her role in the play.

Backstage before the performance, the actors attempt to console Duckling. They also discuss the future: Dabby plans to escape that night; Sideway wants to start a theatre company; Liz and Freeman want to join Sideway's company as actors and Wisehammer as playwright; Mary and Ralph plan their lives together. Caesar is very drunk and suffering from stage fright; only ludicrous threats from his fellow actors convince him to go on stage. Wisehammer reminds Ralph of the prologue he wrote for the play and reads it. Although pleased, Ralph does not dare to use it, because it is too political. The play begins: Arscott and Caesar go onstage while as the rest of the cast listens in trepidation. The first speech of the play is met with tremendous applause.

== Characters ==

=== Use of doubling ===

The play has been written with the idea of doubling in mind, needing only ten actors for twenty-two roles. It is typically performed with performers changing costumes on stage; a wig and military uniform jacket marking the only differences between an officer and a convict. Ralph Clark is the only character that has to be played by an actor without a second role; every other actor plays at least one convict and one officer, with three actors even taking three roles. The following table shows the list of characters with all roles typically (as done by the original production and imitated by most later productions) taken by one actor in the same horizontal line

=== Overview of characters ===
* [[Arthur Phillip|Captain Arthur Phillip, RN]]: The real Arthur Phillip had been called out of retirement to take on the position of Governor of the first fleet to Australia. He is a calm and controlled leader, contrasting Major Robbie Ross's leadership. He shows an obvious patience and understanding towards the convicts, especially Liz Morden. Throughout the play he refers to historical people and situations, such as famous thespians Garrick and Kemble. He is intellectual, understanding, and authoritative.
* [[Robert Ross (Royal Marines officer)|Major Robbie Ross, RM]]: The real Major Robbie Ross had previously been on the losing side of the American War of Independence. In the play, Ross makes a reference to this, "This is a profligate prison for us all, it's a hellish hole we soldiers have been hauled to because they blame us for losing the war in America." (Act Two, Scene Ten) The fact he feels he is being blamed may account for some of his bitterness. He is a vile, power obsessed man, who intimidates the convicts and believes that the convicts' punishment should be severe. He is completely against the play ''The Recruiting Officer'' being put on, and constantly ridicules Ralph Clark for it.
* [[David Collins (governor)|Captain David Collins, RM]]: Collins was appointed as the colony's judge on arrival at Botany Bay in 1788 and as such, his contribution to conversations at hand are generally from a legal perspective.  He approaches subjects with the other officers very logically and justifies all of his comments.  He fully supports Ralph's decision to stage a play and conducts a vote amongst the officers to find out who agrees with them. The real David Collins went on to found the first settlement in [[Tasmania]].
* [[Watkin Tench|Captain Watkin Tench, RM]]: Tench is an officer who dislikes all of the convicts for the simple fact that they are convicts. whenever he has a comment to make about them, it is always a sarcastic aside. He does not believe in the redemption of the convicts, nor in the fact that they can be converted from their criminal ways. He regards all of the convicts as barbarians, stating that hanging is "their favourite form of entertainment" (Act One, Scene Three).
* Captain Jemmy Campbell, RM: A follower of Ross. There is great debate among productions as to his sobriety and while he is often played as drunk, there is nothing ever mentioned in the script to confirm this thought. He tends to copy Ross's views on everything though finds himself amused by the idea of the convicts performing a play.
* [[Richard Johnson (chaplain)|Reverend Richard Johnson]]: The first clergyman in the Australian Penal Colony at Botany Bay, Johnson was to be a moral guide to both the convicts and officers of the camp, but seems more concerned with the play propagating Christian doctrine than any more pressing matters at hand. The Real Reverend Johnson was given a patch of land on which he planted oranges and lemons from Rio de Janeiro. It is said that he sold his 'Farm' for a fair profit when he left the colony.
* [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)|Lieutenant William Dawes, RM]]: The colony's astronomer, who couldn't care less about matters on earth. He agrees to the play if he doesn't have to come and watch it.
* [[George Johnston (New South Wales)|Lieutenant George Johnston, RM]]: An officer most famed for his "compassion, if not to say passion" (Act One, Scene Six) for the convict women. The real Johnston lived with a convict named Esther Abrahams and later took part in the Rum Rebellion.
* [[Ralph Clark|Second Lieutenant Ralph Clark]]: Ralph is struggling as a lower officer. He desperately wants promotion, and when he hears through Harry Brewer that Arthur Phillip has suggested a play be put on by the convicts, he jumps to set about doing it. You see his transformation in the play as he turns from a man who is extremely nervous and uneasy around women, even ridiculed for not having a women convict for himself on the voyage to Australia, to a man in love with the convict Mary Brenham. He is influenced, to changing his feelings towards the convicts, by Arthur Phillip, giving them respect in the end, apologising to Liz Morden for interrupting her line in a rehearsal. The real Ralph Clark later had a daughter with Mary Brenham, whom he named Betsey Alicia – for his wife in England.
* Second Lieutenant William Faddy: He opposes the play simply because he doesn't like Ralph. His dislike is never really explained, but all of his comments in his only scene (Act One, Scene Six) are sarcastic snides or even insults directed at Ralph.
* [[Midshipman Harry Brewer]]: Harry Brewer is an officer alongside the other army men, but is the lowest of ranks, Midshipman Harry Brewer struggles to find his place. Tormented by the apparent ghost of Handy Baker, a man who he had hanged, and other ghosts, he seeks reassurance in Ralph. Since in Australia, he and convict Duckling Smith have been together. He is a very jealous man, and is always keeping a watchful eye on Duckling, much to her dismay. He dies, with Duckling at his side in despair.
* John Arscott: John Arscott's hopelessness as a convict becomes apparent in Act Two, Scene One. He says, 'There's no escape I tell you.' His utter hopelessness becomes more apparent when it is revealed that his compass he bought from a sailor is actually a piece of paper with 'North' written on it. Depending upon the delivery, this line can be full of humour or full of pathos. He eventually becomes most lost in the play, claiming that he doesn't have to think about reality when he plays Kite, finding a different way of "escape" through the theatre. The real John Arscott never actually tried escaping and got rich enough after his liberation to return to England.
* James "[[Jack Ketch|Ketch]]" Freeman: Transported to Australia for the killing of a sailor who broke a strike, Freeman is made the hangman of the colony when he is told 'hang or be hanged'. Despised by many of the other convicts for being a hangman, in particular Liz Morden, Ketch struggles to be accepted. He exchanges words with Ralph in Act One, Scene Nine. He explains how he came to be in his situation, blaming a mix of reasons including leaving Ireland where his guardian angel was. You see also in this scene his desperation to be an actor in the play.
* John Wisehammer: Transported to Australia for stealing snuff, he continues to claim his innocence. He is Jewish and struggles against slight (Liz) and strong (Ross) anti-semitism. His large knowledge is self-taught and he says of himself that he "like[s] words" (Act One, Scene Ten). He writes a new prologue to the play, which Ralph doesn't want to use on the first night, as he considers it too political. In the end, Wisehammer wants to stay in Australia, as "no one has more of a right than anyone else to call [him] a foreigner" (Act Two, Scene Eleven), and to become an author there. He and Mary Brenham exchange words, literally, in Act One, Scene Ten, where Wisehammer's slight intellectualism is explained. The real Wisehammer would get married and become a merchant after his release.
* Black Caesar: Originally from Madagascar, Caesar wants to join the play and gets the (silent) parts of Worthy's servant and Kite's drummer more or less written for him. Stage fright gets the better of him in the end and he is only made to perform after the most ludicrous threats from his fellow actors. The real John Caesar was described as one of the most troublesome convicts and would be one of the colony's first bushrangers before being killed in 1796.
* Robert Sideway: A London pickpocket, severely punished on the transport ship for insulting an officer, Sideway tries to act as a cultured gentleman in front of Ralph, but keeps falling into [[Thieves' cant|cant]] when upset. He claims to have seen many theatre pieces, but his acting is completely over the top and one of the major sources of humour in the first rehearsal scene, when he accompanies near every word with a gesture. He says that he wants to found a theatre company in the last scene, which, according to the epilogue in Thomas Keneally's novel, the historical Sideway actually did.
* Mary Brenham (Branham): A very shy girl, whose love for "A.H." turned her into a thief, she gets as good as dragged to the audition by Dabby Bryant, but is offered a part by Ralph after having heard her read only a few lines. She opens up gradually, but remains slightly naive in comparison to the people around her. She finally falls in love with Ralph and dreams of a future with him. Brenham and Clark would indeed have a daughter, but Clark would leave both of them behind upon returning to England.
* Dabby Bryant: Mary's friend who constantly dreams of returning to Devon. Although she did sell Mary for food on the ship, she obviously cares for her. Although she seems to enjoy the play, she thinks the content and especially her character, Rose, are stupid and argues for a play that is more relevant towards their current situation. In the final scene, she reveals that she has plans for escaping that night. The real [[Mary Bryant]] would indeed become famous for a daring escape in 1791.
* Duckling Smith: A young thief and prostitute, sentenced to death at only 18 years of age. Harry Brewer is hopelessly in love with her, a feeling that for a long time does not appear to be mutual. She only admits to loving Harry once he is close to dying and later says that she never told him about her love as she feared he might become cruel towards her. Keneally lists her real name as Ann, but none of the three women named "Ann Smith" on the First Fleet fit her description.
* Liz Morden: One of the most troublesome women, Governor Phillip wants to make an example out of her: through redemption, which is why he wants her in the play. Liz is accused of stealing food, but does not defend herself at her trial. The play makes her care enough about herself to defend herself when given the last chance in Act Two, Scene Ten, where she claims that before, speaking wouldn't have mattered. In Keneally's novel, her name is Nancy Turner. Neither name can be found on the list of First Fleet convicts.
* Meg Long: Nicknamed "Shitty Meg", she acts as a madam for the other women convicts. She has a short but humorous appearance in the audition, where she completely misunderstands Clark's call for women.
* An Aboriginal Australian: He describes the British settler's efforts with curiosity and later with fear. Depending on how prominent his appearances are made in a given staging, the subject of colonisation may become more and more central to the play.

A '''passport''' is a travel document issued by a government to a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of that country. The purpose of this document is to allow entry back into the home country, as well as access into other countries around the world by providing legal proof of identity and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/m/ds/investigat/c10714.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Misusing a passport is a crime in many jurisdictions. 

==United States ==

'''Passport fraud'' is a federal crime. Usually, this crime is committed to facilitate another crime such as, [[Illegal immigration]], [[Contraband]] [[Smuggling]], [[Economic crime]], or [[Terrorism]]. The [[US department of state]]'s law enforcement, [[Diplomatic Security Service]] have special agents who work with [[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement agencies]] in over 160 countries all over the world to investigate passport fraud. Millions of stolen passports are used by terrorists and other dangerous criminals at any given time and is considered the single largest threat to U.S. [[National security]]. 

===Committing the Crime===

Passport fraud is usually committed by: 
• Stealing the identity of a deceased person to use their passport 
• Using false documents; i.e.: fake [[Birth certificate]]
• Using stolen or modified passports, such as altering the photo I.D portion of an old passport
• Circumventing the parent signatures required for the passport of a person 16 years or younger
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/m/ds/investigat/c10714.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violations===

Possible violations of the following statutes are investigated by the United States [[Diplomatic Security Service]]:

*18 U.S.C. 1541 Issuance Without Authority
*18 U.S.C. 1542 False Statement in Application and Use of [[Passport]] 
*18 U.S.C. 1543    [[Forgery]] or False Use of Passport
*18 U.S.C. 1544 Misuse of Passport 
*18 U.S.C. 1546 Fraud and Misuse of [[visa (document)|Visa]]s, Permits, and Other Documents 
*18 U.S.C. 371 Conspiracy to Commit Offense or to Defraud the United States 
*18 U.S.C. 911 False Claim to [[Citizenship]] 
*18 U.S.C. 1028 Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Identification Documents and Information

Statutes do not specify that the passport must be a US passport.

===Conviction===

If a person lied on a passport application form, they can be fined up to $250,000 and sentenced up to 10 years in [[prison]]. 
If the crime includes [[Trafficing in human beings|trafficing]], [[Narcotic|narcotics]], or both, the sentencing can be raised up to 15 years in prison. 
If terrorism is involved, the penalty can be raised to 20 years in prison.
As well as being charged with further penalties, if the person is caught engaging in any of these additional illegal activities.

'''Piedra Roja''' was a music festival in [[Chile]] noted as an expression of the [[Hippie|hippie counterculture]] in [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inedit-nescafe.cl/muestra-2011/competencia-nacional-2011/piedra-roja/ 2011 website on Piedra Roja]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of [[Woodstock]], a similar music festival was held in [[Chile]] between 10 and 12 October 1970 in the eastern area of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Among others, the following bands performed in the festival: [[Aguaturbia]], [[Los Blops]], [[Lágrima Seca]] and [[Los Jaivas]]. Similarly to [[Woodstock]], chaos marked the festival, involving problems with sound, drugs and delinquency. The festival showed for the first time that the young population in Chile during that time was a group to reckon with. It also showed the increasing social tension that would end in the ascension of [[Pinochet]].{{cn|date=May 2015}}

'''Reflections Projections''' (stylized as '''Reflections|Projections''' and shortened to '''R|P''') is an annual technology-related [[Academic conference|conference]] hosted by the [[UIUC|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] student chapter of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (also known as ACM). The conference has been held in October or November each year since 1995 and features two [[job fair]]s, numerous guest speakers from various fields in [[computing]], [[technology]] and occasionally [[webcomic]]s, as well as an [[AI]] programming competition, [[MechMania]]. One of the main goals of the event is to bring together midwestern ACM chapters. However, the event also open to students who are not members of ACM. The conference is noted for being free for general attendees and being run entirely by student volunteers. Students from a variety of schools attend the event to learn about new innovations in the CS field through various workshops and tech-talks.

== History ==

Reflections|Projections began as the 1995 Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference. The conference was originally held in the [[UIUC Engineering Campus#Digital Computer Laboratory|Digital Computer Laboratory]] but has since moved most of its operations to the [[Siebel Center for Computer Science]]. A job fair was incorporated into the conference in 1996. Other events that have been part of the conference have included movie showings, workshops, [[barbecues]], as well as an evening [[party|social]]. Early instances of the conference included registration fees for general attendance, though the conference is now free.

== MechMania ==

Running alongside guest speaker presentations at the conference is an [[artificial intelligence]] programming competition called [[MechMania]]. The competition typically attracts student groups from neighboring universities. MechMania is usually funded by a corporate sponsor which provides monetary prizes to the victors. During the opening ceremony of the conference, participants are presented with the rules to a game for which they must build an AI. Teams have twelve hours after this presentation to formulate a strategy and 24 hours to write and submit their solutions. Final judging for the competition has varied but usually involves a tournament [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]]. Sponsors for the competition have included [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[O'Reilly &amp; Associates]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Palantir Technologies|Palantir]], and others.

[[File:Faraday Michael Christmas lecture detail.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Faraday]] delivering a Christmas Lecture in 1856.]]
'''The Royal Institution Christmas Lectures''' are a series of lectures on a single topic each, which have been held at the [[Royal Institution]] in London each year since 1825, missing 1939–42 because of the Second World War. The lectures present scientific subjects to a general audience, including young people, in an informative and entertaining manner. [[Michael Faraday]] initiated the first Christmas Lecture series in 1825. This came at a time when organised education for young people was scarce. Faraday presented a total of nineteen series in all.

The props for the lectures are designed and created by the RI's science demonstration technician, a post which Faraday previously held. The technician is informed of the general subject of the lectures during spring, but the specifics aren't settled until September, with the recordings made in mid-December.&lt;ref name=secrets /&gt; By 2009, the lectures had expanded to a series of five sessions each year. However, in 2010 the Royal Institution cut back on costs as it had become over £2 million in debt. These cost cutting measures included the budget allotted to the Christmas Lectures. This resulted in a reduction from five sessions to three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|title=Cash-strapped Royal Institution scales back Christmas lectures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/12/royal-institution-christmas-talks|accessdate=15 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
The Christmas Lectures were first televised in 1936 on the BBC's fledgling Television Service.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6424a3e20cf3442aa89fe74b6b6f4859&lt;/ref&gt; They were broadcast on [[BBC Two]] from 1966–1999 and [[Channel 4]] from 2000–2004. In 2000 one of the lectures was broadcast live for the first time. Following the end of Channel 4's contract to broadcast the lectures, there were concerns that they might simply be dropped from scheduling as the channel was negotiating with the Royal Institution over potential changes to the format, while the BBC announced that "The BBC will not show the lectures again, because it feels the broadcasting environment has moved on in the last four years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adam|first=David|title=Christmas lectures threat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/26/science.media|accessdate=15 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel Five]] subsequently agreed to show the lectures from 2005–2008, an announcement which was met with derision from academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fazackerley|first=Anna|title=Academics scorn TV lecture move|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=193838&amp;sectioncode=26|accessdate=15 December 2012|newspaper=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=4 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures were broadcast on [[More4]] in 2009. In 2010, the lectures returned to the BBC after a ten-year absence from the broadcaster, and have been shown on [[BBC Four]] each year since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science lectures back on BBC|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/science-lectures-back-on-bbc-1-821532|accessdate=15 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''SXSW V2V''' is the newest [[South by Southwest]] conference; it features a startup competition, panel discussions, and mentoring workshops for entrepreneurs. Hosted in [[Las Vegas]], it is the first SXSW event to take place outside of [[Austin, Texas]].  It began in 2013 as an evolution of the startup competition that is held as part of the [[SXSW|SXSW Interactive]] festival each spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/sxsw-interactive-expanding-next-year-with-las-vega/nSmFZ/ |title= SXSW Interactive expanding next year with Las Vegas startup conference|last=Gallaga|first=Omar L.|publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
The company has said variously that V2V stands for "Vision to Venture", "Visionaries to Vegas", and “Voice to Voice", describing the focus of the conference on finding, financing, and developing new businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/business/south-by-southwest-interactive-expanding-to-las-ve/nSkyy/|title=South by Southwest Interactive expanding to Las Vegas with ‘V2V’ conference|last=Gallaga|first=Omar L.|date=October 23, 2012|publisher=Austin American-Statesman|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference started with the recognition that the three large spring festivals that SXSW, Inc. holds in Austin were straining the hotel capacity of that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/potential-seen-las-vegas-inaugural-sxsw-event|title=Potential seen in Las Vegas' inaugural SXSW event|last=Carroll|first=Laura|date=August 8, 2013|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|publisher=Stephens Media LLC|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">A '''Salsa congress''' is a multi-day dance festival featuring workshops, [[social dancing]], [[concert dance|performances]] and [[competitive dance|competitions]] focusing on [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa dancing]]. The format was first pioneered at the Puerto Rico Salsa Congress in 1997.

Since then salsa congresses have become popular in almost every country, including different cities in the USA, all over Europe, parts of Asia, and countries in Latin America and Africa. There are many events that follow a similar format to salsa congresses, but go by other names such as "Salsa Festival" or "Salsa Summit".

==Puerto Rico Salsa Congress==

The first salsa congress in the world took place in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1997 promoted by Eli Irizarry. The number of people participating in this first edition was 375 coming from 19 different countries.

In 1998 the number of participants was 550 from 23 countries, with 32 salsa companies performing and teaching and by 1999 there were 800 people from 34 countries with about 56 salsa companies taking part. In 2008 the finals of the World Salsa Open were hosted at the Puerto Rico Congress which concluded with Spain (Anita Santos and Adrián Rodríguez) winning the first position, Puerto Rico (Licelott Maldonado and Kelvin Hernández) as runner-up and Argentina (Fernando Alonso and Ayelen Gauna) in third place.

==Congreso Mundial de la Salsa==

The [[All Stars Entertainment company]] and [[Bacardí]] promoted between 1999 and 2002 a salsa tour, called the "Congreso Mundial de la salsa" in several locations including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Curaçao, Denver, Tokyo, Bombay, Calcutta, Valencia, Roma, Torino, Milan, Santiago de Compostela, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, London, Amsterdam, Miami, Mexico, Panamá, Colombia, Venezuela, Guayaquil, Osaka, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Paris or San Juan de Puerto Rico.

==Los Angeles Salsa Congress==

In 1999 and 2000 one of the cities visited by the 'Congreso Mundial de la salsa' was [[Los Angeles]] which has resulted in a congress every year since. The event is held every May and is the oldest salsa congress in the US. The congress was originally called the "West Coast Salsa Congress", but was later changed to the "LA Salsa Congress" as more cities on the West Coast began hosting congresses. In 2013 the event was renamed the "LA Salsa Fest".

==Salsa congresses in Europe==
By 2013 Salsa congresses and festivals had become an annual tradition in nearly half the major European cities, including London (UK), Berlin (Germany), Warsaw (Poland), Vilnius (Lithuania), Budapest (Hungary), Brasov (Romania), Split (Croatia), Milan (Italy), Riga (Latvia), Munich (Germany), Maribor (Slovenia), Edinburgh (Scotland) and many others.

Many of the most successful and relevant salsa congresses in Europe were started in 2002, such as the UK International Salsa Congress in London, Simposium de la salsa (Madrid), Rome, Hamburg and the Switzerland Salsa Congress at Zurich. One of the first salsa congresses in Germany was 2003 in Regensburg. [http://www.salsa-stuttgart.com/reports/reports2.php?page=44&amp;id=26 Report Regensburg Salsa Congress 2003]

The Croatian Summer Salsa Festival (CSSF) in Rovinj Croatia was founded in 2005, as well as the Tallinn Salsafestival (TSF) in Estonia.
The Vilnius Salsa Festival (VSF) that takes place annually in Lithuania was started in 2007.

There are many other congresses in Europe now available to enjoy, each with its own unique flavour; in the UK for instance is the Teesside Latin Festival (started in 2009) in the north east of England, which is one of the most popular and fastest growing in UK. The congress combines LA salsa, NY Salsa and Cuban Salsa in one festival. It also includes a [[Kizomba]] Festival.

When making a choice of congresses salseros first need to determine what they 'like' or prefer and their budgets. Some congresses cater more towards one style, such as [[Bachata (dance)|Bachata]], Cuban Salsa, LA/NY Salsa and NY on2, others give a taste of all styles and encourage salseros to experience different forms of dancing. As a general rule for beginners, improvers and intermediate dancers an 'all style' congress is the most suitable. More advanced dancers who specialise in a specific style of dancing may want to go to a more focused congress. Some combine a holiday with a congress, staying for a  few extra days for sightseeing or to go to the beach.

'''''Sea of Blood''''' ({{korean|hangul=피바다|mr=P‘ibada|context=north}}) is a [[North Korea]]n opera credited to [[Kim Il-sung]]. It was first produced as an opera by [[Sea of Blood Theatrical Troupe]] (''Pibada Guekdan'') in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = [[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |title = Revolutionary opera "Sea of Blood" 30 years old |url= http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2001/200108/news08/24.htm | accessdate = 2006-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then later adapted into a novel by the [[Choseon Novelist Association]] of the [[4.15 Culture Creation Group]] ({{lang|ko|조선작가 동맹 4·15문학창작단}}) in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = [[Naver Encyclopedia]] |title = Pibada |url= http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=73785&amp;cid=670&amp;categoryId=1395 | accessdate = 2014-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and synopsis==
''Sea of Blood'' is set in the 1930s, during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], and follows the life of protagonist Sun-Nyo and her family as they suffer numerous tragedies at the hands of the Japanese before eventually gaining the willpower and means to join the communist revolution and fight against their oppressors. The story is meant to exemplify the values of the [[Juche|''Juche'' ideology]], with self-reliance and solidarity being the central themes. The novel is notable for its highly detailed descriptions and lengthy narrations of each character's point of view as well as its graphic depiction of violence. It is also mandatory reading in North Korea’s literature curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= [[Naver Encyclopedia]] |title = Pibada |url= http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1692312&amp;cid=264&amp;categoryId=1063 | accessdate = 2014-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with ''[[The Flower Girl]]'' ({{korean|꽃파는 처녀|context=north}}), ''[[Tell O’the Forest!]]'' ({{korean|밀림아 이야기하라|context=north}}), ''[[A True Daughter of the Party]]'' ({{korean|당의 참된 딸|context=north}}) and ''[[The Song of Mount Kumgang]]'' ({{korean|금강산의 노래|context=north}}), ''Sea of Blood'' is considered one of the "Five Great Revolutionary Operas" ([[Korean revolutionary opera]]) ({{korean|5대 혁명가극|혁명가극]]|context=north}}), which are the five most critically acclaimed operas within North Korea with revolutionary themes. The opera is considered as a masterpiece in North Korea since it expresses the unique aspects of the ''Juche'' regime's revolutionary ideology. It is also regarded as an exemplary revolutionary piece because of its unique use of visual and auditory effect and unprecedented theme, which was unlike other existing operas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = [[Naver Encyclopedia]] |title = Pibada |url= http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1821824&amp;cid=1616&amp;categoryId=1616 | accessdate = 2014-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera is known for being North Korea's longest-running production, having been staged over 1,500 times, and is presented three to four times a week at Pyongyang's main theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = John Gorenfeld|title = Dear Playwright|url= http://www.reason.com/contrib/show/307.xml | accessdate = 2006-04-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029183408/http://reason.com/contrib/show/307.xml |archivedate = 2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Korean Opera Troupe, which was established in 1946, was renamed "[[Sea of Blood Opera Troupe]]" shortly after the opera's release in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2002/200206/news06/19.htm|title=Phibada Opera Troupe|publisher=Korean Central News Agency|date=19 June 2002|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sea of Blood'' was also produced as a four-hour black-and-white film, {{cn span|in the early 1970s, which was produced by [[Korea Films]].|date=December 2017}} Kim Jong-il produced the film, directed by [[Choe Ik-gyu]].&lt;ref name="Fischer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Paul|title=A Kim Jong-Il Production:  Kidnap, Torture, Murder...

[[File:HasekuraBookItalian.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Scipione Amati]]'s ''[[History of the Kingdom of Voxu]]'' (1615)  an example of a secondary source.]]
In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;"[http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=327327&amp;p=2195975 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/secondary Secondary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[document]] or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a [[primary source]], which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. 

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. 
 
The most accurate [[#Classification|classification]] for any given source is not always obvious.  ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121|quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Classification==
Information can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called '''symbolic sources'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OX7d7u_2rF4C&amp;pg=PA121|title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=1989-11-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521389211|location=|pages=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a [[midden]], regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kragh|1989|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalton|Charnigo|2004|p=419 n.18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delgadillo|Lynch|1999|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an [[obituary]]&lt;ref name="Duffin"&gt;{{Citation|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name="Duffin" /&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Henige|first=David|authorlink=David Henige|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further "levels". One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.

Some other [[modern language]]s use more than one word for the English word "source". [[German language|German]] usually uses ''Sekundärliteratur'' ("secondary literature") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' ("secondary source") to [[historiography]]. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source which can tell about a lost ''Primärquelle'' ("primary source"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.

==Science, technology, and medicine==
In general, secondary sources are self-described as [[Review journal|review article]]s or [[meta-analysis]].

Primary source materials are typically defined as "original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study." An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in [[IMRAD]] style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrard, Judith |title=Health Sciences Literature Review Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSbfIcjQUcsC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|date= 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010/&gt; A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.

A [[book review]] that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.

===Library and information science===

In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=UMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2/&gt;

=== Maths ===

An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title=Riemann's Zeta Function|year=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|publication-place=Mineola, New York|isbn=0-486-41740-9|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22|quote=The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role.

===Humanities and history===
Secondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source.
The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.  In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Helge (1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In  original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cipolla|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Leopold von Ranke|Rankean model]] established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use [[archive]]s of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick C. Beiser|title=The German Historicist Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ1k6w0dFIMC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Camic|author2=Neil Gross|author3=Michele Lamont|title=Social Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l7iDZY-MSoC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law====
In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the [[headnote]]s of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bouchoux|first=Deborah E.|year=2000|title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form|page=45|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1893-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family history====
"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."&lt;ref&gt;Harland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.

====Autobiographies====
An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, particularly the introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''St. James Court Art Show''', colloquially called the '''St. James Art Fair''', or just '''St. James''', is a popular free public outdoor annual arts and crafts show held since 1957 in the [[Old Louisville]] neighborhood of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in the [[St. James-Belgravia Historic District]]. Mostly situated to the south of [[Central Park, Louisville|Central Park]], the show is normally held on the first weekend in October, and includes more than 700 [[artisan]]s from various locations throughout the Americas. The show draws nearly 300,000 people, one-third from out of state, each year. The show is put together by a group of various neighborhood associations in Old Louisville.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The art and item selection at the show runs from the mundane to the sublime{{cn|date=May 2017}}, and the inexpensive to the very expensive. Booths featuring such items as furniture, pottery, jewelry, glassworks, photography and paintings are lined up on streets and sidewalks with ample walk spaces between them to handle large crowds.{{cn|date=May 2017}} Booths with the highest showcase quality are situated on St. James Court, Belgravia Court and Magnolia Avenue, while booths on Fourth and Third Streets tend to purvey more consumer-oriented artistic items. The 19th century mansion [[Conrad-Caldwell House]], on St. James Court, is open for tours during the show.

In addition to the various items for sale, the show attracts various state and local politicians, charities, churches, [[radio]] stations and [[publisher]]s who take the opportunity to promote themselves to the public.

[[Image:St James art fest booth.jpg|thumb|right|Each booth showcases a unique set of artistic works]]

The event is sponsored by various corporate donors. There are various awards given out for "Best of Show," "People's Choice," the poster contest and several scholarships. The show has been ranked #1 in the nation by Sunshine Artist Magazine.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Being held in the neighborhood Old Louisville has a particular significance because the St James Art show was founded in order to produce revenue and sustain the surrounding area. Old Louisville at the time the St James Art Show was created was in a financial decline; however, today it is known as one of the most popular areas of Louisville. Old Louisville became a historic district in 1975, and also has the United States largest collection of Victorian style homes. This unique atmosphere creates the perfect location for the St James Art Show, as the art show is almost exclusively outdoors, and people enjoy walking around the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.stjamescourtartshow.com/about-us/|website=St James Court Art Show|accessdate=29 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206133751/http://www.stjamescourtartshow.com/about-us/|archivedate=6 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sundance drawing of theater.jpg|thumb|The open-air theater at Sundance]]
[[File:Sundance program cover page - 1965.jpg|thumb|Program cover from 1965]]
The '''Sundance Festival of the Chamber Arts''' was a cultural summer festival that took place for several years during the 1960s in [[Upper Black Eddy]] in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It was the brainchild of the noted [[harpsichord]] builder/entrepreneur [[Wolfgang Zuckermann]].

==History==
[[File:Sundance Wolfgang Zuckermann - ca. 1963.jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Zuckermann, ca. 1963]]
[[File:Sundance photo under construction spring 1963.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The amphitheater under construction]]
[[File:Sundance map upper black eddy.jpg|thumb|Location of [[Upper Black Eddy]]]]
Zuckermann's successful career as a seller of build-it-yourself harpsichord kits had been facilitated by a surge of public interest in music of the Baroque and classical periods. The festival was founded in 1963 by Zuckermann together with his colleague [[Eric Britton]] in response to this surge, as well as to rising interest in chamber music and related art forms.

The two built a charming open-air [[amphitheater]], seating 250 people. The amphitheater was originally designed by Zuckermann himself and redesigned and built in partnership with local contractors. It was located on a 55 acre estate in the rural town of Upper Black Eddy, Northern Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a bit more than one hour from New York City (where Zuckermann ran his business in [[Greenwich Village]]) and rather less from Philadelphia. The rural surroundings added to the appeal of the enterprise, as [[Michael Townsend Smith]] (who succeeded Britton as director in 1966) later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was extremely charming, and we presented a wondrous range of artists over the next three summers. Farther up the drive beyond the theatre, there were two houses, a barn, a tennis court, a big concrete swimming down in the woods, and a screened-in summer house. ... The performers often came for the weekend and enjoyed the facilities.{{Cite quote|date=February 2018}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zuckermann served as Managing Director, Eric Britton as Associate Director (1963-1965, followed by Smith). The festival featured chamber music, other musical artists (including, not surprisingly, various eminent harpsichordists), and some off-the-beaten path offering such as marionette opera.

The festival took place in the months of July and August. There were two performances weekly, Friday and Saturday nights, solely dedicated to chamber music, modern dance, drama, poetry readings, and film. Admission was $2.00 per concert.

The chamber music events were entirely devoted to classical music and featured some of the most appreciated groups of the time (Galimir String Quartet, the Kroll Quartet, the Claremont Quartet, Krainis Baroque Trio), harpsichordists (including Fernando Valenti, Sylvia Marlowe, Pamela Cook, Robert Conant), and distinguished musicians and singers (Helen Boatwright, Sanford Allen, Peter Serkin, Michael Tree, Rey de la Torre, Daniel Weisman, Suzanne Bloch among them).

An edge to the festival was given by less familiar, at times more experiment works, such as the dance presentations of the James Waring Company, Merce Cunningham (and John Cage), and Yvonne Rainer, among them. Sundance also presented off-off Broadway plays, marionette operas, poetry readings Allen Ginsburg and low budget films of what was then called the Independent American Cinema.&lt;br /&gt;

The last performances at Sundance took place in Summer 1968. In 1969, Zuckermann moved to England, selling both his harpsichord business as well as the Sundance property, and the Sundance Festival came to an end.

==Reception==
One enthusiastic patron wrote at the time: "Sundance is the newest and brightest star in the Bucks County firmament. The setting is a charming sylvan one, deep in a wooded area. The comfortable seating is, in true theater fashion so that one has an obstructed view from every point. The stage is handsome having a proscenium on which the names of the geniuses of the past and present are carved in gold on a dark brown with background. But the most interesting aspect before one enters the open air seating area and views the stage is that of the Mexican Indian like stucco wall, which forms the background of the theater, and seems to convey the idea of an abstract painting. And there is peace and beauty here – and excitement."&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is taken from the back cover of [[:File:Sundance program back cover - 1965.jpg|a program]] for one of the Sundance performances.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
From [[Michael Townsend Smith]]:
{{block indent|left=1.5|1=Zuckermann had done three summer seasons at Sundance with an English friend [[Eric Britton]] who had now moved to Paris. Deep in the woods in northern [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], two hours west of New York, they had built a small covered stage and a wide amphitheatre for the audience that was open to the stars. It was extremely charming, and we presented a wondrous range of artists over the next three summers. Farther up the drive beyond the theatre, there were two houses, a barn, a tennis court, a big concrete swimming down in the woods, and a screened-in summer house. Wolfgang and I got to be good friends, playing chamber music together in the city and tennis at Sundance. The performers often came for the weekend and enjoyed the facilities. For our third season the great Catalan harpsichord [[Fernando Valenti]] was in residence, and Wolfgang fixed up the horse stalls as practice rooms for his students. But the following year, appalled by America's political power, Wolfgang sold Sundance and moved abroad. He presently owns and operates Librairie Shakespeare, a bookshop in Avignon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaeltownsendsmith.com/sundance|title=Michael Townsend Smith: Sundance|website=Michaeltownsendsmith.com|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From [[Eric Britton]], Paris:
{{block indent|left=1.5|1=Years later (February 2018) I have come to regret that Wolfgang and I designed Sundance and the program in light of our own particular tastes and preferences (one might say a bit elitist). In retrospect I rather wish that we had spread our wings a bit and welcomed other less erudite performing arts forms to help us engage a wider audience and permanence.
&lt;p&gt;
Despite our extending the focus from our original point of departure (chamber music and that's it!) to house and welcome performances of modern dance, Off-Broadway plays and what we then called The New American Cinema (low cost experimental and student productions), I have come to think in retrospect that we should have stretched further: different shades of jazz, audience singing, and poetry slams. Perhaps the next time around?{{Cite quote|date=February 2018}}}}

'''Super Bowl Sunday''' is the day on which the [[Super Bowl]], the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s annual championship game, is played. It is usually observed on the first Sunday in February and is sometimes referred to as an unofficial national holiday. The 52nd annual event, [[Super Bowl LII]], occurred on February 4, 2018.  Festivities for Super Sunday typically involve groups of people gathering to watch the game. Both "Super Sunday" and "Super Bowl Sunday" are registered [[trademark]]s of the National Football League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipbrief.net/2014/01/27/the-super-trademark-bowl/ The Super – Trademark – Bowl]. [[American University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivities==
Although not an [[Public holidays in the United States|official holiday]], Super Sunday is an occasion when many families and friends gather together to watch the game, including those who are not normally football fans.&lt;ref name=tftu&gt;{{cite news|last=Stellino|first=Vito|title=Super Sunday feels like a holiday|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-02-06/story/super_bowl_sunday_feels_like_a_holiday|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=The Florida Times Union|date=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gay|first=Jason|title=Should the Super Bowl Be a Holiday?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-the-super-bowl-be-a-holiday-1454612826?tesla=y|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[sports bar]]s have historically been busy on Super Sunday in the past, it is becoming more common for people to watch the game from home. This is due in part to the increasing size of home televisions in the United States as well as the attempts of budget conscious consumers to save money.&lt;ref name=twsj02&gt;{{cite news|last=Jargon|first=Julie|title=Sports Bars Play Super Bowl Defense|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704680604576110050697188540|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsj01&gt;{{cite news|last=Halls|first=Sarah|title=Where to Watch the Super Bowl in Europe|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704709304576124013128512114|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because watching the Super Bowl is so popular, stores are often empty during the game, particularly in the regions represented by the two teams playing in the Super Bowl,&lt;ref name=tn&gt;{{cite news|last=Bollier|first=Jeff|title=Oshkosh shuts down for Packers, Super Bowl|url=http://www.thenorthwestern.com/article/20110206/OSH0101/102060328/Oshkosh-shuts-down-for-Super-Bowl|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=The Northwestern|date=February 6, 2011|location=Oshkosh, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and water usage drops, with significant rises in use during halftime and after the game, as fans use the bathroom.&lt;ref name="calder20120209"&gt;{{cite news|last=Calder|first=Rich|title=Toilet Bowl XLVI|url=https://nypost.com/2012/02/09/toilet-bowl-xlvi/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, churches sometimes cancel afternoon or evening services on Super Sunday, hold football-themed charity drives, or deliver sermons designed to appeal to male members of the congregation.&lt;ref name=tva&gt;{{cite news|title=Some churches cancel Super Sunday services|url=http://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2011/feb/03/bc-wi-super-bowl-sunday-services/?sports&amp;nfl|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=February 3, 2011|agency=Associated Press|location=Victoria, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dp&gt;{{cite news|last=Draper|first=Electa|title=Some preachers use Super Bowl to put focus on harm of pornography|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_17299496|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=Dever Post|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hs&gt;{{cite news|last=Kloosterman|first=Stephen|title=Churches see Super Bowl as a time to connect with worshippers|url=http://www.hollandsentinel.com/newsnow/x549731920/Churches-see-Super-Bowl-as-a-time-to-connect-with-worshippers|accessdate=February 6, 2011|newspaper=Holland Sentinel|date=February 6, 2011|location=Holland, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL executives have called for a three-day weekend in order to allow fans to celebrate the event, and there is thought to be a loss of [[productivity]] in the American work force on Monday after the event.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riccobono|first=Anthony|title=Should The Monday After The Super Bowl Be A National Holiday?|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/should-monday-after-super-bowl-be-national-holiday-1798312|website=[[International Business Times]]|date=February 1, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television network carrying the game (either [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], [[Fox NFL|Fox]], or [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]) will usually devote the entire day's programming schedule to the game, with extended pregame shows, [[NFL Films]] retrospectives of the previous season, and special versions of the [[Sunday morning talk show]]s in the morning and afternoon hours leading into the game. Competing networks, due to the severe loss of viewers to the Super Bowl festivities, generally resort to low-cost [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|counterprogramming]] measures like the ''[[Puppy Bowl]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|title=Just Fine as Tackles, but They Can’t Pass|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/arts/television/02bark.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 2008|accessdate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Tech tabloid''' is a type of news media that mainly concentrates on technology news: science, IT, semiconductors, telecoms and related issues, but also takes on a less formal and more humorous approach than traditional technology publications such as [[EE Times]] or [[EDN (magazine)|EDN]]. They are  professional in nature, though, rather than community-based technology news sites such as [[Digg]] or [[Slashdot]].

==Tabloid nature==

[[Tabloid journalism|Tabloid]] newspapers traditionally aim for sensationalist stories, celebrity news and aim for a down-market reader. The tabloid tag does not apply to the paper format, as many of these publications are web-based only, such as [[The Inquirer]] and [[The Register]].

The sarcastic, iconoclastic and skeptic tones of these publications is often more akin to publication such as [[Private Eye]], which would not usually be labelled a tabloid, than to the [[Page Three]] tabloid such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]''.

The Inquirer even, in its 20000th article, refers to itself as "redtop tabloid rags like the INQUIRER",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=20000 The Inquirer's 20000th article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830181356/http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=20000 |date=30 August 2006 }} (cited 20 December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; later in the same article calling itself "cheesy": determining the irony of this is left as an exercise to the reader. Both the Register and the Inquirer do generally have red banners at the top of their home pages.

'''''The Case for Impeachment''''' is a non-fiction book by [[American University]] Distinguished Professor of History [[Allan Lichtman]] arguing for the [[Efforts to impeach Donald Trump|impeachment of Donald Trump]]. It was published on April 18, 2017 by [[Dey Street Books]], an imprint of [[HarperCollins]]. Lichtman predicted to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that after ascending to the presidency, Trump would later be impeached from office. He developed this thesis into a set of multiple arguments for Trump's predicted impeachment.&lt;ref name="Trump headed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;

Lichtman argues in the book that Trump could face impeachment for reasons including: complicity of conspiracy with foreign governments, [[crimes against humanity]] for the U.S. neglecting [[global warming]], and violation of the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]] of the constitution barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. He provides the reader with an overview of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] and [[links between Trump associates and Russian officials]], asserting such ties could be used in [[efforts to impeach Donald Trump|efforts to impeach President Trump]]. He uses the [[Watergate scandal]] as the backdrop to compare Trump's reactions to criticism with those of [[Richard Nixon]] during [[Impeachment of Richard Nixon|Nixon's impeachment process]]. The author discusses [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|assertions of sexual misconduct against Trump]], and delves into some of the [[legal affairs of Donald Trump|his legal affairs]] stemming from them. Lichtman places the [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording]]s within a larger context of public degradation of women.&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave ''The Case for Impeachment'' a positive review, writing: "Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations."&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "striking to see the full argument unfold".&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; ''New York Journal of Books'' recommended it as a resource, "if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought".&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt; ''[[CounterPunch]]'' characterized the work as "a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act".&lt;ref name=larson /&gt; ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' gave the author praise, writing: "Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year."&lt;ref name=budowsky /&gt; [[CBC News]] consulted law scholars who said Lichtman's impeachment prediction was unlikely, especially with a Republican-controlled [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=cbcnews /&gt;

==Contents summary==
{{see|Efforts to impeach Donald Trump}}

''The Case for Impeachment'' sets forth multiple arguments why President Trump's actions warrant impeachment from office. The author organizes the book into subsets of different grounds for impeachment. These include complicity or conspiracy with foreign governments.  Lichtman explains to the reader the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]] of the constitution, barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. The author contends impeachment could be brought for actions by the president intended to benefit himself financially based on [[insider trading|inside information]] about economic dealings. Lichtman observes the president has not garnered knowledge from a study of earlier key events in U.S. politics: "A president who seems to have learned nothing from history is abusing and violating the public trust and setting the stage for a myriad of impeachable offenses."&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt;

Lichtman compares and contrasts Trump's actions with the [[Impeachment of Richard Nixon]] stemming from the [[Watergate scandal]]. Discussion of prior impeachment proceedings for presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Bill Clinton]] are placed within historical context, and the book makes comparisons between Trump and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name=tomwarren&gt; {{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=els1k6qifGU|first=Tom|last=Warren|work=[[Politics and Prose]]|title=Allan J Lichtman, 'The Case For Impeachment'|date=May 10, 2017|type=video}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author writes that Trump's decisions threaten American values: "Even early in his presidency, Donald Trump exhibits the same tendencies that led Nixon to violate the most basic standards of morality and threaten the foundations of our democracy."&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; Lichtman argues that Trump's failure to learn from Nixon's negative example will harm his presidency, noting: "They also shared a compulsion to deflect blame, and they were riddled with insecurities." He criticizes what he documents as Trump's disregard for veracity: "Neither man allowed the law, the truth, the free press, or the potential for collateral damage to others to impede their personal agendas."&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; Lichtman feels Trump and Nixon's potential political success can be viewed as stifled by a perceived need for covert decision making devoid of critical viewpoints: "They obsessed over secrecy and thirsted for control without dissent."&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt;

The author provides an overview of actions taken by Trump before his presidency that could also lead to his downfall, including possible violations of the [[Fair Housing Act]], the operations of [[Trump University]], and donations or lack thereof related to the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation]]. With regard to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, the author outlines for the reader the basis for impeachment with discussion of Trump and Trump family debt, trademark negotiations with China, and financial transactions in the Philippines, arguing these obligations could allow foreign powers control over the Trump Administration.&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; In a proposal that the author acknowledges is unlikely, he submits the [[International Criminal Court]] could potentially prosecute the president for [[crimes against humanity]] related to reneging on agreements to combat [[climate change]]. Legally this would not have significant standing on its own for impeachment in the U.S. however, the author suggests that it could provide the moral impetus for legislators to take further actions instead.&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt;

''The Case for Impeachment'' devotes a chapter to [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|assertions of sexual misconduct made by women against Trump]], and details some of [[legal affairs of Donald Trump|Trump's legal affairs]] stemming from them. Lichtman describes Trump as driven by lust, and places the [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording]] within a larger context of public degradation of women. Events contained in the discussion of this topic are later contrasted with the fact that despite such details, Trump garnered a majority of white female voters' support compared to his opponent [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt;

Lichtman takes the reader through [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, and writes that President Trump: "stands a chance of becoming the first American president charged with treason or the failure to report treason by agents and associates".&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; He likens the multiple investigations by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[House Intelligence Committee]], and the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] into Russian interference in the  2016 U.S. election, and Trump associates' links a "[[Sword of Damocles]]" awaiting Trump. The author concludes these investigations could have disastrous impact for the president: "Neither Republicans nor Democrats in Congress will tolerate a compromised or treacherous president. Impeachment and trial will be quick and decisive."&lt;ref name=thankyou /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;&lt;ref name=smilke /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' magazine, Lichtman explained his thought process for predicting a Trump impeachment: "it is based on a deep study of history, including Trump's parallels to his impeached predecessors; a study of the process of impeachment; a study of Trump's vulnerabilities".&lt;ref name=willis /&gt; He explained why he chose to write the book at this particular point, emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and "because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be because the American people demand it."&lt;ref name=willis /&gt; Lichtman said because there were many potential unlawful activities, "I believe he is more vulnerable than any early president in the history of the nation."&lt;ref name=willis /&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' journalist Carlos Lozada wrote in a review that on reading the book, it was "striking to see the full argument unfold and realize that you don't have to be a zealot to imagine some version of it happening".&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; He concluded: "Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place.

'''''The Danton Case''''' is a 1929 historical [[Play (theatre)|play]] by the Polish writer [[Stanisława Przybyszewska]]. The work portrays the conflict between the rival revolutionaries [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Georges Danton]] during the [[French Revolution]], particularly in the period leading up to Danton's execution. Przybyszewska wrote the play between March 1928 and March 1929, after many years of studying the French Revolution.

==Adaptations==
The 1932 French film ''[[Danton (1932 film)|Danton]]'' and the 1983 Polish-French film ''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]'' both drew inspiration from the play.

[[File:Undie500Noah.jpg|thumb|2006 Undie 500 entry "Noah's Ark", winner best overall]]

The '''Undie 500''', originally named the '''Under 500''', was an annual student-run [[car rally]] between [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]], New Zealand with multiple stops at drinking establishments along the way. The name comes from the original rule that a vehicle is purchased for less than [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500, and optionally decorated.

The event has run since the early 1980s and is organised by the [[University of Canterbury Engineering Society Inc. (ENSOC)]]. The premise of the event is for student members of ENSOC to purchase and decorate a vehicle before rallying the cars to [[Dunedin]].  The vehicles are individually themed and occupants [[pub crawl]] over the entire day of driving. This event is characterised by the high level of work performed on the entrants' cars; transforming them from normal motor vehicles into something unique.

The event was originally to coincide with the weekend of the annual Canterbury University Engineers v Otago Surveyors rugby match. At this time and well into the 1990s it was known as the "Under 500". Somewhere along the way it has been transformed into the "Undie 500", presumably to establish a similar-sounding name to the more famous [[Indy 500]].

Since 2003, the number of vehicles was limited to 150. The event used to attract more than 1,000 participants and thousands of spectators. The event was widely reported, attracting national TV news coverage, newspaper, radio and has even featured in ''[[Ralph (magazine)|Ralph]]'' magazine. The [[New Zealand Police]] accompany the convoy throughout the trip to ensure both the safety of participants and other road users.

Since 2006, when others driving cars not associated with the event began traveling to Dunedin concurrently and rioting,&lt;ref name="ODT_73741"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/73741/tradition-cars-rip-roaring-good-time |title=Tradition, cars, the rip-roaring good time |author=Porteous, Debbie |date=12 September 2009 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event has also received much negative publicity due to rioting students and others associated with the event. Some have been charged with offenses including offensive language and breaching the liquor ban the Dunedin City Council had placed.&lt;ref name="rocky"/&gt;

After the 2009 event, the head of the [[University of Canterbury Students' Association]] (UCSA) noted that they could not "exert authority on those hangers-on or those other students and young people that head to Dunedin to use this as an excuse for violence or anti-social behaviour.", and that it was no longer in the interest of students to be associated with those who were causing trouble after the event.&lt;ref name="ODT_74432"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/74432/undie-over-dunedin |title=Undie over for Dunedin |date=17 September 2009 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the 2009 head of the UCSA predicted ENSOC could not run a further event to Dunedin in light of the trouble that would be caused by those non-students who would use it as an excuse for violence and other anti-social behaviour, but appeared not to rule out a similar event heading to a different destination.

Many in Dunedin see the event as having been sensationalised by the media, with one local noting the "local newspaper will start printing stories a week in advance, and will continue for a week after the event, even if it runs smoothly."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10610537"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10610537 |title=The Job Tour: Media blamed for Dunedin students' reputation |author1=Andrew Hughes  |author2=Olivia Wix  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=20 November 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Cars were expected to meet the following requirements:
* Have a current [[Warrant of Fitness]] and [[Vehicle registration]]
* Be driven by a [[sobriety|sober]] driver

In previous years it was also a requirement to have a vehicle under the price of $500, hence the name UNDIE 500.  However, due to rising prices and stricter regulations this rule was later overlooked.

==Prizes==
Before embarking for Dunedin, cash prizes were awarded for outstanding entries including:
* Best Car
* Best Dressed Team
* Best Mechanical Car
* Best Structural Car
* Best Engineered Car
* Most [[Politically Incorrect]] Car
* Best Overall

==Disorder==

===1994===
The winner of best dressed vehicle in 1994 was a 1964 HD Holden Special station wagon cleverly transformed into Thomas The Tank Engine. It featured in an article on the Under 500 in The Timaru Herald newspaper. That year there was a bad snow storm on The Kilmog hill, just north of Dunedin. The local police stopped many of the cars on their way up the hill due to the icy conditions. This vehicle was allowed through as it was explained to the officer, "This is a train, not a car".

===2006===
The 2006 event was marred by drunken rioting in the Castle St area of [[Dunedin]]; resulting in 30 arrests and a [[liquor ban]] subsequently imposed on the main student area over the events weekend.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10397227"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10397227 |title=Dunedin police face drunken, rioting students |date=21 August 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident ENSOC worked with the various local authorities in [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]], [[Timaru]], [[Oamaru]] and [[Dunedin]] to minimise any possible disruption caused to local residents, including paying the [[Dunedin City Council]] to tow away any abandoned vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED0708/S00066.htm Scoop: ENSOC Undie 500&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
[[File:Undie 500 fire, Grange St, Dunedin, NZ.jpg|thumb|right|Two members of the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] dousing an Undie 500 fire on Grange Street in 2007]]
In 2007 the event saw further drunken rioting in which 69 people were arrested, on a night which one student involved described it as "a usual Dunedin Saturday night", while Dunedin emergency service workers said it was the city's worst trouble for many years.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_1323121"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/1323121 |title=Undie 500 could be banned |date=27 August 2007 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowd estimates were 1,000 – 2,000 at the height of the riots. Couches, a mattress and at least two Undie 500 cars were torched on Castle, Dundas, Hyde, Grange, and Leith streets, and police and fire-fighters were pelted with bottles. 9 of the 24 University of Canterbury students arrested were officially registered on the Undie 500, along with 30 Dunedin students and 15 non-students.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Subsequently, there have been calls for an end to the event, with the [[Mayor of Dunedin]] [[Peter Chin]] calling the event 'history'.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/33517 |title=Undie 500 'history' – Mayor |date=27 August 2007 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the rioting, police upgraded charges from disorderly behaviour to the more serious crime of [[rioting]] for 21 of the 69 arrested people, which could have resulted in up to 2 years in prison.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10460661"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=30&amp;objectid=10460661 |title=Charges upgraded after Undie 500 riots |date=30 August 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These charges were later dropped by the police, with ten offenders pleading guilty and six pleading not guilty to lesser offences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police drop Undie 500 rioting charges|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10480023|date=3 December 2007|work=NZ Herald|accessdate=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in at least one conviction for fifteen people.&lt;ref name=ODT_500_please&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/18129/undie-500-convictions-please-police|title=Undie 500 convictions please police|author1=Porteous, Debbie  |author2=Reid, Marian |lastauthoramp=yes |date=16 August 2008|work=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[University of Otago]] students involved in the rioting also risked being expelled from the university.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_1324056"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/1324056 |title=Rampaging students face boot from uni |date=27 August 2007 |publisher=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31 people were charged at the Dunedin District Court, 22 being convicted (9 on two charges), and 5 receiving diversion. One charge of disorderly likely to cause violence was upheld on appeal to the High Court. The people convicted were forced to pay fines, reparations, donations and court costs exceeding $16,500 (up to $2,000 for some individuals), and received 250 hours community service, in addition to lawyers fees estimated at up to $1,000 to $5,000 each.&lt;ref name=ODT_500_please/&gt;

===2008===
Chin later said he expected the event would go ahead for 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016161106/http://www.aus.ac.nz/Publications/tertiaryupdate/2008/No%203.asp#6 AUS – The Association of University Staff of New Zealand&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though he soon pulled out of meetings with ENSOC and emergency services.&lt;ref name="underground"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/286176 |title='Underground' Undie 500? |date=25 February 2008 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENSOC had submitted a management plan with bonds and behavioural guarantees for participants,&lt;ref name=underground/&gt; and had planned for a concert for the Saturday night after the official event, which has been the scene of the rioting in recent years. Meetings had been held with concert promoters with the aim of organizing a large event with a budget of over $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canta (magazine)|Canta]]'', Issue 3, 12 March 2008, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Without approval, ENSOC are refusing to condone the 'underground' Undie 500 that they expect to occur.&lt;ref name=underground/&gt;

In 2008 the official event was cancelled, but around 100 students from the University of Canterbury travelled to Dunedin in about 40 cars and vans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4662004a24035.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912094613/http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4662004a24035.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 September 2012|title=Rerun for rally that led to riot|author1=Hartevelt, John  |author2=Suisted, Narelle |lastauthoramp=yes |date=20 August 2008|publisher=The Press|accessdate=30 August 2008}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_Around30"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10528717|title=Around 30 students arrested after riot police move in|date=24 August 2008|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 police were rostered on for the event, and had placed checkpoints on the outskirts of Rolleston and the entrance to Dunedin city. The media once again reported the event sparked violence, with police in full riot gear three times charging a group of around 500 students throwing rocks and bottles, before dispersing the crowd in the early hours of 24 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/19219/rogue-undie-descends-mayhem|title=Rogue Undie descends into mayhem|last=Porteous|first=Debbie|date=24 August 2008|work=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While police Inspector Dave Campbell noted that the event was not a catalyst for the trouble, with most of those arrested from Otago University or non-students, he also said that to those persons "It's quite clear that it [the Undie 500] is seen as a magnet."&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_595411"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/595411 |title=Otago students to blame for Undie mayhem – police |date=24 August 2008 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 arrests were made, in addition to 3 University of Canterbury and 2 University of Otago students from the previous night.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_Around30"/&gt;

===2009===
[[Image:Undie500-Man-Arrested-2009.jpg|thumb|right|A man is arrested during riots after the 2009 Undie 500]]
An official ENSOC charity event ran in 2009, after Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin refused to negotiate with the University of Canterbury Students Association and ENSOC to organise events after the main Undie rally to minimise disorder afterwards. About 600 students from Canterbury participated,&lt;ref name="3_News_120735"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Undie-500-kicks-off-under-watchful-eye-of-police-/tabid/368/articleID/120735/cat/64/Default.aspx |title=Undie 500 kicks off, under watchful eye of police  – Video |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing more than 1000 cans of food for Dunedin food banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/on-campus/university-otago/73905/undie-500-delivers-foodbanks|title=Undie 500 delivers for foodbanks|last=Fox|first=Rebecca |date=14 September 2009|work=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Undie Charity Drive" has been criticised by Chin as "no matter how it is dressed up it is just a pub crawl." While the rally featured decorated cars, costumes and alcohol, new measures such as a good behaviour bond were introduced to address previous concerns. These measures, could, however, only be used to control behaviour by Canterbury University students, not Otago University students or the unemployed.

The harshest penalty imposed has been on a 41-year-old unemployed Dunedin man for breaching the City Council liquor ban.

===2010===
In the year 2010 the Undie 500 Charity Drive was denied a liquor licence for an event that included a concert in Seddon. This was a blow to the event as it eventually led to the charity drive being cancelled in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ensoc.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ENSOC-EMAIL-18.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee ended up spending funds set asides on helping relief efforts for the Canterbury earthquake.

===2011===
After several meetings between event organisers [[ENSOC]], the Dunedin police, Christchurch and the Dunedin city council the event was organised as a pub crawl that left from the university and returned to Christchurch. The event was kept off Facebook and the ENSOC website in an effort to keep it out of the media's attention, removing the negative publicity that is normally associated with the event.

The event consisted of leaving from the university arts car park, as in previous years, then heading out to the first pub in Yarldhurst. Both the participants and police were well behaved. Following that the event continued further out on to the Canterbury plains, finally ending back at a pub in Templeton, just out of Christchurch.

===2017===
The name Undie 500 was revitalised in 2017 by former University of Otago student [[Ryan Hellyer]], who created the new annual Undie 500 event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://undiecar.com/event/undie-500/ | title=Undie 500 2017 | date=December 2017 | deadurl=no}} &lt;/ref&gt; as a special event for the [[Undiecar Championship]], a sim racing series run on the iRacing platform. The most recent event in 2018 attracted 33 competitors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://undiecar.com/event/undie-500-2/ | title=Undie 500 2018 | date=October 2018 | deadurl=no}} &lt;/ref&gt;.

The United States provides a wide range of benefits for veterans with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which was incurred in, or aggravated by, their military service. The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) will provide benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and Survivors, 2017 Edition|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to veterans that the VA has determined suffer from PTSD, which developed during, or as a result of, their military service. These benefits not only include tax-free cash payments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VA Compensation Rate Table|url=https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/resources_comp01.asp|work=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=24 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but can also include free or low-cost mental health treatment and other healthcare;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access VA Health Benefits|url=http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/access/|work=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  vocational rehabilitation services;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VA Vocational Rehabilitation|url=http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/vre/|work=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; employment assistance;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/|title=Careers and Employment|website=VA.gov|language=en|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/education-and-career-counseling/|title=Educational and Career Counseling (Chapter 36)|website=VA.gov|language=en|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; independent living support;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Living Support for Veterans|url=https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/independent_living.asp|work=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Benefits|url=http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/|publisher=Veterans Benefits Administration|access-date=30 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126185724/http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/|archive-date=26 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VA disability benefits for PTSD have evolved over time, in response to [[legislation]], scientific advances, political pressure, revised [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] classification schemes, regulatory changes, [[case law]], and administrative decisions. Veterans advocacy organizations, researchers, clinicians, politicians, administrators, and citizens will no doubt continue to influence how the United States evaluates, adjudicates, and administers the program. For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on [[vocational rehabilitation]] and treatment versus cash payments; revising the [[#General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders|General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders]] to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; and considering a veteran's [[quality of life]] as a factor in determining the [[#The Disability Rating|disability rating]].

===History===
[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|Revolutionary War Soldiers]]
Since the founding of the country, the United States has sought to compensate the men and women who have served in its [[armed forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ridgway|first=J.|title=The splendid isolation revisited: Lessons from the history of veterans benefits before judicial review|journal=Veterans Law Review|year=2011|volume=3|pages=135–219|ssrn=1598344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the [[Us Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed legislation emphasizing an [[indemnity]] model for veterans disability benefits. Congress sought to clarify and better specify provisions of the law in 1919 amendments to the original bill.&lt;ref name="ESI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Economic Systems Inc|title=VA disability compensation program: Legislative history|year=2004|publisher=VA Office of Policy, Planning and, Preparedness|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that year, compensation has been provided to veterans suffering from physical or mental disabilities that were incurred during, or aggravated by, military service, and which have adversely impacted the veteran's ability to work. The amount of compensation provided—both cash payments and VA-sponsored services—are based on the veteran's ''average impairment in earnings capacity.''&lt;ref&gt;An Act To amend and modify the War Risk Insurance Act, ch. 16, 41 Stat. 371, 373 (1919) ("A schedule of ratings of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combinations of injuries of a permanent nature shall be adopted and applied by the bureau. Ratings may be as high as 100 per annum. The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations and not upon the impairment in earning capacity in each individual case ...").&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Operation Enduring Freedom|OIF/OEF]], PTSD has grown to be the third most compensated disability in the VA after [[hearing loss]] and [[tinnitus]].

===Effectiveness===
Whether disability benefits adequately compensate veterans with PTSD for loss in average earning capacity has been debated.  Older veterans age 65 and up rated at 50% disabled or higher for PTSD, including individual unemployability (IU) benefits,&lt;ref name="IU" /&gt; receive more in compensation (plus any earned income and retirement benefits such as Social Security or pensions) than nondisabled veterans earn in the workforce and/or receive in Social Security and other retirement benefits.&lt;ref name=CNA&gt;{{cite book|title=Final Report for the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission: Compensation, Survey Results, and Selected Topics|date=August 2007|publisher=The CNA Corporation|page=4|url=https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/D0016570.A4.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, younger veterans (age 55 and below) generally receive less in compensation benefits (plus any earned income) than their non-disabled counterparts earn via employment. For example, the ''parity ratio''{{efn|The CNA report cited herein describes the ''parity ratio'' as: "A ratio of exactly 1 would be perfect parity, indicating that the earnings of disabled veterans, plus their VA compensation, gives them the same lifetime earnings as their peers. A ratio of less than one would mean that the service-disabled veterans receive less than their peers on average, while a ratio of greater than one would mean that they receive more than their peers."}} for a 25-year-old veteran rated 100% disabled by PTSD is 0.75, and for a 35-year-old veteran rated 100% disabled by PTSD the ratio is 0.69. The parity ratio for a 75-year-old veteran receiving IU benefits is 6.81.&lt;ref name=CNA /&gt;

Research indicates that veterans receiving disability benefits for PTSD experience a reduction in PTSD symptom severity, and have lower rates of poverty and homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murdoch|first1=Maureen|title=Long-term outcomes of disability benefits in US veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=1 October 2011|volume=68|issue=10|pages=1072–80|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.105|pmid=21969464|url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1107426|accessdate=13 August 2014|quote=Regardless of claim outcome, veterans who apply for PTSD disability benefits are highly impaired. However, receiving PTSD benefits was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and less poverty and homelessness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lost income, a Congressionally-mandated commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott (USA, Ret.)|first1=LTG James Terry|title=Findings Of The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg39461/html/CHRG-110hhrg39461.htm|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=20 June 2015|location=Testimony before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives|date=10 October 2007|quote=We believe that the level of compensation should be based on the severity of the disability and should make up for the average impairments of earnings capacity and the impact of the disability on functionality and quality of life.&amp;nbsp;... Current compensation payments do not provide a payment above that required to offset earnings loss. Therefore, there is no current compensation for the impact of disability on the quality of life for most veterans. While permanent quality of life measures are developed, studied, and implemented, we recommend that compensation payments be increased up to 25 percent with priority to the more seriously disabled.}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the VA disability benefits program should compensate veterans for non-economic losses, particularly with regard to a veteran's overall quality of life. The U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] analyzed this recommendation and suggested that it be considered as one of three major changes to modernize the VA disability benefits program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=VA disability compensation: Actions needed to address hurdles facing program modernization (GAO-12-846)|issue=GAO-12-846|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-846|publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=10 September 2012|quote=Three key approaches for modernizing VA's disability programs recommended by disability commissions and others—providing quality of life payments, providing integrated vocational services with transitional cash assistance, and systematically factoring the effects of assistive technology and medical interventions into rating decisions—hold opportunity and challenges. Experts and veteran groups GAO interviewed believe each approach holds at least some opportunity for serving veterans more fairly, equitably, and effectively.|last1=Office|first1=U. S. Government Accountability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that the VA disability benefits program is "countertherapeutic" because it provides no incentives to overcome symptoms and problems caused by the disorder, and, in fact rewards veterans for staying sick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mossman|first1=D.|title=At the VA, it pays to be sick|journal=The Public Interest|date=1994|volume=114|pages=35–47|quote=Sadly, a program with good intentions has yielded a series of perverse incentives that reward illness, encourage patients to view themselves as incapacitated, and poison the relationships between patients and their caregivers.|url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/at-the-va-it-pays-to-be-sick|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frueh|first1=B.

At home on disability, he risks adopting a "sick role" that ends up depriving him of the estimable therapeutic value of work. Lost are the sense of purpose work gives (or at least the distraction from depressive rumination it provides), the daily structure it affords, and the opportunity for socializing and cultivating friendships. The longer he is unemployed, the more his confidence in his ability and motivation to work erodes and his skills atrophy. Once a patient is caught in such a downward spiral of invalidism, it can be hard to throttle back out. What's more, compensation contingent upon being sick often creates a perverse incentive to remain sick. For example, even if a veteran wants very much to work, he understandably fears losing his financial safety net if he leaves the disability rolls to take a job that ends up proving too much for him.

==VA disability claims process==

To begin the disability claim process, veterans submit a claim to the [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] (VBA), an organizational element of the VA. In order for a veteran to receive disability benefits for PTSD, the VBA, based on their review of medical and psychological evidence, must conclude that the veteran indeed suffers from [[Veterans benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder in the United States#Service-connection|service-connected]] PTSD. Reaching such a determination usually requires that the veteran receive a Compensation and Pension examination ([[#The PTSD C&amp;P Exam|C&amp;P exam]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The PTSD Compensation and Pension Examination|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11870&amp;page=85|work=Institute of Medicine|publisher=National Academies Press|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a forensic{{efn|Note that the term ''forensic'' in this context simply means ''legally-related'' and does not necessarily have anything to do with criminal law or law enforcement. The veterans disability benefits claims process for PTSD is ultimately a legal proceeding, which is why PTSD C&amp;P examinations are categorized as ''psycholegal'', ''medicolegal'' (an even more precise term is [[medical jurisprudence]]), or, most commonly, ''forensic'' mental health evaluations.}} mental health evaluation&lt;ref name=Worthen_Moering_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worthen|first=Mark|author2=Moering, Robert |title=A practical guide to conducting VA compensation and pension exams for PTSD and other mental disorders|journal=Psychological Injury and Law|date=December 2011|volume=4|issue=3–4|pages=187–216|doi=10.1007/s12207-011-9115-2|url=http://www.cavcbar.net/confpdf/A%20Practical%20Guide%20to%20Conducting%20CP%20Exams%20(Worthen%20Moering).pdf|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by a psychologist or psychiatrist at a local VA medical facility or by a psychologist or psychiatrist in independent practice who conducts evaluations for a VA-contracted private vendor.

=== Benefits claim procedures ===

The VA provides a detailed description of the benefits claims process on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claims Process – Compensation|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/process.asp|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, a VSR (Veterans Service Representative),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Service Representative|url=http://mycareeratva.va.gov/Careerpath/Pages/Job.aspx?job=05_099605|work=MyCareer@VA|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an employee of the [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] (VBA), reviews the information submitted by a veteran to determine if VBA needs any additional evidence (e.g., medical records) to [[Adjudication|adjudicate]] the claim.

VA has a legal obligation to help veterans obtain any evidence that will support their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ475/pdf/PLAW-106publ475.pdf|work=Public Law 106-475. Nov. 9, 2000|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the VSR might request a veteran's military personnel records, Social Security disability records, or private medical records. The VSR will almost always request a Compensation and Pension examination (C&amp;P exam),&lt;ref&gt;''The VA Medical Examination And Disability Rating Process: Hearing before the Subcomm. Disability Assistance &amp; Memorial Aff. of the H. Comm. Veterans Aff.'', 110th Congress 63-65 (2008) ([https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg41370/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg41370.pdf statement of Michael McGeary], Senior Program Officer &amp; Study Dir., Comm. Med. Evaluation Veterans Disability Benefits, Bd. Mil. &amp; Veterans Health, Inst. of Med., Nat'l Acad.) ("Applicants for disability compensation are asked to provide their medical records and, under the duty-to-assist law, VBA helps them obtain those records, especially their service medical records. In nearly every case, VBA has applicants undergo a compensation and pension, or C&amp;P, examination performed by a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) or contractor clinician.")&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as a ''VA claim exam''.&lt;ref name="ClaimExam" /&gt;

After VBA obtains all relevant documentation (evidence), an RVSR (Ratings Veterans Service Representative)&lt;ref name="RSVR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratings Veterans Service Representative|url=http://mycareeratva.va.gov/Careerpath/Pages/Job.aspx?job=05_099604|work=MyCareer@VA|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; renders a decision regarding the veteran's claim.  To speed up the decision process, it is advised that the claimant secure they own medical information from the facilities that they visited and provide them to the VA. If the VA has to request them it could hold up the process for 90 days. The RVSR refers in part to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule of ratings – mental disorders|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/warms/docs/regs/38CFR/BOOKC/PART4/S4_130.doc|work=38 C.F.R. §4.130|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=28 December 2013|format=DOC|at=Note: The ''General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders'' appears immediately under ''9440 Chronic adjustment disorder'' on the third page. This placement is misleading because it appears as if the ''Rating Formula'' applies to Chronic Adjustment Disorder only, which is not the case. The ''Rating Formula'' applies to ''all'' mental disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; when making this determination.

===Obtaining assistance===
Veterans may receive assistance with filing a VA disability compensation claim from Veterans Service Officers, also known as "VSO Representatives" or "Veterans Service Representatives".{{efn|Not to be confused with [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] staff whose job title is ''Veterans Service Representative'' (VSR).}} The veteran does not have to pay a Veterans Service Officer for their services. The VA recommends consulting with a Veterans Service Officer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
VA encourages individuals who are applying for disability compensation to work with an accredited representative&amp;nbsp;... to assist them&amp;nbsp;... Being accredited means organizations and individuals must have VA permission to represent Veterans before the Department in their claims for VA benefits. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that Veterans have qualified and competent representation. These individuals receive specialized training in VA benefits law and procedure.&lt;ref name="help"&gt;{{cite web|title=Working With an Accredited Representative|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/apply.asp?expandable=0|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=30 April 2013|quote="There are numerous ways to apply for VA disability benefits depending on the type of benefit you are seeking&amp;nbsp;..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two types of Veterans Service Officers:

1) ''County Veterans Service Officers'' - Most states have established a veterans affairs agency to assist veterans, with offices in each county of the state staffed by County Veterans Service Officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NACVSO|url=http://nacvso.org/about/|work=National Association of County Veterans Service Officers|accessdate=30 April 2013|quote=The National Association of County Veterans Service Officers is an organization made up of local government employees.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) ''VSO Representatives'' are volunteers or employees of nonprofit Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.va.gov/vso/|title=Directory of Veterans Service Organizations|website=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to represent a veteran before the VA, a Veterans Service Organization must either have been Chartered by the U.S. Congress or have received official approval from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to represent veterans in the disability compensation claims process. From the federal government's perspective, the state veterans affairs agencies are "veterans service organizations" since they too must receive approval to represent veterans. Members choosing to use a VSO representative can partake in the VA's new Decision Ready Claim process &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/drc.asp | title=Decision Ready Claims}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This ensures a claims decision within 30 days. 

Some veterans advocates recommend that veterans learn how to file claims on their own so that they retain control over the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Veterans Administration Claims: What You Need to Know to Be Successful|author=asknod|date=2012|isbn=978-1-4771-3951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Win Your Claim|url=http://www.vawatchdog.org/how-to-win-your-claim.html|work=VAWatchdog dot org|publisher=VA Watchdog (Jim Strickland)|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;span id="appeal"&gt;Post-adjudication representation&lt;/span&gt;===
Veterans may appeal the VBA's decision regarding their compensation claim, and they may ask to be represented by an accredited Veterans Service Officer, attorney, or claims agent in the appeals process. Note that the VA does not ''require'' a veteran to be represented on appeal.

VA prohibits attorneys or claims agents from charging a veteran for professional services prior to the [[adjudication]] of the veteran's claim.&lt;ref name="ecfr.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=38 C.F.R. 14.636 – Payment of fees for representation by agents and attorneys in proceedings before Agencies of Original Jurisdiction and before the Board of Veterans' Appeals.|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=d8a5ee044a562fb453141b3c21dea77d&amp;h=L&amp;n=38y1.0.1.1.16&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML#38:1.0.1.1.16.0.163.37|work=Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=United States Government Printing Office (GPO)|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Seal of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.svg|thumb|left|Seal of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]]

Unless they agree to work on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis, attorneys and claims agents who represent veterans before the Veterans Benefits Administration, [[Board of Veterans Appeals]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims|Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]] require payment for their services. At the federal court level, most attorneys work for [[Equal Access to Justice Act]] fees.  These are attorney fees ordered by the court to be paid by the federal government when the government's position in litigation was not "substantially justified."&lt;ref name="ecfr.gov"/&gt;

==Disability rating==

===General rating formula for mental disorders===
If VBA determines that a veteran suffers from service-connected PTSD, then they assign a disability rating, expressed as a percentage. This disability rating determines the amount of compensation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Compensation Benefits Rate Tables|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/resources_comp01.asp|work=Veterans Benefits Administration|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other disability benefits the VA provides the veteran. The disability rating indicates the extent to which PTSD has deprived the veteran of his or her ''average earnings capacity''. A rating of 0% indicates that a veteran has PTSD but the disorder has not affected his or her ability to work, whereas a 100% rating theoretically means that the veteran is not capable of working at all because of PTSD.{{efn|The adverb 'theoretically' is used here because the Rating Formula is based on symptoms, not occupational impairment. While the symptoms associated with the 100% rating for mental disorders often cause significant occupational impairment, e.g., "persistent delusions or hallucinations" or "persistent danger of hurting self or others", they do not necessarily render a veteran unable to work.}}
[[File:Code of Federal Regulations 38.JPG|thumb|Code of Federal Regulations, Title 38 – Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief]]
The VA assigns disability ratings for PTSD according to the ''General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders'' (38 C.F.R. § 4.130),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule of ratings – mental disorders|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=128a291288f3267f643ad3455298d7ac&amp;n=38y1.0.1.1.5.2&amp;r=SUBPART#se38.1.4_1130|work=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 38: Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief, Part 4 – Schedule for Rating Disabilities, Subpart B – Disability Ratings, Mental Disorders|publisher=Government Printing Office, Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR)|accessdate=28 December 2013|at=Note: Scroll down about one page to find the ''General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders'' – it appears immediately under ''9440 Chronic adjustment disorder''. This placement is misleading because it appears as if the ''Rating Formula'' applies to Chronic Adjustment Disorder only, which is not the case. The ''Rating Formula'' applies to ''all'' mental disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specifies criteria for disability ratings of 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%.

Some argue that by relying on the current ''Rating Formula'', "VA uses decades-old regulations developed for mental disorders that do not resemble PTSD", and, consequently, "[i]rrelevant criteria&amp;nbsp;... may outweigh&amp;nbsp;... more relevant factors, leading VA to undercompensate veterans with valid diagnoses of PTSD."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonson|first1=Scott|title=Back from war – A battle for benefits: Reforming VA's disability ratings system for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=Arizona Law Review|date=2008|volume=50|pages=1177–1204|url=http://www.arizonalawreview.org/pdf/50-4/50arizlrev1177.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, veterans service organizations have argued, for example, that a "...&amp;nbsp;veteran service connected for schizophrenia and another veteran service connected for another psychiatric disorder should not be evaluated using the same general formula" and have supported efforts to revise the ''Rating Formula''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=John|title=Statement of John L.

Concern has been expressed by some RSVRs&lt;ref name=RSVR /&gt; (VBA 'raters' who [[adjudicate]] claims) that automated software discourages their use of independent judgment to evaluate the claim as a whole, a charge senior VA officials reject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Daniel|title=Automated System Often Unjustly Boosts Veterans' Disability Benefits: Reduction of VA staff input allows more patients to exaggerate symptoms|url=https://www.wsj.com/article_email/automated-system-often-unjustly-boosts-veterans-disability-benefits-1431387826-lMyQjAxMTE1MTEzMTYxMTEzWj|accessdate=13 May 2015|issue=12 May 2015 [print edition]|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=11 May 2015|page=A6|quote=An effort by the Department of Veterans Affairs that aimed to speed the processing of disability-benefits applications also loosened controls that prevent veterans from exaggerating symptoms to receive more money, say current and former VA employees. A software system introduced in 2012 that automates veterans' disability levels for compensation relies almost solely on a patient's self-reported ailments, the employees say, even in the face of contradictory information. While the new system reduced paperwork and increased output, it limited the information that the VA's employees who determine compensation eligibility and dollar amounts—called raters—can consider, according to these employees. The result, raters contend: a more inaccurate process that approves higher levels of disability than veterans' military records, medical histories and other evidence might show—in some cases increasing payments to veterans by thousands of dollars a month. The process, they maintain, also ignores stated VA rules in which claims must be evaluated 'in light of the [veteran's] whole recorded history.' Senior VA officials counter that the software system still relies on raters' expertise to determine the accuracy of claims. They say it is designed to facilitate, but not replace, that process. Raters 'have every right to change [the symptoms] if there is other evidence in the file,' one official said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, the VA has been revising its disability rating schedule to incorporate medical advances that have occurred since the last review, update medical terminology, add medical conditions not currently in the Rating Schedule, and refine criteria for further clarity, consistency and ease of rater application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=VA Disability Compensation: Actions Needed to Address Hurdles Facing Program Modernization (GAO-12-846)|issue=GAO-12-846|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-846|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|accessdate=5 August 2014|date=10 September 2012|last1=Office|first1=U.

* Some VA medical centers do not allocate enough time for C&amp;P psychologists and psychiatrists to conduct a thorough, [[Evidence based assessment|evidence-based assessment]], with less time presumably reducing the validity of the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Institute of Medicine and National Research Council|title=PTSD Compensation and Military service|date=8 May 2007|publisher=National Academies Press|pages=204–05|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2007/PTSD-Compensation-and-Military-Service.aspx|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russo|first1=Arthur|title=Assessing veteran symptom validity|journal=Psychological Injury and Law|date=5 Mar 2014|volume=7|issue=2|pages=178–90|doi=10.1007/s12207-014-9190-2|url=http://www.veteranslawlibrary.com/files/Veterans_Symptom_Validity_Russo.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As weeks went by, I realized the sad truth about a portion of the veterans there, they were scammers, seeking a higher rating without a real trauma. This was proven when I overheard one vet say to another that he had to 'pay the bills' and how he 'was hoping this in-patient was enough for a 100% rating'. I vowed never to participate in group counseling through the VA again. ... The trend I have seen among the combat veterans, the most traumatized group, [is to] stay away from the VA, or at the very least, [stay away from] the group counseling settings. They have no patience for the fraudulent veterans scamming the system to get a pay check and they are definitely not going to open up about their worst days to those who know nothing about them.")&lt;/ref&gt; assert that a sizable percentage of veterans filing PTSD disability claims exaggerate or feign PTSD symptoms.

=== Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) ===
Mental health professionals document the results of ''Initial'' and ''Review'' PTSD C&amp;P exams on a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Benefits Questionnaire|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_disabilityexams.asp|publisher=Veterans Health Administration|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VA developed Disability Benefit Questionnaires (DBQs) to streamline the VBA ratings process and thereby complete the claims process faster. In addition, veterans may ask their treating clinicians to complete a DBQ and possibly bypass the need for a C&amp;P exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VA Claims Process: Review of VA's Transformation Efforts|url=http://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CHRG-113shrg80110.pdf|publisher=U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs|accessdate=24 August 2014|page=12|format=PDF|date=13 March 2013|quote=DBQs replace traditional VA examination reports and are designed to capture all the needed medical information relevant to a specific condition at once and up front so that claims can be developed and processed in a more timely and accurate manner, with the end result being faster service for Veterans.

Information in the DBQs maps to the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, and provides all of the necessary information to decide a disability claim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the VA discourages their ''mental health'' clinicians from completing DBQs for their patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentation of Medical Evidence for Disability Evaluation Purposes (VHA Directive 2013-002)|url=http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=2856|publisher=Veterans Health Administration|accessdate=24 August 2014|location=4(e)(1)(c)|page=4|format=PDF|date=January 14, 2013|quote=For mental health disability examination requests, it is recommended that the Veteran's treating provider not complete the disability examination to maintain the integrity of the patient-provider relationship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar recommendations have been offered to private psychologists and psychiatrists whose patients ask them to complete DBQs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Worthen, M.

This narrative is not expected to be a veridical history; rather, the therapist strives to see the world 'through the patient's eyes.'

In addition, the disability rating may be based largely on which "Symptom List" items are endorsed, since these items are drawn ''verbatim'' from the examples given for each level of impairment in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.{{efn|For example, the "Symptom List" contains the following items: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Each of those signs, symptoms, or descriptions of functional impairment are the exact examples given for the 50% level of impairment in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (38 C.F.R. § 4.130). Accordingly, if the C&amp;P examiner endorses one or more of these items, the veteran will likely be assigned a 50% disability rating, all other factors being equal, particularly given the advent of VBA's automated ''Evaluation Builder'' software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Daniel|title=Automated System Often Unjustly Boosts Veterans' Disability Benefits|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/automated-system-often-unjustly-boosts-veterans-disability-benefits-1431387826|accessdate=24 August 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=11 May 2015|quote=A software system introduced in 2012 that automates veterans' disability levels for compensation relies almost solely on a patient's self-reported ailments, the employees say, even in the face of contradictory information.

== Important definitions ==

=== Discharge status ===
In order to be eligible for VA benefits, a veteran must have been discharged under ''other than dishonorable conditions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Compensation: Eligibility|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-disability.asp|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stated differently, if a veteran received a ''Bad Conduct'' discharge or a ''Dishonorable'' discharge they will, under most circumstances, not be eligible for VA benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moering|first=Robert|title=Military service records: Searching for the truth|journal=Psychological Injury and Law|volume=4|issue=3–4|pages=217–34|doi=10.1007/s12207-011-9114-3 |url=http://www.cavcbar.net/confpdf/Military%20Service%20Records%20Searching%20for%20the%20Truth%20VA%20Psychiatric%20Exams%20Dr%20Moering.pdf|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Fear of hostile military or terrorist activity - 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3) --&gt;

=== ''In line of duty'' and exceptions ===
There are exceptions to the general rule that injuries or diseases incurred in, or aggravated by, military service are eligible for VA disability compensation benefits. For example, such injuries or diseases must meet the ''in line of duty'' criteria. "''In line of duty'' means an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during a period of active military, naval, or air service unless such injury or disease was the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or&amp;nbsp;... was a result of his or her abuse of alcohol or drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 38, Chapter I, Part 3, Subpart A, Subjgrp-General(Part 3), Section 3.1 – Definitions – (m) ''In line of duty''|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title38-vol1/pdf/CFR-2011-title38-vol1-sec3-1.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Military Sexual Trauma (MST) - 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5) --&gt;

=== Traumatic stressor ===
Matthew J. Friedman of the National Center for PTSD notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;PTSD is unique among psychiatric diagnoses because of the great importance placed upon the etiological agent, the ''traumatic stressor''. In fact, one cannot make a PTSD diagnosis unless the patient has actually met the "stressor criterion," which means that he or she has been exposed to an historical event that is considered traumatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman, MD, PhD|first=Matthew J.|title=PTSD History and Overview|url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/pages/ptsd-overview.asp|publisher=National Center for PTSD|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Dsm-5-released-big-changes-dsm5.jpg|thumb|right|DSM-5]]
A ''traumatic stressor'' is an event that meets Criterion A of the [[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition]] diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The definition of PTSD Criterion A in DSM-5 is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, as follows: (one required)

1. Direct exposure.

2. Witnessing, in person.

3. Indirectly, by learning that a close relative or close friend was exposed to trauma. If the event involved actual or threatened death, it must have been violent or accidental.

4. Repeated or extreme indirect exposure to aversive details of the event(s), usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, collecting body parts; professionals repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). This does not include indirect non-professional exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Relevant regulations,&lt;ref&gt;''See e.g.'', Diagnosis of mental disorders, 38 C.F.R. 4.125(a).&lt;/ref&gt; were updated on August 4, 2014 to reflect the publication of [[DSM-5]].{{efn|There is an exception--although 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) ("Posttraumatic stress disorder") refers to 38 C.F.R. 4.125(a) ("Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with §4.125(a) of this chapter ..."), which specifies use of DSM-5, 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3) was not changed to correspond with DSM-5 PTSD diagnostic criteria. Specifically, the definition of "fear of hostile military or terrorist activity" contains, almost verbatim, language from DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criterion A: "For purposes of this paragraph, 'fear of hostile military or terrorist activity' means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, [DSM-IV criterion A1] ... and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror." [DSM-IV criterion A2]). The VA's [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-08-04/pdf/2014-18150.pdf notice in the Federal Register] does not explain why 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3) still uses DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.}} Thus, as of August 4, 2014, C&amp;P examiners began using DSM-5 when diagnosing veterans' mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Veterans Affairs / 38 CFR Parts 3 and 4 / RIN 2900–AO96 / Schedule for Rating Disabilities—Mental Disorders and Definition of Psychosis for Certain VA Purposes|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-08-04/pdf/2014-18150.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=21 January 2015|page=45094|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Claims that were appealed before August 4, 2014 would still use DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria. ''See ''[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-08-04/pdf/2014-18150.pdf 79 Fed. Reg. 45093] at 45094 ("The Secretary does not intend for the provisions of this interim final rule to apply to claims that have been certified for appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals or are pending before the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.")}}

=== Service-connection ===

The term, ''service-connected'', means that a veteran has a disease or injury that is "connected" to his or her military service, i.e., the disease or injury was incurred in, or aggravated by, his or her military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 2 Service-Connected Disabilities: Disability Compensation|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book/benefits_chap02.asp|work=Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and Survivors|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official definition in the Code of Federal Regulations&lt;ref&gt;38 CFR §3.303(a)&lt;/ref&gt; begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title38-vol1/pdf/CFR-2010-title38-vol1-sec3-303.pdf Full text of 38 CFR §3.303(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The relationship between service connection and access to VA healthcare is emphasized in this definition: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Service connected' veterans are those with documented, compensative conditions related to or aggravated by military service, and they receive priority for enrollment into the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdoch|first=Maureen|author2=Hodges J |author3=Cowper D |author4=Fortier L |author5= van Ryn M |title=Racial disparities in VA service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder disability.|journal=Medical Care|date=April 2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=536–49|doi=10.1097/01.MLR.0000053232.67079.A5|pmid=12665717 |url=http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2003/04000/Racial_Disparities_in_VA_Service_Connection_for.9.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Types of military service ===
[[File:United States Coast Guard Academy seal.jpg|thumb|left|United States Coast Guard Academy seal]]
The regulations describe three categories of military service, ''active duty'', ''active duty for training'', and ''inactive duty training''.&lt;ref name="38CFR3.6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 38, Chapter I, Part 3, Subpart A, Subjgrp-General(Part 3), Section 3.6 – Duty periods.|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title38-vol1/pdf/CFR-2011-title38-vol1-sec3-6.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for VA disability compensation requires that the veteran's service occurred during one of these three categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Compensation|url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/types-disability.asp|website=Veterans Benefits Administration|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=24 August 2015|quote=Disability compensation is a monthly tax-free benefit paid to Veterans who are at least 10% disabled because of injuries or diseases that were incurred in or aggravated during active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of ''active duty'' military service includes "service at any time as a cadet at the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military]], [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]], or [[United States Coast Guard Academy|Coast Guard]] Academy, or as a midshipman at the [[United States Naval Academy]]."&lt;ref name="38CFR3.6"/&gt;

[[Image:VW Jetta V TDI Cup ftl SIAM2008.JPG|thumb|Jetta TDI car from German race series. (Jetta is called Bora in Germany)]]

The '''Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup''' was a single-make racing series sanctioned by the [[Sports Car Club of America]].  The series was started in 2008 and was a [[sports car racing|sports car]] series that ran only in [[North America]], the series quietly folded in 2011.

==Rules &amp; prizes==
The series was open to only drivers between the ages of 16 and 26 who held a passport from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], or [[Mexico]]. The entry fee for drivers is $45,000. In addition to more than $50,000 in prize money at stake during the season, the series champion received Volkswagen factory career advancement support with a value up to $100,000.

==Vehicles==
The cars were 2009 [[Volkswagen Jetta]]s that were modified by the factory for the series. Once completed, the cars were still about 70% stock with the other 30% made up of parts from the VW parts bin, one-off brackets and mounts, and race prepping from outside parties. The cars feature VW's [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]] twin shaft, dual clutch automatic transmission and have height adjustable [[Sachs]] race suspension. Brakes were controlled by an [[Continental AG|ATE]] Racing ABS system and utilize [[Brembo]] 4 piston fixed calipers in front and Lucas 1 piston floating caliper [[disc brake]]s in the rear. The tires are racing slicks provided by [[Pirelli]]. The minimum race weight for the car with driver and equipment is {{convert|1370|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Points system==
The point system used was similar to other race series in that the most points are awarded to the first place finisher and points are reduced for subsequent finishing places. The Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup is unique in that the points are halved for the first two races compared to the points for the rest of the season.
