==Overview==
Allometry is a well-known study, particularly in [[statistical shape analysis]] for its theoretical developments, as well as in [[biology]] for practical applications to the differential growth rates of the parts of a living organism's body. One application is in the study of various [[insect]] species (e.g., [[Dynastes|Hercules beetles]]), where a small change in overall body size can lead to an enormous and disproportionate increase in the dimensions of appendages such as legs, antennae, or horns&lt;ref&gt;E.L. McCullough, K.J. Ledger, D.M. O'Brien, D.J. Emlen (2015) Variation in the allometry of exaggerated rhinoceros beetle horns. ''Animal Behaviour'' 109: 133-140. doi:10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.08.013&lt;/ref&gt;  The relationship between the two measured quantities is often expressed as a [[power law]] equation which expresses a remarkable scale symmetry:&lt;ref name="Longo 23–73"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35938-5_2|title=Perspectives on Organisms|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642359378|series=Lecture Notes in Morphogenesis|pages=23–73|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35938-5_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y = kx^a \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or in a logarithmic form:

: &lt;math&gt;\log y = a \log x + \log k\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the '''scaling exponent''' of the law.  Methods for estimating this exponent from data can use type-2 regressions, such as [[major axis regression]] or [[reduced major axis regression]], as these account for the variation in both variables, contrary to [[least squares regression]], which does not account for error variance in the independent variable (e.g., log body mass).  Other methods include [[measurement error|measurement-error]] models and a particular kind of [[Power law#Power-law functions|principal component analysis]].

Allometry often studies shape differences in terms of [[ratio]]s of the objects' dimensions. Two objects of different size, but common shape, will have their dimensions in the same ratio. Take, for example, a biological object that grows as it matures. Its size changes with age, but the shapes are similar. Studies of ontogenetic allometry often use [[lizards]] or [[snakes]] as model organisms both because they lack [[parental care]] after [[birth]] or hatching and because they exhibit a large range of body sizes between the [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] and [[adult]] stage. Lizards often exhibit allometric changes during their [[ontogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]]| first=T., Jr. |author2=P. L. Else |date=March 1987 |title= Seasonal, sexual, and individual variation in endurance and activity metabolism in lizards | url= http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlEl87.pdf |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=252 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages= R439–49 |pmid=3826408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to studies that focus on growth, allometry also examines shape variation among individuals of a given age (and sex), which is referred to as static allometry.  Comparisons of species are used to examine interspecific or evolutionary allometry (see also: [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]]).

Isometric scaling happens when proportional relationships are preserved as size changes during growth or over evolutionary time.  An example is found in frogs — aside from a brief period during the few weeks after metamorphosis, frogs grow isometrically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emerson SB |title=Allometry and Jumping in Frogs: Helping the Twain to Meet |journal=Evolution |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=551–564 |date=September 1978 |jstor=2407721 |doi=10.2307/2407721}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, a frog whose legs are as long as its body will retain that relationship throughout its life, even if the frog itself increases in size tremendously.

Isometric scaling is governed by the [[square-cube law]].  An organism which doubles in length isometrically will find that the surface area available to it will increase fourfold, while its volume and mass will increase by a factor of eight.  This can present problems for organisms.  In the case of above, the animal now has eight times the biologically active tissue to support, but the surface area of its respiratory organs has only increased fourfold, creating a mismatch between scaling and physical demands.  Similarly, the organism in the above example now has eight times the mass to support on its legs, but the strength of its bones and muscles is dependent upon their cross-sectional area, which has only increased fourfold.  Therefore, this hypothetical organism would experience twice the bone and muscle loads of its smaller version.  This mismatch can be avoided either by being "overbuilt" when small or by changing proportions during growth, called allometry.

Isometric scaling is often used as a null hypothesis in scaling studies, with 'deviations from isometry' considered evidence of physiological factors forcing allometric growth.

==Allometric scaling==

Allometric scaling is any change that deviates from [[isometry]]. A classic example discussed by [[Galileo]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences]]'' is the skeleton of mammals. The skeletal structure becomes much stronger and more robust relative to the size of the body as the body size increases.&lt;ref name=Schmidt-Nielsen&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Nielsen|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allometry is often expressed in terms of a scaling exponent based on body mass, or body length (Snout-vent length, total length etc.). A perfectly isometrically scaling organism would see all volume-based properties change proportionally to the body mass, all surface area-based properties change with mass to the power of 2/3, and all length-based properties change with mass to the power of 1/3. If, after statistical analyses, for example, a volume-based property was found to scale to mass to the 0.9th power, then this would be called "negative allometry", as the values are smaller than predicted by isometry. Conversely, if a surface area-based property scales to mass to the 0.8th power, the values are higher than predicted by isometry and the organism is said to show "positive allometry". One example of positive allometry occurs among species of monitor lizards (family [[Varanidae]]), in which the limbs are relatively longer in larger-bodied species.&lt;ref name="Christian_and_Garland_1996"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Christian, A. |author2=Garland T., Jr. |authorlink2=Theodore Garland, Jr.  |year= 1996 |title= Scaling of limb proportions in monitor lizards (Squamata: Varanidae) |journal= Journal of Herpetology  |volume= 30 |pages= 219–230 |url= http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/ChriGa96.pdf |format=PDF |issue = 2 |jstor = 1565513 |doi=10.2307/1565513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for some fish, e.g. the [[muskellunge]], the weight of which grows with about the power of 3.325 of its length.&lt;ref&gt;R. O. Anderson and R. M. Neumann, Length, Weight, and Associated Structural Indices, in Fisheries Techniques, second edition, B.E. Murphy and D.W. Willis, eds., American Fisheries Society, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|30|in|cm|adj=on}} muskellunge will weigh about {{convert|8|lb|kg}}, while a {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=on}} muskellunge will weigh about {{convert|18|lb|kg}}, so 33% longer length will more than double the weight.

==Determining if a system is scaling with allometry==
To determine whether isometry or allometry is present, an expected relationship between variables needs to be determined to compare data to. This is important in determining if the scaling relationship in a dataset deviates from an expected relationship (such as those that follow isometry). The use of tools such as dimensional analysis is very helpful in determining expected slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pennycuick |first=Colin J. |title= Newton Rules Biology |year=1992 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-854021-3 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Nielsen|1984|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.C. |last=Gibbings |title= Dimensional Analysis |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6iflrgVaWcC |year=2011 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-1-84996-317-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘expected’ slope, as it is known, is essential for detecting allometry because scaling variables are comparisons to other things. Saying that mass scales with a slope of 5 in relation to length doesn’t have much meaning unless knowing the isometric slope is 3, meaning in this case,  the mass is increasing extremely fast. For example, different sized frogs should be able to jump the same distance according to the geometric similarity model proposed by Hill 1950&lt;ref name="Hill_1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hill |first=A.V. |title= The dimensions of animals and their muscular dynamics |journal= Science Progress |date=April 1950 |volume=150 |bibcode= 1949Natur.164R.820. |page=820 |doi= 10.1038/164820b0 |issue=4176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreted by Wilson 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson RS, Franklin CE, James RS |title= Allometric scaling relationships of jumping performance in the striped marsh frog ''Limnodynastes peronii'' |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=203 |issue=Pt 12 |pages= 1937–46 |date= June 2000 |pmid=10821750 |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10821750}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in actuality larger frogs do jump longer distances. 
[[Dimensional analysis]] is extremely useful for balancing units in an equation or in this case, determining expected slope.

A few dimensional examples follow (M=Mass, L=Length, V=Volume, which is also L cubed because a volume is merely length cubed):
[[File:Scalingfigure.jpg|thumb|Allometric relations show as straight lines when plotted on [[Logarithmic scale|double-logarithmic]] axes]]
To find the expected slope for the relationship between mass and the characteristic length of an animal (see figure), the units of mass (M=L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, because mass is a volume; volumes are lengths cubed) from the Y-axis are divided by the units of the X-axis (in this case, L). The expected slope on a double-logarithmic plot of L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in this case is 3 (log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)=3). This is the slope of a straight line, but most data gathered in science do not fall neatly in a straight line, so data transformations are useful. 
It is also important to keep in mind what is being compared in the data. Comparing a characteristic such as head length to head width might yield different results from comparing head length to body length. That is, different characteristics may scale differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Robinson |first=Michael |first2=Philip |last2=Motta |title= Patterns of growth and the effects of scale on the feeding kinematics of the nurse shark (''Ginglymostoma cirratum'') |journal= Journal of Zoology, London |year=2002 |volume=256 |pages=449–462 |doi= 10.1017/S0952836902000493 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common way to analyze data such as those collected in scaling is to use [[Log-log plot|log-transformation]]. There are two reasons for log transformation - a biological reason and a statistical reason. Biologically, log-log transformation places numbers into a geometric domain so that proportional deviations are represented consistently, independent of the scale and units of measurement. In biology this is appropriate  because many biological phenomena (e.g. growth, reproduction, metabolism, sensation) are fundamentally multiplicative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kerkhoff, A.J. |author2=Enquist, B.J. |title=Multiplicative by nature: Why logarithmic transformation is necessary in allometry |journal= Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=257 |pages=519–521 |year= 2009 |doi= 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.12.026 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistically, it is beneficial to transform both axes using logarithms and then perform a linear regression. This will normalize the data set and make it easier to analyze trends using the slope of the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O’Hara, R.B. |author2=Kotze, D.J. |title=Do not log-transform count data |journal= Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=1 |pages=118–122 |year= 2010 |doi= 10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00021.x |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before analyzing data though, it is important to have a predicted slope of the line to compare the analysis to.

After data are log-transformed and linearly regressed, comparisons can then use [[least squares regression]] with 95% confidence intervals or [http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/andy/RMA.html reduced major axis analysis]. Sometimes the two analyses can yield different results, but often they do not. If the expected slope is outside the confidence intervals, then there is allometry present. If mass in this imaginary animal scaled with a slope of 5 and this was a statistically significant value, then mass would scale very fast in this animal versus the expected value. It would scale with positive allometry. If the expected slope were 3 and in reality in a certain organism mass scaled with 1 (assuming this slope is statistically significant), then it would be negatively allometric.

Another example: Force is dependent on the cross-sectional area of muscle (CSA), which is L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If comparing force to a length, then the expected slope is 2. 
Alternatively, this analysis may be accomplished with a power regression. Plot the relationship between the data onto a graph. Fit this to a power curve (depending on the stats program, this can be done multiple ways), and it will give an equation with the form: ''y''=''Zx''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the number. That “number” is the relationship between the data points. The downside, to this form of analysis, is that it makes it a little more difficult to do statistical analyses.

==Physiological scaling==

Many physiological and biochemical processes (such as heart rate, respiration rate or the maximum reproduction rate) show scaling, mostly associated with the ratio between surface area and mass (or volume) of the animal.&lt;ref name="Longo 23–73"/&gt; The [[metabolic rate]] of an individual animal is also subject to scaling.

===Metabolic rate and body mass===
In plotting an animal's [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR) against the animal's own body mass, a logarithmic straight line is obtained, indicating a [[power law|power-law]] dependence.  Overall metabolic rate in animals is generally accepted to show negative allometry, scaling to mass to a power of ≈&amp;nbsp;0.75, known as [[Kleiber's law]], 1932.  This means that larger-bodied species (e.g., elephants) have lower mass-specific metabolic rates and lower heart rates, as compared with smaller-bodied species (e.g., mice). The straight line generated from a double logarithmic scale of metabolic rate in relation to body mass is known as the "mouse-to-elephant curve".&lt;ref name="Willmer_2009" /&gt;  These relationships of metabolic rates, times, and internal structure have been explained as, "an elephant is approximately a blown-up gorilla, which is itself a blown-up mouse."&lt;ref name=bettencourt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bettencourt LM, Lobo J, Helbing D, Kühnert C, West GB |title=Growth, innovation, scaling, and the pace of life in cities |journal= Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Max Kleiber contributed the following allometric equation for relating the BMR to the body mass of an animal.&lt;ref name="Willmer_2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willmer|first=Pat|title=Environmental Physiology of Animals|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis of the intercept did not vary from 70 and the slope was not varied from 0.75, thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Metabolic rate} = 70 M^{0.75}&lt;/math&gt; (although the universality of this relation has been disputed both empirically and theoretically &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dodds PS, Rothman DH, Weitz JS |title=Re-examination of the "3/4-law" of metabolism |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=209 |issue=1 |date=March 2001| pages=9–27 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0007096 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2238|arxiv=physics/0007096 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman DH, Weitz JS |title=Beyond the ‘3/4-power law’: variation in the intra- and interspecific scaling of metabolic rate in animals |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=Nov 2005| pages=611–662  |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1017/S1464793105006834/full |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006834}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;)
where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is body mass, and metabolic rate is measured in [[Calorie|kcal]] per day.

Consequently, the body mass itself can explain the majority of the variation in the BMR. After the body mass effect, the taxonomy of the animal plays the next most significant role in the scaling of the BMR. The further speculation that environmental conditions play a role in BMR can only be properly investigated once the role of taxonomy is established. The challenge with this lies in the fact that a shared environment also indicates a common evolutionary history and thus a close taxonomic relationship. There are strides currently in research to overcome these hurdles; for example, an analysis in muroid rodents,&lt;ref name=Willmer_2009 /&gt; the mouse, hamster, and vole type, took into account taxonomy. Results revealed the hamster (warm dry habitat) had lowest BMR and the mouse (warm wet dense habitat) had the highest BMR. Larger organs could explain the high BMR groups, along with their higher daily energy needs. Analyses such as these demonstrate the physiological adaptations to environmental changes that animals undergo.

Energy metabolism is subjected to the scaling of an animal and can be overcome by an individual's body design. The metabolic scope for an animal is the ratio of resting and maximum rate of metabolism for that particular species as determined by oxygen consumption.
Oxygen consumption V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and maximum oxygen consumption [[VO2 max]]. Oxygen consumption in species that differ in body size and organ system dimensions show a similarity in their charted V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; distributions indicating that, despite the complexity of their systems, there is a power law dependence of similarity; therefore, universal patterns are observed in diverse animal taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Labra FA, Marquet PA, Bozinovic F |title=Scaling metabolic rate fluctuations |journal=Proc.

Across a broad range of species, allometric relations are not necessarily linear on a log-log scale.  For example, the maximal running speeds of mammals show a complicated relationship with body mass, and the fastest sprinters are of intermediate body size.&lt;ref name='Garland_1983_JZL'&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] Jr.|first=T. |year=1983 |title=The relation between maximal running speed and body mass in terrestrial mammals| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1983_JZL.pdf |journal=Journal of Zoology, London |volume=199 |issue= 2|pages=157–170 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02087.x |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chappell_1989'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chappell|first=R. |year=1989 |title=Fitting bent lines to data, with applications to allometry |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=138 |issue= 2|pages=235–256 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80141-9|pmid=2607772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allometric muscle characteristics===
The [[muscle]] characteristics of animals are similar in a wide range of animal sizes, though muscle sizes and shapes can and often do vary depending on environmental constraints placed on them. The muscle tissue itself maintains its contractile characteristics and does not vary depending on the size of the animal. Physiological scaling in muscles affects the number of muscle fibers and their intrinsic speed to determine the maximum power and efficiency of movement in a given animal. The speed of muscle recruitment varies roughly in inverse proportion to the cube root of the animal’s weight (compare the intrinsic [[frequency]] of the sparrow’s flight muscle to that of a stork).
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{frequency} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{mass}^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

For inter-species allometric relations related to such ecological variables as maximal reproduction rate, attempts have been made to explain scaling within the context of [[dynamic energy budget]] theory and the [[metabolic theory of ecology]]. However, such ideas have been less successful.

===Allometry of legged locomotion===

====Methods of study====
Allometry has been used to study patterns in locomotive principles across a broad range of species.&lt;ref name="Daley2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Two explanations for the compliant running paradox: reduced work of bouncing viscera and increased stability in uneven terrain | journal=Biology Letters | volume=6 | pages=418–421 | year=2010 | first1=Monica A. | last1=Daley | first2=James R. | last2=Usherwood | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2010.0175 | issue=3 | pmid=20335198 | pmc=2880072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farley1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farley CT, Glasheen J, McMahon TA |title=Running springs: speed and animal size |journal=J.

Allometric study of locomotion involves the analysis of the relative sizes, masses, and limb structures of similarly shaped animals and how these features affect their movements at different speeds.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;  Patterns are identified based on dimensionless [[Froude number]]s, which incorporate measures of animals’ leg lengths, speed or stride frequency, and weight.&lt;ref name="Sellers2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;

Alexander incorporates Froude-number analysis into his “dynamic similarity hypothesis” of gait patterns. Dynamically  similar gaits are those between which there are constant coefficients that can relate linear dimensions, time intervals, and forces. In other words, given a mathematical description of gait A and these three coefficients, one could produce gait B, and vice versa. The hypothesis itself is as follows: “animals of different sizes tend to move in dynamically similar fashion whenever the ratio of their speed allows it.” While the dynamic similarity hypothesis may not be a truly unifying principle of animal gait patterns, it is a remarkably accurate heuristic.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;

It has also been shown that living organisms of all shapes and sizes utilize spring mechanisms in their locomotive systems, probably in order to minimize the energy cost of locomotion.&lt;ref name="Roberts2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Fleximble mechanisms: the diverse roles of biological springs in vertebrate movement | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=214 | pages=353–361 | year=2011 | first1=Thomas J. | last1=Roberts | first2=Emanuel | last2=Azizi | doi=10.1242/jeb.038588 | issue=3 | pmid=21228194 | pmc=3020146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allometric study of these systems has fostered a better understanding of why spring mechanisms are so common,&lt;ref name="Roberts2011" /&gt; how limb compliance varies with body size and speed,&lt;ref name="Daley2010" /&gt; and how these mechanisms affect general limb kinematics and dynamics.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;

====Principles of legged locomotion identified through allometry====
* Alexander found that animals of different sizes and masses traveling with the same [[Froude number]] consistently exhibit similar gait patterns.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;
* Duty factors—percentages of a stride during which a foot maintains contact with the ground—remain relatively constant for different animals moving with the same Froude number.&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;
* The dynamic similarity hypothesis states that "animals of different sizes tend to move in dynamically similar fashion whenever the ratio of their speed allows it".&lt;ref name="Alexander1984" /&gt;
* Body mass has even more of an effect than speed on limb dynamics.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* Leg stiffness, &lt;math&gt;k_\text{leg} =\frac{\text{peak force}}{\text{peak displacement}}&lt;/math&gt;, is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.67}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is body mass.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* Peak force experienced throughout a stride is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.97}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* The amount by which a leg shortens during a stride (i.e. its peak displacement) is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.30}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* The angle swept by a leg during a stride is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{-0.034}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;
* The mass-specific work rate of a limb is proportional to &lt;math&gt;M^{0.11}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Farley1993" /&gt;

===Drug dose scaling===
The physiological effect of drugs and other substances in many cases scales allometrically.

West, Brown, and Enquist in 1997 derived a hydrodynamic theory to explain the universal fact that metabolic rate scales as the ¾ power with body weight. They also showed why lifespan scales as the +¼ power and heart rate as the -¼ power.  Blood flow (+¾)  and resistance (-¾) scale in the same way, leading to blood pressure being constant across species.&lt;ref name="Westetal1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=G.

Hu and Hayton in 2001 discussed whether the basal metabolic rate scale is a ⅔ or ¾ power of body mass. The exponent of ¾ might be used for substances that are eliminated mainly by metabolism, or by metabolism and excretion combined, while ⅔ might apply for drugs that are eliminated mainly by renal excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Allometric scaling in fluid locomotion==
''This technical section is not well-written and needs editing''.

The mass and density of an organism have a large effect on the organism's locomotion through a fluid. For example, a tiny organisms uses flagella and can effectively move through a fluid it is suspended in.  Then on the other scale a blue whale that is much more massive and dense in comparison with the viscosity of the fluid, compared to a bacterium in the same medium. The way in which the fluid interacts with the external boundaries of the organism is important with locomotion through the fluid. For streamlined swimmers the resistance or drag determines the performance of the organism.  This drag or resistance can be seen in two distinct flow patterns.  There is Laminar Flow where the fluid is relatively uninterrupted after the organism moves through it.  Turbulent flow is the opposite, where the fluid moves roughly around an organisms that creates vortices that absorb energy from the propulsion or momentum of the organism.  Scaling also affects locomotion through a fluid because of the energy needed to propel an organism and to keep up velocity through momentum.  The rate of oxygen consumption per gram body size decreases consistently with increasing body size.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt; (Knut Schmidt-Nielson 2004)

In general, smaller, more streamlined organisms create laminar flow (''R''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.5x106), whereas larger, less streamlined organisms produce turbulent flow (''R''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.0×106).&lt;ref name=Hill_1950 /&gt;  Also, increase in velocity (V) increases turbulence, which can be proved using the Reynolds equation.  In nature however, organisms such as a 6‘-6” dolphin moving at 15 knots does not have the appropriate Reynolds numbers for laminar flow ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;107, but exhibit it in nature.  Mr. G.A Steven observed and documented dolphins moving at 15 knots alongside his ship leaving a single trail of light when phosphorescent activity in the sea was high. The factors that contribute are:
* Surface area of the organism and its effect on the fluid in which the organism lives is very important in determining the parameters of locomotion.
* The Velocity of an organism through fluid changes the dynamic of the flow around that organism and as velocity increases the shape of the organism becomes more important for laminar flow.
* Density and viscosity of fluid.
* Length of the organism is factored into the equation because the surface area of just the front 2/3 of the organism has an effect on the drag

'''The resistance to the motion of an approximately stream-lined solid through a fluid can be expressed by the formula: &lt;big&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''fρ''&lt;/sub&gt;(total surface)''V''2/2&lt;/big&gt; &lt;ref name=Hill_1950 /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'''V = velocity
: ''ρ'' = density of fluid
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;  = 1.33''R'' − 1 (laminar flow) ''R'' = Reynolds number

: Reynolds number &lt;big&gt;[''R''] = ''VL''/''ν''&lt;/big&gt;
: ''V'' = velocity
: ''L'' = axial length of organism
: ''ν'' = kinematic viscosity (viscosity/density)
	
Notable Reynolds numbers:
: ''R'' &lt; 0.5x106 = laminar flow threshold
: ''R'' &gt; 2.0x106 = turbulent flow threshold

Scaling also has an effect on the performance of organisms in fluid.  This is extremely important for marine mammals and other marine organisms that rely on atmospheric oxygen to survive and carry out respiration.  This can affect how fast an organism can propel itself efficiently and more importantly how long it can dive, or how long and how deep an organism can stay underwater.  Heart mass and lung volume are important in determining how scaling can affect metabolic function and efficiency.  Aquatic mammals, like other mammals, have the same size heart proportional to their bodies.

Mammals have a heart that is about 0.6% of the total body mass across the board from a small mouse to a large Blue Whale.  It can be expressed as: Heart Weight = 0.006Mb1.0, where Mb is the body mass of the individual.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt;  Lung volume is also directly related to body mass in mammals (slope = 1.02).   The lung has a volume of 63 ml for every kg of body mass.  In addition, the tidal volume at rest in an individual is 1/10 the lung volume.   Also respiration costs with respect to oxygen consumption is scaled in the order of Mb.75.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt;  This shows that mammals, regardless of size, have the same size respiratory and cardiovascular systems and it turn have the same amount of blood:  About 5.5% of body mass.  This means that for a similarly designed marine mammals, the larger the individual the more efficiently they can travel compared to a smaller individual.  It takes the same effort to move one body length whether the individual is one meter or ten meters. This can explain why large whales can migrate far distance in the oceans and not stop for rest. It is metabolically less expensive to be larger in body size.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"/&gt; This goes for terrestrial and flying animals as well. In fact, for an organism to move any distance, regardless of type from elephants to centipedes, smaller animals consume more oxygen per unit body mass than larger ones. This metabolic advantage that larger animals have makes it possible for larger marine mammals to dive for longer durations of time than their smaller counterparts. That the heart rate is lower means that larger animals can carry more blood, which carries more oxygen.  Then in conjuncture with the fact that mammals reparation costs scales in the order of Mb.75 shows how an advantage can be had in having a larger body mass.  More simply, a larger whale can hold more oxygen and at the same time demand less metabolically than a smaller whale.

Traveling long distances and deep dives are a combination of good stamina and also moving an efficient speed and in an efficient way to create laminar flow, reducing drag and turbulence.  In sea water as the fluid, it traveling long distances in large mammals, such as whales, is facilitated by their neutral buoyancy and have their mass completely supported by the density of the sea water. On land, animals have to expend a portion of their energy during locomotion to fight the effects of gravity.

Flying organisms such as birds are also considered moving through a fluid. In scaling birds of similar shape, it has also been seen that larger individuals have less metabolic cost per kg than smaller species, which would be expected because it holds true for every other form of animal.  Birds also have a variance in wing beat frequency.  Even with the compensation of larger wings per unit body mass, larger birds also have a slower wing beat frequency, which allows larger birds to fly at higher altitudes, longer distances, and faster absolute speeds than smaller birds.  Because of the dynamics of lift-based locomotion and the fluid dynamics, birds have a U-shaped curve for metabolic cost and velocity.  Because flight, in air as the fluid, is metabolically more costly at the lowest and the highest velocities.  On the other end, small organisms such as insects can make gain advantage from the viscosity of the fluid (air) that they are moving in.  A wing-beat timed perfectly can effectively uptake energy from the previous stroke. (Dickinson 2000) This form of wake capture allows an organism to recycle energy from the fluid or vortices within that fluid created by the organism itself.  This same sort of wake capture occurs in aquatic organisms as well, and for organisms of all sizes. This dynamic of fluid locomotion allows smaller organisms to gain advantage because the effect on them from the fluid is much greater because of their relatively smaller size.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Nielsen97"&gt;{{cite book |first=Knut |last=Schmidt-Nielsen |title=Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Af7IwQWJoCMC |date=10 April 1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57098-5 |edition=5th |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allometric engineering==
[[Allometric engineering]] is a method for manipulating allometric relationships within or among groups.&lt;ref name=sinervo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sinervo, B. |author2=Huey, R. |year=1990|title=Allometric Engineering: An Experimental Test of the Causes of Interpopulational Differences in Performance|pages=1106–9|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=248|doi=10.1126/science.248.4959.1106|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/pdfs/SinervoScience1.pdf|issue=4959 |format=PDF|bibcode = 1990Sci...248.1106S |pmid=17733374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In characteristics of a city==
Arguing that there are a number of analogous concepts and mechanisms between cities and biological entities, Bettencourt et al. showed a number of scaling relationships between observable properties of a city and the city size. GDP, "supercreative" employment, number of inventors, crime, spread of disease,&lt;ref name=bettencourt/&gt; and even pedestrian walking speeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bornstein MH, Bornstein HG |title=The Pace of Life |journal=Nature  |volume=259 |issue=5544 |pages=557–9 |date=19 February 1976 |doi=10.1038/259557a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v259/n5544/abs/259557a0.html|bibcode = 1976Natur.259..557B }}&lt;/ref&gt; scale with city population.

==Examples==
Some examples of allometric laws:
* [[Kleiber's law]], metabolic rate &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; raised to the &lt;math&gt;3/4&lt;/math&gt; power:
:: &lt;math&gt;q_{0} \sim M^{\frac 3 4}&lt;/math&gt;
* breathing and heart rate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are both inversely proportional to body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; raised to the &lt;math&gt;1/4&lt;/math&gt; power:
:: &lt;math&gt;t \sim M^{-\frac{1}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;
* mass transfer contact area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:: &lt;math&gt;A \sim M^{\frac 7 8}&lt;/math&gt;
* the proportionality between the optimal [[cruising speed]] &lt;math&gt;V_{opt}&lt;/math&gt; of flying bodies (insects, birds, airplanes) and body mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; raised to the power &lt;math&gt;1/6&lt;/math&gt;:
:: &lt;math&gt;V_\text{opt} \sim  M^{\frac 1 6}&lt;/math&gt;

==Determinants of size in different species==
Many factors go into the determination of body mass and size for a given animal. These factors often affect body size on an evolutionary scale, but conditions such as availability of food and [[habitat]] size can act much more quickly on a species. Other examples include the following:

*Physiological design
: Basic physiological design plays a role in the size of a given species. For example, animals with a closed circulatory system are larger than animals with open or no circulatory systems.&lt;ref name=Willmer_2009 /&gt;
*Mechanical design
: Mechanical design can also determine the maximum allowable size for a species. Animals with tubular endoskeletons tend to be larger than animals with exoskeletons or hydrostatic skeletons.&lt;ref name=Willmer_2009 /&gt;
*Habitat
: An animal’s habitat throughout its [[evolution]] is one of the largest determining factors in its size. On land, there is a positive correlation between body mass of the top species in the area and available land area.&lt;ref name="Burness_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burness|first1=G. P.|last2=Diamond|first2=Jared|last3=Flannery|first3=Timothy|title=Dinosaurs, dragons, and dwarfs: The evolution of maximal body size|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |year=2001 |volume=98 |issue=25|pages=14518–23|doi=10.1073/pnas.251548698 |pmid=11724953 |pmc=64714|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9814518B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a much greater number of “small” species in any given area. This is most likely determined by ecological conditions, evolutionary factors, and the availability of food; a small population of large predators depend on a much greater population of small prey to survive. In an aquatic environment, the largest animals can grow to have a much greater body mass than land animals where gravitational weight constraints are a factor.&lt;ref name=Hill_1950 /&gt;

{{Reading}}
According to the '''alphabetic principle''', [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s and combinations of letters are the [[symbol]]s used to represent the [[phoneme|speech sounds]] of a language based on systematic and predictable relationships between written letters, symbols, and spoken words. The alphabetic principle is the foundation of any alphabetic writing system (such as the [[English (language)|English]] variety of the [[Roman alphabet]]), which is one of the more common types of [[List of writing systems|writing systems]] in use today.

Alphabetic writing systems that use an (in practice) almost perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] have a single letter for each individual speech sound and a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letters that represent them. Such systems are used, for example, in the modern languages [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (arguably, an example of perfect phonemic orthography), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Such languages have a straightforward [[spelling]] system, enabling a writer to predict the spelling of a word given its [[pronunciation]] and similarly enabling a reader to predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling. Ancient languages with such almost perfectly phonemic writing systems include [[Avestan alphabet|Avestic]], [[Latin]], [[Tamil script|Tamil]], [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]], and [[Sanskrit]] ([[Devanāgarī]]— an [[abugida]]; see [[Vyakarana]]). On the other hand, [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] have a strong difference between sounds and symbols.

The alphabetic principle does not underlie [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] like [[written Chinese|Chinese]] or [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]. [[Korean Language|Korean]], along with Chinese and Japanese, is a member of the [[CJK characters|CJK group]] and shares origins for many of the symbols. [[Hangul]], the Korean writing system, is actually strongly alphabetic while it may look logographic or syllabic to outsiders.

==Latin alphabet==
{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
Most [[orthographies]] that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin writing system]] are imperfectly phonological and diverge from that ideal to a greater or lesser extent. This is because the ancient Romans designed the alphabet specifically for Latin. In the Middle Ages, it was adapted to the Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin, as well as to the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and some Slavic languages, and finally to most of the languages of Europe.

===English orthography===

{{Main|English orthography}}
[[English orthography]] is based on the alphabetic principle, but the acquisition of sounds and spellings from a variety of languages has made English spelling patterns confusing. Spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions but nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled with different letters or letter combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, Sebastian. Exception Words, Southwest Educational Development Laboratory. Retrieved from http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183306/http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html |date=2007-10-11 }}, September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters ''ee'' almost always represent {{IPA|/i/}}, but the sound can also be represented by the letter ''y'' or the letters ''ie''.

The spelling systems for some languages, such as [[Spanish orthography|Spanish]], are relatively simple because they adhere closely to the ideal one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. In [[English orthography|English]] the spelling system is more complex and varies considerably in the degree to which it follows the stated pattern. There are several reasons for this, including: first, the alphabet has 26 letters, but the English language has 40 sounds that must be reflected in word spellings; second, English spelling began to be standardized in the 15th century, and most spellings have not been revised to reflect the long-term changes in pronunciation that are typical for all languages; and third, English frequently adopts foreign words without changing the spelling of those words.

==Role in beginning reading==
{{See also|Phonics|Whole Language}}
Learning the connection between written letters and spoken sounds has been viewed as a critical heuristic to word identification for decades. Understanding that there is a direct relationship between letters and sounds enables an emergent reader to decode the pronunciation of an unknown written word and associate it with a known spoken word. Typically, emergent readers identify the majority of unfamiliar printed words by sounding them out. Similarly, understanding the relationship of letters and sounds is also seen as a critical heuristic for learning to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Juel | first1 = Connie | title = Handbook of Reading Research, II | chapter = 27 Beginning Reading | volume = 2 |pages=759–788 | editor = Rebecca Barr | editor2 = Michael L.

Two contrasting philosophies exist with regard to emergent readers learning to associate letters to speech sounds in English. Proponents of [[phonics]] argue that this relationship needs to be taught explicitly and to be learned to [[automaticity]], in order to facilitate the rapid word recognition upon which comprehension depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chall |first=Jeanne S. |authorlink=Jeanne Chall |date=1996 | edition=3rd |title=Learning to read: The great debate |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/learning-to-read-the-great-debate/oclc/8974797/editions  | page= |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |access-date=2010-07-01 | quote= }} '''[See [[Talk: Alphabetic principle#Chall| Talk page]]&amp;zwj;]'''&lt;/ref&gt;   
Others, including advocates of [[Whole language|whole-language]] who hold that reading should be taught [[Holistic education|holistically]], assert that children can naturally intuit the relationship between letters and sounds.

'''Ancient Fishweir Project''' is a collaborative group that creates an annual public art installation on [[Boston Common]]. 

==Description==
In the spring of each year, members of the [[Massachusett]] and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Native American tribes work with students, educators and artists to construct a [[fish-weir]] in honor of the people who built fishweirs 3500 to 5200 years BP ([[Before Present]]) in the area that is now urban Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthunter.com/?p%3D177|title=The Ancient Fishweir Project Part II |accessdate=July 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707140731/http://ancienthunter.com/?p=177 |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this fishweir re-creation is located on dry land near what was once an early shoreline that existed when ocean levels were lower and before new land was made by fill of the [[Back Bay]] tidal estuary that began in the Colonial period.

The fishweir construction is based on archeological discovery of wooden stakes from fishweirs, including the [[Boylston Street Fishweir]], that are still buried under the streets of the [[Back Bay, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oy6nK0ZdqksC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=ancient+fishweir+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0JBxKnjtC0&amp;sig=U9sjZO-EOE_f2OP-X6Mn1ViSxdc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=58AuSqCVH4-UMuCD8YUK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#|title=Boston's Back Bay|page=11|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The early fishweirs, fence-like structures of wood and brush, were built in tidal flats to catch [[alewife]], [[smelts|smelt]], and [[herring]] during the spring [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].

The time of the spring fish spawn, and the beginning of new growing season, is traditionally considered the New Year for Wampanoag and Massachuset people. In traditional culture it is said that the fish return to spawn in the streams when “the oak leaf is as big as a mouse’s ear”.

Initiators of the Ancient Fishweir Project include Gill Solomon, Sachem of the Massachuset Tribe;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/05/18/guided_by_the_spoken_cadence_of_history|title=Guided by the spoken cadence of history|website=Boston.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]]; Dena Dincauze, archeologist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/umarmot/?p=632|title=Dincauze, Dena Ferran • SCUA • UMass Amherst Libraries|website=Library.umass.edu|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Berkland, Archeologist for the City of Boston; and Annawon Weedon and Jim Peters of the Wampanoag Tribe.

The '''argument from reason''' is an argument against [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and for the [[existence of God]] (or at least a [[supernatural]] being that is the source of human reason). The best-known defender of the argument is [[C. S. Lewis]]. Lewis first defended the argument at length in his 1947 book, ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles: A Preliminary Study]]''. In the second edition of ''Miracles'' (1960), Lewis substantially revised and expanded the argument.

Contemporary defenders of the argument from reason include [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Victor Reppert]] and [[William Harker]].

==The argument==

Methodological naturalism is the view that nature as studied by the natural sciences is all that exists. Naturalists deny the existence of a supernatural God, souls, an afterlife, or anything supernatural. Nothing exists outside or beyond the physical universe.

The argument from reason seeks to show that naturalism is self-refuting, or otherwise false and indefensible.

According to Lewis,

{{blockquote|One absolutely central inconsistency ruins [the naturalistic worldview].... The whole picture professes to depend on inferences from observed facts. Unless inference is valid, the whole picture disappears.... [U]nless Reason is an absolute--all is in ruins. Yet those who ask me to believe this world picture also ask me to believe that Reason is simply the unforeseen and unintended by-product of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless becoming. Here is flat contradiction. They ask me at the same moment to accept a conclusion and to discredit the only testimony on which that conclusion can be based.|sign=C. S. Lewis, "Is Theology Poetry?", ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]''}}

More precisely, Lewis's argument from reason can be stated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or "valid", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A’s reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle be explained without invoking supernatural or other nonnatural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
3. Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred (from 1 and 2). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
4. We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally inferred from good evidence. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;5. Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Victor Reppert, author of ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea''. Taken from his blog at: http://dangerousidea.blogspot.com/2006/07/argument-from-reason-and-lewiss-post.html"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, naturalism undercuts itself. If naturalism is true, then we cannot sensibly believe it or virtually anything else.

In some versions of the argument from reason, Lewis extends the argument to defend a further conclusion: that human reason depends on an eternal, self-existent rational Being (God). This extension of the argument from reason states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Since everything in nature can be wholly explained in terms of nonrational causes, human reason (more precisely, the power of drawing conclusions based solely on the rational cause of logical insight) must have a source outside of nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. If human reason came from non-reason it would lose all rational credentials and would cease to be reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. So, human reason cannot come from non-reason (from 2).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;4. So human reason must come from a source outside nature that is itself rational (from 1 and 3).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;5. This supernatural source of reason may itself be dependent on some further source of reason, but a chain of such dependent sources cannot go on forever. Eventually, we must reason back to the existence of eternal, non-dependent source of human reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;6. Therefore, there exists an eternal, self-existent, rational Being who is the ultimate source of human reason. This Being we call God (from 4-5). (Lewis, ''Miracles'', chap. 4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==

On 2 February 1948, Oxford philosopher [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] read a paper to the Oxford [[Socratic Club]] criticizing the version of the argument from reason contained in the third chapter of Lewis's ''Miracles''.

Her first criticism was against the use of the word "irrational" by Lewis (Anscombe 1981: 225-26). Her point was that there is an important difference between irrational causes of belief, such as wishful thinking, and nonrational causes, such as neurons firing in the brain, that do not obviously lead to faulty reasoning. Lewis accepted the criticism and amended the argument, basing it on the concept of nonrational causes of belief (as in the version provided in this article).

Anscombe's second criticism questioned the intelligibility of Lewis's intended contrast between "valid" and "invalid" reasoning. She wrote: "What ''can'' you mean by 'valid' beyond what would be indicated by the explanation you would give for distinguishing between valid and invalid, and what in the naturalistic hypothesis prevents that explanation from being given and from meaning what it does?" (Anscombe 1981: 226) Her point is that it makes no sense to contrast "valid" and "invalid" reasoning unless it is possible for some forms of reasoning to be valid. Lewis later conceded (Anscombe 1981: 231) that "valid" was a bad word for what he had in mind. Lewis didn't mean to suggest that if naturalism is true, no arguments can be given in which the conclusions follow logically from the premises. What he meant is that a process of reasoning is "veridical", that is, reliable as a method of pursuing knowledge and truth, only if it cannot be entirely explained by nonrational causes.

Anscombe's third objection was that Lewis failed to distinguish between different senses of the terms "why", "because", and "explanation", and that what counts as a "full" explanation varies by context (Anscombe 1981: 227-31).  In the context of ordinary life, "because he wants a cup of tea" may count as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of why Peter is boiling water. Yet such a purposive explanation would not count as a full explanation (or an explanation at all) in the context of physics or biochemistry. Lewis accepted this criticism, and created a revised version of the argument in which the distinction between "because" in the sense of physical causality, and "because" in the sense of evidential support, became the central point of the argument. (This is the version described in this article.)&lt;ref&gt;For Anscombe's critical appraisal of Lewis's revised argument from reason, see Elizabeth Anscombe, "C. S. Lewis's Rewrite of Chapter III of ''Miracles''", in Roger White, Judith Wolfe, and Brendan N. Wolfe, eds., ''C. S. Lewis and His Circle: Essays and Memoirs from the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent critics have argued that Lewis's argument at best refutes only strict forms of naturalism that seek to explain everything in terms ultimately reducible to physics or purely mechanistic causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., David Kyle Johnson, "Con: Naturalism Undefeated," in Gregory Bassham, ed. ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "broad" naturalists that see consciousness as an "emergent" non-physical property of complex brains would agree with Lewis that different levels or types of causation exist in nature, and that rational inferences are not fully explainable by nonrational causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Charles Taliaferro, "On Naturalism," in Robert MacSwain and Michael Wards, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to C. S. Lewis''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have objected that Lewis's argument from reason fails because the causal origins of beliefs are often irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational, justified, warranted, etc. Anscombe, for example, argues that "if a man has reasons, and they are good reasons, and they are genuinely his reasons, for thinking something—then his thought is rational, whatever causal statements we make about him" (Anscombe 1981: 229). On many widely accepted theories of knowledge and justification, questions of how beliefs were ultimately caused (e.g., at the level of brain neurochemistry) are viewed as irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational or justified. Some defenders of Lewis claim that this objection misses the mark, because his argument is directed at what he calls the "veridicalness" of acts of reasoning (i.e., whether reasoning connects us with objective reality or truth), rather than with whether any inferred beliefs can be rational or justified in a materialistic world.

==Similar views by other thinkers==
Philosophers such as [[Victor Reppert]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, ''C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from'' ''Reason''. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2003; Victor Reppert, "The Argument from Reason Defended," in Gregory Bassham, ed., ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 75-89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hasker]]&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, ''The Emergent Self''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999, chap. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; have expanded on the argument from reason, and credit C.S. Lewis as an important influence on their thinking.

Lewis never claimed that he invented the argument from reason; in fact, he refers to it as a "venerable philosophical chestnut."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Collected Letters'', vol. 2, Walter Hooper ed. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004, p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the argument occur in the works of Arthur Balfour (see, e.g., ''The Foundations of Belief'', 1879, chap. 13) and G.K. Chesterton. In Chesterton's 1908 book ''Orthodoxy'', in a chapter titled "The Suicide of Thought", he writes of the "great and possible peril . . . that the human intellect is free to destroy itself....It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, "Why should anything go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?"&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Orthodoxy''. New York: Iamge Books, 1959, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Chesterton asserts that the argument is a fundamental, if unstated, tenet of Thomism in his 1933 book ''St. Thomas Aquinas: "The Dumb Ox"'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, even those who appreciate the metaphysical depth of Thomism in other matters have expressed surprise that he does not deal at all with what many now think the main metaphysical question; whether we can prove that the primary act of recognition of any reality is real. The answer is that St. Thomas recognised instantly, what so many modern sceptics have begun to suspect rather laboriously; that a man must either answer that question in the affirmative, or else never answer any question, never ask any question, never even exist intellectually, to answer or to ask. I suppose it is true in a sense that a man can be a fundamental sceptic, but he cannot be anything else: certainly not even a defender of fundamental scepticism. If a man feels that all the movements of his own mind are meaningless, then his mind is meaningless, and he is meaningless; and it does not mean anything to attempt to discover his meaning. Most fundamental sceptics appear to survive, because they are not consistently sceptical and not at all fundamental. They will first deny everything and then admit something, if for the sake of argument--or often rather of attack without argument. I saw an almost startling example of this essential frivolity in a professor of final scepticism, in a paper the other day. A man wrote to say that he accepted nothing but Solipsism, and added that he had often wondered it was not a more common philosophy. Now Solipsism simply means that a man believes in his own existence, but not in anybody or anything else. And it never struck this simple sophist, that if his philosophy was true, there obviously were no other philosophers to profess it.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Thomas Aquinas: The Dumb Ox''. New York: Image Books, 1933, pp. 148-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Miracles'', Lewis himself quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning in his 1927 book, ''Possible Worlds'': "If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms."&lt;ref&gt;J. B. S. Haldane, ''Possible Worlds and Other Essays''. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1929, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the argument from reason occur in [[C.E.M. Joad]]'s ''Guide to Modern Philosophy'' (London: Faber, 1933, pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59), Richard Taylor's ''Metaphysics'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd ed., 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–05), and [[J. P. Moreland]]'s ''Scaling the Secular City: A Defense of Christianity'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1987, chap. 3).

[[Image:CPAS building.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University in Canberra]]
The '''Centre for the Public Awareness of Science''' is part of the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000 it became an accredited Centre for the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

==Work of the Centre==

As a [[UNESCO]] Centre, CPAS engages with [[science communication]] and communicators in the Pacific region and beyond.  In partnership with the [[UNESCO]] Pacific Office in [[Apia]], [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=36986&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt; CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations.  As well as running a science journalism workshop for [[Pacific Island]] journalists in 2001, CPAS  followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Pacific Science Communication Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] office in [[Jakarta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.id UNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; invited CPAS to join a mission to [[Cambodia]] to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with [[UNESCO]] ([[Apia]]) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific.

CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. 

Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in [[Fiji]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]. A joint teaching program is being developed with the [[National University of Singapore]]. In [[South Africa]], CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various [[South African]] science centres.

==Teaching, Outreach and Research==

With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of [[science communication]]. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php CPAS Academic Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113805/http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell [[Questacon]] Science Circus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/sqsc.html ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of [[science communication]] theory.

==History==

CPAS was launched by Professor [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/about/CPAS_launch.php CPAS Launch]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in [[Canberra]]. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into [[Questacon]] – The National Science and Technology Centre. [[Questacon]] was the brainchild of [[Mike Gore (physicist)|Michael Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike Prof. Michael Gore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from [[Shell Australia]].

Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris Prof. Chris Bryant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dean of Science at the [[Australian National University]], with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of [[science communication]]. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629085932/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program.

By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the [[Australian National University]] agreed to fund a Lectureship in [[Science Communication]]. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr [[Susan Stocklmayer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue Dr Susan Stocklmayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for [[science communication]].  The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today.

==Awards==

In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, [[Shell Australia]] and [[Questacon]] jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round Table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhert.com/ Business/Higher Education Round Table]&lt;/ref&gt; Award. The citation commends CPAS as “a university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.”  In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication.

In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3723">'''Battlemind''' is both the [[Orientation (mental)|mental orientation]] [[developed]] during a [[combat|combat zone]] [[Military deployment|deployment]] and a program developed at [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR) intended to reduce its impact on personal post-[[Military deployment|deployment]] issues.

==Mental orientation==
In the definition provided by the U.S. Army Medical Command 
{{quote|text="Battlemind is the Soldier's inner strength to face fear and adversity with courage. Key components include: 
# Self confidence: taking calculated risks and handling challenges.
# Mental toughness: overcoming obstacles or setbacks and maintaining positive thoughts during times of adversity and challenge."&lt;ref name=behavioralhealth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.behavioralhealth.army.mil/battlemind/index.html |title=Battlemind Information |date=May 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=U.S. Army Medical Command| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080529053857/http://www.behavioralhealth.army.mil/battlemind/index.html| archivedate= 29 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The significance of Battlemind in the Medical Command's context is that ''"Battlemind skills helped you survive in combat, but may cause you problems if not adapted when you get home."''&lt;ref name=behavioralhealth/&gt;

Initial writings on the subject focused on the utility of battlemind while in service,&lt;ref name=saint&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Crosbie E. Saint]] |title=Battlemind guidelines for battalion commanders |publisher= Headquarters, U.S. Army, Europe and Seventh Army |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while several recent works focus on treatment and self-help.&lt;ref name=whealin1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Julia M. Whealin |author2=Lorie T. DeCarvalho |author3=Edward M. Vega |title=Clinician's Guide to Treating Stress After War: Education and Coping Interventions for Veterans |publisher=Wiley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-25777-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whealin2&gt;{{cite book |author1=Julia M.

Vega |title=Strategies for Managing Stress After War: Veteran's Workbook and Guide to Wellness |publisher=Wiley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-25776-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
The first Battlemind product was a mental health post-deployment briefing. It quickly became a training system supporting soldiers and families across the seven phases of the deployment cycle.&lt;ref name=huseman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48567 |title='Battlemind' Prepares Soldiers for Combat, Returning Home |author=Huseman, Susan |date=Jan 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=defenselink.mil| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080520122624/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48567| archivedate= 20 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battlemind system now includes separate pre-deployment training modules for soldiers, unit leaders, health care providers and spouses. Psychological debriefings are given in theater and upon redeployment. There is also a post-deployment module for spouses and several post-deployment modules for soldiers.

==Controversy==
Some veteran groups have expressed concern or curiosity about the effectiveness of the Battlemind program in addressing [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=vawatchdog&gt;{{cite web |title=A LOOK AT DoD's "BATTLEMIND" PROGRAM |url=http://www.vawatchdog.org/08/nf08/nfJAN08/nf010408-1.htm |author=Scott, Larry |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |publisher=VA Watchdog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Trait-scale-bimodal.png|thumb|right|313px|[[Norms of reaction]] for two genotypes. Genotype B shows a strongly bimodal distribution indicating differentiation into distinct phenotypes. Each phenotype that results from genotype B is buffered against environmental variation—it is canalised.]]

'''Canalisation''' is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same [[phenotype]] regardless of variability of its environment or [[genotype]]. It is a form of [[robustness (evolution)|evolutionary robustness]]. The term was coined in 1942 by [[C. H. Waddington]] to capture the fact that "developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to [[natural selection]]...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington CH |title=Canalization of development and the inheritance of acquired characters |journal=Nature |volume=150 |pages=563–565 |year=1942 |doi=10.1038/150563a0 |issue=3811|bibcode=1942Natur.150..563W }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems.

Biological robustness or canalisation comes about when [[developmental biology|developmental pathways]] are [[evolutionary developmental biology|shaped by evolution]]. Waddington introduced the concept of the [[epigenetic landscape]], in which the state of an organism rolls "downhill" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley (which he called a [[creode]]) enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its "fate". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waddington CH |title=The strategy of the genes |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic assimilation==

Waddington used the concept of canalisation to explain his experiments on [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2405747 |author=Waddington CH |title=Genetic assimilation of an acquired character |journal=Evolution|volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=118–126 |year=1953 |jstor=2405747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, he exposed ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' [[pupa]]e to heat shock. This environmental disturbance caused some flies to develop a [[crossveinless]] [[phenotype]]. He then [[Artificial selection|selected]] for crossveinless. Eventually, the crossveinless phenotype appeared even without heat shock. Through this process of genetic assimilation, an environmentally induced phenotype had become inherited. Waddington explained this as the formation of a new canal in the [[epigenetic]] landscape.

It is, however, possible to explain genetic assimilation using only [[quantitative genetics]] and a threshold model, with no reference to the concept of canalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/282040 |author=Stern C |title=Selection for subthreshold differences and the origin of pseudoexogenous adaptations |journal=American Naturalist|volume=92 |pages=313–316 |year=1958 |issue=866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateman KG |title=The genetic assimilation of the dumpy phenocopy |journal=American Naturalist|volume=56 |pages=341–351 |year=1959 |doi=10.1007/bf02984790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000433 |author=Scharloo W |title=Canalization – genetic and developmental aspects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22 |pages=65–93 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Falconer DS, Mackay TF |title=Introduction to Quantitative Genetics |pages=309–310 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, theoretical models that incorporate a complex [[genotype–phenotype map]] have found evidence for the evolution of phenotypic robustness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.102303999 |vauthors=Siegal ML, Bergman A |title=Waddington's canalization revisited: Developmental stability and evolution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99 |issue=16 |pages=10528–10532 |year=2002 |pmid=12082173 |pmc=124963|bibcode=2002PNAS...9910528S }}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to genetic assimilation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Masel J |title=Genetic assimilation can occur in the absence of selection for the assimilating phenotype, suggesting a role for the canalization heuristic |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=1106–1110 |year=2004 |pmid=15312082| doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00739.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; even when selection is only for developmental stability and not for a particular phenotype, and so the quantitative genetics models do not apply. These studies suggest that the canalisation heuristic may still be useful, beyond the more simple concept of robustness.

==Congruence hypothesis==

Neither canalisation nor robustness are simple quantities to quantify: it is always necessary to specify which trait is canalised (robust) to which perturbations. For example, perturbations can come either from the environment or [[mutational robustness|from mutations]]. It has been suggested that different perturbations have '''congruent''' effects on development taking place on an epigenetic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meiklejohn CD, Hartl DL |title=A single mode of canalization |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17 |pages=e9035 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02596-X |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-010X(20001015)288:3&lt;242::AID-JEZ5&gt;3.0.CO;2-O |vauthors=Ancel LW, Fontana W |title=Plasticity, evolvability, and modularity in RNA |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=288 |issue=3 |pages=242–283 |year=2000 |pmid=11069142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msp008 |vauthors=Szöllősi GJ, Derényi I |title=Congruent Evolution of Genetic and Environmental Robustness in Micro-RNA|journal=Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution|volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=867–874 |year=2009 |pmid=19168567 |arxiv=0810.2658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2411105 |vauthors=Wagner GP, Booth G, Bagheri-Chaichian H | title=A population genetic theory of canalization| journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=329–347|year=1997 |jstor=2411105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lehner B |last2=Lehner |first2=Ben |title=Genes Confer Similar Robustness to Environmental, Stochastic, and Genetic Perturbations in Yeast|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=468–473 |year=2010 |pmid=20140261 |pmc=2815791 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009035 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009035 |editor1-last=Polymenis |editor1-first=Michael|bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9035L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, however, depend on the molecular mechanism responsible for robustness, and be different in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.07.005 |author=Masel J Siegal ML |title=Robustness: mechanisms and consequences |journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=395–403 |year=2009 |pmid=19717203 |pmc=2770586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary capacitance==

The canalisation metaphor suggests that phenotypes are very robust to small perturbations, for which development does not exit the canal, and rapidly returns down, with little effect on the final outcome of development. But perturbations whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold will break out of the canal, moving the developmental process into uncharted territory. Strong robustness up to a limit, with little robustness beyond, is a pattern that could increase [[evolvability]] in a fluctuating environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel I, Matessi C |title=Canalization, genetic assimilation and preadaptation. A quantitative genetic model |journal=Genetics |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=2119–33 |year=1998 |pmid=9691063 |pmc=1460279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic canalisation could allow for [[evolutionary capacitance]], where genetic diversity outside the canal accumulates in a population over time, sheltered from [[natural selection]] because it does not normally affect phenotypes. This hidden diversity could then be unleashed by extreme changes in the environment or by molecular switches, releasing previously cryptic genetic variation that can then contribute to a rapid burst of evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10210">The '''Cenozoic Research Laboratory''' ({{zh|c=新生代地质与环境研究室}}) of the [[Geological Survey of China]] was established within the [[Peking Union Medical College]] in [[1928 in archaeology|1928]] by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Davidson Black]] and [[China|Chinese]] [[geologist]]s [[Ding Wenjing]] and [[Weng Wenhao]] for the research and appraisal of [[Peking Man]] fossils unearthed at [[Zhoukoudian]].

==History==
Davidson Black founded the laboratory with an $80,000 grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and  stayed on as honorary director until he died in his office, surrounded by his finds, in [[1934 in archaeology|1934]].&lt;ref name="sheilaMelvin1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php | title = Archaeology: Peking Man, still missing and missed | accessdate = April 20, 2008 | author = | last = Melvin | first = Sheila | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = October 11, 2005 | year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | doi = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051012071152/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php| archivedate =2005-10-12| dead-url = yes | quote = Black died at his office desk in the middle of the night with a skullcap of Peking Man beside him.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Germany|German]] [[Jewish]] [[anthropologist]] [[Franz Weidenreich]].

Excavations at Zhoukoudian ceased in [[1937 in archaeology|1937]] with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]] and the fossils from the site were locked in the laboratory safe under the assumption that they would be secure at the American-run hospital.&lt;ref name="sheilaMelvin2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php | title = Archaeology: Peking Man, still missing and missed | accessdate = April 20, 2008 | author = | last = Melvin | first = Sheila | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = October 11, 2005 | year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | doi = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051012071152/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php| archivedate =2005-10-12| dead-url = yes | quote = Although there was some discussion of moving the bones after the Japanese invasion in 1937, they were apparently assumed to be safe because they were housed in the American-run Peking Union Medical Hospital, which oversaw the Cenozoic Research Lab.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the summer of [[1941 in archaeology|1941]], fearing imminent war between America and Japan, Weidenreich ordered copies of the bones to be made. When this task had been completed secretary [[Hu Chengzi]] packed up the fossils so they could be shipped to the U.S. for safekeeping until the end of the war. They were never seen again.&lt;ref name="sheilaMelvin3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php | title = Archaeology: Peking Man, still missing and missed | accessdate = April 20, 2008 | author = | last = Melvin | first = Sheila | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = October 11, 2005 | year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | doi = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051012071152/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php| archivedate =2005-10-12| dead-url = yes | quote = Franz Weidenreich, a German who led the Cenozoic Lab after Black's death, insisted that copies of all the Peking Man bones be made in the summer of 1941 because he feared (correctly) that Japanese would take over the lab if war broke out with the United States. But it was not until the late autumn of 1941 that the bones were crated and sent to the American controller of Peking Union Medical College for shipment to the United States - and vanished forever.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now only Weidenreich’s timely copies and the research notes of the staff remain to demonstrate the pioneering work of this laboratory that is considered to be the precursor of the modern [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] (IVPP) of the [[Chinese Academy of Science]].

The ruins are buildings and terraces at levels above and below Sunch'u Pata, the truncated hill top. The hilltop was anciently leveled and ringed with stones to create a 30 by 50&amp;nbsp;m platform.

Choquequirao at an elevation of {{convert|3050|m|ft}} &lt;ref name="promperu"/&gt;) is in the spurs of the [[Vilcabamba mountain range|Vilcabamba]] mountain range in  the Santa Teresa district,  [[Anta Province|La Convención Province]] of the [[Cusco Region]]. The complex is 1,800&amp;nbsp;hectares, of which 30–40% is excavated.&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"/&gt; The site overlooks the [[Apurimac River]] canyon which has an elevation of {{convert|1450|m|ft}}.

== History ==
Choquequirao is a 15th and 16th century settlement associated with the Inca Empire, or more correctly [[Tahuantinsuyo]].&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; The site had two major growth stages. This could be explained if [[Pachacuti]] founded Choquequirao and his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Tupac Inca Yupanqui]], remodeled and extended it after becoming the [[Sapa Inca]].&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;  Choquequirao is located in the area considered to be Pachacuti’s estate; which includes the areas around the rivers Amaybamba, Urabamba, Vilcabamba, Victos and Apurímac. Other sites in this area are [[Sayhuite]], [[Machu Picchu]], Chachabamba ''(Chachapampa)'', Choquesuysuy ''(Chuqisuyuy)'' and Guamanmarca ''(Wamanmarka)''; all of which share similar architectural styles with Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The architectural style of several important features appears to be of [[Chachapoya]] design, suggesting that Chachapoya workers were probably involved in the construction. This suggests that Tupaq Inka probably ordered the construction. Colonial documents also suggest that Tupac Inca ruled Choquequirao since his great grandson, Tupa Sayri, claimed ownership of the site and neighboring lands during Spanish colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the last bastions of resistance and refuge of the Son of the Sun (the "Inca"), [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], who fled [[Cusco]] after his siege of the city failed in 1535.

According to the Peruvian Tourism Office, "Choquequirao was probably one of the entrance check points to the [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], and also an administrative hub serving political, social and economic functions. Its urban design has followed the symbolic patterns of the imperial capital, with ritual places dedicated to ''[[Inti]]'' (the Incan sun god) and the ancestors, to the earth, water and other divinities, with mansions for administrators and houses for artisans, warehouses, large dormitories or kallankas and farming terraces belonging to the Inca or the local people. Spreading over 700 meters, the ceremonial area drops as much as 65 meters from the elevated areas to the main square."&lt;ref name="promperu"&gt;[http://www.peru.travel/en/culture/archaeology/choquequirao-1122-2-567-4.1.14 Choquequirao, Peru's Tourism Office, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The city also played an important role as a link between the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]] and the city of [[Cusco]].

=== Discovery ===
According to Ethan Todras-Whitehill of the New York Times, Choquequirao's first non-Incan visitor was the [[explorer]] [[Juan Arias Díaz]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/travel/03inca.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 Ethan Todras-Whitehill on the New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The first written site reference in 1768 was made by [[Cosme Bueno]], but was ignored at the time.

The Prefect of the Province of Apurimac, J.J. Nuñez, encouraged [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] to visit the 'Cradle of Gold', in order to discover any Incan treasure.  Bingham was a delegate to the 1908 First Pan American Scientific Congress and was in Cusco at the time.  Bingham decided to visit Choquequirao in 1909 to determine if it was [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcapampa]], the Capital of the last four Incas.  He found three groups of buildings, mummified bodies, and places where dynamite had been used in the search of treasure.  Visitors who had recorded their names included Count de Sartiges, Jose Maria Tejada and Marcelino Leon, 1834, Jose Benigno Samanez, Juan Manuel Rivas Plata and Mariana Cisneros, 1861, and three Almanzas, Pio Mogrovejo, and their treasure hunting workmen, 1885.  However, Bingham decided it was merely a frontier fortress, and tempted him to search further.&lt;ref name="Hiram"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Hiram|title=Lost City of the Incas|date=1952|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=9781842125854|pages=112–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choquequirao is situated at an elevation of 3,000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level on a southwest-facing spur of a glaciated peak above the [[Apurimac River]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The region is characterized by mountain topography and covered with Amazonian flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is 98&amp;nbsp;km west of Cusco, in the Vilcabamba range. The complex covers 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally it is similar to Machu Picchu. The main structures, such as temples, [[huaca]]s, elite residences, and fountain/bath systems are concentrated around two plazas along the crest of the ridge, which encompass approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and follow Inca urban design. Also there is a conglomeration of common buildings clustered away from the plaza. Excavations and surface items suggest they were probably used for workshops and food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings are well-preserved and well-restored; restoration continues.

The terrain around the site was greatly modified. The central area of the site was leveled artificially and the surrounding hillsides were terraced to allow cultivation and small residential areas.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"/&gt; The typical Inca terraces form the largest constructions on site.

Many of the ceremonial structures are associated with water. There are two unusual temple ''wak'a'' sites that lie several hundred meters lower than the two plazas. These are carefully crafted step terraces down a steep slope are designed around water.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The site also contains a number of ceremonial structures such as the large ''[[ushnu|usnu]]'' built on a truncates hill, the Giant Staircase, and an aqueduct providing water to the water shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectors===
The archaeological complex of Choquequirao is divided into 12 sectors. While the contents of each sector are different, terraces used for various purposes are common throughout. It seems that most of the buildings here were either for ceremonial purposes, residences of the priests, or used to store food.
    
* Sector I is the highest and most northerly portion of the site. There exist 5 buildings constructed on terraces at varying levels, a temple and a plaza, as well as a smaller plaza in the uppermost area of the sector. Two of the buildings appear to be ''[[qullqa]]s'' (warehouses). The three long buildings, called ''kallankas'' were likely priests’ residences.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel.(2008). p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector II is where a majority of the ''qullqanpatas'', or depositories are located. In one part of this sector there are 16 ceremonial platforms with canal routes in between that branch off from the main water way.&lt;ref name="Burga"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector III is between the ''hanan'' (high) area and the ''urin'' (low) area of the complex and contains what is believed to be the Haucaypata ''(Hawkaypata)'', or main plaza. At the periphery of the plaza there are one story and two story buildings. To the north, there is a ''Sunturwasi'' and a single level ''kallanka'' likely used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; To the east are the buildings with two levels. The main plaza is discussed in more detail in the section called '''Ceremonial Center''' of this page.
* Sector IV is located in the southerly area of the complex, known as the ''urin'' zone. The main building here has walls that were probably ceremonial in function since one of them is known as “wall of offerings to the ancestors”.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt;
* Sector V is the location of the ''usnu'' which is a hill leveled at the summit to form an oval platform used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; A small wall encircles the hill. From the platform, one can see the main plaza of sector III, the snowcapped mountains and the Apurímac River.
* Sector VI, south of the ''usnu'' in the ''urin'' area, it has the ''Wasi Kancha'' ("house yard"), also known as the priests' quarters. There are four terraces here that were used as ceremonial space.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In the walls of the terraces there is a zigzagged design.
* Sector VII can be reached from the main plaza by pathway. Located on the east side of Choquequirao, this zone contains cultivation terraces that have markedly greater amplitude than all others throughout the complex.
* Sector VIII, on the western side of the complex, has 80 cultivation terraces divided into plots by water canals that stream down from the main plaza. In this zone, one will find the famous "Llamas del Sol".&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector IX contains general living quarters for groups of people, such as workers or families. The buildings are constructed on top of artificial platforms in circular and rectangular design, interconnected by stairways and narrow alleys.
* Sector X, called ''paraqtepata'', has 18 terraced platforms that have irrigation canals running parallel to the stairs.&lt;ref name="manuel"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector XI has 80 terraces used for cultivation, called ''phaqchayuq'' ("the one with a waterfall"), which are the most extensive in the entire complex.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt; Also found here are small, quadrilateral enclosures with two levels used for both ceremony and living. Outside, there are three water fountains used for drinking and to supply the irrigation canals.
* Sector XII lies three hours away (by foot) from the upper part of the complex. Here there are 57 platforms with permanent irrigation systems. In the uppermost terraces there are buildings for ceremony and a pool of water fed by a spring. In the semicircular enclosures ceramic shards, stone tools and remains of bones have been found.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt;

===Ceremonial center===
The ceremonial center of Choquequirao shares many features similar to those of other Inca ceremonial centers and pilgrimage sites, such as Isla del Sol, Quespiwanka (''Qhispi Wank'a'', palace of [[Huayna Capac]]), Machu Picchu/[[Llaqtapata]], [[Tipon]] and Saywite. The long and treacherous route from Cusco to Choquequirao likely passed by Machu Picchu, leading onto the face of Machu Picchu Peak. From Llaqtapata, the path continued down into the Mollepata Valley, traversed the Yanamia pass at 4670 m, and continued across the Rio Blanco, finally reaching Choquequirao from above after an estimated 7- to 10-day journey.&lt;ref name=Malville&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremonial center consists of a main platform and a lower plaza. Stone lined channels carried ceremonial water, or chicha to shrines and baths throughout the site. The main platform, unique in its size and prominence, limited ceremonial activity to royalty and the ministerial class. This seems as such due to evidence showing that the only entrance to the platform was through a double-jam doorway, which functioned to control access to the sacred space.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Other features of the ceremonial center include structures that mark the direction of certain solar events, such as when the June and December solstice sun rises and sets.
 
Located in the main platform, the Giant Stairway opens to the sunrise of the December solstice. Measured at 25 meters long and 4.4 meters wide, this structure seems to have been purely ceremonial in function, since the stairs end abruptly partway down a hill, leading to nothing. Large boulders that rest upon the risers of the stairway become fully illuminated when the December solstice sun rises. Gary R. Ziegler and J. McKim Malville have postulated that when the boulders become illuminated, a ''wak'a'' is activated by its solar camaquen—a case similar to when the large stone of the Torreon at Machu Picchu becomes illuminated.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt;
 
In the lower plaza a group of structures were found that appeared to be water shrines and baths. This belief is held based on their strong resemblance to those at sector II of Llaqtapata and because there are numerous water channels leading to that portion of the plaza.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Overall, it seems as though the site was chosen, as Machu Picchu was, for its sacred geographical location, and was designed to facilitate ritual and ceremonial activity.

===Subsectors===
The area around Choquequiaro contains several subsectors that have been associated with the Inca culture that thrived in Choquequirao, suggesting that the subsectors are most likely part of the site. Design, construction style, and cultural parallels support that these sectors were tightly intertwined with Choquequiaro and the Inca at some point in their history. The lack of residential space in these sectors suggests that these were probably farming outposts from Choquequirao rather than an independent site.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to differences in design and construction styles, it is believed that these sectors were built in three different phases.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Choquequirao art style, the subsector also contains multiple camelid art and ceremonial ''phaqchas'' that are tightly related to Inca, especially Pachacuti’s government.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
All lithic materials utilized for the construction of the site and surrounding sectors were mined from the local quarries.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[metamorphic rock]] in the quarries of Choquequirao, superb masonry like that at Machu Picchu could not be obtained. Instead, the entrances and corners were shaped from [[quartzite]], and the walls were made of achlar and plastered with clay and then painted in a light orange color.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Most of the rock art in Choquequirao is in the terraced area where cultivation occurred. Archaeologists have documented twenty-five semi-naturalistic figures on the terraces of sector VIII of Choquequirao. The rocks used to build the walls are dark [[schist]] while the camelid images are of white [[calcocuarcita]], a sandstone of quartz and carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, pp.214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; The camelid motifs vary between a maximum height of 1.94&amp;nbsp;m and one minimum of 1.25&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, archaeologist Zenobio Valencia from the University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco found several camelid figurines made of white stones in a group of terraces in one sector of the archaeological site.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"/&gt;

One recent discovery for example, uncovered a scene laid into the stone terraces with white quartzite depicting several llamas loaded with cargo standing by their handlers. Present on the uppermost terrace wall is a zigzag pattern of the same quartzite. This style of design is uniquely [[Chachapoya]] and not found in other sites of Inca construction, indicating that workers from Chachapoya may have been involved in the construction of Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
Presently the only way to access Choquequirao is by a hard hike. The common trail head begins at the village of San Pedro de Cachora,&lt;ref name="Horizon Guides"&gt;[https://horizontravelpress.com/guides/trekking-to-machu-picchu-013 Trekking To Machu Picchu, Horizon Guides, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately a 4-hour drive from Cuzco, along the Cusco-Abancay route. Another access point is from Huanipaca village, whose crossroad is located on the same route Cusco-Abancay, 4–5&amp;nbsp;km beyond the Cachora crossroad. Huanipaca offers a 15&amp;nbsp;km trail, half distance less than Cachora trail (31&amp;nbsp;km). Over 5,000 people trekked to Choquequirao in 2013. From Choquequirao it is possible to continue hiking to Machu Picchu. Most treks range from 7-day to 11-day hikes, and involve going over the Yanama Pass, which at 4,668&amp;nbsp;m is the highest point on the trek.

The construction of the cable car to Choquequirao has been declared a priority by the [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac Regional Government]], which are destined to receive 220 million Peruvian Soles (US$82.7 million) to fund the project. It will reduce a two-day hike to a 15-minute cable car ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salazar|first=Carla|title=Tramway planned for Machu Picchu’s ‘sister city’|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tramway-planned-machu-picchus-sister-city-065213029.html|work=AP Travel|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Canales, president of the National Chamber of Tourism (Canatur) believes that in the first year of operation the Choquequirao cable car will receive 200,000 tourists, which will generate an income of US$4 million, with the average visitor paying US$20 per ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Choquequirao recibiría 600 mil viajeros en el 2018 con teleférico|url=http://elcomercio.pe/turismo/1506503/noticia-apurimac-recibiria-600-mil-viajeros-2018-gracias-teleferico-choquequirao?ft=grid|newspaper=El Comercio|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">'''Cognitive poetics''' is a school of [[literary]] criticism that applies the principles of [[cognitive science]], particularly [[cognitive psychology]], to the interpretation of literary [[Writing|texts]].  It has ties to [[reader-response criticism]], and is also closely related to [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], whose application to literary study has been most popular in continental [[Europe]]. Like the [[New Critics]], cognitive poetics engages in close analysis of the text, but it recognizes that context has an important role to play in the creation of meaning.

Due to its focus on how readers process the language of texts, cognitive poetics represents simultaneously a turn back in time, to the [[ancient]] study of [[rhetoric]];&lt;ref name=Stockwell2002p8&gt;
"Cognitive poetics is still relatively new as a discipline, though it makes clear reconnections back to much older forms of analysis such as classical rhetoric."
Stockwell (2002): p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
but it also has a grounding in modern principles of [[cognitive linguistics]].

Topics addressed by cognitive poetics include [[deixis]]; text world theory (the feeling of immersion within texts); [[schema (psychology)|schema]], script, and their role in reading; attention; foregrounding; and [[genre]].

One of the main focal points of cognitive literary analysis is [[conceptual metaphor]], an idea pioneered and popularized by the works of [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]], as a tool for examining texts. Rather than regarding metaphors as ornamental [[figures of speech]], cognitive poetics examines how the conceptual bases of such metaphors interact with the text as a whole.

Prominent figures in the field include [[Reuven Tsur]], who is credited for originating the term,&lt;ref&gt;
"Reuven Tsur ... has run a cognitive poetics project since the early 1970s, long before the first publications in cognitive linguistics."
Gerard Steen and Joanna Gavins, "Contextualising cognitive poetics", in Gavins and Steen (2003): p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ronald Langacker]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], Gerard Steen, Joanna Gavins and Peter Stockwell. Although Tsur's original, "precise and particular" sense of the term ''poetics'' was related to his theory of "[[poetry]] and [[perception]]", it has come to be "more broadly applied" to any "theory" or "system" of the workings (Greek ''poiesis'') of literature of any genre.&lt;ref name=Stockwell2002p8 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7981">In [[information theory]], the '''computationally bounded adversary''' problem is a different way of looking at the problem of sending data over a noisy channel. In previous models the best that could be done was ensuring correct decoding for up to ''d''/2 errors, where d was the Hamming distance of the code. The problem with doing it this way is that it does not take into consideration the actual amount of computing power available to the adversary. Rather, it only concerns itself with how many bits of a given code word can change and still have the message decode properly. In the computationally bounded adversary model the channel – the [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]] – is restricted to only being able to perform a reasonable amount of computation to decide which bits of the code word need to change. In other words, this model does not need to consider how many errors can possibly be handled, but only how many errors could possibly be introduced given a reasonable amount of computing power on the part of the adversary. Once the channel has been given this restriction it becomes possible to construct codes that are both faster to encode and decode compared to previous methods that can also handle a large number of errors.

==Comparison to other models==

===Worst-case model===
At first glance, the [[worst-case complexity|worst-case model]] seems intuitively ideal. The guarantee that an algorithm will succeed no matter what is, of course, highly alluring. However, it demands too much. A real-life adversary cannot spend an indefinite amount of time examining a message in order to find the one error pattern which an algorithm would struggle with.

As a comparison, consider the [[Quicksort]] algorithm. In the worst-case scenario, Quicksort makes O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) comparisons; however, such an occurrence is rare. Quicksort almost invariably makes O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') comparisons instead, and even outperforms other algorithms which can guarantee O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') behavior. Let us suppose an adversary wishes to force the Quicksort algorithm to make O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) comparisons. Then he would have to search all of the ''n''! permutations of the input string and test the algorithm on each until he found the one for which the algorithm runs significantly slower. But since this would take O(''n''!) time, it is clearly infeasible for an adversary to do this. Similarly, it is unreasonable to assume an adversary for an encoding and decoding system would be able to test every single error pattern in order to find the most effective one.

===Stochastic noise model===
The stochastic noise model can be described as a kind of "dumb" noise model. That is to say that it does not have the adaptability to deal with "intelligent" threats. Even if the attacker is bounded it is still possible that they might be able to overcome the stochastic model with a bit of cleverness. The stochastic model has no real way to fight against this sort of attack and as such is unsuited to dealing with the kind of "intelligent" threats that would be preferable to have defenses against.
----
Therefore, a computationally bounded adversarial model has been proposed as a compromise between the two.&lt;ref name=lipton&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/worst-case-complexity/

 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forces one to consider that messages may be perverted in conscious, even malicious ways, but without forcing an algorithm designer to worry about rare cases which likely will never occur.

==Applications==

===Comparison to stochastic noise channel===
Since any computationally bounded adversary could in O(''n'') time flip a coin for each bit, it is intuitively clear that any encoding and decoding system which can work against this adversary must also work in the stochastic noise model. The converse is less simple; however, it can be shown that any system which works in the stochastic noise model can also efficiently encode and decode against a computationally bounded adversary, and only at an additional cost which is polynomial in ''n''.&lt;ref name=lipton /&gt; The following method to accomplish this was designed by Dick Lipton, and is taken from:&lt;ref name=lipton /&gt;
[[File:Illustration of Proof for Computationally Bounded Adversary.png|thumb|right|250px|alt=An illustration of the method. The first row gives the initial encoded message; the second, after random permutation and random R; the third, after the adversary adds N; the fourth, after unpermuting; the fifth, the encoded message with the adversary's error removed.|An illustration of the method. The first row gives the initial encoded message; the second, after random permutation and random R; the third, after the adversary adds N; the fourth, after unpermuting; the fifth, the encoded message with the adversary's error removed.]]
Let &lt;math&gt;E()&lt;/math&gt; be an encoder for the stochastic noise model and &lt;math&gt;D()&lt;/math&gt; be a simple decoder for the same, each of which runs in polynomial time. Furthermore, let both the sender and receiver share some random permutation function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and a random pattern &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

For encoding:
1. Let &lt;math&gt;X = E(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

2. Let &lt;math&gt; Y = \pi (X) \oplus R&lt;/math&gt;.

3. Transmit &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;

Then for decoding:
1. Receive &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt;. Compute &lt;math&gt;Z = \pi^{-1} (Y' \oplus R)&lt;/math&gt;.

2. Calculate &lt;math&gt;M = D(Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly to the Quicksort comparison above, if the channel wants to do something smart, it must first test all the permutations. However, this is infeasible for a computationally bounded adversary, so the most it can do is make a random error pattern &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt;. But then:

: &lt;math&gt; Z = \pi^{-1}(Y' \oplus R) = \pi^{-1} (Y \oplus N \oplus R), &lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;Y' = Y \oplus N&lt;/math&gt; by definition.

: &lt;math&gt;= \pi^{-1}(Y \oplus R) \oplus N' &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N' = \pi^{-1}(N),&lt;/math&gt;

since any permutation is linear with respect to XOR,

: &lt;math&gt;= X \oplus N',&lt;/math&gt;

as per the definition of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; above.

Since &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is random, &lt;math&gt;N'&lt;/math&gt; is just random noise and we can use the simple decoder to decode the received message and get back &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Specific applications==
By assuming a computationally bounded adversary, it is possibly to design a [[locally decodable code]] which is both efficient and near-optimal, with a negligible error probability. These codes are used in complexity theory for things like self-correcting computations, probabilistically checkable proof systems, and worst-case to average-case hardness reductions in the constructions of pseudo-random generators. They are useful in cryptography as a result of their connection with [[private information retrieval]] protocols. They are also in a number of database applications like [[fault-tolerant]] data storage.&lt;ref name=OPScodes&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/PUBLIC/80.pdf
 |title=Private Locally Decodable Codes
 |author=Ostrovsky, Pandey, Sahai
 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it is possible to construct codes which surpass known bounds for worst-case codes—specifically, unique decoding with a &lt;math&gt;1-R&lt;/math&gt; error rate.&lt;ref name=MPWSWoptErr&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/papers/2005/mpsw-full.pdf
 |title=Optimal Error Correction for Computationally Bounded Noise.
 |author1=Micali, Peikert |author2=Sudan, A. Wilson |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be done by concatenating timestamped digital signatures onto messages. A computationally bounded channel cannot forge a signature; and while it may have valid past signatures, the receiver can use [[list decoding]] and select a message only if its signature has the correct timestamp.

[[File:Drei Frauen am Pranger, China, Anonym, um 1875.jpg|thumb|right|Three women in the [[pillory]], [[Ching China|China]], 1875]]
'''Criminology''' (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|crīmen}}, "accusation" originally derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] verb "krino" "κρίνω", and Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logy|-logia'', from "logos" meaning: “word,” “reason,” or “plan”) is the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of the nature, extent, management, causes, control, consequences, and prevention of [[criminal behavior]], both on individual and social levels. Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[social science]]s, drawing especially upon the research of [[sociology|sociologists]], [[psychology|psychologists]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[social anthropology|social anthropologists]], as well as scholars of law.

The term ''criminology'' was coined in 1885 by Italian law professor [[Raffaele Garofalo]] as ''[[:it:Criminologia|criminologia]].'' Later, French anthropologist [[Paul Topinard]] used the analogous French term ''[[:fr:Criminologie|criminologie]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociological Theory and Criminological Research: Views from Europe and the United States |page=279 |editor=Deflem, Mathieu |isbn=978-0-7623-1322-8 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States for the past 100 years, criminology has experienced three life course phases : (1) Golden Age of Research (1900-1930) which has been described as multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930-1960) which shows that they were no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory, and 1960-2000 period as seen as a significant turning point for criminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=J.|date=2000-03-01|title=The New Regulatory State and the Transformation of Criminology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/40/2/222/611103?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=222–238|doi=10.1093/bjc/40.2.222|issn=0007-0955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminological Schools of thought==
In the mid-18th century, criminology arose as [[social philosophy|social philosophers]] gave thought to crime and concepts of law. Over time, several schools of thought have developed. There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical]], [[Positivist school (criminology)|Positivist]], and [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago]]. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, labeling, [[critical criminology]], [[cultural criminology]], [[Postmodernist school (criminology)|postmodern criminology]], [[Feminist school of criminology|feminist criminology]] and others discussed below.

===Classical school===
{{POV|date=January 2013}}
The [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical school]] arose in the mid-18th century and has its basis in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosophy. [[Cesare Beccaria]],&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Beccaria, Cesare |title=On Crimes and Punishments, and Other Writings |year=1764 |page=64 |translator=Richard Davies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1763–64), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (inventor of the ''[[panopticon]]''), and other philosophers in this school argued:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# People have [[free will]] to choose how to act.
# The basis for deterrence is the idea humans are '[[Hedonism|hedonists]]' who seek pleasure and avoid pain, and 'rational calculators' who weigh the costs and benefits of every action. It ignores the possibility of [[irrationality]] and unconscious drives as motivators.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
# [[Punishment]] (of sufficient severity) can deter people from crime, as the costs (penalties) outweigh benefits, and severity of punishment should be proportionate to the crime.&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"/&gt;
# The more swift and certain the punishment, the more effective as a deterrent to criminal behavior.
This school developed during a major reform in [[penology]], when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms, the [[French Revolution]], and the development of the [[Law of the United States|legal system in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Positivist school===
The [[Positivist school]] argues criminal behavior comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: [[Positivist school (criminology)#Biological positivism|biological]], [[Positivist school (criminology)#Psychological postivism|psychological]] and [[social positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;David, Christian Carsten. "Criminology - Crime." Cybercrime. Northamptonshire (UK), 5 June 1972.

====Italian school====
[[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called "the father of [[criminal anthropology|criminology]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227053359/http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |archivedate=27 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the [[Italian school of criminology]].&lt;ref name="siegel-p7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Siegel, Larry J. |title=Criminology, 8th edition |year=2003 |publisher= Thomson-Wadsworth |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crime and Society: Readings in History and Theory |isbn=978-0-415-02755-7 |author1=McLennan, Gregor |author2=Jennie Pawson |author3=Mike Fitzgerald |publisher= Routledge |page=311 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheek bones or hairline, or a cleft palate could indicate "[[atavism|atavistic]]" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of [[phrenology]] and by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], has been superseded. [[Enrico Ferri]], a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories, since [[control group]]s were not used in his studies.&lt;ref name="siegel-p139"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociological positivism====
[[Sociological positivism]] suggests societal factors such as [[poverty]], membership of subcultures, or low levels of education predispose people to crime. [[Adolphe Quetelet]] used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors. He found age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/228630 |title=Adolphe Quetelet and the Origins of Positivist Criminology |author=Beirne, Piers |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=92 |date=March 1987 |pages=1140–1169 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments, each one proving education reduces crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lochner|first=Lance|title=The American Economic Review|journal=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|volume=94|pages=155–189|doi=10.1257/000282804322970751|year=2004|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4mf8k11n|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rawson W. Rawson]] used [[crime statistics]] to suggest a link between [[population density]] and [[crime rate]]s, with crowded cities producing more crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hayward, Keith J. |title=City Limits: Crime, Consumerism and the Urban Experience |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-904385-03-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Fletcher (statistician)|Joseph Fletcher]] and John Glyde read papers to the [[Statistical Society of London]] on their studies of crime and its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Garland, David |chapter=Of Crimes and Criminals |page=21 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Criminology, 3rd edition |editor=Maguire, Mike |editor2=Rod Morgan |editor3=Robert Reiner |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Mayhew]] used [[empirical]] methods and an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] approach to address social questions and poverty, and gave his studies in ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25 |title=Henry Mayhew: London Labour and the London Poor |publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160854/http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25/ |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people.

====Differential association (subcultural)====
People learn crime through [[Differential association|association]]. This theory was advocated by [[Edwin Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deviance: A Symbolic Interactionist Approach|last=Herman|first=Nancy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1995|isbn=978-1882289387|location=Michigan|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances. Interacting with [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] peers is a major cause. Reinforcing criminal behavior makes it chronic. Where there are criminal [[subcultures]], many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ferracuti|title=Criminological Theory Summaries|url=http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|publisher=Cullen &amp; Agnew|accessdate=3 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131020192418/http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago school===
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess]], and other [[urban sociology|urban sociologists]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  In the 1920s, Park and Burgess identified five [[Concentric ring model|concentric zones]] that often exist as cities grow, including the "[[zone of transition]]", which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder.  In the 1940s, [[Harry McKay|Henry McKay]] and Clifford R. Shaw focused on [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]], finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition.

Chicago school sociologists adopted a [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience breakdown in the [[social structure]] and [[institution]]s such as family and schools.  This results in [[social disorganization]], which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]].

Other researchers suggested an added social-psychological link.  [[Edwin Sutherland]] suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals with whom they may associate.

Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include [[psychoanalysis]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[interactionism]], [[Marxism]], [[econometrics]], [[systems theory]], [[postmodernism]], [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], etc.

===Social structure theories===
This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a [[conflict theory]] or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime. As this perspective is itself broad enough, embracing as it does a diversity of positions.&lt;ref&gt;Hester, S., Eglin, P. 1992, ''A Sociology of Crime'', London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social disorganization (neighborhoods)====
[[Social disorganization theory]] is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shaw, Clifford R.  |author2=McKay, Henry D. |title=Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1942 |isbn=978-0-226-75125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of [[population turnover]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Disorganization and Theories of Crime and Delinquency: Problems and Prospects |author1=Bursik Jr. |author2=Robert J. |journal=Criminology |year=1988 |volume=26 |pages=519–539 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1988.tb00854.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, ‘subcultures’ or ‘gangs’. These groups have different values to the [[social norm]]. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population [[Heterogeneous|heterogeneity]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt; With high turnover, informal [[social structure]] often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain [[social order]] in a community.

====Social ecology====
Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.  Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morenoff, Jeffrey |author2=Robert Sampson |author3=Stephen Raudenbush |title=Neighborhood Inequality, Collective Efficacy and the Spatial Dynamics of Urban Violence |journal=Criminology |volume=39 |year=2001 |pages=517–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2001.tb00932.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[working class|working]] and [[Middle class|middle-class]] people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. [[William Julius Wilson]] suggested a poverty "concentration effect", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Larry|title=Criminology: Theories, Patterns, and Typologies|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1305446090|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strain theory (social strain theory)====
{{Main|Strain theory (sociology)}}
Strain theory, also known as Mertonian Anomie, advanced by American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the ''[[American Dream]]''. Most people buy into this dream, and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivator. Merton also used the term ''[[anomie]]'', but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]].  Merton saw the term as meaning a [[dichotomy]] between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve.  Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] subcultures (such as [[Gang|gang members]], or what he calls "[[hobo]]s"). [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]] developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as [[general strain theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merton, Robert |year=1957 |title=Social Theory and Social Structure |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-02-921130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory'''

''Main article: Messner and Institutional Anomie Theory''

The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory stems from a pre-existing theory, discovered by Merton named Strain theory. Rosenberger took his findings and offered a different approach to definition and based it on the assumption that everybody should already have "the assumption that the “American Dream” produces a society that is dominated by the economy and obsessed with the pursuit of success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberger|first=Jared|date=October 2016|title=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=a46dc574-3755-410e-8199-998554e3b4a9%40sdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116344296&amp;db=sih|journal=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|volume= 49|pages=305–325. 21p|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory has many different views and definitions by many people therefore this becomes a very flexible theory.

Larine Hughes found a correlation between economic pressure and how it combines the "American Dream" and "Individualism" to a high crime. Hughes came to  final decision that "Therefore, individuals that do not have the drive to succeed and achieve this “goal”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Lorine|date=2015|title=Economic Dominance, the "American Dream," and Homicide:|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f60096cd-f6eb-4b62-b63c-18b30345ebe9%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100487344&amp;db=sih|journal=A Cross-National Test of Institutional Anomie Theory|volume= 85|pages=p. 100–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will fail, despite social and cultural pressures.

Samantha Applin, then took an approached relating genders and The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory. Stated in an article by S. Applin, "males make up what is considered “normal subjects”, and due to this, force woman to lie on a boundary that expectation is outside the dominant cultural frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samantha|first=Applin|date=April 2014|title=Her American Dream|url=https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1557085114525654|journal=Bringing Gender Into Institutional-Anomie Theory|volume= 10|pages= 36–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, setting women back in the beginning stages of Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory.

Brian Stults began to research studies on the violence between youth and the correlation that it  has on Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory. Stults found sated " As well as the results showed graduating high school represents an important developmental stage in American society, as it ends the compulsory education, and is often followed by a significant decline in daily need and extra resources from your parents."

====Subcultural theory====
{{Main|Subcultural theory}}
Following the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and strain theory, and also drawing on [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s idea of [[differential association]], subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups [[Fragmentation (sociology)|fragmenting]] away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life.

[[Albert K. Cohen]] tied anomie theory with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[reaction formation]] idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cohen, Albert |title=Delinquent Boys |publisher=Free Press |year=1955 |isbn=978-0-02-905770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include "toughness" and disrespect for authority.  Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kornhauser, R. |year=1978 |title=Social Sources of Delinquency |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-45113-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]] suggested that delinquency can result from a differential opportunity for lower class youth.&lt;ref name="cloward"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cloward, Richard, Lloyd Ohlin |title=Delinquency and Opportunity |publisher=Free Press |year=1960 |isbn=978-0-02-905590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as [[minimum wage]]-paying jobs available to them.&lt;ref name="cloward"/&gt;

Delinquency tends to occur among the lower working-class males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas, as mentioned extensively by Albert Cohen (Cohen, 1965). Bias has been known to occur among law enforcement agencies, where officers tend to place bias on minority groups, without knowing for sure if they had committed a crime or not. Delinquents may also commit crimes in order to secure funds for themselves or their loved ones, such as committing an armed robbery, as studied by many scholars (Briar &amp; Piliavin).

British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of [[Social class|class]], where some criminal activities were seen as "imaginary solutions" to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults.

Sociologists such as [[Raymond Gastil|Raymond D. Gastil]] have explored the impact of a [[Southern culture of honor]] on violent crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond D. Gastil, "Homicide and a Regional Culture of Violence," American Sociological Review 36 (1971): 412-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control theories====
Another approach is made by the social bond or [[social control theory]]. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do ''not'' become criminal. [[Travis Hirschi]] identified four main characteristics: "attachment to others", "belief in moral validity of rules", "commitment to achievement", and "involvement in conventional activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirschi, Travis |title=Causes of Delinquency |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-7658-0900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal).  On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low [[self control]] is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A General Theory of Crime |author=[[Michael R. Gottfredson|Gottfredson, Michael R.]], [[Travis Hirschi|Hirschi, Travis]] |year=1990 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one.  If the person cannot exert self-control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms.

Social bonds, through [[Peer group|peers]], parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control.  For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children, from those who are not delinquent, is the control exerted by parents or [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson, Harriet |title=Parental Supervision: A Neglected Aspect of Delinquency |year=1980 |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, theorists such as [[David Matza]] and [[Gresham Sykes]] argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social behavioral constraints through [[techniques of neutralization]].

====Psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for punishment====
Psychoanalysis is the system of psychological theory and therapy looking towards the investigation of the conscious and unconscious mind elements, along with repressed memories that can be taken back into consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Broadview Editions|year=2011|isbn=|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his novel, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' which was interpreted by Hubback.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freud looks into research indicating a ‘repetition compulsion’ and a ‘death drive’ which is the unconscious impulse that one may get to become self-destructive and actually have the ability to take over the creativity drive within someone. Phillida Rosnick, author of the article ''Mental Pain and Social Trauma,'' looks into the mental state of someone who has experienced extreme trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosnick|first=Phillida|date=2017|title=Mental Pain and Social Trauma|url=|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=94(6)|pages=1200–1202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They discovered there is a difference in the actions and thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain and this corresponds to them having thoughts and feelings that are unlike their normal selves. By looking at the unconscious within a paranoid state of mind from trauma, there is a direct correlation to how this behavior can cause criminals to act in deviant ways based on their brain structure and how their unconscious is taking information. Sander Gilman, the author of the article ''Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis'', actually looks into the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system relating to the impulses that someone might feel and the impulses that might cause someone to unconsciously desire pain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilman|first=Sander|date=2008|title=Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/docview/199033499?accountid=28917|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|pages=1799–1800|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman speaks to Freud’s position on the various issues of the mind and the potential discovery from looking at the brain and interpreting data about the unconscious mind and the Eros within the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By looking at how psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for pain relate to each other, there is more evidence as to how it can occur within criminals and how these impulses or the innate desires within an individual can ultimately be the cause of deviant acts.

==Social network analysis==
{{main|Social network analysis (criminology)}}

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism draws on the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], as well as [[subcultural theory]] and [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mead, George Herbert |title=Mind Self and Society |year=1934 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought focused on the relationship between state, media, and conservative-ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the "significant other" in the less powerful groups' processes of generating [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to "label" minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take the label on board, indulge in crime more readily, and become [[Free will|actors]] in the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] and [[Edwin Lemert]], in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Becker, Howard |title=Outsiders |publisher=Free Press |year=1963 |isbn=978-0-684-83635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] developed the concept of "[[moral panic]]" describing societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena (e.g. post-World War 2 youth cultures like the [[Mods and Rockers]] in the UK in 1964, [[AIDS epidemic]] and [[football hooliganism]]).

==== Labeling theory ====
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
Labelling theory refers to an individual who is labelled in a particular way and was studied in great detail by Becker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slattery|first=Martin|title=Key Ideas In Sociology|year=2003|publisher=Nelson Thornes|pages=154+}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arrives originally from sociology but is regularly used in criminological studies. It is said that when someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime. Even those who initially reject the label can eventually accept it as the label becomes more well known, particularly among their peers. This stigma can become even more profound when the labels are about deviancy, and it is thought that this stigmatization can lead to [[Deviancy amplification spiral|deviancy amplification]]. [[Malcolm W. Klein|Malcolm Klein]] conducted a test which showed that labelling theory affected some youth offenders but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelin|first=Malcolm|journal=Criminal Justice &amp; Behaviour|date=March 1986|volume=13|pages=47–79|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0093854886013001004|title=Labeling Theory and Delinquency Policy: An Experimental Test|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061209/http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|archivedate=14 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual theories===
[[File:Keyhoe sign.jpg|thumb|right|The self-assessment of the perpetrator of the [[Bath School disaster]] ]]

====Traitor theories====
At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist [[Lonnie Athens]] developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. [[Richard Rhodes]]' ''Why They Kill'' describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  Rhodes| first =  Richard| title = Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist| publisher = Vintage| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-375-40249-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rational choice theory====
{{Main|Rational choice theory (criminology)}}
[[File:Cesare Beccaria 1738-1794.jpg|thumb|180px|Cesare Beccaria]]
Rational choice theory is based on the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], classical school philosophies of [[Cesare Beccaria]], which were popularized by [[Jeremy Bentham]].  They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender. In ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'' (On Crimes and Punishments, 1763–1764), Beccaria advocated a rational [[penology]]. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime; thus, the judge was simply to conform his or her sentence to the law. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and [[sin]], and advocated against the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], as well as [[torture]] and inhumane treatments, as he did not consider them as rational deterrents.

This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s with the writings of [[James Q. Wilson]], [[Gary Becker]]'s 1965 article ''Crime and Punishment''&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker]], "Crime and Punishment", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol. 76 (2), March–April 1968, p.196-217&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Stigler]]'s 1970 article ''The Optimum Enforcement of Laws''.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler]], "The Optimum Enforcement of Laws", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol.78 (3), May–June 1970, p. 526–536&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theory argues that criminals, like other people, weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms.&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cornish, Derek |author2=Ronald V. Clarke |year=1986 |title=The Reasoning Criminal |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-96272-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors.&lt;ref name="cornish"/&gt;

Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing [[surveillance]], one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.

With this perspective, [[crime prevention]] or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as [[target hardening]].&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clarke, Ronald V. |year=1992 |title=Situational Crime Prevention |publisher=Harrow and Heston |isbn=978-1-881798-68-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, law enforcement presence, added street lighting, and other measures, are effective in reducing crime.&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"/&gt;

One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the [[panopticon]]), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which the measures required would cost the supermarket so much that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and [[classical liberalism]] have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable.

Such rational choice theories, linked to [[neoliberalism]], have been at the basics of [[crime prevention through environmental design]] and underpin the [[Market Reduction Approach]] to theft &lt;ref&gt;Sutton, M. Schneider, J. and Hetherington, S. (2001) Tackling Theft with the Market Reduction Approach. Crime Reduction Research Series paper 8. Home Office.

====Routine activity theory====
{{Main|Routine activity theory}}
Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Felson, Marcus |title=Crime and Everyday Life |year=1994 |publisher=Pine Forge |isbn=978-0-8039-9029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohen, Lawrence |author2=Marcus Felson |title=Social Change and Crime Rate Trends |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=44 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2094589 |pages=588–608 |issue=4 |jstor=2094589|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.3696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of "place manager" such as rental property managers who can take [[nuisance]] abatement measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reducing Crime and Drug Dealing by Improving Place Management: A Randomized Experiment |author1=Eck, John |author2=Julie Wartell |publisher=National Institute of Justice |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosocial theories===
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name=Asghate2011&gt;Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aggressive behavior]] has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: [[serotonin]] systems, [[catecholamine]] systems, and the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]]. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=WALTON K. G. |author2=LEVITSKY D. K. |date=2003 |title=Effects of the Transcendental Meditation program on neuroendocrine abnormalities associated with aggression and crime |journal=Journal of Offender Rehabilitation |volume=36 |issue=1–4 |pages=67–87 |pmc= |pmid= |issn= |doi=10.1300/J076v36n01_04 |quote= |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist criminology===
{{Main|Marxist criminology}}
In 1968, young British sociologists formed the [[National Deviancy Symposium|National Deviance Conference]] (NDC) group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. [[Ian Taylor (sociologist)|Ian Taylor]], Paul Walton and [[Jock Young]] – members of the NDC – rejected previous explanations of crime and deviance. Thus, they decided to pursue a new Marxist criminological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The New Criminology'', they argued against the biological "positivism" perspective represented by Lombroso, [[Hans Eysenck]] and Gordon Trasler.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Marxist perspective on crime, "defiance is normal – the sense that men are now consciously involved [...] in assuring their human diversity." Thus Marxists criminologists argued in support of society in which the facts of human diversity, be it social or personal, would not be criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 170 - 171&lt;/ref&gt; They further attributed the processes of crime creation not to genetic or psychological facts, but rather to the material basis of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Charles, C. W. G. Jasperse, K. A. van Leeuwen-Burow. "Criminology Between the Rule of Law and the Outlaws." (1976). Deventer: Kluwer D.V. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convict Criminology===
Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of criminology. Convict criminologists have been directly affected by the [[criminal justice system]], oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminology such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional criminology can better be understood by those who lived in the walls of a prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Stephen C.|last2=Ross|first2=Jeffrey Ian|date=2001|title=Introducing the New School of Convict Criminology|jstor=29768063|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=177–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Leyva argues that "prisonization" oftentimes begins before prison, in the home, community, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leyva|first=Martin|last2=Bickel|first2=Christopher|date=2010|title=From Corrections to College: The Value of a Convict's Voice|url=http://convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|journal=Western Criminology Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=50–60|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809135344/http://www.convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queer Criminology===
Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on [[LGBT]] individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The goals of this field of study are as follows:
* To better understand the history of LGBT individuals and the laws put against the community
* Why LGBT citizens are incarcerated and if or why they are arrested at higher rates than heterosexual and [[cisgender]] individuals
* How queer activists have fought against oppressive laws that criminalized LGBT individuals
* To conduct research and use it as a form of activism through education

====Legitimacy====
The value of pursuing criminology from a queer theorist perspective is contested; some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole, and as a result is a subject that lacks a wide berth of research available. On the other hand, it could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to “queer” the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT communities to liberating and protecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Matthew. "Queer Criminology as Activism." Critical Criminology 24.4 (2016): 473-87. Web. 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and definitions of crime==
Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.  Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon. However, there are two types of laws:
*[[Natural law]]s are rooted in core values shared by many cultures. Natural laws protect against harm to persons (e.g. murder, rape, assault) or property (theft, larceny, robbery), and form the basis of [[common law]] systems.
* [[Statutory law|Statutes]] are enacted by legislatures and reflect current cultural [[mores]], albeit that some laws may be controversial, e.g. laws that prohibit [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use and gambling. Marxist criminology, conflict criminology and critical criminology claim that most relationships between [[state (polity)|state]] and citizen are non-consensual and, as such, [[criminal law]] is not necessarily representative of public beliefs and wishes: it is exercised in the interests of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] or dominant class.  The more right-wing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual [[social contract]] between state and citizen.

Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural norms and mores, but may be broadly classified as [[blue-collar crime]], [[corporate crime]], [[organized crime]], [[political crime]], [[public order crime]], [[state crime]], [[state-corporate crime]], and [[white-collar crime]].&lt;ref&gt;"Attack the System » Crime and Conflict Theory."

'''Critical terrorism studies''' ('''CTS''') applies a [[critical theory]] approach rooted in [[counter-hegemonic]] and politically progressive critical theory to the study of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21"&gt;Jackson, R., Jarvis, L., Gunning, J., &amp; Breen-Smyth, M. (2011). Terrorism: A critical introduction. London, UK: Palgrave Macmillian&lt;/ref&gt; With links to the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory and the [[Aberystwyth School]] of critical security studies, CTS seeks to understand terrorism as a [[social construction]], or a label, that is applied to certain violent acts through a range of political, legal and academic processes.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It also seeks to understand and critique dominant forms of counter-terrorism.

== Description ==

Following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]; there has been a massive increase in research related to terrorism. Terrorism has become one of the most powerful signifiers in contemporary society with the term generating vast amounts of social and political activity.  It has also become a cultural taboo which invokes emotions – fear and hatred.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35"&gt;Smyth, M.B., Gunning, J., Jackson, R. Kassimeris, G. &amp; Robinson, P. (2008). "Critical terrorism studies – an introduction". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 1(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS takes issue with previous terrorism studies in what it perceives as having methodological and analytical weaknesses, including a reliance on poor research methods and procedures, an overreliance on secondary resources, and a failure to undertake primary research; a failure to come up with an accepted definition of terrorism, and an inability to be cross-disciplinary. According to Jeroen Gunning: "core epistemological, methodological and political-normative problems persist, ranging from lack of conceptual clarity and theoretical sterility to political bias and a continuing dearth of primary research data".&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"&gt;Gunning, J. (2007a). A case for critical terrorism studies? Government and opposition, 42(3), pp. 363-393.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS is a response to these research problems. With its origins in the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the Welsh School of critical security studies (in which the primary referent to be secured is individuals not states), CTS is a self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism which challenges the ontological, epistemological and ideological commitments of mainstream terrorism scholars.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS also looks to attract academics from other disciplines who are uncomfortable with the mainstream discourse around terrorism and looks to engage directly with those who are perceived as 'terrorists' and/or terrorist sympathisers.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

CTS aims to approach terrorism studies from a critical angle, that is, to encourage and further the adoption of a more self-consciously critical approach to the study of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"&gt;Jackson, R., Breen Smyth, M., &amp; Gunning, J. (Eds.).(2009). Critical terrorism studies: A new research agenda. Abingdon, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; However CTS does not only criticise the state of terrorism studies, it also attempts to "suggest an alternative way of studying terrorism and a concrete research agenda for the future".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; While critical approaches to the study of terrorism are not new,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt; previous efforts have often occurred outside of the terrorism studies field. Such as the critical approach that some anthropology scholars have taken. These alternative approaches have "had little cross-fertilization with the orthodox field and have largely failed to alter its practices, priorities, approaches, outputs and myths".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS seeks to engage directly with the orthodox field,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; and question its normative assumptions. Prompted by the growing unease over the state of current terrorism research, and the relationship between much orthodox terrorism research and the institutions of state power, CTS sets out to "stimulate, encourage, and more clearly articulate the nascent but observable 'critical turn' that was starting to become visible within the broader terrorism studies field".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt;

CTS scholars argue that terrorism should be de-exceptionalised as a form of political violence, not singled out as a unique form of "evil" violence, but  should be treated as other forms of political violence are.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS also encourages researchers to engage with terrorists as humans, and not form explanations of terrorists in an [[Other (philosophy)|'Othering']] sense.&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"/&gt; Therefore; "Ultimately, a critical approach to terrorism suggests that more positive and progressive change is always possible and that we can break out of seemingly endless cycles of terrorist/counter-terrorist violence, if only we can begin to think, study, speak and act outside of the dominant terrorism paradigm."&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

== History ==

CTS's antecedents lie with scholars such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], who published critical works relating to the state and terrorism from the late 1970s. One of the first major works that gave impetus to a CTS discourse was [[Joseba Zulaika]] and William Douglass's&lt;ref name=" Zulaika 43 "&gt;Zulaika, J., (2012). "Drones, Witches and other Flying Objects: the Force of Fantasy in US Counterterrorism". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 5(1), 51-68&lt;/ref&gt; seminal work, ''Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism''. This book was a critical appraisal of  many of the international community's commonly-held assumptions about terrorism. A further catalyst for CTS came from Richard Jackson's 2005 book, ''Writing the War on Terrorism''. Jackson called for scholars to resist the current terrorism studies discourse: "I believe we have an ethical duty to resist the discourse, to deconstruct it at every opportunity and continually to interrogate the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2005) Writing the War on Terror: Language, politics and counter-terrorism. Manchester University Press, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the Critical Studies on Terrorism Working Group (CSTWG) within the [[British International Studies Association]] (BISA) occurred in early 2006, while in October 2006, a conference was held entitled; 'Is it time for a critical terrorism studies?' This was followed by two journal articles that called for a critical appraisal of the current state of terrorism studies. Richard Jackson's "Introduction: The Case for Critical Terrorism Studies" and Jeroen Gunning's "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies". In his "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies", Gunning calls for a critical approach that will "encourage researchers to historicize and contextualize the conflict by looking at the evolution of violence, broader processes of [[radicalization]], the relationship between violent organizations and wider social movements, and the relationship between social movements and the state."&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12" /&gt;

The setting up of the journal ''Critical Studies in Terrorism'' occurred in early 2007. The idea behind launching the journal was "one small part of a much broader attempt to foster a more self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism, and bring in those who study aspects of 'terrorism', but are uncomfortable with or hostile to the (perceived) [[Ontology|ontological]], [[Epistemology|epistemological]], and [[Ideology|ideological]] commitments of existing terrorism studies."&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS has continued to expand as a sub-discipline of terrorism studies and there has been a growth of CTS programs in universities such as [[Aberystwyth University]], the [[University of Kent]] and the [[University of Manchester]]. Other courses also exist within peace studies and politics programmes in universities such as [[Otago University]], [[Durham University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Virginia Tech]], [[University of Florida]], and [[Queens University Belfast]]. A major milestone in CTS will be the ''Handbook of Critical Terrorism Studies'' due to be published by [[Routledge]] in 2015.

== Ontological and epistemological foundations ==

===Two ontological critical theories===
* Critical realism: Observer and observed, or subject and object, are distinctly separate (For a clear alternative discussion on critical realism and CTS, see: Stump and Dixit 2013, 2011). 
* [[Reflectivism]]: Observer and observed or subject and object are deeply interconnected (For a more reflective discourse see: Jackson, Javis, Gunning, Smyth 2009&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;).
There has been a huge amount of academic discussion about the [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of critical terrorism studies. Within CTS, there is a broad agreement on the need to examine terrorism and terrorists from a historical, contextualized perspective asking 'how' questions of causation and constitution, rather than the more orthodox problem solving questions of a single isolated event. For instance, CTS questions why a terrorist action happens, asking whether the terrorists simply hate western notions of freedom, or whether they have deeper underlying political motivations?  CTS adopts the ontological position that "terrorism" is fundamentally a social fact rather than brute fact.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Epistemological perspective===
* Critical realism: best approximation to objective world.
* [[Reflexivism]]: tool for inducing self-reflection of individuals and groups. Not static and monolithic.
CTS adopts the epistemological position that the nature of knowledge in terrorism studies is a social process which relies on contextual factors, including the influence of the researcher. CTS scholars argue that by being continuously aware of context, social processes, and the 'known' and 'unknown' knowledge in circulation, you can gain further insights into the study of terrorism. CTS also acknowledges the link between power and knowledge, and who research is ultimately for.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Overview of research areas===
* With the focus on epistemological understanding, it is now possible to question how we receive knowledge and who it benefits and why. 
* Examining the constructed information flow produced through academic research, basic education, political rhetoric, state and international law, and media. Reframing the discourse through a reflexive epistemology. 
* Human security over state security/national security. Move away from state-centric policies on security, to focusing on people and liberty.
* [[Emancipation]]: whose voice is marginalized or silenced, whose voice is empowered in defining terrorism, and what should the response to it be in particular contexts?&lt;ref name="McDonald 25"&gt;McDonald, M., 2007. Emancipation and critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 252–259.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender: the misconception that typically women are seen as victims of political violence and men as perpetrators.
* Gendering serves to maintain gender hierarchy and reinforces essentialist stereotypes of women as peaceful and powerless.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Reframing women's interaction with terrorism and violence.
* Study of political terror (violence), state terrorism, structural violence and cultural violence.
* Exploring the extent to which the status quo contributes to the problem of terrorism.    "Whom defines terrorism?  Whom defines terrorist? Whom defines the dominant response?".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; 
* [[State terrorism]] and [[counter-terrorism]]: creating the conditions of oppositional violence. To analyse the way traditional terrorism discourse is used to discredit oppositional groups and justify state policies. The applying of historical materialist approaches to systematic research of state terrorism has started to be critically assessed by [[Michael Stohl]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Richard Jackson (sociologist)|Richard Jackson]], [[Ruth Blakeley]] and others.

== Major differences from orthodox terrorism studies ==

CTS differs from [[:wikt:orthodox|orthodox]]/traditional terrorism studies (OTS) in several fundamental ways. Some of the most significant points of difference include its emphasis on the utilization of [[critical theory]] in research, its focus on removing the bias of [[ethnocentrism]] from all research, its goal to facilitate the spread of [[emancipation]] of peoples previously marginalized in traditional terrorism studies, and its attempt to avoid political bias and a problem-solving policy-orientation.

===Utilization of critical theory===
Scholars created CTS in response to what they felt was missing from traditional terrorism studies, namely, the critical aspect of research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; Employing critical thinking in terrorism research can mean employing any one of several existing critical theories (such as [[Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s [[post-structuralism]], or [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]]'s [[structuralism]], etc.) But, in a broader sense, it simply means researching and writing to challenge commonly held social, political, and personal beliefs about terrorism that often go unchallenged (specifically in traditional terrorism studies).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R., 2007a. "Symposium: Introduction: the case for critical terrorism studies". ''European Political Science'', 6 (3), 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt; OTS scholars agree that critical thinking and the utilization of critical theory should be a prominent aspect of any valuable research.&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, M., ed., 2006. ''Mapping terrorism research: state of the art, gaps and future directions''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rengger, N. and Thirkell-White, B., 2007. "Still critical after all these years? The past, present and future of critical theory in international relations". ''Review of International Studies'', 33, 3–24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also feel that such research already exists within the field of terrorism studies and that CTS is bringing more of a critical eye to the field, but that there is no cause for it to be a whole separate sub-field.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; However, unlike traditional terrorism studies, CTS is strict on its adherence to the critical element of research, as it believes critical analysis is one of the few ways to overcome the problematic gaps within traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17"&gt;Jackson, R., 2007b. The core commitments of critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 244–251.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS also hopes that the critical element will also eventually bridge the traditional and critical approaches, if both begin to follow the research procedures that allow critical analysis.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Removing ethnocentrism===
CTS attempts to combat what they feel is a prevalent state-centricity and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]] in traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J., 2006. Overblown: how politicians and the terrorism industry inflate national security threats and why we believe them. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent scholars Jackson, Gunning and Smyth claim that since most research on terrorism is done by [[state-sponsored]] scholars and experts, there is a disproportionate amount of research articulating states' perspectives and experiences (namely western state-actors), leaving almost all non-state actors without any fair, unbiased representation in the research field.&lt;ref name="Silke 33"&gt;Silke, A., ed., 2004. Research on terrorism: trends, achievements and failures. London: Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, CTS challenges state-centric or ethnocentric research by responding directly to already published research, finding holes and gaps in the arguments,&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; and by completing new research that challenges ethnocentric claims and provides new claims from the perspective of non-state entities, and specifically, the perspectives of the so-labeled 'terrorists' themselves.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; OTS scholars see this shift from so-called "[[state centrism]]" as obvious and not wholly necessary. Bias is unavoidable and viewing it as such has the possibility to weaken arguments already made.&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Also, there is not a complete lack of ethnocentric-free research within terrorism studies and therefore CTS is seen as simply creating a bifurcation between the subfields.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Despite this criticism, CTS remains determined to conduct research free from state-centric and ethnocentric perspectives, opening space for new perspectives and discourses that may have been overlooked by terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Facilitating the spread of emancipation===
When referring to the [[emancipation|emancipatory]] nature of research, CTS is referring not only to the emancipation of previously marginalized peoples' voices in the field of OTS, but the emancipation of ideas, questions and theories that have been marginalized, overlooked, or seen as non-issues in orthodox studies. A simple way to understand CTS's emancipation is to think of it as a process of creating space and discussion that allows the focus to be on experiences, ideas and questions which have been "neglected in most orthodox accounts of security and terrorism".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; The emancipation of ideas, dialogue, and experience is a powerful "philosophical anchorage"&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; that allows CTS to separate itself and its motives from that of traditional and orthodox terrorism studies. Traditional terrorism studies theorists understand the value behind the idea of emancipatory nature of CTS's research, but many feel such a claim is overstated.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15"&gt;Horgan, J. &amp; Boyle, M. J., (2008). A case against 'Critical Terrorism Studies', Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 51-64, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701848225.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS's claim of emancipation is seen as simply reinventing the wheel, a wheel that has been working effectively for orthodox scholars for decades. And the claim&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; to be the first in a field as politically charged and somewhat emotionally delicate as terrorism studies to ask hard questions and challenge commonly held beliefs and assumptions is seen as a gross over-simplification and generalization that risks replacing one dominant discourse with another, and in turn,  marginalizing the research and voices of traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, J., 2007. The rise and rise of terrorism studies. The Guardian, 3 July.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite traditional terrorism studies' negative response to CTS's emancipatory claim, CTS still strives to keep emancipation as one of its core motivations for continued research.&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; Emancipatory research in terrorism studies can bring to light overlooked perspectives such as the war in Iraq being a form of occupation bringing more violence than peace,&lt;ref&gt;Fontan, V., 2006. Polarization between occupier and occupied in post-Saddam Iraq: humiliation and the formation of political violence. Terrorism and Political Violence, 18, 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that State sponsored research is often biased and unreliable&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; and that any and all valuable research should be conducted free of political bias to truly increase understanding.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; These few listed ideas are examples of what CTS hopes to bring to the field of terrorism studies through emancipatory research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

===Freedom from policy===
One of the largest voids of orthodox terrorism studies CTS aims to fill is the void of politically neutral and policy-free research and ideas.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; Post-9/11, almost all research on terrorism has been sponsored and conducted by [[state-actors]], many standing to gain politically from the conclusions drawn from such research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5"&gt;Burnett, J. &amp; Whyte, D. (2005). Embedded expertise and the new terrorism. Journal for Crime, Conflict and the Media, 1(4), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS feels that the prominent discourse maintained by State-sponsored terrorism research contributes to the justification of [[state terrorism]] and de-legitimizes any argument that would challenge or condemn such actions.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34"&gt;Sluka, J., 2000. "Introduction: State terror and anthropology" in J. Sluka, ed. ''Death squad: The anthropology of state terror''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when research is sponsored for political reasons, the 'experts' become not those who have the most relevant experience, but those who are willing to support whatever political view that will result in more funding, and those who are willing to adhere to any current policy around terrorism (e.g. "Our country does not negotiate with terrorists" therefore all research reflects the impossibility of negotiating with terrorist).&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, C., 2006. In the name of terrorism: presidents on political violence in the post-World War II era. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox terrorism studies researchers see the idea of political and policy neutral research as a nice sentiment, but impossible to execute.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; Many have criticized CTS for claiming policy free and politically neutral research, as even the word terrorism itself is not free of any political meaning and connotation.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; And since many scholars study and research the causes, effects, and nature of terrorism because of passionate ideas and interests, it would be irresponsible to assert that simply because a piece of research is free of state centricism and bias that it is automatically politically neutral.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; Again, traditional terrorism studies sees CTS's research attempts as oversimplifications to claim innovation in an already established field.

However, CTS sees the criticism from orthodox scholars as extenuating the need for there to be more than one avenue of academic discourse available.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; By aiming to keep all research politically neutral and policy free, a space opens up for experts with non-state experience to enter a field which was previously unavailable to them.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; And again, politically neutral scholars are more able to bring to attention and help fight acts of state terrorism that are often overlooked and even justified in orthodox studies.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34" /&gt;

===Traditional terrorism studies' response===
CTS's new approach and perspective has been widely welcomed in the field of terrorism studies. Nevertheless, it has  been subject to criticism for its desire to distinguish itself from what it deems "traditional" or "orthodox" terrorism studies, and for its claim of maintaining absolute political neutrality. However, scholars both from critical and traditional terrorism studies remain determined not to allow any distinction between the subfields to cause bifurcation and incompatibility within the field of research itself.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;

== CTS's main critiques of traditional terrorism studies ==

CTS would not have come into existence unless scholars saw the need for a change in many of the perspectives within terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Some of the most common criticisms CTS consistently presents including the inconsistent 'definition' of terrorism, the political power held by most Orthodox scholars, the ineffectiveness of the War on Terror, the glorification of patriotism, and the demonising narrative of the 'enemy'.

===Definitions of terrorism===
The term "terrorism" gained prominence during the [[French Revolution]] when it was used by the Jacobins to kill known supporters of the [[Ancien Régime]], and to eliminate those labeled enemies of the revolution.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40"&gt;Wilkinson, P. (2012). "The Utility of the Concept of Terrorism" in R. Jackson and S. J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Contemporary Debates on Terrorism'', Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the state was the first proponent of using terrorism as a political tool.&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, M. (2008). Old myths, new fantasies and the enduring realities of terrorism, Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 5-16, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701846443.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the twentieth century, the regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] and Soviet Russia, through the use of secret police, used tension to subdue and kill those deemed enemies of the state. Further, a number of Latin American states backed by the US utilised state-terrorism to silence the population and consolidate their control – Chile and Nicaragua in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, J. (1994). ''Distant Voices'' (rev. ed.). London: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until this point, terrorism was largely, though not exclusively, defined by its use by state. And it was not until later that academic circles shifted the focus to non-state actors.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; There is research to suggest that states that have witnessed severe upheaval throughout their history will utilise state-terrorism. Such as Iraq, Syria, Israel, Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Myanmar, Indonesia, Serbia and Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; Furthermore, for weak states, state terrorism is often viewed as a legitimate total state consolidation.

Terrorism therefore has a number of meanings and interpretations that we can use to assess terrorist acts in the contemporary era. Terrorism is a heavily contested concept and it is the context in which a violent act occurs as to how people define the act. It is symbolic violence, a communicative act, with the sole purpose to send the message. It is the psychological effect of using fear, as it is not the victims of a terrorist act. But the wider audience who are the target, because the victims become instrumental as they are the message carriers.

* Generic terrorism: "The systematic use of violence and intimidation to coerce a government or community, into acceding to specific political demands."&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, J., and Trumble, B., eds, (2006). Oxford Referencing Dictionary, 2nd ed., revised, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the use of or the threat of violence that is meant to intimidate a wider target than the immediate victims of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* Non-state terrorism: Involves attacks on civilians, symbolic and random targets and is usually, though not exclusively, aimed at bringing about political change.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* [[Religious terrorism]]: Political violence in the name of religion by religiously motivated people. A problematic term that is used to categorise terrorism and differentiate it from other forms of terrorism, by assuming there is a casual relationship between religion and violence, rather than looking at the study of beliefs and practices in the production of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gunning, J., and Jackson, R. (2011). "What's so 'religious' about 'religious terrorism'?", ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 4:3, 369-388, DOI: 10.1080/17539153.2011.623405.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[State terrorism]]: Involves the intimidation of the civilian population into submission. This occurs when a third-party is used to silence dissidents, and kill people, instilling fear in the population.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;

===Links to power===
A CTS critique of OTS revolves around many OTS scholars' links to institutions of power. CTS questions these links to [[hegemonic]] actors and structures from the [[global North]] that can be seen to be furthering the agendas of certain states, because OTS is a discipline that is primarily concerned with looking at acts of terrorism by non-state actors. This is a very state-centric perspective which has a limited set of assumptions and narratives about the nature and cause of terrorism. Moreover, this becomes accepted as the general consensus at the macro, meso and micro levels of government and institutions, and is reflected in policy and the way the mainstream view terrorism. Traditional terrorism studies is also largely concerned with "problem solving theory", which looks at the world "with the prevailing social and power relationships and the institutions into which they are organised, as the given framework for action", and then works to "make these relationships and institutions work smoothly by dealing effectively with particular sources of trouble".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R. (1981). Social forces, states and world orders: Beyond international relations theory. Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 10(2), 126-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they look at dealing with the issue of terrorism within the current dominant structures of power. An example of this is the scholars and associated research that is affiliated with the [[RAND Corporation]]. Now an independent think tank, RAND was established by the US air force in 1945, and was contracted to the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. It has maintained close links with US administrations, and former board members include [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]], both leading members of the [[George W. Bush]] administration.&lt;ref name="Blakeley 4"&gt;Blakeley, R. (2009). ''State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The north in the south''. London, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem with this association with government is that it privileges research on threats by non-state actors, and marginalises research around state sponsorship of terrorism. According to Burnett and Whyte, the Corporation acts "effectively as an influential prestigious voice in the American military-industrial lobby and in world politics; particularly with regard to its interventions on the war on terror". Scholars, or "embedded experts"&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; associated with RAND have key editorial positions in the two most prominent English-language terrorism journals, ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' and ''Conflict and Terrorism''. RAND scholars helped to found the [[St Andrew Centre for Studies in Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV)]], the leading centre for the study of terrorism in the UK.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; As well, experts associated with the RAND-St Andrews nexus have significant professional ties with businesses and military personal associated with counter-terrorism activity, many of which have made "windfall profits" in the Iraq conflict.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;

== The War on Terror ==

On [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks | 19 terrorists]]&lt;ref name="Pape 27"&gt;Pape. R. (2005) ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– in association with [[Al-Qaeda]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks|hijacked four commercial planes and flew them]] into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)| World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], and a field near [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]. The number of deaths is estimated at 2996 casualties.&lt;ref name="http 49"&gt;http://owni.eu/2011/05/05/the-war-on-terror-in-numbers/&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, President [[George W. Bush]] declared a [[War on Terror]] to prevent any more terrorist attacks on the Western world. Bush immediately framed these terrorists as being motivated by [[Islamic extremism]]; an evil, destructive and repressive people who America refused to negotiate with and must defeat (45). The estimates of how many thousands of civilians, insurgents, soldiers (both American and otherwise) and Islamists that have been killed in the war on terror vary widely from 220,000&lt;ref name="http 49" /&gt; to 650,000.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; However these statistics are unreliable due to their varied date, source and amount – it is not possible to know how many people have been victims of the war on terror. Not only has this war killed, tortured and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, there is no proof that it has been effective in reducing terrorism, and has led to a further proliferation of terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Lum 24"&gt;Lum, C., Kennedy, L. W., &amp; Sherley, A. (2006).  Are counter-terrorism strategies effective?&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bush Doctrine===
{{main article|The Bush Doctrine}}
The rationality behind Bush's decision to start a war on terrorism comes in four parts. First it was implemented as a preventive war, and as an excuse to act pre-emptively. Second, it was based on unilateralism, although where necessary, Bush attempted to enlist support from the international community. Third, there was an element of idealism that believed that war would help to spread democracy, human rights and liberties. And lastly, Bush endeavoured to maintain American hegemony by reaffirming the vital role of American military strength.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It is argued that the negative effects of this war will be felt for generations, due to the culture of division, stereotyping and hate between the Middle East and the West. The formation of a new "suspect community" in the Middle East has undermined human rights and civil liberties, and impaired the functionality of the international system.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; [[Just war theory]] stands as the main justification for the war on terror. This means that new technologies and methods in war are legalized. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] is viewed by many CTS scholars as an act of terror.&lt;ref name="Keen 23"&gt;Keen, D. (2006). War without end? Magic, Propaganda and the hidden functions of counter-terror. Journal of International Development, 18(1), p. 87-104&lt;/ref&gt; Terror on terror makes no sense,&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; and did not produce positive results. The attack on Iraq  was illogical considering America's past partnership with Iraq, the whereabouts of [[Al-Qaeda]]'s base and [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, and also the men who attacked the twin towers were from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Pape 27" /&gt;  American power internationally meant that they authorized the attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. While Bush legitimises the enemy by asserting that terrorists want to 'kill all Americans',&lt;ref name="https 45"&gt;ConspiracyWorld (September 3, 2010). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSPbzitPL8 "Sept. 20, 2001 - Bush Declares War on Terror"]. ''[[YouTube]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no discernable difference between this falsified aim and the goal of American Military intervention in the Middle East. [[Barack Obama]] has continued the Bush-instigated War on Terror by plainly stating that the biggest threat to America is still terrorism.&lt;ref name="http 48"&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/5/29/obama-west-pointspeech.html&lt;/ref&gt;  So, despite the reduction of military occupation in the Middle East, the trace of War on Terror still remains.&lt;ref name="http 48" /&gt;

===Counter-insurgency failures===
The overall ineffective and illegitimate result of the war on terror means that the costs have thus far outweighed the successes. [[Counter-terrorism]] efforts such as [[Targeted killing]] and [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone strikes]] have backfired and are not proven to work, and have even perpetuated the number of terrorist attacks, including [[Suicide attacks|suicide bombings]].&lt;ref name="Lum 24" /&gt; While counter-terrorism may deter some attacks, it cannot prevent all, and often has the result of provoking rather than reducing terrorism. The [[Iraq War]] was not productive in countering terrorism.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Upward of 60 examples of terrorist incidents in America are proven consequences of United States foreign policy and military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/fpb50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Still, no academic scholar in orthodox terrorism studies has considered American military intervention as the primary problem.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; It is noted that at [[Faisal Shahzad]]'s trial – following his failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] – he cited the drones that were killing the people of his community as the reason for his vengeance.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Unmanned drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan tend to target public places and gatherings, such as weddings and funerals, and are increasing the threat of terrorism. Violence emanates and results from counterinsurgency/terrorism. What America calls preventative war, the Middle East calls state terrorism.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1"&gt;Aretxaga, B. (2001). "Terror as a thrill: First thoughts on the 'war on terrorism'." ''Anthropological Quarterly'', 75(1), p.138–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===The War on Terror and patriotism===
Throughout American history, military strength has been at the heart of identity; it is embedded in politics and culture. War as a solution is rooted in American culture, as [[The War of Independence]] and [[World War Two|World War II]] are referred to as successes and justifications for future war.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Rather than concentrating resources and money on problems that have widespread negative effects on American society, like poverty, education, health or the environment, the United States has spent US$1.283 trillion since 9/11 on military interventions internationally.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/rl33110.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype of the enemy is perpetuated and normalized through American culture, media, entertainment and politics. And the shared hate for the enemy contributes to a unified patriotism within America that deflects attention from the deeply entrenched inequalities within the nation.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; The war on terror acts as a distraction mechanism from local problems in the Western world, and maintains a war culture of its own that produces justifications and legitimate rationality for prolonging the war in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Bayoumi, M. (2008). Endless War? Hidden Functions of the 'War on Terror' by David Keen. Development and Change. 39(5), p.870-871.&lt;/ref&gt; The patriotism that the war on terror creates contributes to large sources of revenue for the American military industrial economy through [[mass surveillance]], weapon suppliers, the [[CIA]], military personnel and orthodox terrorism academics.&lt;ref&gt;Zalman, A., &amp; Clarke, J. (2009). The Global War on Terror: A Narrative in Need of a Rewrite. Ethics &amp; International Affairs, 23(2), p.101-113,89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating a narrative of the enemy===
The culture of war is created through the imagery and language used in politics and popular entertainment in order to frame a narrative of the enemy. [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]] have been constructed as a dangerous other in Western culture. Not only do politicians&amp;nbsp;– especially in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]&amp;nbsp;– inform the public of this enemy, this fictional reality is reinforced through journalism and entertainment in which the war is framed as inevitable and the enemy as evil.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; This all reinforces the fantasy that this war is about fighting evil in general, and the Western soldiers that are killed are fighting for a greater good. The hyperbolic, dramatic language used in the media casts the Western world as heroes who fight the villains. CTS reflects on who this narrative of the enemy benefits. This perception that reinforces patriotism and justifications for war, profits the Western world and furthers the dominance and oppression that divides the two regions.
When the motives and ideology of terrorists are largely unknown – let alone the number and whereabouts – the greater the possibility is to rely on stereotype and myth-based discourse.&lt;ref name="http 44"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brenner/terror-americas-archetype_b_5784166.html?ir=WorldPost&lt;/ref&gt; Because the enemy is foreign (even alien) this possibility is increased due to limited knowledge and physical connection to the region. When reality falls short, the narrative of foreign peoples is shaped by "shortcuts provided by stylized imagery compounded of stories, films and our own imaginations".&lt;ref name="http 44" /&gt; Politicians use this to back up their dehumanized claims, so the image of the terrorist mimics [[Osama bin Laden]] with the beard, turban, black eyes and hollow glum face creating a stereotyped stigma. This enemy is merciless, believes in extreme religious values and will do anything to destroy the West. Such imagery and language degrades common humanity, and prevents us from understanding that the enemy is a human who is victimized.

===Terrorism and mobilities===
[[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] was a pioneer in discussing the paradigms of mobilities within the age of terror. Per his viewpoint, terrorism operates in a world of contrasting complexities where the power, far from being static, flows. The power is mobile in the same way, its gravity-effects on the world of consumption. Terrorism divides the world in two safe and unsafe zones.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2002). The global complexities of September 11th. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 19(4), 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexities of the global. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 235-254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexity turn. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Over past decades, many voices alerted on the negative effects of terrorism over the industry of tourism and mobilities in developed and underdeveloped economies.&lt;ref&gt;Sönmez, S. F., Apostolopoulos, Y., &amp; Tarlow, P. (1999). Tourism in crisis: Managing the effects of terrorism. Journal of Travel Research, 38(1), 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergent theories explained terrorism as an indicator of the lack of democracy, or even extreme poverty which represents a fertile ground for ethnic resentment necessary to rechannel terrorism. Since tourists are ambassadors of first World, not surprisingly they were targets of terrorist cells in zones dotted with lower levels of security.&lt;ref&gt;Pizam, A., &amp; Smith, G. (2000). Tourism and terrorism: A quantitative analysis of major terrorist acts and their impact on tourism destinations. Tourism Economics, 6(2), 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansfeld, Y., &amp; Pizam, A. (Eds.). (2006). Tourism, security and safety. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enders, W., Sandler, T., &amp; Parise, G. F. (1992). An econometric analysis of the impact of terrorism on tourism. Kyklos, 45(4), 531-554.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some other scholars questioned this idea considering that tourism recovers its attraction and growth after elapsed little time from the original event;&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, A., &amp; Buccola, S. (2002). War, terror, and the tourism market in Israel. Applied Economics, 34(11), 1335-1343.&lt;/ref&gt; or even producing "traumaescape" which means zones whipped by terrorism that becomes tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;Bégin, R. (2014). Digital Traumascape From the Trümmerfilme to Wall e.

A '''Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO)''' is a series of [[Shakedown (testing)|missile tests]] conducted by the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name = "www.uscs.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uscs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DS05_Sumarine-Missile-Firings.pdf | title = SUBMARINE MISSILE FIRINGS | date = | accessdate = 27 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests are employed to validate a [[weapon system]] [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|(SLBM)]] and ensure a submarine crew's readiness to use that system. A shakedown operation usually occurs after a [[refueling and overhaul]] process or construction of a new submarine. Testing of missile systems allows collection of flight-data, and examinations of submarine launch platforms.&lt;ref name = "www.lockheedmartin.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lockheedmartin.co.uk/us/news/press-releases/2016/september/ssc-space-trdent.html | title = Successful Trident II D5 Missile Flight Test Supports Navy Submarine Certification for Strategic Patrol | date = | accessdate = 27 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first DASO test occurred July 20, 1960 on the [[USS George Washington (SSBN-598)|USS George Washington]], using the [[UGM-27 Polaris#Polaris A-1|Polaris A-1]].

'''Electric motorsport''' (also known as '''electric racing''' or '''electric motor racing''') is a category of motor sport that consists of the racing of electric powered vehicles for competition, either in all-electric series, or in open-series against vehicles with different power trains. Very early in the history of automobiles, electric cars held several performance records over [[internal combustion engine]] cars, such as [[Land speed record#1898.E2.80.931965 .28wheel-driven.29|land speed records]], but fell behind in performance during the first decade of the 20th century. With the renaissance of electric vehicles during the early 21st century, notable electric-only racing series have been developed, for both cars and motorcycles, including for example, the [[FIA Formula E Championship]]. In other racing events, electric vehicles are competing alongside combustion engine vehicles, for example in the [[Isle of Man TT]] and the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], and in some cases winning outright.

==History==

===Background and early powertrains===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Goldsworthy Gurney steam carriage - Project Gutenberg eText 12496.png|thumb|The [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]], in an 1827 illustration.]]
see also: [[History of the steam engine]] and [[Locomotive#Origins|Origins of the locomotive]]

Early mechanically powered vehicles used steam power, a technology first developed for static applications (notably, [[Thomas Newcomen]] 1712 and [[James Watt]] 1765) (see [[History of the steam engine]]). Steam for vehicle traction was taken up both for road vehicles and for rail by [[Richard Trevithick]] who creating the [[Richard Trevithick#Puffing Devil|Puffing devil]] for transporting passengers by road in 1801, and later rail transport, initially for coal (1804) and then for people (Trevethick 1808, [[George Stephenson]] 1824 onwards).  By the 1830s steam began to be more widely adopted for transportation, with steam carriages for road (e.g. the 1827 [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] [[Steam bus]]) and for rail, although the latter quickly became more established for medium and longer distance travel. Mechanically powered road vehicles were largely limited to utilitarian vehicles such as [[traction engine]]s during this period (especially 1850s onwards, see [[History of steam road vehicles#Victorian Age of Steam|History of steam road vehicles]]).

[[File:Thomas Parker Electric car.jpg|thumb|Electric car built by [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]] ]]

During the 1860s diverse small experiments with personal transportation and different powertrains blossomed, with steam buggies (e.g. [[History of steam road vehicles#Henry Taylor.27s steam buggy|Henry Taylor]] 1867) and even steam motorcycles ([[History of steam road vehicles#Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede|Michaex-Perreux]] and [[History of steam road vehicles#Sylvester H. Roper|Sylvester Roper]], both around 1867-69). [[Amédée Bollée]] developed several long distance (Le Mans to Paris, 210&amp;nbsp;km) steam vehicles from 1873 onwards, including the 1878 [[Amédée Bollée#La Mancelle|La Mancelle]] of which 50 were produced, and the 1881 [[Amédée Bollée#La Rapide|La Rapide]] capable of 62&amp;nbsp;km/h (39&amp;nbsp;mph). An early electric powertrain was exhibited in November 1881 by French inventor [[Gustave Trouvé]] at the [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris|International Exhibition of Electricity in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wakefield|first=Ernest H.|title=History of the Electric Automobile|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers|year=1994|isbn=978-1-56091-299-6|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English inventor [[Thomas Parker (inventor)|Thomas Parker]], who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the [[London Underground]], overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel [[coalite]], built the first production electric car in [[London]] in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5212278/Worlds-first-electric-car-built-by-Victorian-inventor-in-1884.html  |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=World's first electric car built by Victorian inventor in 1884 |date=2009-04-24 |access-date=2009-07-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects [[smoke]] and [[pollution]] were having in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/hybrid-technology/history-of-electric-cars1.htm |title=What is the history of electric cars? |last=Fuller |first=John |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2009-04-09 |access-date=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[petrol engine|petrol/gasoline-powered]] internal combustion engine automobiles were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in [[Mannheim]].  Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886, and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after [[Bertha Benz]], his wife, had proved - with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back (194&amp;nbsp;km) - that the horseless coach was absolutely suitable for daily use.

Overall, there were a variety of powertrains and vehicle forms experimented with during this period, each with different advantages and disadvantages, range, reliability and speed. In terms of outright performance, different powertrains competed for the land speed record through the turn of the 20th century (see below), and it was not until 1924 onwards that internal combustion powertrains began to dominate this aspect.

===Early land speed records===
[[File:Jamais contente.jpg|thumb|[[La Jamais Contente]] electric, 1899]]
{{Main|Land speed record}}

The table below details the early history of land speed records from 1898 into the early decades of the 20th century. ''[[La Jamais Contente]]'' ({{lang-en|The Never Satisfied}}) was the first road vehicle to go over {{convert|100|km/h}}. It was an [[electric car|electric vehicle]] with a [[light alloy]] [[torpedo]] shaped bodywork and with Fulmen [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. The vehicle established the [[land speed record]] on April 29 or May 1, 1899 at [[Achères, Yvelines]] near [[Paris]], [[France]].  The vehicle had two direct drive Postel-Vinay 25&amp;nbsp;kW motors, running at 200 V drawing 124 Amperes each&lt;ref name=pdf1&gt;{{cite web | title= La Jamais Contente | url = http://www.e-mobile.ch/pdf/2005/Fact-Sheet_LaJamaisContente_FW.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EV Zero? |publisher=EV1 Club |url=http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |accessdate=2006-10-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012220024/http://ev1-club.power.net/torpedo.htm |archivedate=2006-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for about 68&amp;nbsp;hp, and was equipped with [[Michelin]] [[tires]].

As of 1900, 38% of US automobiles, 33,842 cars, were powered by electricity (40% by steam, and 22% by gasoline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Evolution of Electric Cars |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |publisher=Sustainnovate |url=http://sustainnovate.ae/en/innovators-blog/detail/evolution-of-electric-cars |access-date=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as combustion powertrains developed, they offered a superior range than electrics, and (especially after the 1908 [[Ford Model T]], and its mass production from 1913 onwards) a much lower purchase price. In 1912 the electric starter motor was invented by [[Charles F. Kettering|Charles Kettering]] leading to easier and faster starting of internal combustion powertrains, and removing what had been perceived as one of their main drawbacks (having to use a hand crank). Electric and subsequently steam still had some performance advantages and dominated the outright speed record until 1924.  Yet the combustion engine technology benefitted from much greater market penetration and thus more development, and began to achieve greater speed performance than electrics and stream from 1924 onwards.

===21st century renaissance===
{{Main|History of the electric vehicle}}
The emergence of higher volume manufacturing of electric powertrain vehicles has allowed for economies of scale and increased research and development of electrical batteries, the critical technology in electric powertrains. Battery power density (the amount of energy stored per unit weight) has typically been the greatest drawback of electric powertrains in comparison to gasoline combustion engine powertrains. Steady advances in battery technology, [[Research in lithium-ion batteries|especially lithium-ion battery technologies]] first commercialized in the early 1990s have driven innovations in electric powertrains, and further battery advances allow them to once again compete with the combustion engine powertrains in motorsports events.

[[Electric drag racing]] is a sport where electric vehicles start from standstill and attempt the highest possible speed over a short given distance.&lt;ref name="0EX1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.0-60mag.com/news/2010/12/cars-peugeot-ex1-sets-new-electric-records/ |title=Concept Or Not, Peugeot EX1 Is One Fast EV |work=0-60mag |date=December 2010|accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes race and usually beat gasoline sports cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MythBuster: Why Electric Vehicles Beat Gas in 5 Extreme Tests |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a3244/4264025/ |publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=2016-05-24 |date=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[NEDRA]] keep track of records worldwide using certified equipment.

At the [[Formula Student]] competition at the [[Silverstone Circuit]] in July 2013, the electric powered car of the [[ETH Zurich]] won against all cars with internal combustion engines. It is believed to be the first time that an electric vehicle has beaten cars powered by combustion engines in any accredited motorsport competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric vehicle storms to victory in Formula Student 2013 |url=http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |publisher=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |accessdate=2013-07-12 |date=2013-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515111913/http://www.imeche.org/news/archives/2013/07/08/Electric_vehicle_storms_to_victory_in_Formula_Student_2013 |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pikes Peak International Hill Climb===
{{main|Pikes Peak International Hill Climb}}

The [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], also known as ''The Race to the Clouds'', is an annual automobile and motorcycle [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] to the summit of [[Pikes Peak]] in Colorado, USA. The track measures {{convert|12.42|mi|km}} over 156 turns, climbing {{convert|4720|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the start at Mile 7 on Pikes Peak Highway, to the finish at {{convert|14110|ft|m|abbr=on}}, on grades averaging 7.2%.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;''PPIHC race overview'', {{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727131916/http://www.ppihc.com/2014-spectator-guide/ |archivedate=2014-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race is self sanctioned and has taken place since 1916, making it the second oldest motorsport event in the Western Hemisphere behind the Indianapolis 500.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; It is currently contested by a variety of classes of cars, trucks, motorcycles and quads. There are often numerous new classes tried and discarded year-to-year. In the modern era, electric vehicles have competed in the event since 1983 (Joe Balls, Sears Electric car). In the 2-wheeled divisions, the electric powertrains are already able to outcompete the combustion engines; the 2013 overall winner was an electric bike, the [[Lightning Motorcycle]] [[Lightning LS-218|LS-218 electric Superbike]] ridden by Carlin Dunne in a time of 10:00.694 minutes, a new course record for the 2-wheeled class.

In the 4-Wheeled Divisions, the results of recent years show that the relative improvements in race time are advancing at different rates in the electric classes compared to the unlimited/combustion engine classes. Unlimited class vehicles, with combustion engines, broke the 16 minute barrier in 1938, and have steadily improved over the subsequent decades, breaking the 10-minute barrier in 2011.&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppihc.com/race_winners_by_year/ |title=Race winners by year |website=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the electric vehicle class broke the 16 minute barrier in 1994 (Katy Endicott, Honda Civic Shuttle finishing in 15:44:71 minutes), and the 10-minute barrier in 2013 (Nabuhiro 'Monster' Tajima, E-Runner finishing in 9:46:53 minutes).&lt;ref name="ppihc.com"/&gt; In the 2014 event, the Mitsubishi team ([[Mitsubishi MiEV Evolution|MiEV Evolution III]]) achieved 2nd (Greg Tracey, 9:08.188 minutes) and 3rd position (Hiroshi Masuoka, 9:12:204 minutes) - within 3 seconds and 7 seconds (respectively) of the overall fastest vehicle, a gasoline powered Norma race car.&lt;ref name="LiveTiming.net PPIHC results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |website=Live Timing |publisher=North Country Timing &amp; Scoring and LiveTiming.net |location=US |access-date=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716194314/http://livetiming.net/ppihc/?Class= |archivedate=2014-07-16 |df= |title=Pikes Peak International Hill Climb 2018&lt;br&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The graph to the right shows the relative rates of improvement of these two classes since the 1980s.

2015 for the first time in the history of the race was an electric car to win the race outright. The winning car was the Latvian team [[Drive eO]]'s 3rd generation vehicle, eO PP03 with peak power of 1020&amp;nbsp;kW and peak torque of 2160 Nm, weighing 1200&amp;nbsp;kg. The time achieved was 9:07.222 minutes, just faster than Greg Tracey's 9:08.188 time in 2014. Second place was also earned by an electric car, the Tajima [[Rimac Automobili]] [[Rimac E-Runner Concept One|E-Runner Concept_One]] with peak power of 1100&amp;nbsp;kW, peak torque of 1500 Nm, and weighing 1500&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.electricautosport.com/2015/06/tajima-and-rimac-reveal-1100kw-electric-pikes-peak-racer-photos-and-specs/ |title=Tajima and Rimac reveal 1100kW electric Pikes Peak racer + photos and specs |first=Tim |last=Biesbrouck |work=Electric Autosport |date=2015-06-01 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winning driver [[Rhys Millen]] said in an interview that the vehicle had lost half its tractive power (due to heat) from around the halfway point. Based on testing the team had expected a run 30 seconds faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMjsAMlXGBI |title=Rhys Millen Wins Pikes Peak First Electric Car Victory |via=YouTube |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the two above teams and drivers raced again in 2016, with evolutions of the vehicles, and were joined by a prototype '4-motor EV' from Acura based on the 2016 NSX production car, with heavy modifications to all-electric drive. The Acura, driven by Tetsuya Yamano, achieved a remarkable time for its first outing, finishing in 9:06:015 minutes, and third place overall. [[Drive eO]]'s 4th generation vehicle, eO PP100 achieved a time of 8:57:118 minutes, improving on the previous year's time and coming second overall. The winning 2016 vehicle was a combustion engine Norma driven by [[Romain Dumas]] with a time 8:51:445 minutes. The Norma has similar power to weight ratio to the PP100, but weighs half as much and as a result has better traction in corners. Dumas' team also won in an earlier version of the same vehicle in 2014 with a time of 9:05:801 minutes, thus improving by some 14 seconds over 2 years technological evolution. The Drive eO vehicle improved by some 10 seconds in one year, over its 2015 time.

In 2018, the outright winner was the all electric I.D. R Pikes Peak Prototype driven by Romain Dumas, in new overall record time 7:57.148 minutes. The previous track record stood at 8:13.878 minutes, driven by Sébastien Loeb in the 2013 [[Peugeot 208]] T16 Pikes Peak. Now that electrics have overtaken the performance of gasoline cars on Pike's Peak, it seems likely that electric cars will continue to dominate this race from 2018 onwards. Electric cars are still relatively early in their motorsport development with much room for further improvement, whereas gasoline powered cars have had over a century of development, with only incremental improvements likely to come in the future.

===Isle of Man TT===
{{main|Isle of Man TT|TT Zero}}

TT Zero is part of the [[Isle of Man TT]] and races for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the [[Snaefell Mountain Course]]. The TT Zero event as an officially sanctioned [[Isle of Man TT]] race is for [[racing motorcycle]]s where "''The technical concept is for motorcycles (two wheeled) to be powered without the use of carbon based fuels and have zero toxic/noxious emissions''."&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' p27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural 2010 TT Zero race was won by [[Mark Miller (TT motorcycle racer)|Mark Miller]] riding a [[MotoCzysz E1pc]] motor-cycle in 23 minutes and 22.89 seconds at an average race speed of 96.820&amp;nbsp;mph for 1 lap (37.733 miles) of the Mountain Course and the first [[United States]] winner since Dave Roper won the 1984 Historic TT riding a 500cc [[Matchless]]. The TT Zero race replaced the [[TTXGP]] franchise with the simplification of the regulations&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races – Official Programme May 29–11 June 2010'' page 14 Isle of Man Department of Community, Culture &amp; Leisure – ACU Events Ltd (2010) Mannin Media Group Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; and the emphasis on electric powered motor-cycles.&lt;ref&gt;''REGULATIONS TT ZERO – 2010 International Tourist Trophy – Isle of Man 29 May – 11 June'' Appendix C page 25–27 ACU Events Ltd (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MotoCzysz]] [[MotoCzysz E1pc|E1pc]] was also the first [[United States|American]] manufactured motor-cycle to win an Isle of Man TT Race since Oliver Godfrey won the [[1911 Isle of Man TT|1911]] [[Senior TT]] with an [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] V-Twin motor-cycle.

The riders of the TT Zero bikes are typically those that also compete in the combustion engine classes and are very experienced on the circuit. Comparing the experience of the different powertrains, Lee Johnston said as he climbed off his electric bike in the 2015 practice sessions: “That was just mint. It feels so stable, it’s unbelievable. It’s just so peaceful. No revving.” Asked for what was memorable, he responded “I think just the peace and quiet and riding over the mountain, no noise and seeing the sunset..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2015/06/06/iomtt-victory-motorcycles-tt-qualifying-report/ |title=Victory Racing Breaks the 100mph Average Lap Speed Barrier on its First TT Practice Session |work=Cycle World |location=US |date=2015-06-06 |access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TT Zero lap speeds have been improving at an average rate of around 2&amp;nbsp;mph in recent years (121.824&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). With more mature technology, the combustion engine bikes' [[Isle of Man TT#Fastest race lap by year|lap speeds]] in the mainstream TT have been improving at a lower rate of around 1&amp;nbsp;mph each year in recent years (135.452&amp;nbsp;mph as of 2018). It's likely that the electric bikes will surpass the combustion bikes at some point, but it may not happen until the mid to late 2020s.

===FIA World Endurance Championship===

{{main|FIA World Endurance Championship}}

The [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] is an [[auto racing]] [[world championship]] organized by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) and sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  The series usurps the ACO's former [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] which began in [[2010 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup|2010]], and is the first endurance series of world championship status since the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] at the end of [[1992 World Sportscar Championship season|1992]].  The World Endurance Championship name was previously used by the FIA from [[World Sportscar Championship|1981 to 1985]].

The series feature multiple classes of cars competing in [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance races]], with [[sports prototype]]s competing in the [[Le Mans Prototype]] categories, and production-based [[grand tourer]]s competing in the [[LM GTE]] categories.  World champion titles are awarded to the top scoring manufacturers and drivers over the season,&lt;ref name="FIA WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | title = 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063434/http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIA WMSC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | title = World Motor Sport Council | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063414/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other cups and trophies will be awarded for drivers and [[privateer (motorsport)|private teams]].&lt;ref name="ACO WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | title = The FIA World Endurance Championship is unveiled! | publisher = [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] | work = lemans.org | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616155004/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/update/The-FIA-World-Endurance-Championship-is-unveiled--_4068.html | archivedate = 2011-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nissan ZEOD RC]] was designed by Ben Bowlby, who previously designed the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] Garage 56 entry [[DeltaWing]] as an employee for DeltaWing Project 56 LLC, a consortium led by Don Panoz. He previously worked for DeltaWing LLC, a Chip Ganassi company created to develop a DeltaWing concept race car for IndyCar. Nissan provided an engine and received naming rights on the Garage 56 entry at the 2012 Le Mans race, as well as and other 2012 American Le Mans Series races

The ZEOD RC had a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric drivetrain]] with [[lithium ion]] battery packs in a chassis similar in design to the DeltaWing.&lt;ref name="ZEOD RC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/108176/ |title=Nissan unveils electric Le Mans Garage 56 car |publisher=[[Haymarket Press]] |work=[[Autosport]] |last=O'Leary |first=Jamie |date=2013-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a June 22, 2013 article at Autosport.com, Bowlby said: "This is a new car, but it uses the narrow track technology of the DeltaWing and that gives us great efficiency. It is something we understand and it is an efficient way of getting around Le Mans."

At the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the car had to retire during the race's early hours due to a gearbox failure. However it managed to achieve its goals of reaching a speed above 300&amp;nbsp;km/h and completing a lap in [[Circuit de la Sarthe|Le Mans]] using electric power only.

===Rally Paris-Dakar===
{{main|Dakar Rally}}

In January [[2017 Dakar Rally|2017]], a pure electric car participated in the Paris-Dakar Rally and completed the entire route of 9000&amp;nbsp;km through Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. The vehicle had been specially designed and built for the race. The car had a 250&amp;nbsp;kW engine (340&amp;nbsp;hp) and a 150 kWh battery. The battery consisted of several modules. Each module could be charged separately by power cable to speed up the charging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oekonews.at/?mdoc_id=1112013 |title=Dakar Rallye: Erstmals 100% elektrisch im Ziel |trans-title=Dakar Rallye: First 100% electric in the finish |work=oekonews [[Süddeutsche Zeitung|Süddeutschen Zeitung]] |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future prospects==

Electric powertrains have advantages over combustion engines in power delivery and vehicle dynamics (especially on motorbikes), but still have range disadvantages in longer races (note that combustion engine vehicle often have to refill energy supply also, e.g. Isle of Man TT bikes refill every two laps). Early electric challengers to combustion engine vehicles are therefore typically in shorter more intensive races such as hill climbs or other limited distance races, or simply in fastest lap times (e.g. around the Isle of Man Snaefell circuit). Nevertheless, for endurance racing, hybrid electric powertrains have also proven their advantages over pure combustion engine powertrains, with recent years at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] all won by the hybrid electric [[Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].

| Name = Endometrial Cups
}}
'''Endometrial cups''' form during pregnancy in [[mare]]s and are the source of [[equine chorionic gonadotropin]] (eCG) and a placenta-associated structure, which is derived from the fetus. Their purpose is to increase the immunological tolerance of the mare in order to protect the developing [[foal]].

==Function==
Endometrial cups are unique to animals in the [[equus (genus)|horse family]], and so named because of their concave shape.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; They are a placenta-associated structure,&lt;ref name="CSU"/&gt; found in the uterine wall of a mare from about 38 to 150 days into a pregnancy.  After about 70 days, they begin to regress,&lt;ref name=Jacobs/&gt; and are eventually destroyed by the immune system.&lt;ref name="CSU"/&gt; They begin to develop at approximately 25 days of pregnancy, deriving from the [[chorionic girdle]]. At approximately 36-38 days of pregnancy, the cells that will become the endometrial cup begin to burrow into the endometrial tissue, through the [[basement membrane]], and into the uterine [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]. Their invasion of the uterine stroma begins the cells' maturation process, which takes 2-3 days. Endometrial cups can be circular, U-shaped, or ribbonlike and are pale compared to the rest of the endometrial tissue. They can range in size from 1 cm to 10 cm in diameter at the widest point.&lt;ref name="CSU" /&gt; They resemble [[ulcer]]s in form, and when examined under a microscope have large epithelioid decidual-like cells and large nucleoli.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=PH|last2=Elsinghorst|first2=TA|title=[Endometrial cups in horses].|journal=Tijdschrift voor diergeneeskunde|date=1 April 1987|volume=112|issue=7|pages=383-9|pmid=3576577}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They produce high concentrations of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), also called pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin, in the bloodstream of pregnant mares. eCG is actually an equine [[luteinizing hormone]].&lt;ref name="CSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Endometrial Cups and Secretion of Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/placenta/endocups.html|website=Colorado State University|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endometrial cups behave somewhat like cells from [[metastatic tumor]]s, in that they leave the placenta and migrate into the uterus. Their purpose appears to be to work with other placental cells to control the expression of histocompatibility genes so that the developing fetus is not destroyed by the mare’s immune system.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Endometrial Cups|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/news/endometrialcups.cfm|website=Cornell University|date=June 20, 2014|access-date=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar types of cells that invade the placenta have been described in humans. The purpose of these cells In both humans and horses is believed to be to interact with the mother’s immune system and increase maternal immunological tolerance of the developing fetus.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt;

== Histology ==
Mature endometrial cup cells appear rounded and secrete eCG; all but a few cells have two nuclei. As the mare's immune system begins to react to the presence of the pregnancy, histological changes are visible. First, as the endometrial cup grows and develops, maternal white blood cells, including [[T cell|T cells]], [[B cell|B cells]], and [[Macrophage|macrophages]], mass in the uterine stroma. They begin to destroy the cup around days 70-80 of pregnancy, and it is completely destroyed by 100-140 days, at which point it naturally separates from the endometrium.&lt;ref name="CSU" /&gt;

The '''excavatability''' of an earth (rock and [[regolith]]) material is a measure of the material to be excavated (dug) with conventional excavation equipment such as a [[bulldozer]] with [[Bulldozer#Ripper|ripper]]s, [[backhoe]], [[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]] and other grading equipment. Materials that cannot be excavated with conventional excavation equipment are said to be non-[[rippable]]. Such material typically requires pre-[[Rock blasting|blasting]] or use of percussion hammers or chisels to facilitate excavation. The excavatability or [[rippability]] of earth materials is evaluated typically by a [[geophysicist]], [[engineering geologist]], or [[geotechnical engineer]].

The '''Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope''' ('''FGST'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fgst.slac.stanford.edu/ |title=FGST: Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;), formerly called the '''Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope''' ('''GLAST'''), is a [[space observatory]] being used to perform [[gamma-ray astronomy]] observations from [[low Earth orbit]]. Its main instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), with which astronomers mostly intend to perform an all-sky survey studying [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena such as [[active galactic nuclei]], [[pulsar]]s, other high-energy sources and [[dark matter]]. Another instrument aboard Fermi, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM; formerly GLAST Burst Monitor), is being used to study [[gamma-ray burst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/glast_gbm.html |title=NASA's GLAST Burst Monitor Team Hard at Work Fine-Tuning Instrument and Operations |publisher=NASA |date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermi was launched on 11 June 2008 at 16:05&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]] aboard a [[Delta II]] 7920-H rocket. The mission is a joint venture of [[NASA]], the [[United States Department of Energy]], and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-glast.stanford.edu/ |title=An Astro-Particle Physics Partnership Exploring the High Energy Universe - List of funders |publisher=SLAC |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope on orbit, succeeding [[INTEGRAL]].

[[File:GLAST on the payload attach fitting.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fermi on Earth, solar arrays folded]]

[[General Dynamics]] Advanced Information Systems (formerly Spectrum Astro and now [[Orbital Sciences]]) in [[Gilbert, Arizona]], designed and built the [[spacecraft]] that carries the instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/library/conferences/lat_oct02/DConte.pdf |title=Spacecraft Overview Presentation for the GLAST LAT Collaboration Meeting |publisher=NASA |date=23 October 2002 |id=1196-EB-R43864}}&lt;/ref&gt; It travels in a low, circular orbit with a period of about 95&amp;nbsp;minutes. Its normal mode of operation maintains its orientation so that the instruments will look away from the Earth, with a "rocking" motion to equalize the coverage of the sky. The view of the instruments will sweep out across most of the sky about 16 times per day. The spacecraft can also maintain an orientation that points to a chosen target.

Both science instruments underwent environmental testing, including vibration, vacuum, and high and low temperatures to ensure that they can withstand the stresses of launch and continue to operate in space. They were integrated with the spacecraft at the General Dynamics ASCENT facility in Gilbert, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.gd.com/news/press-releases/2008/06/nasas-general-dynamics-built-glast-satellite-launched-today |title=NASA's General Dynamics-Built GLAST Satellite Launched Today |publisher=General Dynamics |first=Carol |last=Smith |date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the instruments are available to the public through the Fermi Science Support Center web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/ |title=Currently Available Data Products |work=Fermi Science Support Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software for analyzing the data is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/ |title=Data Analysis |work=Fermi Science Support Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GLAST renamed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ==
Fermi gained its new name in 2008: On 26 August 2008, GLAST was renamed the "Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope" in honor of [[Enrico Fermi]], a pioneer in high-energy physics.&lt;ref name=firstlight&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/26aug_firstlight.htm |title=First Light for the Fermi Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |date=26 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317001936/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/26aug_firstlight.htm |archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's [[Alan Stern]], associate administrator for Science at NASA Headquarters, launched a public competition 7 February 2008, closing 31 March 2008, to rename GLAST in a way that would "capture the excitement of GLAST's mission and call attention to gamma-ray and high-energy astronomy&amp;nbsp;... something memorable to commemorate this spectacular new astronomy mission&amp;nbsp;... a name that is catchy, easy to say and will help make the satellite and its mission a topic of dinner table and classroom discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/HQ_08036_GLAST.html |title=NASA Calls for Suggestions to Re-Name Future Telescope Mission |publisher=NASA |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/08feb_namethattelescope.htm |title=Name that Space Telescope! |date=8 February 2008 |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402005128/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/08feb_namethattelescope.htm |archivedate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA designed the mission with a five-year lifetime, with a goal of ten years of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/public/ |title=The GLAST Mission: GLAST Overview, mission length |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key scientific objectives of the Fermi mission have been described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-glast.stanford.edu/mission.html |title=The Mission |publisher=SLAC |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Infrared satellite imagery depicts a missile launch through the clouds.jpg|thumb|GLAST launch as pictured by a space-based infrared sensor, looking down at the Earth]]

=== Prelaunch ===
On 4 March 2008, the spacecraft arrived at the [[Astrotech]] payload processing facility in [[Titusville, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/releases/2008/release-20080304.html |title=GLAST Spacecraft Arrives in Florida to Prepare for Launch |publisher=NASA |first1=George |last1=Diller |first2=Rob |last2=Gutro |date=4 March 2008 |id=04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2008, after several previous delays, launch status was retargeted for 11 June at the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |title=Tracking Station — Worldwide launch schedule |work=Spaceflight Now |accessdate=4 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qF7qFllk?url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |archivedate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/index.html |title=GLAST Mission: Coverage Latest News |accessdate=4 June 2008 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last delays resulting from the need to replace the Flight Termination System batteries.&lt;ref name=06-06staus&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/status/2008/elvstatus-20080606.html |title=Expendable Launch Vehicle Status Report: ELV-060608 |publisher=NASA |first=George |last=Diller |date=6 June 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch window extended from 15:45 to 17:40&amp;nbsp;UTC daily, until 7 August 2008.&lt;ref name=06-06staus/&gt;

=== Launch ===
Launch occurred successfully on 11 June 2008 at 16:05&amp;nbsp;UTC aboard a [[Delta II|Delta 7920H-10C]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Space Launch Complex 17-B]]. Spacecraft separation took place about 75 minutes after launch.

=== Orbit ===
Fermi resides in a [[Low Earth orbit|low-Earth circular orbit]] at an altitude of {{convert|550|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and at an inclination of 28.5 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/public/ |title=The GLAST Mission: GLAST Overview, orbital information |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software modifications ===
GLAST received some minor modifications to its computer software on 23 June 2008.

=== LAT/GBM computers operational ===
Computers operating both the LAT and GBM and most of the LAT's components were turned on 24 June 2008. The LAT high voltage was turned on 25 June, and it began detecting high-energy particles from space, but minor adjustments were still needed to calibrate the instrument. The GBM high voltage was also turned on 25 June, but the GBM still required one more week of testing/calibrations before searching for gamma-ray bursts.

=== Sky survey mode ===
After presenting an overview of the Fermi instrumentation and goals, Jennifer Carson of [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] had concluded that the primary goals were "all achievable with the all-sky scanning mode of observing".&lt;ref name=carson&gt;{{cite journal |title=GLAST: physics goals and instrument status |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |last=Carson |first=Jennifer |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=115–118 |date=March 2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0610960 |bibcode=2007JPhCS..60..115C |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/60/1/020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi switched to "sky survey mode" on 26 June 2008 so as to begin sweeping its field of view over the entire sky every three hours (every two orbits).

=== Collision avoided ===
On 30 April 2013, NASA revealed that the telescope had narrowly avoided a collision a year earlier with a defunct Cold War-era Soviet spy satellite, [[Kosmos 1805]], in April 2012. Orbital predictions several days earlier indicated that the two satellites were expected to occupy the same point in space within 30 milliseconds of each other. On 3 April, telescope operators decided to stow the satellite's high-gain parabolic antenna, rotate the solar panels out of the way and to fire Fermi's rocket thrusters for one second to move it out of the way. Even though the thrusters had been idle since the telescope had been placed in orbit nearly five years earlier, they worked correctly and potential disaster was thus avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/bullet-dodge.html |title=The Day NASA's Fermi Dodged a 1.5-ton Bullet |publisher=NASA |date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extended mission 2013-2018 ===
In August 2013 Fermi started its 5-year mission extension.&lt;ref name=fme2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasas-fermi-celebrates-five-years-in-space-enters-extended-mission/ |title=NASA's Fermi Celebrates Five Years in Space, Enters Extended Mission |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar array drive failure ===
On 16 March 2018 one of Fermi's solar arrays quit rotating, prompting a transition to "safe hold" mode and instrument power off.  This was the first mechanical failure in nearly 10 years. Fermi's solar arrays rotate to maximize the exposure of the arrays to the Sun. The motor that drives that rotation failed to move as instructed in one direction. On 27 March, the satellite was placed at a fixed angle relative to its orbit to maximize solar power. The next day the GBM instrument was turned back on. On 2 April, operators turned LAT on and it resumed operations on 8 April. Alternate observation strategies are being developed due to power and thermal requirements.&lt;ref name=20180530nasa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/fermi-status-update |title=Fermi Status Update |publisher=NASA |first=Felicia |last=Chou |date=30 May 2018 |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
[[Image:Cycle of pulsed gamma rays from the Vela pulsar HI RES.gif|thumb|Cycle of pulsed gamma rays from the [[Vela pulsar]], constructed from photons detected by LAT]]

=== Pulsar discovery ===
The first major discovery came when the space telescope detected a [[pulsar]] in the CTA 1 [[supernova]] remnant that appeared to emit radiation in the [[gamma ray]] bands only, a first for its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/19879/fermi-telescope-makes-first-big-discovery-gamma-ray-pulsar/ |title=Fermi Telescope Makes First Big Discovery: Gamma Ray Pulsar |work=[[Universe Today]] |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new pulsar sweeps the Earth every 316.86 milliseconds and is about 4,600 light years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cosmosmagazine.com/news/2260/new-kind-pulsar-discovered |title=New kind of pulsar discovered |work=[[Cosmos (magazine)|Cosmos]] |date=18 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211043148/http://cosmosmagazine.com/news/2260/new-kind-pulsar-discovered |archivedate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greatest GRB energy release ===
In September 2008, the gamma-ray burst [[GRB 080916C]] in the constellation [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] was recorded by the Fermi telescope. This burst is notable as having "the largest apparent energy release yet measured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fermi Observations of High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission from GRB 080916C |journal=Science |first=A. A. |last=Abdo |display-authors=etal |volume=323 |issue=5922 |pages=1688–1693 |date=March 2009 |doi=10.1126/science.1169101 |bibcode=2009Sci...323.1688A |pmid=19228997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion had the power of about 9,000 ordinary supernovae, and the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] jet of material ejected in the blast must have moved at a minimum of 99.9999% the [[speed of light]]. Overall, GRB 080916C had "the greatest total energy, the fastest motions, and the highest initial-energy emissions" ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141458.htm |title=Most Extreme Gamma-ray Blast Ever, Seen By Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope |work=Science Daily |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic rays and supernova remnants ===
In February 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/cosmic-rays-source.html |title=NASA's Fermi Closes on Source of Cosmic Rays |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was announced that Fermi-LAT had determined that [[supernova remnant]]s act as enormous accelerators for [[Cosmic ray|cosmic particles]]. This determination fulfills one of the stated missions for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/cosmic_rays.html |title=Cosmic Rays and Supernova Remnants |series=Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |first=Robert |last=Naeye |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background gamma ray sources ===
{{main|Gamma-ray burst progenitors}}
In March 2010 it was announced that [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] are not responsible for most gamma-ray background radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/gamma-ray-dragons.html |title=NASA's Fermi Probes "Dragons" of the Gamma-ray Sky |series=Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though active galactic nuclei do produce some of the gamma-ray radiation detected here on Earth, less than 30% originates from these sources. The search now is to locate the sources for the remaining 70% or so of all gamma-rays detected. Possibilities include [[Star formation|star forming galaxies]], [[Galaxy formation and evolution#Galaxy mergers and the formation of elliptical galaxies|galactic mergers]], and yet-to-be explained dark matter [[Self-interacting dark matter|interactions]].

=== Milky Way Gamma/X-ray bubbles ===
In November 2010, it was announced two gamma-ray and X-ray bubbles were detected around Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=bubbles&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2010-22 |title=Astronomers Find Giant, Previously Unseen Structure in our Galaxy |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |first1=David A. |last1=Aguilar |first2=Christine |last2=Pulliam |date=9 November 2010 |id=Release No. 2010-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bubbles, named Fermi Bubbles, extend about 25 thousand [[light years]] distant above and below the center of the galaxy.&lt;ref name=bubbles/&gt; The galaxy's diffuse gamma-ray fog hampered prior observations, but the discovery team led by D. Finkbeiner, building on research by G. Dobler, worked around this problem.&lt;ref name=bubbles/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Highest energy light ever seen from the Sun ===
In early 2012, Fermi/GLAST observed the highest energy light ever seen in a solar eruption.&lt;ref name=flare&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/highest-energy.html |title=NASA's Fermi Detects the Highest-Energy Light From a Solar Flare |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terrestrial gamma-ray flash observations ===
Fermi telescope has observed and detected numerous [[terrestrial gamma-ray flash]]es and discovered that such flashes can produce 100 trillion positrons, far more than scientists had previously expected.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html |title=NASA's Fermi Catches Thunderstorms Hurling Antimatter into Space |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GRB 130427A ===
[[File:NASA's Fermi, Swift See 'Shockingly Bright' Burst (before and after labels).jpg|thumb|GRB 130427A before and after in more than 100&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]]&lt;!-- million electron volt--&gt; light]]
On 27 April 2013, Fermi detected [[GRB 130427A]], a [[gamma-ray burst]] with one of the highest energy outputs yet recorded.&lt;ref name=nasa1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/shocking-burst.html |title=NASA's Fermi, Swift See 'Shockingly Bright' Burst |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This included detection of a gamma-ray over 94 billion electron volts (GeV).&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; This broke Fermi's previous record detection, by over three times the amount.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;

=== GRB coincident with gravitational wave event GW150914 ===
Fermi reported that its GBM instrument detected a weak gamma-ray burst above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%.&lt;ref name="Connaughton2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fermi GBM Observations of LIGO Gravitational-wave Event GW150914 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |first1=V. |last1=Connaughton |first2=E. |last2=Burns |first3=A. |last3=Goldstein |first4=M.

Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. [[Avi Loeb]] has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star's collapse it triggers a gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref name="fermi_woo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077783-ligos-black-holes-may-have-lived-and-died-inside-a-huge-star/ |title=LIGO's black holes may have lived and died inside a huge star |work=New Scientist |last=Woo |first=Marcus |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loeb"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electromagnetic Counterparts to Black Hole Mergers Detected by LIGO |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first=Abraham |last=Loeb |volume=819 |issue=2 |at=L21 |date=March 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/819/2/L21 |bibcode=2016ApJ...819L..21L |arxiv=1602.04735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRB on BBH"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/127463/did-a-gamma-ray-burst-accompany-ligos-gravitational-wave-detection/ |title=Did a Gamma Ray Burst Accompany LIGO’s Gravity Wave Detection? |work=Universe Today |last=Gough |first=Evan |date=18 February 2016 |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2017, Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor software detected, classified, and localized a gamma-ray burst which was later designated as GRB 170817A. Six minutes later, a single detector at Hanford LIGO registered a gravitational-wave candidate which was consistent with a binary [[neutron star merger]], occurring 2 seconds before the GRB 170817A event. This observation was "the first joint detection of [[GW170817|gravitational]] and [[AT 2017gfo|electromagnetic radiation from a single source]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |first=B.

=== Gamma-ray Burst Monitor ===
The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) (formerly GLAST Burst Monitor) detects sudden flares of [[gamma-ray]]s produced by [[gamma ray burst]]s and [[solar flare]]s. Its [[scintillator]]s are on the sides of the spacecraft to view all of the sky which is not blocked by the Earth. The design is optimized for good resolution in time and photon energy.

"Gamma-ray bursts are so bright we can see them from billions of light years away, which means they occurred billions of years ago, and we see them as they looked then," stated Charles Meegan of NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/11jun_glast2.htm |title=NASA's Newest Space Telescope Blasts Off |publisher=NASA |first=Dauna |last=Coulter |date=11 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617210829/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/11jun_glast2.htm |archivedate=17 June 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor has detected gamma rays from [[positron]]s generated in powerful thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;

=== Large Area Telescope ===
The Large Area Telescope (LAT) detects individual [[gamma rays]] using technology similar to that used in terrestrial [[particle accelerator]]s. [[Photons]] hit thin metal sheets, converting to [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, via a process known as [[pair production]]. These charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon [[microstrip detector]]s, causing [[ionization]] which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge. Researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles. After passing through the tracker, the particles enter the [[calorimeter]], which consists of a stack of [[caesium iodide]] [[scintillator]] crystals to measure the total energy of the particles. The LAT's field of view is large, about 20% of the sky. The resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards, a few [[arc minute]]s for the highest-energy photons and about 3 degrees at 100 [[MeV]]. The LAT is a bigger and better successor to the [[EGRET (telescope)|EGRET]] instrument on [[NASA]]'s [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] satellite in the 1990s. Several countries produced the components of the LAT, who then sent the components for assembly at [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]]. SLAC also hosts the LAT Instrument Science Operations Center, which supports the operation of the LAT during the Fermi mission for the LAT scientific collaboration and for NASA.

== Education and public outreach ==
Education and public outreach are important components of the Fermi project. The main Fermi education and public outreach website at http://glast.sonoma.edu offers gateways to resources for students, educators, scientists, and the public. NASA's [[NASA Education and Public Outreach Group|Education and Public Outreach]] (E/PO) group operates the Fermi education and outreach resources at [[Sonoma State University]].

== Rossi Prize ==
The 2011 [[Bruno Rossi Prize]] was awarded to Bill Atwood, Peter Michelson and the Fermi LAT team "for enabling, through the development of the Large Area Telescope, new insights into neutron stars, supernova remnants, cosmic rays, binary systems, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts."&lt;ref name="Rossi2011"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://aas.org/media/press-releases/astronomers-honored-excellence-research-education-writing-more |title=Astronomers Honored for Excellence in Research, Education, Writing &amp; More |publisher=American Astronomical Society |first=Rick |last=Fienberg |date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the prize was awarded to Roger W.

'''Forest ecology''' is the scientific study of the interrelated patterns, processes, [[flora]], [[fauna]] and [[ecosystem]]s in [[forests]].  The management of forests is known as [[forestry]], [[silviculture]], and [[forest management]].  A forest [[ecosystem]] is a natural woodland unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[Biotic component]]s) in that area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Christopherson. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The forest ecosystem is very important.{{clarify|date=October 2018}}

==Relationship to other branches of ecology==
[[Image: Redwood M D Vaden.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood]] tree in northern California forest, where many trees are managed for preservation and longevity]]

Forest ecology is one branch of a biotically-oriented [[Categorization|classification]] of types of ecological study (as opposed to a classification based on organizational level or complexity, for example [[Population ecology|population]] or [[community ecology]]).  Thus, forests are studied at a number of organizational levels, from the individual [[organism]] to the ecosystem.  However, as the term [[forest]] connotes an area inhabited by more than one [[organism]], forest ecology most often concentrates on the level of the [[population]], [[community]] or ecosystem.  Logically, [[tree]]s are an important component of forest research, but the wide variety of other life forms and [[abiotic components]] in most forests means that other elements, such as [[wildlife]] or [[soil]] [[nutrients]], are often the focal point.  Thus, forest [[ecology]] is a highly diverse and important branch of ecological study.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Forest ecology studies share characteristics and methodological approaches with other areas of [[terrestrial plant]] ecology.  However, the presence of trees makes forest ecosystems and their study unique in numerous ways.

==Community diversity and complexity==

Since trees can grow larger than other plant life-forms, there is the potential for a wide variety of forest structures (or physiognomies).  The infinite number of possible spatial arrangements of trees of varying size and species makes for a highly intricate and diverse micro-environment in which environmental variables such as [[solar radiation]], temperature, [[relative humidity]], and [[wind speed]] can vary considerably over large and small distances.  In addition, an important proportion of a forest ecosystem's [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] is often underground, where soil structure, [[water quality]] and quantity, and levels of various soil nutrients can vary greatly.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Kimmins. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, forests are often highly [[heterogeneous]] environments compared to other [[terrestrial plant]] communities.  This heterogeneity in turn can enable great biodiversity of species of both plants and animals. Some structures, such as tree ferns may be keystone species for a diverse range of other species.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain-Jones N.M, Mc Quillan P and Grove S. (2012) ‘Beetle communities associated with the tree fern Dicksonia antarctica Labill. in Tasmania’ Australian Journal of Entomology. 51, 154-165.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of factors within the forest affect biodiversity; primary factors enhancing wildlife abundance and biodiversity are the presence of diverse tree species within the forest and the absence of [[even aged timber management]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Joseph Burton. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[wild turkey]] thrives when uneven heights and [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] variations exist and its numbers are diminished by even aged timber management.
Forest management techniques that mimic natural disturbance events ([[variable retention forestry]] &lt;ref&gt;Franklin et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt;) can allow community diversity to recover rapidly for a variety of groups including beetles.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain-Jones, N.M, Baker, S.B and Jordan, G (2015). ‘Moving beyond the guild concept: developing a consistent functional trait framework for terrestrial beetles’ Ecological Entomology. 40, 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the biologist Dr. Roberto Cazzolla Gatti and his colleagues tested &lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R., Di Paola, A., Bombelli, A., Noce, S., &amp; Valentini, R. (2017). Exploring the relationship between canopy height and terrestrial plant diversity. Plant Ecology, 218(7), 899-908.&lt;/ref&gt; a global correlation between [[vascular plant]] [[species richness]] (S) and average [[forest canopy]] height (H). They found a significant correlation between H and S both at global and [[Macroclimate|macro-climate]] scales, with the strongest confidence in the tropics. The authors of this study suggested that the higher the forest canopy, the bigger the number of species a forest can host.

==Energy flux==
[[File:RockyPointTrailAsFirebreak.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Forest ecologists are interested in the effects of large disturbances, such as [[wildfire]]s. [[Montana]], United States.]]

Forests accumulate large amounts of standing biomass, and many are capable of accumulating it at high rates, i.e. they are highly productive.  Such high levels of biomass and tall vertical structures represent large stores of [[potential energy]] that can be converted to [[kinetic energy]] under the right circumstances.  Two such conversions of great importance are [[wildfires|fires]] and [[windthrow|treefall]]s, both of which radically alter the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] and the physical environment where they occur.  Also, in forests of high productivity, the rapid growth of the trees themselves induces biotic and environmental changes, although at a slower rate and lower intensity than relatively instantaneous [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] such as fires.

==Death and regeneration==
Woody material, often referred to as [[coarse woody debris]], [[decomposition|decay]]s relatively slowly in many forests in comparison to most other [[organic matter|organic]] materials, due to a combination of environmental factors and wood chemistry (see [[lignin]]).  Trees growing in [[arid]] and/or cold environments do so especially slowly.  Thus, tree trunks and branches can remain on the forest floor for long periods, affecting such things as wildlife [[habitat]], fire behavior, and tree [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] processes.

==Water==
Lastly, forest trees store large amounts of water because of their large size and anatomical/physiological characteristics.  They are therefore important regulators of hydrological processes, especially those involving groundwater [[hydrology]] and local evaporation and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall/snowfall]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smerdon|first=Brian D, et al.,|year=2009|title=An overview of the effects of forest management on ground water hydrology|url=http://forrex.org/sites/default/files/publications/jem_archive/ISS50/vol10_no1_art4.pdf|journal=BC Journal of Ecosystems and Management|volume=10 |issue=1|pages=22–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, forest ecological studies are sometimes closely aligned with [[meteorology|meteorological]] and hydrological studies in regional ecosystem or resource planning studies. Perhaps more importantly the duff or leaf litter can form a major repository of water storage. When this litter is removed or compacted ( through grazing or human overuse), erosion and flooding are exacerbated as well as deprivation of dry season water for forest organisms.

==Ecological potential of forestal species==

The ecological potential of a particular species is a measure of its capacity to effectively compete in a given geographical area, ahead of other species, as they all try to occupy a natural space. For some areas it has been quantified, as for instance by Hans-Jürgen Otto, for central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otto|first=Hans-Jürgen|title=Écologie Forestière|year=1998|publisher=Institut pour le Développement Forestier|location=Paris|isbn=9782904740657|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He takes three groups of parameters:

:*Related to site requirements: Tolerance to low temperatures, tolerance to dry climate, frugality.

:*Specific qualities: [[Shade tolerance]], height growth, stability, longevity, regeneration capacity.

:*Specific risks: Resistance to late freezing, resistance to wind/ice storm, resistance to fire, resistance to biotic agents.

Every parameter is scored between 0 and 5 for each considered species, and then a global mean value calculated. A value above 3.5 is considered high, below 3.0 low, and intermediate for those in between. In this study ''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'' has a score of 3.82, ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]'' 3.08 and ''[[Juglans regia]]'' 2.92; and are examples of the three categories.

(See also the Form-based section of the [[Zoning in the United States#Form-based|Zoning in the United States]] article.)

A '''Form-Based Code''' (FBC) is a means of regulating land development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle, with a lesser focus on [[land use]], through municipal regulations. A FBC is a regulation, not a mere guideline, adopted into city, town, or county law and offers a powerful alternative to conventional zoning regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form-Based Codes Defined|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/definition|website=Form Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form-Based Codes are a new response to the modern challenges of [[urban sprawl]], deterioration of historic neighborhoods, and neglect of pedestrian safety in new development. Tradition has declined as a guide to development patterns, and the widespread adoption by cities of single-use [[zoning]] regulations has discouraged compact, walkable urbanism. Form-Based Codes are a tool to address these deficiencies, and to provide local governments the regulatory means to achieve development objectives with greater certainty.

==Scope==
Form-Based Codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks. The regulations and standards in Form-Based Codes, presented in both diagrams and words, are keyed to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of development rather than only distinctions in land-use types. This is in contrast to conventional [[zoning]]'s focus on the micromanagement and segregation of land uses, and the control of development intensity through abstract and uncoordinated parameters (e.g., [[floor area ratio]]s, dwelling units per acre, [[Setback (land use)|setback]]s, parking ratios) to the neglect of an integrated built form. Not to be confused with design guidelines or general statements of policy, form-based codes are regulatory, not advisory.

Form-Based Codes are drafted to achieve a community vision based on time-tested forms of urbanism. Ultimately, a Form-Based Code is a tool;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Implementation Tools for Walkable Urban Places|url=http://opticosdesign.com/projects/form-based-code-tools-walkable-urban-places/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of development outcomes is dependent on the quality and objectives of the community plan that a code implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: What Is a Form-Based Code?|url=http://plannersweb.com/2014/12/fbc1/|website=Planners Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Form-Based Codes are part of a long history of shaping the built landscape. Such efforts go back to the urban designs of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], the planning of cities in ancient China, and Roman town planning. The [[Laws of the Indies]], promulgated by the Spanish Crown starting in the 16th century, established some basic urban form requirements for colonial towns in the Americas. [[William Penn]] when planning [[Philadelphia]] in the 17th century did not shy from precise urban form requirements when he said, "Let every house be in a line, or upon a line, as much as may be." {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During the 18th century, Baroque [[urban design]] commonly brought buildings to the fronts of their lots with common facade treatments. [[Baron Haussmann]], appointed by [[Napoleon III]] to oversee the redevelopment of Paris in the 19th century, stipulated precise ratios of building heights to street widths; disposition and sizes of windows and doors on building facades; consistent planting of street trees; and standardization of material colors to bring unity and harmony to the public environment.

===Emergence===
Regulating urban form is a challenge in modern democracies. Design guidelines adopted by municipalities, without legal enforceability, often invite capricious observance, thus failing to produce the comprehensive changes required to produce satisfying public places. When public planning exercises fail to produce predictable results, citizens often rebel against any development. In addition, from early in the twentieth century to the present, attempts at regulating the built landscape have usually been done for reasons that neglect community form, that are more concerned with the uses of property and impacts of scale than the form that development takes.  And a planning profession that in recent decades has focused on policy, neglecting design, encouraged an abstract intellectual response to problems that are largely physical in nature. {{Citation needed|reason=Text includes conclusions without foundation.|date=December 2016}}

The development of modern Form-Based Codes was started by architects, urban designers, and physical planners frustrated by the ineffectiveness of past criticisms of sprawl development and the failure of critics to propose realistic alternatives. These professionals, used to thinking physically about community problems, began the search for systematic physical solutions in the 1970s. Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] published ''A Pattern Language'' in 1977, a compendium of physical rules for designing humane buildings and places. [[Ian McHarg]] developed systematic mapping tools to encourage deliberate development patterns sensitive to local environmental conditions. Traditional Neighborhood Development ordinances were drafted beginning in the early 1990s as sets of development regulations to promote traditional neighborhood forms in new development projects. TND ordinances were typically adopted as an optional regulatory procedure that developers could request in place of conventional zoning . But their design regulations were not mapped to parcels or streets in advance, so lacked predictability of outcomes; TND ordinances proved to be an instructive effort, but showed few results.

Meanwhile, the accelerating scale of worldwide urban growth and the rapid expansion of the extent of cities heightened the need for regulatory tools better equipped to deal with such growth. The first serious attempt at creating a modern form-based code was done in 1982 to guide the development of the Florida resort town of [[Seaside, Florida|Seaside]] by the husband and wife design team of [[Andres Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]]. Realizing that designing an entire town would be an overwhelming task and would in the end lack the visual serendipity that only comes from myriad creative minds at work, they created a design code that established basic physical standards mapped to parcels, and then invited developers and architects to put their own distinctive stamp on their projects—but operating within those standards. The Seaside Code proved very successful; the resulting development of the town of Seaside is widely recognized as one of the most important and appealing planning efforts of the post-World War II era.

Duany/Plater-Zyberk's codes and the work of subsequent form-based code practitioners are not top-down mandates from imperial designers as in the baroque era or the wishful thinking of design guidelines that lack enforceability, but are instead legal regulations adopted by units of local government. As regulations they possess [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]; violators of the regulations can be cited, and their invocation or retraction must go through a legislative process. As such, the community plays a more forceful role in shaping its physical future.

[[Image:FBC-effect-animation.gif|frame|right|Form-based codes produce more consistent and predictable patterns of development in relationship to the public realm than typically achieved through conventional zoning regulations.]]

=== Recent developments ===
Although the Seaside code was commissioned by a private developer, most current codes are commissioned by counties and municipalities. Since Seaside, the scale of Form-Based Coding projects has grown. Form-Based Coding can be applied at many scales, from a two-block main street to a county-wide region. An early Form-Based Code was adopted for downtown West Palm Beach in 1995. A significant code for a major urban arterial, the Columbia Pike in Arlington County, Virginia, was adopted in 2003 (Ferrell Madden Associates). A regional FBC was adopted in 2006 by St. Lucie County, Florida (Spikowski Associates, Dover-Kohl Partners). Duany/Plater-Zyberk has drafted a model FBC that is also a [[transect (urban)|transect]]-based code that can be calibrated for local needs—the [[SMARTCODE]]. Its first attempted customization was done for Vicksburg, Mississippi in 2001 (Mouzon &amp; Greene). The lessons learned there led to the first California adoption of a citywide Form-Based Code for the City of Sonoma in March 2003 (Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates, Moule &amp; Polyzoides), followed on June 16, 2003, by the first SmartCode adopted in the U.S., for central Petaluma, California (Fisher and Hall Urban Design, Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates). SmartCodes are now being calibrated for Miami, Florida and Hurricane Katrina ravaged communities in Mississippi and Louisiana, along with cities as diverse as Taos, NM, Michigan City, IN, Jamestown, RI, Lawrence, KS, New Castle, DE, and Bran, Romania. Planetary climate change that must be mitigated by changes in the human environment will no doubt be an inducement to form-based and transect-based coding in the future.

The Cincinnati Form-Based Code adopted in 2013 is designed to be applied citywide in an incremental way, neighborhood by neighborhood. The code establishes transect zones and specifies standards for transects, building types, frontage types, walkable neighborhoods, and thoroughfares that can be adapted to each neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Form-Based Code|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/codes/cincinnati-form-based-code|website=Form-Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yung|first1=John|title=Here's how Cincinnati's form-based codes are designed to spur redevelopment|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/01/21/heres-how-cincinnatis-form-based.html?page=all|website=Cincinnati Business Courier|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaufort County, South Carolina adopted one of the first multijurisdictional Form-Based Codes at the end of 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starkey|first1=Jackie|title=Beaufort looks to develop different planning method|url=http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_ffd55024-9e95-11e4-916f-83892b1f4c00.html|website=Carteret County News-Times|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beaufort County Eliminates PUDs in Favor of Walkable Neighborhoods!|url=http://opticosdesign.com/beaufort-county-council-votes-9-1-adopt-new-development-code/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the County, the City of Beaufort and the City of Port Royal came together to hire Opticos Design, Inc. in Berkeley, California to draft the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steuteville|first1=Rob|title=Beaufort County, SC, commissions form-based code|url=http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/13617/beaufort-county-sc-commissions-form-based-code|website=Better Cities &amp; Towns|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the growing number of consultants advertising themselves as capable of writing FBCs but with little or no training, in 2004 the non-profit [http://formbasedcodes.org/ Form-Based Codes Institute] was organized to establish standards and teach best practices. In addition, SmartCode workshops are regularly scheduled by PlaceMakers.com, SmartCodePro.com, and SmartCodeLocal.com. In Spring 2014, a new graduate-level studio dedicated to Form-Based Coding was launched at California State Polytechnic University. “Form-Based Codes in the Context of Integrated Urbanism,” is one of the only full courses on the subject in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opticos Goes to School on Form-Based Codes|url=http://opticosdesign.com/opticos-goes-school-form-based-codes/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course is taught by Tony Perez,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Perez, Director of Form-Based Coding|url=http://opticosdesign.com/people/tony-perez/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of Form-Based Coding at Opticos Design; it is expected to be repeated for Spring 2015.

==Components==
Form-Based Codes commonly include the following elements:

* ''Regulating Plan.''  A plan or map of the regulated area designating the locations where different building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical character of the area being coded.
* ''Public Space Standards.'' Specifications for the elements within the public realm (e.g., sidewalks, travel lanes, on-street parking, street trees, street furniture, etc.).
* ''Building Form Standards''. Regulations controlling the configuration, features, and functions of buildings that define and shape the public realm.
* ''Administration.'' A clearly defined application and project review process.
* ''Definitions.'' A glossary to ensure the precise use of technical terms.

[[Image:FBC TypicalComponents.jpg|frame|center|At a minimum, a Form-Based Code, written to enable or preserve a specific urban form, consists of building form and public space standards keyed to a regulating plan. An urban design is the intention or goal, the form-based code is the regulatory tool to achieve it.]]&lt;br /&gt;
Form-based codes also sometimes include:
* ''Architectural Standards.'' Regulations controlling external architectural materials and quality.
* ''Landscaping Standards.'' Regulations controlling landscape design and plant materials on private property as they impact public spaces (e.g. regulations about parking lot screening and shading, maintaining sight lines, insuring unobstructed pedestrian movements, etc.).
* ''Signage Standards.'' Regulations controlling allowable signage sizes, materials, illumination, and placement.
* ''Environmental Resource Standards.'' Regulations controlling issues such as storm water drainage and infiltration, development on slopes, tree protection, solar access, etc.
* ''Annotation.'' Text and illustrations explaining the intentions of specific code provisions.

=== Building Form Standards ===
[[Image:FBC BldgFormStandards2.gif|frame|right|Building attributes that can be regulated in a Building Form Standard, in this case for a hypothetical street in a neighborhood center]]
The types of buildings that make for a lively main street are different from the types of buildings that make for a quiet residential street. Building Form Standards are sets of enforceable design regulations for controlling building types and how they impact the public realm. These Standards are mapped to streets on a Regulating Plan. Building Form Standards can control such things as: the alignment of buildings to the street; how close buildings are to sidewalks; the visibility and accessibility of building entrances; minimum and maximum buildings heights; minimum or maximum lot frontage coverage; minimum and maximum amounts of window coverage on facades; physical elements required on buildings (e.g. stoops, porches, types of permitted balconies); and the general usage of floors (e.g. office, residential, or retail). These regulations are less concerned with architectural styles and designs than in how buildings shape public spaces. If a local government also wishes to regulate the quality of architecture—for example to preserve the historic appearance of a neighborhood—then Architectural Standards should be drafted in addition to Building Form Standards.

=== Public Space Standards ===
[[Image:DPZ SmartCode9 OptionModule ThoroughfareAssemlies Page 21.png|right|thumb|An example of a Public Space Standard for public streets from the SmartCode 9.0]]
Public Space Standards control the physical form of squares, parks, the public right-of-way of streets, and other public spaces. Public spaces are typically under the control of public works, parks, and highway departments. Streets, being the most common public spaces in a community, are the most frequently regulated. Public Space Standards for streets are typically described with dimensioned cross-sections and/or plan views showing travel lane widths, sidewalk widths, street tree and street lamp placement, locations of transit lanes, and the placement of architecture. Plan view diagrams may also be included showing spacing of street trees and lamps, and the radii of the curves of street corners.

==Identification==
How does one determine if a development regulation is a form-based code and a well-crafted one? Form-based codes generally receive affirmative answers to all of the following questions:

* Is the code's focus primarily on regulating urban form and less on land use?
* Is the code regulatory rather than advisory?
* Does the code emphasize standards and parameters for form with predictable physical outcomes (build-to lines, frontage type requirements, etc.) rather than relying on numerical parameters (floor-area ratios, density, etc.) whose outcomes are impossible to predict?
* Does the code require private buildings to shape public space through the use of building form standards with specific requirements for building placement?
* Does the code promote and/or conserve an interconnected street network and pedestrian-scaled blocks?
* Are regulations and standards keyed to specific locations on a regulating plan?
* Are the diagrams in the code unambiguous, clearly labeled, and accurate in their presentation of spatial configurations? &lt;ref&gt;[http://formbasedcodes.org/take-quiz FBCI quiz]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
How are form-based codes incorporated into a local government's development regulations? There are three basic ways:

'''Mandatory codes.''' This is the most common adoption approach. It has the most regulatory  "teeth"—compliance is required. But it is the most ambitious of the approaches, making the new code a seamless part of, or a complete replacement for, the existing zoning ordinance. The form-based code can be adopted as a new zoning district or as an overlay district.

Unique to California and a few other states with appropriate enabling legislation, form-based codes can be contained within a planning document called a "specific plan," which can completely override the zoning ordinance for a given geographic area. Since it stands apart from the zoning ordinance, it can be more creative in its format, giving the coder greater freedom in designing for user-friendliness through page layout, diagrams, and illustrations. Also, the urban design plan and the implementing regulations are bundled together, greatly improving user comprehension. But since the specific plan is not securely integrated within the existing zoning ordinance, it may be more politically vulnerable to retraction.

Example adopted codes:
*''Winter Springs Town Center District Code'', [[Winter Springs, Florida]]
*''Farmers Branch Station Area Form-Based Code'', [[Farmers Branch, Texas]]
*''Central Petaluma Specific Plan and SmartCode'', [[Petaluma, California]]

'''Optional (parallel) codes.''' An optional or parallel form-based code serves as an alternative to, but doesn't replace, a present zoning ordinance. Compliance is voluntary. The developer has the choice of complying with the form-based code or the zoning ordinance, but it must be one or the other. This approach makes sense when compliance with the zoning ordinance is so difficult and time consuming that most development is stymied. Thus a developer has the option of following a form-based code that will streamline and simplify his development process. But, for a local government to maintain two different sets of development regulations for one area is added work which can be significant if the area is extensive. Also depending on the area being regulated, if some developers are choosing the form-based code and others nearby are not, the possibilities for integrated place-making can be compromised.

Example codes:
*''Columbia Pike Form-Based Code'', [[Arlington County, Virginia]]
*''Pike Road SmartCode'', [[Pike Road, Alabama]]
*''Pass Christian SmartCode'', [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]]

'''Floating-zone codes.''' Floating zones are most often written to facilitate master-planned suburban communities and are called PUDs (planned unit developments). However, floating-zone codes are now being written as form-based codes to facilitate urban development. A floating-zone form-based code does not contain a regulating plan but includes instructions and standards for developers to follow when they prepare a regulating plan for their property (e.g. maximum block dimensions, street types, building types, open space accessibility, sidewalk widths.) This distinguishes floating-zone codes from the other two approaches–developers rather than the local government create the regulating plans and the urban designs that they facilitate, but the local government sets the standards. Floating-zone codes allow local governments to establish urban form standards for development without incurring the expense of developing urban design and regulating plans. Developers are given the freedom, within clear parameters, to prepare regulating plans for their property that are likely to meet government approval. A developer submits his or her regulating plan for approval through the rezoning process. Upon rezoning, the floating zone replaces the prior zoning for that property and the regulating plan becomes binding.

Example codes:
*''Miami-Dade County TND District'', [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]
*''Towns, Villages, Countryside Land Development Regulations'', [[Saint Lucie County, Florida]]
*''Flowood SmartCode'', [[Flowood, Mississippi]]
*''Montgomery SmartCode'', [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (not to be confused with the mandatory SmartCode for downtown)

Initially a local government may wish to adopt a form-based code for its entire jurisdiction following one approach, but find this too ambitious with short-term resource and political limitations requiring a more focused effort. Instead it may wish to follow one approach for a smaller area, and then phase in other areas using the same or different approaches as needed. Or a floating-zone code could be adopted for large areas awaiting the public resources coming later that would allow the local government to draft its own regulating plans. Whatever approach is followed—or combination of approaches—simplicity and consistency helps at the permit desk where the code is implemented.

For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of [[time]]. The current [[sexagesimal]] [[Numeral system|system]] of time [[systems of measurement|measurement]] dates to approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|{{sc|bc}}]]&lt;!--See talk page--&gt; from the  [[Sumer]]ians.

The  Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large [[obelisk]]s to track the movement of the [[sun]]. They also developed [[water clock]]s, which were probably first used in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who called them ''clepsydrae''. The [[Zhou dynasty]] is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2000{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.

Other ancient timekeeping devices include the [[candle clock]], used in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Japan]], [[England]] and Mesopotamia; the [[Sundial#Shepherd dials – Timesticks|timestick]], widely used in [[India]] and [[Tibet]], as well as some parts of [[Europe]]; and the [[hourglass]], which functioned similarly to a water clock.  The [[sundial]], another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.  It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the [[gnomon]] was not aligned with the [[Earth's axis]]).

The earliest known clock with a [[water-power]]ed [[escapement]] mechanism, which transferred [[rotational energy]] into intermittent motions,&lt;ref name="Samual l. Jackson 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} in [[ancient Greece]];&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=343–369 (356f.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science and technology in China|Chinese engineers]] later invented clocks incorporating [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="needham 411"/&gt; followed by [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Iranian engineers]] inventing water clocks driven by [[gear]]s and [[Maintaining power|weights]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656.  The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of [[microelectronics]] in the 1960s made [[quartz clock]]s both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and [[wristwatch]]es.

Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the [[International Atomic Time]]; a [[standardized]] civil system, [[Coordinated Universal Time]], is based on atomic time.

[[Image:Louxor obelisk Paris dsc00780.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Luxor Obelisk]] in [[Place de la Concorde]], [[Paris, France]]]]

Egyptian shadow clocks divided [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"/&gt; One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice|winter]] [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=bruton/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2 April 2008 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html| archivedate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, was similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]]. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The ''T'' was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at [[noon]], so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;Barnett, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/hourglass.html |title= How does an hourglass measure time? |accessdate=31 March 2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Berlev, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them.

The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a [[siphon]]. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar.

In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in [[court]]; later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Plato]] says that "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on".&lt;ref name="Water clocks in court"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook|last=Humphrey|first=John William|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=518–519|accessdate=11 April 2008|isbn=0-415-06136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention occurs in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]'': "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known as The Golden Ass|last=Apuleius|first=Lucius|others=Translated by Robert Graves|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|year=1951|page=54|authorlink3=Apuleius|isbn=0-374-50532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.&lt;ref name="Waterclockhistory"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rees, Abraham |title=Rees's clocks, watches, and chronometers (1819–20); a selection from the Cyclopaedia, or Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature |publisher=C.

Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QcE2pBCLE8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Empires of Time: Calendars, Clocks, and Cultures|last=Aveni|first=Anthony F.|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2000|isbn=1-86064-602-6|accessdate=22 June 2008|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by [[water pressure]]: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman [[horology|horologists]] beginning in 100{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Collier, James Lincoln |title=Clocks |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=[[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], NY |year=2003 |page=25 |isbn=0-7614-1538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 270{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}500, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe.

Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer [[Theodosius of Bithynia]], for example, is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J.

[[File:Ancient water clock used in qanat of gonabad 2500 years ago.JPG|thumb|Ancient Persian clock]]
[[File:میرآب.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran]]
According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using [[water clock]]s in 328{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zeebad]], dates back to 500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86 Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383], in Persian&lt;/ref&gt;

Water clocks, or ''Fenjaan'', in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"&gt;[http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 |date=April 29, 2014 }} Amordad News (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"/&gt;

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''khaneh fenjaan''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

===Ancient and medieval China===
{{See also|History of science and technology in China|Su Song}}
[[Joseph Needham]] speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from [[Mesopotamia]], occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, during the [[Shang Dynasty]], and at the latest by the 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. By the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]], in 202{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, [[Zhang Heng]] added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor [[Shen Kuo]]. Around 610, this design was trumped by two [[Sui Dynasty]] inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the [[steelyard balance]].&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |pages=479–480 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that:
{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;[the balance clepsydra] permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.&lt;ref name=needham/&gt;}}

==Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods==
The term '[[clock]]' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from [[wristwatch]]es to the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. The English word ''clock'' is said to derive from the [[Middle English]] ''clokke'', [[Old French|Old North French]] ''cloque'', or [[Middle Dutch]] ''clocke'', all of which mean ''[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]'', and are derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'', also meaning bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clock |title=Clock Etymology |accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Clock|title=Merriam-Webster Online: Clock|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=[[Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/31/C0413100.html |accessdate=4 December 2007 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author=executive editor, Joseph P.

The clock continued to be improved, with the first [[pendulum clock]] being designed and built in the 17th century.

===Candle clocks===
{{Main|Candle clock}}
[[Image:Kerzenuhr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[candle clock]]]]
The earliest mention of [[candle clock]]s comes from a Chinese poem, written in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm |title=History of Time |accessdate=8 April 2008 |last=Flamer |first=Keith |year=2006|work=International Watch Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162954/http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm|archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King [[Alfred the Great]]. It consisted of six candles made from 72&amp;nbsp;[[pennyweight]]s of wax, each {{convert|12|in|cm}} high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.&lt;ref name="alfred"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |url=http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |title=Clockworks: Candle clock |accessdate=16 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126001057/http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a [[Dial (measurement)|dial]] to display the time and, for the first time, employed a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet fitting]], a [[Fastener|fastening mechanism]] still used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Routledge Hill]] described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:

{{quote|The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

[[Image:Oil-lamp clock00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[oil-lamp clock]]]]

A variation on this theme were [[oil-lamp clock]]s. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.

===Incense clocks===
{{Main article|Incense clock}}
In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, [[incense clock]]s were used in the [[Far East]], and were fashioned in several different forms.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incense]] clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the [[Shōsōin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bXxHSZkWssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|last=Pagani|first=Catherine|page=209|isbn=0-472-11208-2|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its characters are not Chinese, but [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QerLX9x8pIkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics|pages=160–161|last=Schafer|first=Edward|year=1963|isbn=0-520-05462-8|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in [[Buddhist]] ceremonies, [[Edward H.

While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the [[Song dynasty]]. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"&gt;Bedini, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundials===
{{Main|Sundial}}
[[Image:SevillaGlorietaDelReloj01.JPG|thumb|A 20th-century [[sundial]] in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain]]
Sundials had been used for timekeeping since [[Ancient Egypt]]. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12&amp;nbsp;equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The [[sundial]] was further developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]]. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the sundial |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=2 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010044606/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acceptance of [[heliocentrism]] and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the [[Renaissance]], when they were built in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Mayall, Margaret W. |author2=Mayall, R.

===Hourglass===
{{Main|Hourglass}}
Since the [[hourglass]] was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting ''Allegory of Good Government'', by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], from 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Frugoni p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices.

===Clocks with gears and escapements===
The earliest instance of a liquid-driven escapement was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] engineer [[Philo of Byzantium]] (fl. 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) in his technical treatise ''Pneumatics'' (chapter 31) where he likens the escapement mechanism of a [[washstand]] [[automaton]] with those as employed in (water) clocks.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"/&gt; Another early clock to use [[escapement]]s was built during the 7th century in [[Chang'an]], by [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] monk and mathematician, [[Yi Xing]], and government official [[Liang Lingzan]].&lt;ref name="ASME"&gt;{{Cite book|last=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|title=Proceedings of the 2002 ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|isbn=0-7918-3624-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafer"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schafer | first = Edward H. | authorlink = Edward H.

[It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit&amp;nbsp;... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=The mechanical clock |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |accessdate=16 April 2008 | date=October 1988|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Yi Xing's clock was a [[water clock]], it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by [[Zhang Sixun]] by replacing the water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which remains liquid down to {{convert|-39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Zhang implemented the changes into his [[clock tower]], which was about {{convert|10|m}} tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by [[Su Song]], in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating [[armillary sphere]]—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with [[mannequins]] ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in horology.&lt;ref name="needham 411"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |page=411 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the capital of [[Kaifeng]], it was dismantled by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin army]] and sent to the capital of [[Fanyang|Yanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]), where they were unable to put it back together.

During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century.

====Wristwatch====
{{Main article|Wristwatch|history of watches}}
[[File:Leicester as Governor-General engraving by Goltzius.jpg|thumb|upright|right|One of the earliest references to a wristwatch – an 'arm watch' given to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] by her favourite [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].]]
The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. [[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the [[waistcoat]] was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], the consort to [[Queen Victoria]], introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as [[bracelet]]s, for women.&lt;ref name="Evolu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=THe Evolution of the Wristwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

During the [[Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at the Sudan in 1898]] and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

[[File:First Battle of Passchendaele - barrage map (colour balance).jpg|thumb|right|Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry.]]
These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], an early aviator, asked his friend, a French [[watchmaker]] called [[Louis Cartier]], to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lego Mindstorms NXT Hacker's Guide|last=Prochnow|first=Dave|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-148147-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from [[Kew Observatory]] in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|author=John E. Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British [[War Office|War Department]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Paul|title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7868-8571-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cortjump1.jpg|thumb|A ''Cortébert'' wristwatch from the 1920s.|left]]
The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in [[Coventry]], was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] it was noted that "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

====Equation clock====
{{Main|Equation clock}}
In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, [[equation clock]]s were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent [[solar time]], as would be shown by a [[sundial]]. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the [[equation of time]] made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.

Astronomers in particular needed a better tool for timing the transit of stars and thereby creating more accurate maps of the heavens. The pendulum proved to be the key to boosting the accuracy and dependability of timekeepers. [[Galileo Galilei]], the Italian physicist and astronomer, and others before him experimented with pendulums, but a young Dutch astronomer and mathematician named Christiaan Huygens devised the first pendulum clock on Christmas Day in 1656. (...) Pendulum clocks were about 100 times as accurate as their predecessors, reducing a typical gain or loss of 15 minutes a day to about a minute a week. News of the invention spread rapidly, and by 1660 English and French artisans were developing their own versions of this new timekeeper. &lt;br/&gt; In 1675 Huygens devised his next major improvement, the spiral balance spring. (...) The spiral balance spring revolutionized the accuracy of watches, enabling them to keep time to within a minute a day. This advance sparked an almost immediate rise in the market for watches, which were now no longer typically worn on a chain around the neck but were carried in a pocket, a wholly new fashion in clothing." |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "the most ingenious watchmaker of all time" (in [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]'s own words).&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007).

Innovations to the mechanical clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th.&lt;ref name="Davies434"/&gt; In the 1580s, the Italian [[polymath]] [[Galileo Galilei]] investigated the regular swing of the [[pendulum]], and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockets"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies |first=Eryl |title=Pockets: Inventions |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=0-7513-5184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; The first pendulum clock was designed and built by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], in 1656.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds, very accurate for their time.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;

In [[England]], the manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up.&lt;ref name="histworld"/&gt; The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the [[grandfather clock]]) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the [[anchor escapement]] mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa072801a.htm |title=The History of Mechanical Pendulum Clocks and Quartz Clocks |work=about.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in about 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900|last=Derry|first=T.

To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/clock.htm|title=How Pendulum Clocks Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an "unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision".&lt;ref name="Woods100"&gt;Woods, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods103"&gt;Woods, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] persuaded nine fellow Jesuits "to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day".&lt;ref name="Woods103"/&gt; They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens.&lt;ref name="Woods100"/&gt;

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day.  The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a [[harmonic oscillator]] like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed [[resonant frequency]] and resisted oscillating at other rates.  This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="nistrevolution"/&gt; resulting in the addition of the [[Clock face|minute hand]] to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13458392&amp;search_terms=DTL59|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1737|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate [[pocket watch]]es possible.&lt;ref name="Pockets"/&gt;  This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref name="histworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF CLOCKS|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

===Marine chronometer===

[[File:Harrison H4 clock in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper 1767.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings of [[John Harrison|Harrison]]'s H4 [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] of 1761, published in ''The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper'', 1767.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aB8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Marine chronometer]]s are clocks used at sea as [[time standard]]s, to determine [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name=marinechrono/&gt;
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually [[Greenwich Mean Time]]—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock.&lt;ref name=marinechrono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/museum/nwcm/galleries/marine/marine.htm |title=Marine Chronometers Gallery |accessdate=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html |title=Science News – The Marine Chronometer |accessdate=20 May 2008 |first=Jérôme |last=Marchildon |publisher=[[Manitoba Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919035618/http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longitudeprize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |title=Chronometers, precision watches, and timekeepers |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |location=[[Greenwich]] |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029165741/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[Image:MIH-film12 color cerrected denoise.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-barrel box chronometer.]]
After the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]] where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[Yorkshire]] carpenter [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.

In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

[[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], a Scottish clock and instrument maker, was the first to invent and patent the [[electric clock]] in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[pendulum]] and an [[electric current]] is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.

===Atomic clock===
{{Main article|Atomic clock}}
Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in practical use today. Accurate to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, they are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNwfG5hQ7-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA484,M1|title=Sky and Ocean Joined: The U.S. Naval Observatory, 1830–2000|last=Dick|first=Stephen|page=484|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81599-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first accurate atomic clock, a [[caesium standard]] based on a certain transition of the [[caesium-133]] atom, was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clock and watch-making industry==
{{Main article|Clockmaking|Watchmaking}}
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|A [[pocket watch]]]]
The first professional clockmakers came from the [[guild]]s of [[locksmith]]s and [[jeweller]]s. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.&lt;ref name="Davies435" /&gt;

[[Paris]] and [[Blois]] were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as [[Julien Le Roy]], clockmaker of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.&lt;ref name="Davies435"&gt;Davies, Norman; p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500&amp;nbsp;watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Getty Center]]|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=556 |title=Julien Le Roy |accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], the French government briefly mandated [[decimal time|decimal clocks]], with a day divided into 10&amp;nbsp;hours of 100&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;Alder, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer and mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; A clock in the [[Palais des Tuileries]] kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Alder162"&gt;Alder, pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt; Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the [[metric system]], and it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Alder162"/&gt;

In Germany, [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]] were the early clockmaking centers, and the [[Black Forest]] came to specialize in wooden [[cuckoo clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Antiques|last=Shull|first=Thelma|publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co.|year=1963|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pocketwatch movement.png|thumb|left|220px|An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia.]]
The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the [[City of London]], the [[West End of London]], [[Soho]] where many skilled French [[Huguenot]]s settled and later in [[Clerkenwell]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] was established in 1631 as one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London.

[[Thomas Tompion]] was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury [[pendulum]], and his pupil [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] who created the first [[lever escapement]]. Famous clockmakers of this period included [[Joseph Windmills]], Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and [[Christopher Pinchbeck]] who invented the alloy [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|pinchbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22169|title=Clock and Watch-Making|publisher=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later famous horologists included [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, [[Thomas Earnshaw]] who was the first to make these available to the public, [[Daniel Quare]], who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of [[consumerism]] in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England: Where watchmaking all began|url=http://www.watchpro.com/england-where-watchmaking-all-began/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of [[Huguenot]] craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry "gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches". The leading firm of the day was [[Patek Philippe]], founded by [[Antoni Patek]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Adrien Philippe]] of [[Bern]].&lt;ref name="Davies435"/&gt;

'''Horse behavior''' is best understood from the view that [[horse]]s are [[Predation|prey]] animals with a well-developed [[fight-or-flight]] response, but can act like predators to defend their territory or herd, as when chasing or biting weaker horses, ponies, mules, small animals or people in their way. A horse's first reaction to a sudden threat is often to flee (known as "spooking"), to run for a short distance and circle back, although sometimes they stand their ground and defend themselves or their offspring in cases where flight is untenable, such as when a foal would be threatened.&lt;ref name="KinseyDenison"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kinsey |first=J. M. |last2=Denison |first2=Jennifer |title=Backcountry Basics |location=Colorado Springs, CO |publisher=Western Horseman Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-911647-84-6 |chapter=Inside Your Horse's Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, because of their [[physiology]] horses are also suited to a number of work and entertainment-related tasks. Humans [[domesticated]] horses thousands of years ago, and they have been used by humans ever since.  Through selective breeding, some breeds of horses have been bred to be quite docile, particularly certain large [[draft horse]]s.  On the other hand, most light horse riding [[List of horse breeds|breeds]] were developed for speed, agility, alertness, and endurance; building on natural qualities that extended from their wild ancestors.

Horses' instincts can be used to human advantage to create a bond between human and horse.  These techniques vary, but are part of the art of [[horse training]].

==The "fight-or-flight" response==
Horses evolved from small mammals whose survival depended on their ability to flee from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCall |first=C.A. |year=2006 |title= Understanding your horses’ behaviour|website=Alabama Cooperative Extension System |location= Alabama |accessdate= October 21, 2013 |url= http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-1305/index2.tmpl }}&lt;/ref&gt; This survival mechanism still exists in the modern domestic horse. Humans have removed many predators from the life of the domestic horse; however, its first instinct when frightened is to escape, such as bolting when hearing a strange noise in tree branches above. If running is not possible, the horse resorts to biting, kicking, striking or rearing to protect itself. Many of the horse’s natural behavior patterns, such as herd-formation and [[Social facilitation in animals|social facilitation]] of activities, are directly related to their being a prey species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greene |first1=B. |last2=Comerford |first2=P. |year= 2009 |title= Horse Fight vs Flight instinct |website= extension.org |accessdate=October 23, 2013 |url= http://www.extension.org/pages/23342/horse-fight-vs-flight-instinct#.Umeyr_mnpLY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fight-or-flight]] response involves nervous impulses which result in [[hormone]] secretions into the bloodstream. When a horse reacts to a threat, it may initially "freeze" in preparation to take flight.&lt;ref name="tellingtonttouch.com"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hood |first=R. |year=2001 |title= The 5 F’s –Flight, Fight, Freeze, Fidget, Faint, TEAMM Connections, vol 3 (no issue given) |accessdate= October 22, 2013 |url= http://www.tellingtonttouch.com/Print/5fs.htm|website=tellingtonttouch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fight-or-flight reaction begins in the brain [[amygdala]], which triggers a neural response in the [[hypothalamus]]. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the [[pituitary gland]] and secretion of the hormone [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]].&lt;ref name="ACTH Action"&gt;{{cite web |last= Margioris |first=Andrew |title=ACTH Action on the Adrenal |url= http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |publisher= Endotext.org |accessdate= 18 April 2013 |author2= Tsatsanis, Christos |date=April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130306182338/http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenal5.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[adrenal gland]] is activated almost simultaneously and releases the [[neurotransmitters]] [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline). The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone [[cortisol]], which increases [[blood pressure]] and [[blood sugar]], and suppresses the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="physiological reactions - Padgett &amp; Glaser"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Padgett |first=David |author2=Glaser, R |title= How stress influences the immune response |journal= Trends in Immunology |date= August 2003 |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=444–448 |doi= 10.1016/S1471-4906(03)00173-X |pmid= 12909458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="equisearch.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kilby |first=E.|year= 1997 |title= Glands at a Glance – The horses’ endocrine system |publisher= EQUUS Magazine, Cruz Bay Publishing |accessdate= October 24, 2013|url=http://www.equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/endocrinesystem_062907/3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="learn.genetics.utah.edu"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Utah Press |year=2002 |title= How cells communicate during the flight or fight response |accessdate= October 23, 2013 |url= http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130808004906/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/fight_flight/ |archivedate= August 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catecholamine hormones, such as [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]], facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent [[muscular]] action.  The result is a rapid rise in blood pressure, resulting in an increased supply of oxygen and [[glucose]] for energy to the brain and skeletal muscles,&lt;ref name="gla.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burton |first=F. |year= 1999 |chapter= 7 |title= The Horses’ World’, Ultimate Horse Care|publisher= Ringpress books UK |accessdate= October 22, 2013 |url= http://www.gla.ac.uk/external/EBF/uhcc7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most vital organs the horse needs when fleeing from a perceived threat. However, the increased supply of oxygen and glucose to these areas is at the expense of "non-essential" flight organs, such as the skin and abdominal organs.&lt;ref name="gla.ac.uk"/&gt;

Once the horse has removed itself from immediate danger, the body is returned to more "normal" conditions via the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="eec-equine-therapy.com"&gt;{{cite web |work=Equine Education Connection |year= 2008 |title= Equine Nervous System |accessdate= October 23, 2013 |url= http://www.eec-equine-therapy.com/Nervous-System.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is triggered by the release of [[endorphins]] into the brain,&lt;ref name="eec-equine-therapy.com"/&gt; and it effectively reverses the effects of noradrenaline – metabolic rate, blood pressure and heart rate all decrease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Butcher-Gray |first=M.|year= 2011|title= Horse Brain Discussion: Part II |website= nickernews.net |accessdate= October 22, 2013 |url= http://www.nickernews.net/horse-brain-two.aspx#.Ume62PmnpLY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increased oxygen and glucose being supplied to the muscles and brain are returned to normal.&lt;ref name="eec-equine-therapy.com"/&gt; This is also known as the "rest and digest" state.&lt;ref name="eec-equine-therapy.com"/&gt;

==As herd animals==
Horses are highly social [[herd animal]]s that prefer to live in a group.

There also is a linear [[dominance hierarchy]] in any herd.&lt;ref name=Heitor_et.al._2006&gt;Heitor F, do Mar Oom M, Vicente L (2006) Social relationships in a herd of Sorraia horses Part I. Correlates of social dominance and contexts of aggression.

J Ethol 25, 239–248. doi: http://doi.org/10.1007/s10164-006-0019-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt;  They will establish a "[[pecking order]]" for the purpose of determining which herd member directs the behavior of others, eats and drinks first, and so on.  This behavior pattern also applies to their interrelationship with humans.  A horse that respects the human as a "herd member" who is higher in the social order will behave in a more appropriate manner towards all humans than a horse that has been allowed to engage in dominant behavior over humans.

Horses are able to form companionship attachments not only to their own species, but with other animals as well, including humans. In fact, many [[domesticated]] horses will become anxious, flighty, and hard to manage if they are isolated.  Horses kept in near-complete isolation, particularly in a closed [[stable]] where they cannot see other animals, may require a stable companion such as a cat, goat, or even a small [[pony]] or donkey, to provide company and reduce stress.

When anxiety over separation occurs while a horse is being handled by a human, the horse is described as  "herd-bound". However, through proper training, horses learn to be comfortable away from other horses, often because they learn to trust a human handler, essentially ranking humans as a dominant member of a "herd."

===Social organizations in the wild===
[[Feral horse|Feral]] and [[wild horse]] "herds" are usually made up of several separate, small "bands" which share a territory.

Bands are [[Harem (zoology)|harems]], usually consisting of one adult male, several females, their [[foal]]s, and immature horses of both sexes, although it has been stated there may be one to five stallions.&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt; Each band is led by a dominant [[mare (horse)|mare]] (sometimes called the "lead mare" or the "boss mare").  Bands are usually small, containing between 3 and 35 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Structure of Feral Horses in the Llanos of Venezuela |doi= 10.2307/1382634 |volume=78 |journal= Journal of Mammalogy |pages= 15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The composition of bands changes as young animals are driven out of their natal band and join other bands, or as stallions challenge each other for dominance.

In herds, there is usually a single "herd" or "lead" [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]], though occasionally a few less-dominant males may remain on the fringes of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Mistral, Kip |title=The Secret Life of Stallions |work= Horse Connection |accessdate= June 22, 2007 |url= http://www.horseconnection.com/site/archive/story-feb06.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchical structure===
[[File:Hengstauftrieb Rauris 6.jpg|thumb|Fights for dominance are normally brief; sometimes, displays which do not involve physical contact are sufficient to maintain the hierarchy.]]
Horses have evolved to live in herds.  As with many animals that live in large groups, establishment of a stable [[Hierarchy|hierarchical system]] or "pecking order" is important to reduce aggression and increase group cohesion.  This is often, but not always, a linear system. In non-linear hierarchies, horse A may be dominant over horse B, who is dominant over horse C, yet horse C may be dominant over horse A.  The low horse, in the pecking order, might be dominant over the top lead horse but few others. Dominance can depend on a variety of factors, including an individual's need for a particular resource at a given time. It can therefore be variable throughout the lifetime of the herd or individual animal.  Some horses may be dominant over all resources, and others may be submissive for all resources.

Once a dominance hierarchy is established, horses more often than not will travel in rank order.&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt;

Aggressive interactions risk causing injury, such as long kick fights causing bloody legs. Therefore, once the dominance hierarchy is established, aggressive behavior is reduced between herd members.  Higher-ranked animals often will assume a role of exercising control and moderating aggressive behavior in the herd.

The center of the herd offers the most protection from the elements and is further away from predators than the periphery. Because of this, "punishment" of misbehaving members is sometimes delivered in the form of temporary expulsion from the herd, or sometimes permanently.

Most young horses in the wild are allowed to stay with the herd until they reach full sexual maturity, usually in their first or second year. Studies of wild herds have shown that the herd stallion will usually drive out both [[Colt (horse)|colt]]s and [[filly|fillies]]; this may be an instinct that prevents [[inbreeding]]. The fillies usually join another band soon afterward, and the colts driven out from several herds usually join together in small "bachelor" groups, "graduating" those who are able to establish dominance over an older stallion in another herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=ADVS 3910 |title=Wild Horses Behavior|accessdate= June 22, 2007 |url=http://www.advs.usu.edu/academics/pdf/ADVS3910WildHorses.pdf 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the lead mare===

Contrary to popular belief, the herd stallion is not the "ruler" of a [[harem]] of females, though he usually engages in herding and protective behavior.  Rather, the horse that tends to lead a wild or feral herd is often a dominant [[mare (horse)|mare]].&lt;ref name="Kincaid2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/46932/1/Kincaid.pdf|author=Kincaid, A.T.|year=2008|title=Wild or Feral? Historical and biological consideration of free roaming horses (FRH) 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The mare "guides the herd to food and water, controls the daily routine or movement of the herd, and ensures the general wellbeing of the herd."&lt;ref name="Hallberg"&gt;{{cite book |author= Hallberg, L. |year=2008 |title= Walking the Way of the Horse: Exploring the Power of the Horse-Human Relationship |publisher= iUniverse |pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent alternative theory posits that there is "distributed leadership", and no single individual is a universal herd leader.  A 2014 study of horses in Italy, described as "feral" by the researcher,&lt;!--horses rounded up, branded and such barely qualify as feral--&gt; observed that some herd movements may be initiated by any individual, although higher-ranked members are followed more often by other herd members.&lt;ref name=Movement&gt;[[Konstanze Krüger|Krueger, K.]], Flauger, B., Farmer, K., &amp; Hemelrijk, C. (2014). Movement initiation in groups of feral horses. Behavioural Process., 103, 91–101. viewed January 9, 20144, http://www.rug.nl/research/behavioural-ecology-and-self-organization/_pdf/kr_ea_bp14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the stallion===
[[Image:Flehmendes Pferd bei Altdorf.jpg|thumb|A stallion (foreground) exhibiting the [[flehmen response]]]]

Stallions tend to stay on the periphery of the herd where they fight off both predators and other males.  When the herd travels, the stallion is usually at the rear and apparently drives straggling herd members forward, keeping the herd together. Mares and lower-ranked males do not usually engage in this herding behavior.&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt;  During the [[mating season]], stallions tend to act more aggressively to keep the mares within the herd, however, most of the time, the stallion is relaxed and spends much of his time "guarding" the herd by [[scent-marking]] manure piles and urination spots to communicate his dominance as herd stallion.&lt;ref&gt;"The Natural Horse and Unnatural Behaviour."

===Ratio of stallions and mares===
Feral and wild bands may range from two to 25 individuals, mostly mares and their offspring, with one to five stallions.&lt;ref name=Movement/&gt;

Domesticated stallions, with human management, often mate with ("cover") more mares in a year than is possible in the wild. Traditionally, [[thoroughbred]] stud farms limited stallions to breeding with between 40 and 60 mares a year.  By breeding mares only at the peak of their [[estrous cycle]], a few thoroughbred stallions have mated with over 200 mares per year. With use of [[artificial insemination]], one stallion could potentially sire thousands of offspring annually, though in practice, economic considerations usually limit the number of foals produced.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstein, Stan.

===Domesticated stallion behavior===
{{Main article|Horse breeding|Stallion (horse)}}
Some breeders keep horses in semi-natural conditions, with a single stallion amongst a group of mares.  This is referred to as "pasture breeding." Young immature stallions are kept in a separate "bachelor herd."  While this has advantages of less intensive labor for human caretakers, and full-time turnout{{clarify|date=January 2014}} may be psychologically healthy for the horses, pasture breeding presents a risk of injury to valuable breeding stock, both stallions and mares, particularly when unfamiliar animals are added to the herd.  It also raises questions of when or if a mare is bred, and may also raise questions as to parentage of foals.  Therefore, keeping stallions in a natural herd is not common, especially on breeding farms mating multiple stallions to mares from other herds.  Natural herds are more often kept on farms with closed herds, i.e. only one or a few stallions with a stable mare herd and few, if any, mares from other herds.

Mature, domesticated stallions are commonly kept by themselves in a [[stable]] or small paddock.  When stallions are stabled in a manner that allows visual and tactile communication, they will often challenge each another and sometimes attempt to fight.  Therefore, stallions are often kept isolated from each other to reduce the risk of injury and disruption to the rest of the stable.   If stallions are provided with access to paddocks, there is often a corridor between the paddocks so the stallions cannot touch each other.  In some cases, stallions are released for exercise at different times of the day to ensure they do not see or hear each another.

To avoid [[stable vices]] associated with isolation, some stallions are provided with a non-horse companion, such as a [[castrated]] donkey or a goat (the [[Godolphin Arabian]] was particularly fond of a barn [[cat]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}).  While many domesticated stallions become too aggressive to tolerate the close presence of any other male horse without fighting, some tolerate a [[gelding]] as a companion, particularly one that has a very calm temperament.  One example of this was the racehorse [[Seabiscuit]], who lived with a gelding companion named "Pumpkin".  Other stallions may tolerate the close presence of an immature and less dominant stallion.

Stallions and mares often compete together at [[horse show]]s and in [[horse racing|horse races]], however, stallions generally must be kept away from close contact with mares, both to avoid unintentional or unplanned matings, and away from other stallions to minimize fighting for dominance.  When horses are lined up for award presentations at shows, handlers keep stallions at least one horse length from any other animal. Stallions can be taught to ignore mares or other stallions that are in close proximity while they are working.

Stallions live peacefully in bachelor herds in the wild and in natural management settings.  For example, the stallions in the [[New Forest]] (U.K.) live in bachelor herds on their winter grazing pastures.  When managed as domesticated animals, some farms assert that carefully managed social contact benefits stallions.  Well-tempered stallions intended to be kept together for a long period may be stabled in closer proximity, though this method of stabling is generally used only by experienced stable managers.  An example of this is the stallions of the [[Spanish Riding School]], which travel, train and are stabled in close proximity.  In these settings, more dominant animals are kept apart by stabling a young or less dominant stallion in the stall between them.

===Dominance in domesticated herds===
Because [[domestication of the horse]] usually requires stallions to be isolated from other horses, either mares or [[gelding]]s may become dominant in a domestic herd.  Usually dominance in these cases is a matter of age and, to some extent, temperament.  It is common for older animals to be dominant, though old and weak animals may lose their rank in the herd.  There are also studies suggesting that a [[foal]] will "inherit" or perhaps [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] dominance behavior from its dam, and at maturity seek to obtain the same rank in a later herd that its mother held when the horse was young.

Studies of [[domesticated]] horses indicate that horses appear to benefit from a strong female presence in the herd. Groupings of all [[gelding]]s, or herds where a gelding is dominant over the rest of the herd; for example if the mares in the herd are quite young or of low status,  may be more anxious as a group and less relaxed than those where a mare is dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Barakat, Christine. "Is your horse sleep deprived?"  ''Equus'', February 2007, issue 353, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication==
[[File:APHA Mare2.jpg|thumb|left|Forward ear position indicating alertness.]]
[[File:Arabheadshotalpha.jpg|thumb|left|One ear forward and one ear back, usually indicating divided attention or environmental monitoring.]]

Horses communicate in various ways, including [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s such as nickering, squealing or whinnying; touch, through [[Social grooming|mutual grooming]] or nuzzling; smell; and [[body language]]. Horses use a combination of ear position, neck and head height, movement, and foot stomping or tail swishing to communicate.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;[http://www.equisearch.com/horses%5Fcare/health/behavior/understanding%5Fhorse%5Fbody%5Flanguage%5F022409/  Scott, Laurel. "Equine Expressions: Understanding Your Horse's Body Language"]  Equisearch.com.  Accessed July 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Discipline is maintained in a horse herd first through body language and gestures, then, if needed, through physical contact such as biting, kicking, nudging, or other means of forcing a misbehaving herd member to move.  In most cases, the animal that successfully causes another to move is dominant, whether it uses only body language or adds physical reinforcement.

Horses can interpret the body language of other creatures, including humans, whom they could view as [[predator]]s or providers of food, perhaps following them to see if food is near.  If socialized to human contact, horses usually respond to humans as a non-threatening predator or provider.  Humans do not always understand this, however, and may behave in a way, particularly if using aggressive discipline, that resembles an attacking predator and triggers the horse's [[fight-or-flight response]]. For example a person swatting high at flies might seem to be attacking the horse.  On the other hand, some humans exhibit fear of a horse, and a horse may interpret this behavior as human submission to the authority of the horse, placing the human in a subordinate role in the horse's mind.  This may lead the horse to behave in a more dominant and aggressive fashion.  Human handlers are more successful if they learn to properly interpret a horse's body language and temper their own responses accordingly.  Some methods of horse training explicitly instruct horse handlers to behave in ways that the horse will interpret as the behavior of a trusted leader in a herd and thus more willingly comply with commands from a human handler.  Other methods encourage [[operant conditioning]] to teach the horse to respond in a desired way to human body language, but also teach handlers to recognize the meaning of horse body language.
[[File:Curly-horse.jpg|thumb|Relaxed ear position of a bored or resting horse. Lower lip is loose, also indicating relaxation. The sclera of this horse's eye shows a bit of white, but it is not rolled back in fear or anger.]]
[[File:Andalusian3.jpg|thumb|Tense, backward ear position indicating apprehension. Mouth and lips are also tense, which may indicate an increased tendency to bite.]]
Horses are not particularly vocal, but do have four basic vocalizations:  the [[Glossary of equestrian terms#N|neigh or whinny]], the [[Glossary of equestrian terms#N|nicker]], the squeal and the [[Glossary of equestrian terms#S|snort]].&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/vocalizations_061606/|title=Audio Samples of Common Horse Sounds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also make sighing, grunting or groaning noises at times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/eqsaying934/ Aronson, Linda.  "What's my horse saying?"] September 2000, ''Practical Horseman.'' Accessed July 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Ear position is often one of the most obvious behaviors that humans notice when interpreting horse body language.   In general, a horse will direct the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] of an ear toward the source of input it is also looking at.  Horses have a narrow range of [[binocular vision]], and thus a horse with both ears forward is generally concentrating on something in front of it.  Similarly, when a horse turns both ears forward, the degree of tension in the horse's pinna suggests if the animal is calmly attentive to its surroundings or tensely observing a potential danger.  However, because horses have strong [[monocular vision]], it is possible for a horse to position one ear forward and one ear back, indicative of similar divided visual attention.  This behavior is often observed in horses while working with humans, where they need to simultaneously focus attention on both their handler and their surroundings.  A horse may turn the pinna back when also seeing something coming up behind it.

Due to the nature of a horse's [[equine eye|vision]], head position may indicate where the animal is focusing attention.  To focus on a distant object, a horse will raise its head.  To focus on an object close by, and especially on the ground, the horse will lower its nose and carry its head in a near-vertical position.  Eyes rolled to the point that the white of the eye is visible often indicates fear or anger.

Ear position, head height, and body language may change to reflect emotional status as well.  For example, the clearest signal a horse sends is when both ears are flattened tightly back against the head, sometimes with eyes rolled so that the white of the eye shows, often indicative of pain or anger, frequently foreshadowing aggressive behavior that will soon follow.  Sometimes ears laid back, especially when accompanied by a strongly swishing tail or stomping or pawing with the feet are signals used by the horse to express discomfort, irritation, impatience, or anxiety.   However, horses with ears slightly turned back but in a loose position, may be drowsing, bored, fatigued, or simply relaxed.  When a horse raises its head and neck, the animal is alert and often tense.  A lowered head and neck may be a sign of relaxation, but depending on other behaviors may also indicate fatigue or illness.

[[tail (horse)|Tail]] motion may also be a form of communication.  Slight tail swishing is often a tool to dislodge biting insects or other skin irritants.  However, aggressive tail-swishing may indicate either irritation, pain or anger.  The tail tucked tightly against the body may indicate discomfort due to cold or, in some cases, pain.  The horse may demonstrate tension or excitement by raising its tail, but also by flaring its nostrils, snorting, and intently focusing its eyes and ears on the source of concern.

The horse does not use its mouth to communicate to the degree that it uses its ears and tail, but a few mouth gestures have meaning beyond that of eating, grooming, or biting at an irritation.  Bared teeth, as noted above, are an expression of anger and an imminent attempt to bite.  Horses, particularly [[foal]]s, sometimes indicate appeasement of a more aggressive herd member by extending their necks and clacking their teeth. Horses making a chewing motion with no food in the mouth do so as a soothing mechanism, possibly linked to a release of tension, though some horse trainers view it as an expression of submission.  Horses will sometimes extend their upper lip when scratched in a particularly good spot, and if their mouth touches something at the time, their lip and teeth may move in a mutual grooming gesture.  A very relaxed or sleeping horse may have a loose lower lip and chin that may extend further out than the upper lip.  The curled lip flehmen response, noted above, most often is seen in stallions, but is usually a response to the smell of another horse's urine, and may be exhibited by horses of any sex. Horses also have assorted mouth motions that are a response to a [[bit (horse)|bit]] or the [[riding aids|rider's hands]], some indicating relaxation and acceptance, others indicating tension or resistance.

==Stallion and Mare reproductive Behavior and Signalling==
===Background===
Horse reproductive behaviors are interesting because these animals have been domesticated but their breeding behaviors have not changed. Meaning, they show the same signs of being in heat and the same signalings to stallions that they would in the wild or at a breeding facility.  Mares are animals that undergo [[polyestrous]] which means that they cycle when daylight hours are long (spring &amp; summer) and they go into anesturs period when the days are short (fall &amp; winter).  [[Estrus cycle]]s can be manipulated so that mares can be bred in the winter and early spring if necessary. This can be done by hormone injections and light manipulation.  Estrus cycles in mares last 21 days. During each breeding seasons, mares have 3 to 4 intervals of cyclicity in which they are receptive to the stallion.  (Sertich,2018)   It is important to remember that a mares estrus cycle is much like that of a human. It has many variables based on the horse and as well as the breed. The mares estrus cycles last five to seven days before the mare enters anestrus again.  To be the most successful with horse breeding, it is important to breed to a fertile stallion as well as to check the different aspects of the mare such as her BCS (body condition score), her age, whether she has had foals before (maiden mares can be hard to breed and test heat for), and the check her overall medical condition and record. It is also important to remember that estrus cycles and responses can be different depending on if the mare is a maiden (a mare who has never foaled), a seasoned broad mare (has foaled before), a foaling mare (a mare that still has a foal feeding off her), as well stress and if they are already pregnant can play a role in the signs of estrus.

===Mare receptive behaviors===
Mares have different behaviors when they are in heat even if a stallion is not present.  Mares will show many different signs that they are in heat such as “restlessness, hyperactivity, less time devoted to eating and resting, and more time “running the fences.” (Griffin, 2013).{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}  The more clear signs of estrus are the mare will frequently urinate while they stand in a straddling stance. The most accurate way to tell if your mare is showing signs of estrus is they will do something called “winking”.  (Griffin, 2013).  “Winking”, is a movement made by the mare with their clitoris, in which it opens and closes believed to be released a pheromone type of response to communicating with the stallion that they are in heat.  However, a lot of the time to ensure that the mare is in heat before putting them together with a stallion to breed or to AI them, they will use a teaser stallion to pick up on these different behaviors.  Here are the different behaviors in estrus given by the mare to be able to tell that she is in heat:
“0–Rejection of stallion’s presence (ears pinned, kicking, biting, or pawing at stallion) or complete lack of interest in the stallion.
1–Not aggressive toward stallion, but looks away or is not interested.
2–Shows interest in facial expression and might approach stallion; slow to show interest. Mare might raise tail or exhibit some winking (eversion of the labia of the vulva). Mare might show these signs at a distance, or in close proximity to the stallion.
3–More interest in stallion as demonstrated through facial expression, tail raising, flexion of the pelvis (posturing), winking, and urination.
4–Intense interest in stallion as demonstrated by turning hindquarters to him, leaning toward him, and exhibiting continuous winking and urination.”
(Sellnow, 2001)

===Stallion detection to mare receptivity===
The stallions have their own ways of detecting mares in heat. They also have unique ways of showing and communicating to the mares to show that they are willing to breed.  All horses use the Flehmen response, however, it is most common in stallions. When a mare is in estrus a stallion may use or show this response multiple times an hour. Sex pheromones are the most common reason to get such a response, however, they aren’t the only signal. (Biles, 2001). The stallion will be alert, restless, and aroused when he sees a mare in heat. He can also be hyperactive and impatient and this is where handling breeding stallion can become dangerous to their handlers. (Griffin, 2013). He can also be dangerous to other stallions and horses, which is why in the wild there is usually only one stallion in a herd of mares.  Stallions and mares can also communicate with each other vocally through different vocalizations of neighs and whinnies. It is important to remember that breeding stallions can become creatures of habit, and certain behaviors/interactions with the handler show the stallion that they are getting ready to breed a receptive mare.  These behaviors would include the presence of a stud chain or lip chain. This behavior arouses the stallion and gets them ready for reproduction. The main thing to remember in stallion behavior is that they respond to the smells and the vocalization of the mares.

===Stallion and Mare physical communication===
The exchange between the mare and stallion before breeding has many different aspects to it. The main purpose is to ensure that the mare is receptive to the stallion and to ensure that he will not get hurt. Sometimes mares can be very aggressive if they are not willing to be bred and that can result in severe injuries to the stallion and even on certain accounts can result in him no longer being fertile.  For example, there have been many accounts on which a stallion attempted to breed a non-receptive mare and in the process lost an eye or had severe injuries to the legs, occasionally leading to broken limbs. When a mare is willing to be bred she will walk up to the stallion attentive and very passive to the stallions presence.  She will also start leaning into the stallion, raise her tail, and she may even urinate in front of the stallions once again engaging those pheromones. During the estrus period when a mare and a stallion are put together the mare may nuzzle, sniff, and even lick the stallion to show interest and that she is accepting of him. It is almost as if they are ‘flirting’ with each other.  She will also take a breeding stance in front of the stallion. In return, the stallion will nudge the mare to tell her that he is ready.  Also, “In addition to nudges, some stallions may smell and bite over the mare’s body. Most behaviorists consider this display to be more important in the courtship process than odor recognition.” (Griffin, 2013). The physical communication between the mare and the stallion is the last moment for a mare to either let it be known she is receptive or is not before the stallion attempts to mounts.

==Horses and humans==
Horses are creatures of habit and have excellent long-term memory, which makes consistent training extremely important to the horse. Untrained young horses, even with top bloodlines, can be bought for relatively little money compared to those with training. Once a horse is started under saddle and demonstrates that it is trainable, ridable and has some athletic talent for its work, the price easily triples.

Humans are usually viewed by wild horses as potential predators. However, horses are also innately curious and may investigate any creature that is interesting but not threatening.
[[File:Merens calin.jpg|thumb|left|Horse-human [[interaction]]]]
Any domesticated horse with some experience of humans usually views people as generally harmless objects of curiosity worth at least minor notice, especially if they know that humans may bring food or treats.  Rarely will any domestic horse become truly vicious unless it has been spoiled or abused by humans, though many stallions have a great deal of naturally aggressive, dominant behavior that requires that they be managed only by knowledgeable handlers.  However, any horse is a large animal that retains some wild instincts, so can react unpredictably by running, biting, striking, or kicking.  Thus humans must always be alert around horses because they can accidentally harm people.

The ability of humans to work in cooperation with the horse is based on both the natural curiosity of the horse and the strong social bonds that horses have with each other.  Horses do not like to be separated from their herd, because to be alone is to be exposed to predators on all sides.  Also, in a herd, less dominant horses tend to gravitate toward the most mature and confident members.  Therefore, many horse training principles are based upon having the horse accept a human as the dominant herd member.  Ideally this is not done by force, but by the horse developing trust in the ability of the human and confidence that the human will be a responsible "herd leader."

Horses are also adapted to covering large amounts of territory and must have a certain boldness to do so. A horse that is afraid more than necessary will expend energy needlessly and then may not be able to escape when a threat is real. Thus, horses have an ability to investigate the unusual and not immediately flee from something that is merely different.
[[File:Will Set Off.jpg|thumb|Humans turning a horse loose so that it can run]]
This willingness to consider new things can also be used by a human trainer to adapt the horse's behavior to an extraordinary range of activities that are well outside the range of instinctive horse behavior, including acts considered naturally dangerous by the average horse such as bullfighting, jumping off cliffs, diving into water, jumping through a ring of fire, or walking into a modern television studio, complete with enclosed space, bright lights, and tremendous noise.

People who train horses first have to educate them that some normal herd behavior is inappropriate around humans. For example, biting and "shadow boxing" (rearing, striking) that is common play among young horses, colts in particular, could be injurious or fatal to people.  Other instinctive traits, such as running away when frightened, bucking off anything that lands on a horse's back (like a mountain lion or other predator), or never entering a small enclosed area, also have to be overcome before the horse is useful to humans.

Even when trained, most horses will still test boundaries, at least mildly, and some horses with dominant personalities will openly challenge a weak or inexperienced handler.  For example, if handled with incompetence or abuse, a horse may ignore its training and attempt to nip, bite, kick, refuse to be led, or try other ways to challenge human dominance.  Without consistent handling, some horses, especially young ones, will revert to their untrained ways.  However, due to their good memory, horses with solid training from trustworthy handlers often retain what they have learned, even after a gap of many years.

Horses are prey animals, so they have an eye on each side of their head. This makes it so they have two separate sides to their brain. The left and the right. It works opposite with each other. For example, if a horse sees something that scares them, they turn their head so they are looking with their left eye, which alarms the right side of their brain. The right side of a horse's brain process threatening stimuli, as for the left side of the brain, that side processes new situations.

==Sleep patterns==
[[Image:Cheval ardennais expo.jpg|thumb|A [[draft horse]] sleeping while standing up]]
Horses can sleep both standing up and lying down. They can doze and enter light sleep while standing, an adaptation from life as a [[prey]] animal in the wild.  Lying down makes an animal more vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/hq_sleepstandingup.html  Do Horses Sleep Standing Up?  Web site, accessed March 23, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Horses are able to sleep standing up because a "[[stay apparatus]]" in their legs allows them to relax their muscles and doze without collapsing.  In the front legs, their [[equine forelimb anatomy]] automatically engages the stay apparatus when their muscles relax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqzzz629/|title=How Horses Sleep|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The horse engages the stay apparatus in the hind legs by shifting its hip position to lock the [[patella]] in place.  At the [[horse anatomy|stifle]] joint, a "hook" structure on the inside bottom end of the [[femur]] cups the patella and the medial patella [[ligament]], preventing the leg from bending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseware.com/ezine/questions.asp|title=Horseware Ireland North America - The worlds leading equine product leader for horse and rider|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses do not need a solid unbroken period of sleep time. They obtain needed sleep by many short periods of rest. This is to be expected of a [[prey]] animal, that needs to be ready on a moment's notice to flee from [[predator]]s.  Horses may spend anywhere from four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down.  However, not all this time is the horse asleep; total sleep time in a day may range from several minutes to two hours.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|title=How Horses Sleep Pt. 2 - Power Naps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Horses require approximately two and a half hours of sleep, on average, in a 24-hour period.  Most of this sleep occurs in many short intervals of about 15 minutes each.&lt;ref name="sleepdisorders.about.com"&gt;[http://sleepdisorders.about.com/cs/sleepdeprivation/a/animalkingdom_5.htm "Did you hear the one about the policeman's horse?"

[[Image:Horse lying down.jpg|thumb|left|Horses need to lie down occasionally, and prefer soft ground for a nap.]]
Horses must lie down to reach REM sleep.  They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/&gt; However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|title=Equine Sleep Disorder Videos - EquiSearch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This condition differs from [[narcolepsy]], which horses may suffer from.&lt;ref name="sleepdisorders.about.com"/&gt;

Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators.  A horse kept entirely alone may not sleep well because its [[instinct]]s are to keep a constant eye out for danger.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/&gt;

==Eating patterns==
{{Main article|Equine nutrition|Equine anatomy}}

Horses have a strong grazing instinct, preferring to spend most hours of the day eating [[forage]]. Horses and other equids evolved as [[grazing]] animals, adapted to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, the horse adapted to eating [[prairie]] grasses in semi-arid regions and traveling significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky, Stephen. ''The Nature of Horses.'' Free Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-684-82768-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they are "trickle eaters," meaning they have to have an almost constant supply of food to keep their digestive system working properly. Horses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals. When [[stable]]d, they do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine.&lt;ref name="Rutgers"&gt;[http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/publications/factsheets_nutrition/FS038.htm  Williams, Carey A.,Ph.D., Extension Specialist.

Low-status animals, that eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all.

==Psychological disorders==
{{Main article|Stable vices}}
When confined with insufficient companionship, exercise or stimulation, horses may develop [[stable vices]], an assortment of compulsive [[stereotypy|stereotypies]] considered bad habits, mostly [[psychology|psychological]] in origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth) and other problems.  These have been linked to a number of possible causal factors, including a lack of environmental stimulation and early weaning practices. Research is ongoing to investigate the neurobiological changes involved in the performance of these behaviors.

'''Information sensitivity''' is the control of access to [[information]] or [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] that might result in loss of an advantage or level of security if disclosed to others.

Loss, misuse, modification, or [[Access control|unauthorized access]] to sensitive information can adversely affect the [[privacy]] or [[welfare]] of an individual, [[trade secret]]s of a business or even the [[national security|security]] and international relations of a nation depending on the level of sensitivity and nature of the information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-032/_4768.htm "Sensitive Information"] (definition) Aug. 23, 1996. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sensitive information==

===Public information===

This refers to information that is already a matter of public record or knowledge. With regard to government and private organizations, access to or release of such information may be requested by any member of the public, and there are often formal processes laid out for how to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/access-to-information/accessing-public-information/ "Accessing Public Information" Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved Feb. 11 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of government-held public records is an important part of government transparency, accountability to its citizens, and the values of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracyweb.org/accountability/principles.php "Accountability and Transparency: Essential Principles" Democracy Web. Retrieved Feb. 11, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public records]] may furthermore refer to information about identifiable individuals that is not considered confidential, including but not limited to: [[census]] records, [[criminal records]], [[sex offender registry]] files, and [[voter registration]].

===Routine business information===

This includes business information that is not subjected to special protection and may be routinely shared with anyone inside or outside of the business.

==Types of sensitive information==
''Confidential information'' is used in a general sense to mean sensitive information whose access is subject to restriction, and may refer to information about an individual as well as that which pertains to a business.

However, there are situations in which the release of personal information could have a negative effect on its owner. For example, a person trying to avoid a stalker will be inclined to further restrict access to such personal information. Furthermore, a person's [[Social Security number|SSN]] or [[Social Insurance Number|SIN]], credit card numbers, and other financial information may be considered private if their disclosure might lead to [[crime]]s such as [[identity theft]] or [[fraud]].

Some types of private information, including records of a person's [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|health care]], education, and employment may be protected by [[privacy law]]s. Unauthorized disclosure of private information can make the perpetrator liable for civil remedies and may in some cases be subject to criminal penalties.

Even though they are often used interchangeably, personal information is sometimes distinguished from private information, or [[personally identifiable information]]. The latter is distinct from the former in that private information can be used to identify a unique individual. Personal information, on the other hand, is information belonging to the private life of an individual that cannot be used to uniquely identify that individual. This can range from an individual’s favourite colour, to the details of their domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/lesson/private-and-personal-information-3-5 "Private and Personal Information"] Common Sense Media Inc., 2013. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a common example of personal information that is also regarded as sensitive, where the individual sharing these details with a trusted listener would prefer for it not to be shared with anyone else, and the sharing of which may result in unwanted consequences.

===Confidential business information===

Confidential business information refers to information whose disclosure may harm the business. Such information may include [[trade secret]]s, sales and marketing plans, new product plans, notes associated with patentable inventions, customer and supplier information, financial data, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/articles/confidential-information-and-trade-secrets/ "Confidential information and trade secrets"] MaRS, Dec. 8 2009. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classified===
[[Classified information]] generally refers to information that is subject to special security classification regulations imposed by many national governments, the disclosure of which may cause harm to national interests and security. The protocol of restriction imposed upon such information is categorized into a hierarchy of classification levels in almost every national government worldwide, with the most restricted levels containing information that may cause the greatest danger to national security if leaked. Authorized access is granted to individuals on a [[need to know]] basis who have also passed the appropriate level of [[security clearance]]. Classified information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified (made available to the public) depending on changes of situation or new intelligence.

Classified information may also be further denoted with the method of communication or access. For example, Protectively Marked "Secret" Eyes Only or Protectively Marked "Secret" Encrypted transfer only. Indicating that the document must be physically read by the recipient and cannot be openly discussed for example over a telephone conversation or that the communication can be sent only using encrypted means. Often mistakenly listed as meaning for the eyes of the intended recipient only &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eyes-only&lt;/ref&gt; the anomaly becomes apparent when the additional tag "Not within windowed area" is also used.

==Legal protection from unauthorised disclosure==

===Personal and private information===

Data privacy concerns exist in various aspects of daily life wherever personal data is stored and collected, such as on the [[Internet privacy|internet]], in [[Medical privacy|medical records]], [[Financial privacy|financial records]], and [[Political privacy|expression of political opinions]]. In over 80 countries in the world, personally identifiable information is protected by [[information privacy law]]s, which outline limits to the collection and use of personally identifiable information by public and private entities. Such laws usually require entities to give clear and unambiguous notice to the individual of the types of data being collected, its reason for collection, and planned uses of the data. In consent-based legal frameworks, explicit consent of the individual is required as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc300h/winter/13/lectures/week2-privacy.pdf "Basic Privacy"] (lecture). University of Toronto, Jan. 24, 2012. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the [[Data Protection Directive]] provides a rigorous standard for privacy protection legislation across all member states. Although the Directive is not legally binding in itself, all member states are expected to enact their own national privacy legislation within three years of the Directive’s adoption that conforms to all of its standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:NOT "Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data"] European Parliament, Council. Nov. 23 1995. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since adoption, the Directive has demonstrated significant influence on the privacy legislation of non-EU nations, through its requirements on the privacy laws of non-member nations engaging in transborder flows of private data with EU member nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, J. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p172821_index.html "The Influence of the European Commission Data Privacy Protection Directive on 'Third Countries'"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 24, 2007. Retrieved Feb. 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has passed the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), which will replace the Directive. The regulation was adopted on 27 April 2016. It becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation, and is thus directly binding and applicable.&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16"&gt;

"The proposed new EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonisation of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide turnover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/oExZ4PVtEeefHEPs4cEz6w/www.mlawgroup.de/news/publications/detail.php|title=New draft European data protection regime|last=|first=|date=February 2, 2012|website=[[Law Patent Group]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDPR also brings a new set of "digital rights" for EU citizens in an age when the economic value of personal data is increasing in the digital economy.
In Canada, the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA) regulates the collection and use of personal data and electronic documents by public and private organizations. PIPEDA is in effect in all federal and provincial jurisdictions, except provinces where existing privacy laws are determined to be “substantially similar”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2002/2002-08-03/html/notice-avis-eng.html#i10 "DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY: PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT"] Canada Gazette, Apr. 03 2002. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though not through the unified sensitive information framework, the United States has implemented significant amount of privacy legislation pertaining to different specific aspects of data privacy, with emphasis to privacy in healthcare, financial, e-commerce, educational industries, and both on federal and state levels. Whether being regulated or self regulated, the laws require to establish ways at which access to sensitive information is limited to the people with different roles, thus in essence requiring establishment of the "sensitive data domain" model &lt;ref&gt;[http://mask-me.net/datamaskingwiki/wiki/35/sensitive-data-discovery "Sensitive Data Discovery"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mechanisms of its protection. Some of the domains have a guideline in form of pre-defined models such as "Safe Harbor" of HIPAA,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard&lt;/ref&gt; based on the research of [[Latanya Sweeny]] and established privacy industry metrics.

Additionally, many other countries have enacted their own legislature regarding data privacy protection, and more are still in the process of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationshield.com/intprivacylaws.html "International Privacy Laws "] InformationShield. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidential business information===
The [[confidentiality]] of sensitive business information is established through [[non-disclosure agreements]], a legally binding contract between two parties in a professional relationship. NDAs may be one-way, such as in the case of an employee receiving confidential information about the employing organization, or two-way between businesses needing to share information with one another to accomplish a business goal. Depending on the severity of consequences, a violation of non-disclosure may result in employment loss, loss of business and client contacts, criminal charges or a civil lawsuit, and a hefty sum in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Niznik, J. S. [http://jobsearchtech.about.com/library/weekly/aa-nondisclosure-4.htm "Non-Disclosure Agreement"] About.com, 2002. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When NDAs are signed between employer and employee at the initiation of employment, a [[non-compete clause]] may be a part of the agreement as an added protection of sensitive business information, where the employee agrees not to work for competitors or start their own competing business within a certain time or geographical limit.

Unlike personal and private information, there is no internationally recognized framework protecting [[trade secrets]], or even an agreed-upon definition of the term “trade secret”.&lt;ref&gt;Magri, K. A. [http://www.myersbigel.com/library/articles/InternationalAspectsofTradeSecret.pdf "International Aspects of Trade Secrets Law"] 1997. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many countries and political jurisdictions have taken the initiative to account for the violation of commercial confidentiality in their criminal or civil laws. For example, under the US [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], it is a federal crime in the United States to misappropriate trade secrets with the knowledge that it will benefit a foreign power, or will injure the owner of the trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;104th US Congress.

Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   More commonly, breach of commercial confidentiality falls under civil law, such as [[Breach of confidence in English law|in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Bently, L. [http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/faculty-resources/10008780.ppt "Breach of confidence - the basics"] (lecture). Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In some developing countries, trade secret laws are either non-existent or poorly developed and offer little substantial protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kransdorf, G.

Pp 16-18. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of present and former government employees disclosing classified information regarding national government misconduct to the public and media, in spite of the criminal consequences that await them.

[[Espionage]], or spying, involves obtaining sensitive information without the permission or knowledge of its holder. The use of spies is a part of national intelligence gathering in most countries, and has been used as a political strategy by nation-states since ancient times. It is unspoken knowledge in international politics that countries are spying on one another all the time, even their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Woolsey, R. J. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB95326824311657269 "Why We Spy on Our Allies"] The Wall Street Journal: Mar. 17 2000. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital sensitive information==

[[Computer security]] is information security applied to computing and network technology, and is a significant and ever-growing field in computer science. The term [[computer insecurity]], on the other hand, is the concept that computer systems are inherently vulnerable to attack, and therefore an evolving arms race between those who exploit existing vulnerabilities in security systems and those who must then engineer new mechanisms of security.

A number of security concerns have arisen in the recent years as increasing amounts of sensitive information at every level have found their primary existence in digital form. At the personal level, [[credit card fraud]], [[internet fraud]], and other forms of [[identity theft]] have become widespread concerns that individuals need to be aware of on a day-to-day basis. 
The existence of large databases of classified information on computer networks is also changing the face of domestic and international politics. [[Cyber-warfare]] and [[cyber espionage]] is becoming of increasing importance to the national security and strategy of nations around the world, and it is estimated that 120 nations around the world are currently actively engaged in developing and deploying technology for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Brodkin, J. [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.html "Government-sponsored cyberattacks on the rise, McAfee says"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617091822/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/112907-government-cyberattacks.html |date=2013-06-17}} Networked World: Nov. 29 2007.

Philosophies and internet cultures such as [[open-source governance]], [[hacktivism]], and the popular hacktivist slogan "[[information wants to be free]]" reflects some of the cultural shifts in perception towards political and government secrecy. The popular, controversial [[WikiLeaks]] is just one of many manifestations of a growing cultural sentiment that is becoming an additional challenge to the security and integrity of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, P.

Phylum members can be [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and fall under two distinct phenotypes.  One consists of terrestrial gut microbiota from mammals and birds.  The other phenotype includes marine micro-organisms: sequences from fish and coral microbiomes and marine sediment.

The '''magnetosheath''' is the region of space between the [[magnetopause]] and the [[bow shock]] of a [[planet|planet's]] [[magnetosphere]]. The regularly organized [[magnetic field]] generated by the planet becomes weak and irregular in the magnetosheath due to interaction with the incoming [[solar wind]], and is incapable of fully deflecting the highly [[charged particle]]s. The density of the particles in this region is considerably lower than what is found beyond the bow shock, but greater than within the [[magnetopause]], and can be considered a transitory state.

[[Image:Structure_of_the_magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere, showing the relative position of the magnetosheath]]

Scientific research into the exact nature of the magnetosheath has been limited due to a longstanding misconception that it was a simple byproduct of the bow shock/magnetopause interaction and had no inherently important properties of its own.  Recent studies indicate, however, that the magnetosheath is a dynamic region of turbulent [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] flow that may play an important role in the structure of the bow shock and the magnetopause, and may help to dictate the flow of energetic particles across those boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Earth]]'s magnetosheath typically occupies the region of space approximately 10 Earth radii on the upwind ([[Sun]]-facing) side of the planet, extending significantly farther out on the downwind side due to the pressure of the solar wind.  The exact location and width of the magnetosheath does depend on variables such as [[Solar variation|solar activity]].

{{Paleontology}}
'''Micropaleontology''' (American spelling; spelled '''micropalaeontology''' in European usage) is the branch of [[paleontology]] ([[palaeontology]]) that studies '''microfossils''', or fossils that require the use of a microscope to see the organism, its morphology and its characteristic details.

== Microfossils ==
[[File:Diatomaceous Earth BrightField.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Diatomaceous earth]] is a soft, [[siliceous]], [[sedimentary rock]] made up of microfossils in the form of the [[frustule]]s (shells) of single cell [[diatoms]]. This sample consists of a mixture of centric (radially symmetric) and pennate (bilaterally symmetric) diatoms. This image of diatomaceous earth particles in [[water]] is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/[[μm]], the entire image covers a region of approximately 1.13 by 0.69 [[millimetre|mm]].]]
''Microfossils'' are [[fossils]] that are generally between 0.001mm and 1&amp;nbsp;mm in size,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drewes|first1=Charlie|title=Discovering Devonian Microfossils|url=http://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/DrewesC/htdocs/microfossilsABLE.doc|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of which requires the use of light or electron [[microscopy]]. Fossils which can be studied with the naked eye or low-powered magnification, such as a hand lens, are referred to as [[macrofossil]]s.

For example, some colonial organisms, such as [[Bryozoa]] (especially the [[Cheilostomata]]) have relatively large [[colony (biology)|colonies]], but are classified by fine skeletal details of the small individuals of the colony.

In another example, many fossil [[genus|genera]] of [[Foraminifera]], which are protists are known from shells (called "tests") that were as big as coins, such as the genus ''[[Nummulites]]''.

Microfossils are a common feature of the [[geologic timescale|geological record]], from the [[Precambrian]] to the [[Holocene]]. They are most common in deposits of [[ocean|marine]] environments, but also occur in brackish water, fresh water and terrestrial [[sedimentary]] deposits. While every [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of [[prehistoric life|life]] is represented in the microfossil record, the most abundant forms are [[protist]] skeletons or cysts from the [[Chrysophyta]], [[Pyrrhophyta]], [[Sarcodina]], [[acritarch]]s and [[chitinozoa]]ns, together with [[pollen]] and [[spores]] from the [[vascular plant]]s.

In 2017, fossilized [[microorganism]]s, or [[Micropaleontology#Microfossils|microfossils]], were announced to have been discovered in [[hydrothermal vent]] [[precipitates]] in the [[Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt|Nuvvuagittuq Belt]] of Quebec, Canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old, the [[Earliest known life forms|oldest record of life on Earth]], suggesting "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" (in a geological time-scale sense), after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170301"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodd, Matthew S. |author2=Papineau, Dominic |author3=Grenne, Tor |author4=slack, John F. |author5=Rittner, Martin |author6=Pirajno, Franco |author7=O'Neil, Jonathan |author8=Little, Crispin T.

== Areas of study ==
[[File:TriticitesPlattsmouthChertRedOakIowaPermian.jpg|thumb|300px|Fusulinid (''[[Triticites]]'') from the Plattsmouth Chert, Red Oak, [[Iowa]] ([[Permian]]).]]
Micropaleontology can be roughly divided into four areas of study on the basis of microfossil composition: (a) [[calcareous]], as in [[coccolith]]s and [[foraminifera]], (b) [[Phosphate|phosphatic]], as in the study of some [[vertebrate]]s, (c) [[silicate|siliceous]], as in [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]], or (d) [[organic matter|organic]], as in the [[pollen]] and [[spores]] studied in [[palynology]].

This division reflects differences in the mineralogical and chemical composition of microfossil remains (and therefore in the methods of fossil recovery) rather than any strict [[scientific classification|taxonomic]] or [[ecological]] distinctions. Most researchers in this [[field research|field]], known as '''micropaleontologists''', are typically specialists in one or more [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]].

=== Calcareous microfossils ===
[[File:Nummulitids.jpg|thumb|Fossil [[Nummulites|nummulitid]] foraminiferans showing microspheric and megalospheric individuals; [[Eocene]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]]; scale in mm.]]
[[Calcareous]] ([[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) microfossils include [[coccolith]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[calcareous dinoflagellate cysts]], and [[ostracod]]s (seed shrimp).

=== Phosphatic microfossils ===
[[Phosphate|Phosphatic]] microfossils include [[conodont]]s (tiny oral structures of an extinct chordate group), some [[scolecodonts]] ("worm" jaws), [[Shark]] spines and teeth, and other [[Fish]] remains (collectively called "[[ichthyolith]]s").

=== Siliceous microfossils ===
[[Silicate|Siliceous]] microfossils include [[diatoms]], [[radiolaria]]ns, [[silicoflagellate]]s, [[Ebriid|ebridians]], [[phytolith]]s, some [[scolecodonts]] ("worm" jaws), and [[sponge spicule]]s.

=== Organic microfossils ===
The study of [[organic matter|organic]] microfossils is called [[palynology]]. Organic microfossils include [[pollen]], [[spores]], [[chitinozoa]]ns (thought to be the egg cases of marine invertebrates), [[scolecodonts]] ("worm" jaws), [[acritarchs]], [[dinoflagellate cysts]], and [[fungal]] remains.

== Methods ==
Sediment or rock samples are collected from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted by a variety of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by [[centrifuge]] or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] analysis. A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.

== Applications of micropaleontology ==
Microfossils are especially noteworthy for their importance in [[biostratigraphy]].  Since microfossils are often extremely abundant, widespread, and quick to appear and disappear from the stratigraphic record, they constitute ideal [[index fossils]] from a biostratigraphic perspective.  Also, the [[planktonic]] and [[nektonic]] habits of some microfossils give them the bonus of appearing across a wide range of [[facies]] or paleoenvironments, as well as having near-global distribution, making biostratigraphic correlation even more powerful and effective.

Microfossils, particularly from deep-sea sediments, also provide some of the most important records of global environmental change on long, medium or short timescales.&lt;ref&gt;Ovechkina, M.N. 2007. Calcareous nannoplankton of the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian and Maastrichtian) of the southern and eastern Russian Platform. Nauka, Moscow. 353 pp. {{ISBN|978-5-02-035758-7}} [https://archive.org/details/Ovechkina_2007_Calcareous_Nannoplankton_of_Upper_Cretaceous]&lt;/ref&gt; Across vast areas of the ocean floor, the shells of planktonic micro-organisms sinking from surface waters provide the dominant source of sediment, and they continuously accumulate (typically at rates of 20–50&amp;nbsp;million per million years). Study of changes in assemblages of microfossils and changes in their shell chemistry (e.g., oxygen isotope composition) are fundamental to research on climate change in the geological past.

In addition to providing an excellent tool for [[sedimentary rock]] dating and for paleoenvironmental reconstruction – heavily used in both [[petroleum]] [[geology]] and [[paleoceanography]] – micropaleontology has also found a number of less orthodox applications, such as its growing role in [[forensic]] police investigation or in determining the provenance of [[archaeological]] artefacts.

Micropaleontology is also a tool of [[geoarchaeology]] used in the archaeological reconstruction of human habitation sites and environments.  Changes in the microfossil population abundance in the stratigraphy of current and former water bodies reflect changes in environmental conditions.  Naturally occurring [[ostracods]] in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. When correlated with other dating techniques, prehistoric environments can be reconstructed. Work on [[Lake Tanganyika]] provided a profile of human-induced environmental changes of a 4,000-year period.&lt;ref name=" Palacios_etal "&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Palacios-Fest |url=http://www.tnesr.com/images/Palacios_etal_2005_b.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717064447/http://www.tnesr.com/images/Palacios_etal_2005_b.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-17 |title= Paleolimnological investigations of anthropogenic environmental change in Lake Tanganyika: IV.

Similar work in the arid American Southwest has provided information on irrigation [[canals]] used by prehistoric peoples from 2100 B.C. to 500 B.C.&lt;ref name=" Las Capas "&gt;{{cite book |author=M. Palacios-Fest &amp; Owen K.

Jonathan B. Mabry |publisher= Center for Desert Archaeology, Tucson, Arizona, USA |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeological work in arid climates throughout the Americas has incorporated Micropaleontological analysis to build a more complete picture of prehistoric climate and human activity.

Evolving Definition : : '''Morphology''' in [[architecture]] is the study of the evolution of form within the built environment. Often specifically reducible to the interaction of people and the material world, this in fact broad concept references linguistics, history, sociology, physics, and biology to describe changes in the formal syntax of buildings and cities as their relationship to people and individuals evolves and changes.  Often morphology describes discursive processes, such as in the evolution of a design concept from first conception to production, but can also be understood as the categorical study in the change of buildings and their use from a historical perspective.  Similar to genres of music, morphology concretizes 'movements' and arrives at definitions of architectural 'styles' or typologies.  Architectural typologies are often described by the movements that gave rise to a certain aesthetic, the influences of which are usually cultural or philosophical in origin. Some examples are, [[Indigenous Architecture|indigenous architecture]], [[Classical Architecture|classical architecture]], [[baroque architecture]], [[modernism]], [[postmodernism]], [[deconstructionism]], [[brutalism]], and [[futurism]].  Recent advances in fluid and cross platform tools such as [[3d printing]], [[virtual reality]], and [[building information modeling]] make the current contemporary typology formally difficult to pinpoint into one holistic definition. Advances in the study of Architectural (formal) morphology have the potential to influence or foster new fields of study in the realms of the arts, cognitive science, psychology, behavioral science, neurology, mapping, linguistics, and other as yet unknown social spatial practices or studies. Often Architectural Morphologies are reflexive or indicative of political influences of their time and perhaps more importantly, place.

'''''Mycotaxon''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] that covers the [[nomenclature]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[fungi]], including [[lichens]]. The journal was founded by Grégoire L. Hennebert and [[Richard P. Korf]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="Korf 2005"/&gt; They were frustrated that papers submitted to journals such as ''[[Mycologia]]'' took a year or longer from submission to publication. Korf and Hennebert introduced a number of innovations to make their journal more efficient and accessible than its contemporaries. ''Mycotaxon'' reduced the wait time between submission and publication by requiring authors to submit camera-ready copy. [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] was the industry standard at the time; ''Mycotaxon'' used photo-offset [[lithography]] to expedite publication.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; A quarterly journal, ''Mycotaxon'' aimed to publish papers within four months of submission.&lt;ref name="Korf 1974"/&gt; ''Mycotaxon'' took an unusual non-blind approach to refereeing: authors were required to enlist a reviewer outside of their institution to peer-review their manuscript prior to its submission.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; Initially ''Mycotaxon'' did not demand page charges from authors, rather relying on subscription fees to finance publication. Papers of all lengths were accepted.&lt;ref name="Korf 1974"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">'''Phoslock''' is the commercial name for a [[bentonite]] clay in which the sodium and/or calcium ions are exchanged for [[lanthanum]]. The addition of this element allows it to bind with phosphates to form rhabdophane (&lt;chem&gt;LaPO4.\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;) and thereby remove them from the water column. It is used in lake restoration projects as a tool to manage [[eutrophication]] and manage [[algal blooms]] (specifically [[cyanobacteria]] or blue green algae) by reducing [[phosphorus]], one of the major contributing factors to algal growth.

It was developed in Australia by the [[CSIRO]] in the late 1990s by Dr Grant Douglas (US Patent 6350383) as a way of utilising the ability of lanthanum to bind phosphate in freshwater natural aquatic systems. The first large-scale trial took place in January 2000 in the [[Canning River]], Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoslock.com.au/irm/ShowStaticCategory.aspx?CategoryID=172&amp;masterpage=5 About Phoslock], Phoslock Water Solutions&lt;/ref&gt; More recent [[CSIRO]] research has involved the development of a nanoclay hybrid with a demonstrated ability to remove dissolved phosphorus from both natural and wastewaters.  
  
During its development, patenting and commercialisation by CSIRO and subsequent commercial production, Phoslock has been a subject in academic research (,&lt;ref&gt;Egemose et al, Chemical lake restoration products: sediment stability and phosphorus dynamics, Environment Science &amp; Technology 44 (3), 985-991 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lurling et al, Effects of lanthanum and lanthanum-modified clay on growth, survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna, Water Research 44 (3), 309-319 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb et al, Application of Phoslock™, an innovative phosphorus binding clay, to two Western Australian waterways - preliminary findings, Hydrological Processes, 494, 237-243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, et al, Phoslock™ - A new technique to reduce internal phosphorus loads in aquatic systems.

The largest number of whole lake applications and the most comprehensive pre and post-application monitoring has taken place in Europe, primarily Germany (where it is sold under the tradename Bentophos), the Netherlands and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoslock.eu|title=Home : Phoslock|website=Phoslock.eu|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12693">The '''Planetary Collegium''' is an international research platform that promotes the integration of art, science, technology, and consciousness research, under the rubric of ''technoetic arts''.  It is currently based in [[Plymouth University]]. The Collegium's Hub is the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts (CAiiA), and it has had nodes in Zurich, Milan, Lucerne, Trento, Kefalonia, and currently in Shanghai. The founding President is Professor [[Roy Ascott]].
[[File:Logo for The Planetary Collegium.jpg|thumb|Planetary Collegium logo]]

== History ==
The Planetary Collegium was  conceived and established by [[Roy Ascott]] as the ''Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts'' ('''CAiiA''')  in 1994 at what is now the [[University of Wales, Newport]] 

Three years later, Ascott established '''STAR''' (Science Technology and Art Research) in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth. '''CAiiA-STAR''' constituted a joint research platform, with access to supervisory and technical resources of both universities.

In 2003, Ascott contracted to relocate the platform to [[Plymouth University]], renaming it the '''Planetary Collegium''', where it is currently located in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. The contract with Plymouth University expires in July 2021, when Ascott plans to relocate it in China. 

Since 1997, the Collegium has given more than seventy conferences and symposia in Europe, North and South America, Japan, China and Australia.

Since its inception, first at the University of Wales, and currently at Plymouth,  over 80 doctoral candidates have graduated from the programme. 

==Aims==
The Collegium aims to produce new knowledge in the context of the arts, through transdisciplinary inquiry and critical discourse, with special reference to [[technoetic]] research and to advances in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/ascott/biography/|title=Media Art Net - Ascott, Roy: Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its seeks to reflect the social, technological and spiritual aspirations of an emerging planetary society, while sustaining a critical awareness of the retrograde forces and fields that inhibit social and cultural development. It combines the face-to-face association of individuals with the trans-cultural unity of telematic communities, thereby developing a network of research nodes strategically located across the planet, each with a distinctive cultural ethos. The Collegium seeks outcomes that involve new language, systems, structures, and behaviours, and insights into the nature of mind, matter and human identity. 

== Structure ==
As conceived and directed by Ascott, the Planetary Collegium consists of artists, theoreticians and scholars working within the context of [[transdisciplinarity]] and [[syncretism]] so as to develop their research in the practice and theory of [[new media art]] with a special interest in [[telematics]] and [[technoetics]]. Currently, their doctoral research leads to the award of the '''University of Plymouth PhD'''. Post-doctoral research is also pursued. It has attracted an impressive number of internationally well-established artists, musicians, performers, designers, architects, theorists and scholars involved in doctoral and post-doctoral research.

Currently, the hub of the Collegium, '''CAiiA-Hub''' (the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts) is situated in the School of Art and Media, Faculty of Arts, [[Plymouth University]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated464"&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; The Collegium has a Node '''De Tao-Node''' [http://www.detao-node.com] in Shanghai. The programme, which is largely part-time, has a virtually 100% success rate, with well over 80 doctoral graduates .

In addition to doctoral candidates and graduates, supervisors and honorary members, its constituency also includes general members, who share the aims and interests of the Collegium, and are invited to participate in its development 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/20001464384/

The Planetary Collegium has a geographically dispersed membership,  and convenes the majority of its research sessions and public conferences in Asia, Australia, the Americas and Europe.

== Awards ==
The Collegium was awarded The World Universities Forum Award for Best Practice in Higher Education 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ontheuniversity.com/2011/12/31/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2011-award-for-best-practice-in-higher-education/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116065227/http://ontheuniversity.com/2011/12/31/announcing-the-winner-of-the-2011-award-for-best-practice-in-higher-education/ |date=January 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern Marketing''' is a term derived from [[postmodern]] philosophical movements where there are cultural tendencies of inherent suspicion towards a global cultural narrative or meta-narrative.  Postmodern marketing takes this same philosophical perspective and applies it to the way [[advertising]] initiatives are handled in the current post-World War II era.  Postmodern marketing is approaching or has passed through a new era in [[advertising]], [[Brand management|branding]], and strategic [[brand]] thinking.&lt;ref name="dmarson-pg226"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Well Encyclopedia of Management |last=Marson |first=David J. |year=2011 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=Malden, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-631-23317-6 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern marketing is inherently focused on customized experiences where broad market generalizations are no-longer applied or implemented on behalf of branded communications.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Postmodern Marketing?",|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the technique requires marketers to remove "new aged adlandia" trends and developments to focus on how the consumer prefers to be messaged to.

As a result, the ad aged "art and science" debate around [[creativity|creative]], [[Advertising#Media|media]], [[marketing]] and [[Brand management|branding]] are put to an end.  With a postmodern marketing approach a one-to-one communication is created between real humans, controlling real mouses, real computers, real keyboards and real [[mobile telephones]].

== Origins ==
The development of postmodern marketing is built on the foundations of modern marketing (with analysis, planning, implementation and control deeply rooted in its process).&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   Postmodern marketing however, acts more of a collection of approaches in the need to stay nimble, reactive and able to engage and shift with consumers from a non-definitive point of view.  Postmodern marketing saw great acceptance in the early 1990s with the emerging developments of the [[Splinternet]] and marketers realization that "traditional" strategic practices like Porters five forces, the Wheel of Retailing, and the Boston Matrix had become outdated and not able to keep up with or report on consumer media habits, creative tone, and umbrella [[Brand management|branding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   As a result, postmodern marketing was born.

== Three Categories of Postmodern Marketing ==
Although the exact origins of the term is unknown, scholarly reports date the defining of the movement to the early 1990s by the "European Journal of Marketing" author Stephen Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/fast-company-staff/fast-company-blog/post-modern-marketing |title=Post-Modern Marketing |publisher=FastCompany.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his findings, postmodern marketing is made up of three distinct categories (1) the idea of change, new, and complex, (2) sub-discipline of consumer research, and (3) marketing practices and research methodologies.   Furthermore, as Brown implies, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with "artistic" attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

=== The Idea of Change, New and Complex ===

The idea of change is a deeply rooted philosophy when studying postmodern marketing.  When planning and strategizing within the "new now" or the "new new now" of media, technical services and creative styling a practitioner within the space must be comfortable with new and more complex systems and created worlds, platform and messaging structures.  Fundamentally grounded on dramatic political and economic pressures the changing landscape illustrated the need to be nimble, direct and personalized communication and a high concern for [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="styler"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unspeakable: Discourse, Dialogue, and Rhetoric in the Postmodern World (Rhetoric of Human Sciences) |last=Tyler |first=Stephen J. |year=1987 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Pr |location= Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-299-11274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sub-discipline of Consumer Research ===

To adjust with shifts in consumer consumption habits, postmodern [[marketing]] has created new disciplines to better sample, survey and poll target [[consumer group]] to better align with habit, preference and beliefs.  Many call this shift a "naturalistic" or interpretive" approach,  which mainly emerged from the control of non-renewable resources.

=== Marketing Practices and Research Methodologies ===

Outcomes of redefined consumer research studies are newly defined approaches to marketing and media disciplines.  Although some of these disciplines may be out dated, they illustrate core differences between postmodern marketing and modern marketing methodologies.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

These approaches to marketing suggest that the role of a [[brand manager]], digital agency, creative, [[media planner]], account director, etc. is only defined by the [[company culture|company's culture]] that they in.  Hence, a postmodern marketer is one who approaches marketing and advertising campaigns with a "thinker marker" mentality.  Where they pull in and emphasize the need for creative relevance, companion [[Advertising#Media|media]], collateral activation, social engagement, and most importantly have the means to pull it all together.  Many believe that a postmodern marketing approach creates greater efficiencies, order, opportunity and a chance to gain real world insights from the perspective of the consumer.  As a result, postmodern [[marketing]] like postmodernality stands as a transitory phase in 21st centuryvertising and has ushered in an era of styles and nimble techniques.

== Myths ==
Postmodern marketing is not the same as "non-traditional" or [[digital marketing]]. It is instead made up only of new aged media engagements brought about by the developments like that of the iPad.

Social media belongs to the young.  According to Sean Carton writer of ClickZ, the idea of social media belonging to only the young is, "Baloney".  With the accelerated growth of account activation amongst the 55+ age cohort according to leading marketing research firms like [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], [[eMarketer]], [[comScore]] and [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], the idea of social media belonging to only the young Republicans is an inaccurate statement of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/1709224/-post-modern-marketing-myths-busted |title=Postmodern Marketing Myths: Busted |publisher=ClickZ.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==
According to many scholastic journals, postmodern marketing hinges on and has aided to the development of many changes to the current marketing model.  Some of the more renowned conditions that postmodern marketing is known to influence and disrupt are :&lt;ref name="ffuat-pg40"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Marketing In  Postmodern World",|last=Fuat |first=Firat |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 29 Iss: 1|pages=40–56 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hyper reality:''' Relating to simulations or simulated experiences.  Tourist attractions, amusement parks and "subculture" vacation destinations are known for their ability in creating hyper-real "immersive worlds".
* '''Fragmentation:''' Adheres to many marketing disciplines.  These being media space, consumer attention, consumption habits, and communication/messaging strategies.
* '''Reversals of production and consumption:''' A condition that occurs when the roles of consumer and marketer change.  This is when consumers become "brand ambassadors" for a company and voice concern, opinion and align their beliefs with that of the brand through a number of traditional and non-traditional media channels.
* '''Decentering of the subject:''' Occurs when a brand personifies the product or service being marketed.  As a result, the promoted item become a "Hero" or a new-age savior.
* '''Paradoxical juxtaposition:''' The ultimate state of postmodern marketing.  This condition allows consumers and brand managers to act in the moment and adjust to changing landscapes, tone, pressure, and emotional cues.  As a result, they are able to represent a different self-image and avoid moments of conformity to single, set brand guidelines, perceived reputations and roles.
* '''Loss of commitment:'''  An outcome of many postmodern marketing experiences can result in loss of commitment amongst brand ambassadors and loyalists.  This is usually driven from the inability for brand managers to adhere to or recreate the level of consumer engagement needed retain the same level of consumer interest and interaction.

In [[anatomy]], a '''process''' ({{lang-la|processus}}) is a projection or outgrowth of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] from a larger body.&lt;ref&gt;Dorland's Medical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a vertebra, a process may serve for muscle attachment and leverage (as in the case of the [[transverse processes|transverse]] and [[spinous processes]]), or to fit (forming a [[synovial joint]]), with another vertebra (as in the case of the [[articular processes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Keith L. et al. (2010) ''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'', 6th Ed, p.442 fig. 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used even at the [[histology|microanatomic]] level, where [[cell (biology)|cells]] can have processes such as [[cilium|cilia]] or [[podocyte#Pedicel|pedicels]]. Depending on the tissue, processes may also be called by other terms, such as ''apophysis'', ''[[tubercle]]'', or ''[[protuberance (disambiguation)|protuberance]]''.

'''Reactive attachment disorder''' ('''RAD''') is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon [[attachment disorder|disorder]] that can affect children.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR 2000 p. 129"&gt;DSM-IV-TR (2000) [[American Psychiatric Association]] p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Daniel Schechter|Schechter]] DS, Willheim E | title = Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–86 |date=July 2009 | pmid = 19486844 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.001 | pmc = 2690512}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts.  It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the "inhibited form". Due to recent revision in the [[DSM-5]] the "disinhibited form" is now considered a separate diagnosis named "[[disinhibited attachment disorder]]".

RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of [[neglect]], [[abuse]], abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent change of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; It is differentiated from [[pervasive developmental disorder]] or developmental delay and from possibly [[comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions such as [[intellectual disability]], all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment ''disorder'' are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|attachment ''styles'']] such as insecure or disorganized attachment.

Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="prior228"&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.&lt;ref name="oconzean2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disorders: assessment strategies and treatment approaches |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12944216 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on [[attachment theory]] and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated. Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless "attachment disorder" within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as [[attachment therapy]]. Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment ''therapy'', some of which are physically and psychologically coercive, and considered to be [[wikt: antithetical|antithetical]] to attachment ''theory''.&lt;ref name="O'Connor &amp; Nilsen"&gt;O'Connor TG, Nilsen WJ (2005) "Models versus Metaphors in Translating Attachment Theory to the Clinic and Community". In Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L and Greenberg MT (Eds) ''Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, research, intervention, and policy.'' pp. 313–26. The Guilford Press. Duke series in Child Development and Public Policy. (2005) {{ISBN|1-59385-470-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many constitute [[child abuse|abuse]].

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Attachment theory| attachment disorder}}
[[Pediatricians]] are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. [[Infant]]s up to about 18–24 months ''may'' present with [[Failure to thrive|non-organic failure to thrive]] and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with [[malnutrition]] or [[dehydration]], while serum [[growth hormone]] levels will be normal or elevated.&lt;ref name=Sad04&gt;{{cite book |title=Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry |last=Sadock |first=BJ |author2=Sadock VA  |year=2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7817-5033-4 |pages=570–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children. This can manifest itself in three ways:

# Indiscriminate and excessive attempts to receive comfort and affection from any available adult, even relative strangers (older children and adolescents may also aim attempts at peers). This may often times appear as denial of comfort from anyone as well.
# Extreme reluctance to initiate or accept comfort and affection, even from familiar adults, especially when distressed.
# Actions that otherwise would be classified as [[conduct disorder]], such as [[Animal abuse|mutilating animals]], [[Sibling abuse|harming siblings]] or other family, or [[Self-harm|harming themselves intentionally]].&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006, p. 80"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 80. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt;

While RAD occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. However, the instances of that ability are rare.&lt;ref name="Rutter 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutter M |title=Nature, nurture, and development: from evangelism through science toward policy and practice |journal=Child Dev |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |year=2002 |pmid=14717240 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria includes symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RICHTERS|first=MARGOT MOSER|last2=VOLKMAR|first2=FRED R.|date=1994-03-01|title=Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709641733|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=33|issue=3|pages=328–332|doi=10.1097/00004583-199403000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment tools===
There is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]]),&lt;ref name="Ainsworth et al. (1979)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Solomon (1986)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Main &amp;amp; Solomon 1990"/&gt; the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment,&lt;ref name= "Crittenden 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crittenden PM |title= Quality of attachment in the preschool years|journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume= 4 |issue=02 |pages= 209–41|year= 1992 |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0954579400000110|accessdate= 6 January 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400000110}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment,&lt;ref name="NICHHD"&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |year=1996 |title=Characteristics of infant child care: Factors contributing to positive caregiving |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=269–306(38) |doi= 10.1016/S0885-2006(96)90009-5 |first1=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attachment measures#Developing methods for older toddlers and children|Attachment Q-sort]]&lt;ref name="Waters &amp;amp; Deane 1985"&gt;Waters E, Deane K (1985). "Defining and assessing individual differences in attachment relationships: Q-methodology and the organization of behavior in infancy and early childhood". In Bretherton I and Waters E (Eds.) ''Growing pains of attachment theory and research: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'' 50, Serial No. 209 (1–2), pp. 41–65.&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of narrative techniques using [[attachment measures#Other approaches|stem stories]], puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the [[Attachment measures#Other approaches|Child Attachment Interview]] and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.&lt;ref name="Zeanah &amp; Benoit 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America|vauthors=Zeanah CH, Benoit D | year= 1995 |title= Clinical applications of a parent perception interview in infant mental health |volume= 43| pages= 539–554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research also uses the [[Attachment measures#Developing methods for older toddlers and children|Disturbances of Attachment Interview]] (DAI) developed by Smyke and [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] (1999).&lt;ref name="Smyke &amp; Zeanah (1999)"&gt;Smyke A, Zeanah CH (1999). "Disturbances of Attachment Interview". Available on the ''Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'' website at www.jaacap.com via Article plus.[http://acs.tx.ovid.com/acs/.93554d254ce5ec50e95dc1edabf7938b1c449aa9b2907e89124e214976c8be5cd89fe896880c65062e4945ba06270e8ea898a69e2b2e5aa1286b97438aef50246f.doc] Retrieved on 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The DAI is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely "having a discriminated, preferred adult", "seeking comfort when distressed", "responding to comfort when offered", "social and emotional reciprocity", "emotional regulation", "checking back after venturing away from the care giver", "reticence with unfamiliar adults", "willingness to go off with relative strangers", "self-endangering behavior", "excessive clinging", "vigilance/hypercompliance" and "role reversal". This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment.

==Causes==
Although increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to [[genetic defect]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), pp. 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt; reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors, but on its own does not explain attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that types of [[temperament]], or constitutional response to the environment, may make some individuals  susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years.&lt;ref name="Marshall &amp; Fox (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=492–502 |doi= 10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |vauthors=Marshall PJ, Fox NA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.&lt;ref name="prior"&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited, studies show that the abuse and neglect was far more prominent and severe in the cases of RAD, disinhibited type. The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same.&lt;ref name="Zeanah &amp;amp; Fox (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Fox NA |title=Temperament and attachment disorders |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=32–41 |year=2004 |pmid=15028539 |doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3301_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year [[twin study]], it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of [[psychopathology]], including RAD, [[Borderline Personality Disorder]] (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order [[Emotional dysregulation|self-regulation]] is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the "templates" in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for "re-regulation" (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of "corrective" experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.&lt;ref name="Heller ''et al.'' (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heller SS, Boris NW, Fuselier SH, Page T, Koren-Karie N, Miron D |title=Reactive attachment disorder in maltreated twins follow-up: from 18 months to 8 years |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=63–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16581624 |doi=10.1080/14616730600585177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Attachment measures}}
RAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately.&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006, p. 80"/&gt; There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.&lt;ref name="prior228"/&gt;

According to the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] (AACAP), children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation.&lt;ref name="AACAP"&gt;[http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/reactive_attachment_disorder Reactive Attachment Disorder.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203213050/http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/reactive_attachment_disorder |date=3 February 2008 }} American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, Facts for Families,  No. 85; Updated December 2002.  Retrieved on 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see  [http://dcfswebresource.prairienet.org/resources/rad.php Reactive Attachment Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228050441/http://dcfswebresource.prairienet.org/resources/rad.php |date=28 December 2007 }}, DCFS, State of Illinois and [http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/attach.pdf DBHS Practice Protocol: Disturbances and Disorders of Attachment] (PDF), Arizona Department of Health Services, 2 October 2006. Retrieved on 2008-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the [[British Association for Adoption and Fostering]] (BAAF) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child’s individual and family history.&lt;ref name="BAAF"&gt;[http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf Attachment Disorders, their Assessment and Intervention/Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002051146/http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf |date=2 October 2008 }} (PDF). British Association for Adoption and Fostering, Position Statement 4, 2006. Retrieved on 23 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
ICD-10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood, known as RAD, and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]], less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes, inhibited type and disinhibited type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
* markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts (e.g., the child is avoidant or unresponsive to care when offered by caregivers or is indiscriminately affectionate with strangers);&lt;ref name=DSMIV /&gt;
* the disturbance is not accounted for solely by [[Child development|developmental]] delay and does not meet the criteria for [[pervasive developmental disorder]];
* onset before five years of age (there is no age specified before five years of age at which RAD cannot be diagnosed);&lt;ref name=DSMIV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Text Revision|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|pages=943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a history of significant neglect;
* an implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.

ICD-10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of "[[pathogenic]] care" defined as persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder. For this reason, part of the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is the child's history of care rather than observation of symptoms.

In DSM-IV-TR the ''inhibited'' form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour).&lt;ref name= "DSM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 313.89 Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood  |publisher= AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC) |location= United States}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The ''disinhibited'' form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures).&lt;ref name ="DSM"/&gt; There is therefore a lack of "specificity" of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.

The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD-10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM-IV-TR as follows:
* [[Child abuse|abuse]], ([[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or physical), in addition to neglect;
* associated emotional disturbance;
* poor social interaction with peers, aggression towards self and others, misery, and growth failure in some cases (inhibited form only);
* evidence of capacity for social reciprocity and responsiveness as shown by elements of normal social relatedness in interactions with appropriately responsive, non-deviant adults (disinhibited form only).

The first of these is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver, while the disinhibited form is more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; ICD-10 states the disinhibited form "tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances". Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised. The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision.&lt;ref name="WHO1992"&gt;World Health Organisation (1992) ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)''. Geneva: World health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zilberstein K | year = 2006 | title = Clarifying core characteristics of attachment disorders | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]] | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 55–64 | doi=10.1037/0002-9432.76.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM-V.&lt;ref name=DSM-V&gt;Proposed Revision Reactive Attachment Disorder, ''American Psychiatric Association'' (2012). Retrieved from http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=120&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with the inhibited type, one disorder will be reclassified as ''Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood''.&lt;ref name=DSMIV /&gt;

In regards to pathogenic care, or the type of care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.&lt;ref name=DSM-V /&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
The diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained [[mental health]] expert with particular expertise in [[differential diagnosis]] is considered essential.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanson RF, Spratt EG |title=Reactive Attachment Disorder: what we know about the disorder and implications for treatment |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=137–45 |year=2000 |pmid=11232086 |doi=10.1177/1077559500005002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980109603678 |author=Wilson SL |title=Attachment disorders: review and current status |journal=J Psychol |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=37–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11235838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt; Several other disorders, such as [[conduct disorder]]s, [[oppositional defiant disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[post traumatic stress disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as [[autism spectrum|autism]], [[pervasive developmental disorder]], [[pediatric schizophrenia|childhood schizophrenia]] and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization.&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt; Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;

===Alternative diagnosis===
In the absence of a standardized diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD]], were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as [[attachment therapy]]. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), pp. 82–83. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt; There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, [[Externalization|externalizing]] behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.&lt;ref name="Gutman-Steinmetz &amp;amp; Crowell (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guttmann-Steinmetz S, Crowell JA |title=Attachment and externalizing disorders: a developmental psychopathology perspective |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=440–51 |year=2006 |pmid=16601649 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000196422.42599.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others.&lt;ref name="Randolph 1996"&gt;Randolph, Elizabeth Marie. (1996). ''Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire''. Institute for Attachment, Evergreen CO.&lt;/ref&gt; The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, or are not related to attachment difficulties.

==Treatment==
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)|Attachment therapy}}
Assessing the child's safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, [[family therapy]], individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt;

In 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines (devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=November 2005 |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1206–19 |title= Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood |last1=Boris |first1=Neil W. |last2=Zeanah |first2=Charles H. |author3=Work Group on Quality Issues |pmid=16239871 |url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(09)62229-2/fulltext |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendations in the guidelines include the following:
# "The most important intervention for young children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and who lack an attachment to a discriminated caregiver is for the clinician to advocate for providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure."
# "Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder is based on symptoms displayed by the child, assessing the caregiver's attitudes toward and perceptions about the child is important for treatment selection."
# "Children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. After ensuring that the child is in a safe and stable placement, effective attachment treatment must focus on creating positive interactions with caregivers."
# "Children who meet criteria for reactive attachment disorder and who display aggressive and oppositional behavior require adjunctive (additional) treatments."

Mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BakermansKranenburg ''et al.''

The programs invariably include a detailed assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response. Some of these treatment or prevention programs are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents, as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses.&lt;ref name="Stovall &amp;amp; Dozier (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stovall KC, Dozier M |title=The development of attachment in new relationships: single subject analyses for 10 foster infants |journal=Dev.

===Attachment therapy===
{{main|Attachment therapy}}

The terms [[attachment disorder]], attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaffin|first=Mark|last2=Hanson|first2=Rochelle|last3=Saunders|first3=Benjamin E.|last4=Nichols|first4=Todd|last5=Barnett|first5=Douglas|last6=Zeanah|first6=Charles|last7=Berliner|first7=Lucy|last8=Egeland|first8=Byron|last9=Newman|first9=Elana|date=2006-02-01|title=Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment Therapy, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems|url=http://cmx.sagepub.com/content/11/1/76|journal=Child Maltreatment|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=76–89|doi=10.1177/1077559505283699|issn=1077-5595|pmid=16382093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the mainstream programs is a [[Attachment therapy#Treatment characteristics|form of treatment]] generally known as attachment therapy, a subset of techniques (and accompanying novel diagnosis) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD. These "attachment disorders" use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. Sufferers of "attachment disorder" are said to lack empathy and remorse.

Treatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of [[Age regression in therapy|regression]] and [[catharsis]], accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and parental control.&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006 pp. 79"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), pp. 79–80. The APSAC Taskforce Report.&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 85. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; There is little or no [[Evidence based medicine|evidence base]] and techniques vary from non-coercive [[Therapy|therapeutic]] work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are [[holding therapy]], [[Rebirthing (attachment therapy)|rebirthing]], [[rage-reduction]] and the [[Evergreen model]]. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.''

==Prognosis==
The AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] (dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;

Findings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors.&lt;ref name="Connor &amp;amp; Rutter (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Rutter M |title=Attachment disorder behavior following early severe deprivation: extension and longitudinal follow-up.

Studies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.&lt;ref name="Roy ''et al.''(2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roy P, Rutter M, Pickles A |year=2004 |title=Institutional care: Associations between overactivity and lack of selectivity in social relationships|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=866–73  |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00278.x |pmid=15056316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw-Fusilier ''et al.'' (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinshaw-Fuselier|first1=Sarah|last2=Boris|first2=Neil W.|last3=Zeanah|first3=Charles H.|title=Reactive attachment disorder in maltreated twins|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=20|issue=1| year=1999| pages=42–59|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;42::AID-IMHJ4&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.

In the follow-up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years, the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted. The girl's symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors—a well-documented outcome. The boy still exhibited self-endangering behaviors, not within RAD criteria but possibly within "secure base distortion", (where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment). At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems, or the child's "internal working models". The twins' symptoms were indicative of different trajectories. The girl showed externalizing symptoms (particularly deceit), contradictory reports of current functioning, chaotic personal narratives, struggles with friendships, and emotional disengagement with her caregiver, resulting in a clinical picture described as "quite concerning". The boy still evidenced self-endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression, separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties. It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently. The [[Attachment measures#Other approaches|narrative measures]] used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships.&lt;ref name="Heller ''et al.'' (2006)"/&gt;

One paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on [[Self monitoring|self-monitoring]] (regulating your behavior to "look good"). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.&lt;ref name="Hall &amp;amp; Geher (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980309600605 |vauthors=Hall SE, Geher G |title=Behavioral and personality characteristics of children with reactive attachment disorder|journal=J Psychol |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=145–62 |year=2003 |pmid=12735525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Epidemiological data are limited, but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR 2000 p. 129"/&gt; The [[prevalence]] of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages.&lt;ref name="prior" /&gt; There is little systematically gathered [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] information on RAD.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt; A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Skovgaard AM, Houmann T, Christiansen E, etal |year=2007 |title= The prevalence of mental health problems in children 1½ years of age&amp;nbsp;– the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry  |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=62–70 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01659.x |pmid= 17244271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there.&lt;ref name="Chisholm ''et al.'' (1995)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Smyke ''et al.''(2002)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeanah &amp;amp; Smyke ''et al.''(2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Smyke AT, Koga SF, Carlson E |title=Attachment in institutionalized and community children in Romania|journal=Child Dev |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=1015–28 |year=2005 |pmid=16149999 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00894.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness.&lt;ref name="Chisholm ''et al.''

A 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in Bucharest, in which the DAI was used, challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child.&lt;ref name="Smyke ''et al.''(2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smyke AT, Dumitrescu A, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disturbances in young children.

There are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD.&lt;ref name="Boris ''et al.''(2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Hinshaw-Fuselier SS, Smyke AT, Scheeringa MS, Heller SS, Zeanah CH |title=Comparing criteria for attachment disorders: establishing reliability and validity in high-risk samples |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=568–77 |year=2004 |pmid=15100563 |doi=10.1097/00004583-200405000-00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in ''maltreated'' rather than ''neglected'' toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 81. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt; Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties.&lt;ref name="dsm"&gt;[[DSM-IV]] [[American Psychiatric Association]] 1994, as discussed in Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders.&lt;ref name="dsm"/&gt; [[Psychological resilience|Resilience]] is a common and normal human characteristic.&lt;ref name="Bonanno"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonanno GA|year=2004 |title=Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events? |format=PDF |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/bem/behavhealth/documents/loss_trauma.pdf|accessdate=26 January 2008 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20 |pmid=14736317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in [[foster care|foster children]], [[adoption|adoptive children]], or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;

There are few data on comorbid conditions, but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinshaw-Fusilier ''et al.'' (1999)"/&gt; Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Connor &amp;amp; Rutter (2000)"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Attachment theory|Attachment in children}}
Reactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard [[nosology|nosologies]] of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with [[failure to thrive]]. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.&lt;ref name="Zean96"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeanah CH |title=Beyond insecurity: a reconceptualization of attachment disorders of infancy |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=42–52 |year=1996 |pmid=8907083 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.64.1.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is [[attachment theory]], based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by [[John Bowlby]], [[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[René Spitz]]. Attachment theory is a framework that employs [[Psychology|psychological]], [[Ethology|ethological]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to ''seek proximity'' to a ''particular attachment figure'' (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress,  behavior which appears to have survival value.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby [1969] (1997 edition) pp. 224–27.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment [[Human behavior|behaviors]] tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. [[Attachment in children|Infants become attached to adults]] who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby  [1969] (1997 edition) pp. 313–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name=" Bretherton &amp;amp; Munholland 1999"&gt;Bretherton I, Munholland KA (1999). "Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited". In Cassidy J and Shaver PR (Eds.) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications.'' pp. 89–111. Guilford Press {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby  [1969] (1997 edition) p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.

The pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as ''styles'' or ''patterns''. There are four attachment [[Attachment in children#Attachment patterns|styles]] ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as ''secure'', ''anxious-ambivalent'', ''anxious-avoidant'', (all ''organized'')&lt;ref name="Ainsworth et al. (1979)"&gt;Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S (1979). ''Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation.'' Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''disorganized''.&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Solomon (1986)"&gt;Main M, Solomon J (1986). "Discovery of an insecure disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern: procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior". In Brazelton TB and Yogman M (Eds.) ''Affective development in infancy'', pp. 95–124. Norwood, NJ: Ablex {{ISBN|0-89391-345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Main &amp;amp; Solomon 1990"&gt;Main M, Solomon J (1990). "Procedures for identifying infants as disorganized/disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation". In Greenberg M, Cicchetti D and Cummings E (Eds.) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention'', pp. 121–60. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-30630-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter three are characterised as ''insecure''. These are assessed using the [[Attachment measures#Measuring attachment in children|Strange Situation Procedure]], designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;

A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and happy to see the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.&lt;ref name="Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)"/&gt;

Although there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such.&lt;ref name="Thompson (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson RA |title=The legacy of early attachments |journal=Child Dev |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=145–52 |year=2000 |pmid=10836568 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00128 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A [[disease|disorder]] in the [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations.&lt;ref name="Zean96"/&gt; The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.&lt;ref name="O'Con '02"&gt;O’Connor TG (2002), "Attachment disorders in infancy and childhood". In Rutter M, Taylor E, (Eds.) ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Modern Approaches'' (4th  ed.) Blackwell Scientific publications. pp. 776–792. {{ISBN|0-632-01229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term "attachment disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 77. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications.&lt;ref name="Zean96"/&gt; It is also used within the field of attachment therapy, as is the term reactive attachment disorder, to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 82–83. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD.&lt;ref name="Boris ''et al.'' 1996)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH, Larrieu JA, Scheeringa MS, Heller SS |title=Attachment disorders in infancy and early childhood: a preliminary investigation of diagnostic criteria|journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=295–97 |date=1 February 1998|pmid=9464217|doi=10.1176/ajp.155.2.295|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9464217 |accessdate=31 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Scheeringa M, Boris N, Heller S, Smyke A, Trapani J |date=August 2004 |title=Reactive Attachment Disorder in Maltreated Toddlers  |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect: the International Journal |volume=28 |issue=8 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.010 |pages=877–88 |pmid=15350771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by [[C.H. Zeanah]] and N. Boris. The first of these is ''disorder of attachment,'' in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is ''secure base distortion'', where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is ''disrupted attachment''. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed.&lt;ref name="Boris &amp;amp; Zeanah (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |year=1999 |title= Disturbance and disorders of attachment in infancy: An overview|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal |volume=20|pages=1–9 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;1::AID-IMHJ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required.&lt;ref name="oconzean2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeanah 2000"&gt;Zeanah CH (2000). "Disturbances and disorders of attachment in early childhood". In Zeanah CH (Ed.) ''Handbook of infant mental health'' (2nd ed.) pp. 358–62. New York: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, [[Daniel Schechter]] and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood.   Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue.  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665–687.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Ijzendoorn M, Bakermans-Kranenburg M |date=September 2003 |title=Attachment disorders and disorganized attachment: Similar and different |journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=313–20(8) |doi= 10.1080/14616730310001593938 |pmid=12944229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg 1999"&gt;Greenberg MT (1999). ''Attachment and Psychopathology in Childhood.'' In Cassidy J and Shaver PR (Eds.) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications.'' pp. 469–96. Guilford Press {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work by C.H. Zeanah&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.&lt;ref name= "Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (1990)"&gt;Main M, Hesse E (1990) "Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infants' insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment status: Is frightened or frightening behavior the linking mechanism?" In Greenberg M, Cicchetti D and Cummings E (Eds.) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention'', pp. 161–182 Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-30630-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft of the proposed DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.&lt;ref&gt;DSM-V Proposed Draft.

'''Regulome''' refers to the whole set of regulatory components in a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Those components can be regulatory elements, [[gene]]s, [[mRNA]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[metabolite]]s. The description includes the interplay of regulatory effects between these components, and their dependence on variables such as [[subcellular localization]], [[Biological tissue|tissue]], developmental stage, and pathological state.

== Components ==

One of the major players in cellular regulation are [[transcription factor]]s, proteins that regulate the expression of genes. Other proteins that bind to transcription factors to form [[Transcription preinitiation complex|transcriptional complexes]] might modify the activity of transcription factors, for example blocking their capacity to bind to a [[promotor (biology)|promoter]].

[[Signaling pathway]]s are groups of proteins that produce an effect in a chain that transmit a signal from one part of the cell to another part, for example, linking the presence of substance at the exterior of the cell to the activation of the expression of a gene.

== Measuring ==

High-throughput technologies for the analysis of biological samples (for example, [[DNA microarray]]s, [[proteomics]] analysis) allow the measurement of thousands of biological components such as mRNAs, proteins, or metabolites. [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation]] of transcription factors can be used to map transcription factor binding sites in the genome.

Such techniques allow researchers to study the effects of particular substances and/or situations on a cellular sample at a genomic level (for example, by addition of a drug, or by placing cells in a situation of stress). The information obtained allows parts of the regulome to be inferred.

== Modeling ==

One of the objectives of [[systems biology]] is the modelization of biological processes using [[mathematics]] and [[computer simulation]]. The production of data from techniques of genomic analysis is not always amenable to interpretation mainly due to the complexity of the data and the large amount of data points. Modelization can handle the data and allow to test a hypothesis (for example, gene A is regulated by protein B) that can be verified experimentally.

== Applications ==

The complete knowledge of the regulome will allow researchers to model cell behaviour entirely. This will facilitate the [[drug design|design of drugs]] for therapy, the control of [[stem cell]] differentiation, and the prognosis of [[disease]].

[[Image:Banksia serrata2.jpg|thumb|right|Fire has triggered the opening of the [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] and the release of seed in this ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' fruiting structure]]
'''Serotiny''' is an [[ecological]] adaptation exhibited by some [[seed plant]]s, in which seed release occurs in response to an environmental trigger, rather than spontaneously at seed maturation.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamont|first=B.|author2=Lemaitre, D. |author3=Cowling, R. |author4=Enright, N. |title=Canopy seed storage in woody-plants|journal=Botanical Review|year=1991|volume=57|issue=4|pages=277–317 |doi=10.1007/bf02858770}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common and best studied trigger is [[fire]]. However, the term ''serotiny'' refers more broadly to plants that release their seeds over a long period of time, irrespective of the trigger or whether release is spontaneous.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt; In this sense, the term is synonymous with [[bradyspory]].

Possible triggers include:
* Death of the parent plant or branch (necriscence, this death can be caused by fire)
* Wetting (hygriscence)
* Warming by the sun (soliscence)
* Drying atmospheric conditions (xeriscence)
* Fire (heat, essentially: pyriscence)
* Fire followed by wetting (pyrohydriscence)
Fire is the most common and best studied case.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt; Some plants may respond to more than one of these triggers. For example, ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'' exhibits primarily fire-mediated serotiny,&lt;ref name=Hernandez2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernández-Serrano|first=A|author2=Verdú M. |author3=González-Martínez S.C. |author4=Pausas J.G. |title=Fire structures pine serotiny at different scales|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2013|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300182|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/Hernandez-2013-AmJBot-serotiny.pdf |volume=100 |pages=2349–2356 |pmid=24222682}}&lt;/ref&gt; but responds weakly to drying atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nathan|first=R|author2=Safriel, U. |author3=Noy-Meir, I. |author4=Schiller, G. |title=Seed release without fire in Pinus halepensis, a Mediterranean serotinous wind-dispersed tree|journal=Journal of Ecology|year=1999|volume=87|issue=4|pages=659–669 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00382.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sierras sequoias and some ''[[Banksia]]'' species are strongly serotinous with respect to fire, but also release some seed in response to plant or branch death.

Serotiny can occur in various degrees. Plants that retain all of their seed indefinitely in the absence of a trigger event are strongly serotinous. Plants that eventually release some of their seed spontaneously in the absence of a trigger are weakly serotinous. Finally, some plants release all of their seed spontaneously after a period of seed storage, but the occurrence of a trigger event curtails the seed storage period, causing all seed to be released immediately; such plants are essentially non-serotinous, or facultatively serotinous.

==Fire-mediated serotiny==
In the [[southern hemisphere]], fire-mediated serotiny is found in [[angiosperms]] in fire-prone parts of [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. It is extremely common in the [[Proteaceae]] of these areas, and also occurs in other taxa, such as ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' ([[Myrtaceae]]) and even exceptionally in ''[[Erica sessiliflora]]'' ([[Ericaceae]]). In the northern hemisphere, it is found in a range of [[conifer]] taxa, including species of ''[[Pinus]]'',&lt;ref name=He2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=T|author2=Pausas JG |author3=Belcher CM |author4=Schwilk DW |author5=Lamont BB. |title=Fire-adapted traits of Pinus arose in the fiery Cretaceous|journal=New Phytologist|year=2012|volume=194|pages=751–759|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04079.x|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/He-2012-NewPhytol_fire-adapted-Pinus.pdf |pmid=22348443}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cupressus]]'',  ''[[Sequoiadendron]]'', and more rarely ''[[Picea]]''.

Since even non-serotinous [[conifer cone|cones]] and woody [[fruits]] can provide protection from the heat of fire,&lt;ref name=Michaletz2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michaletz|first=ST|author2=Johnson EA |author3=Mell WE |author4=Greene DF|title=Timing of fire relative to seed development may enable non-serotinous species to recolonize from the aerial seed banks of fire-killed trees|journal=Biogeosciences|year=2013|volume=10|pages=5061–5078|doi=10.5194/bg-10-5061-2013|url=http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/5061/2013/bg-10-5061-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pounden2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pounden|first=E|author2=Greene DF |author3=Michaletz ST |title=Non-serotinous woody plants behave as aerial seed bank species when a late-summer wildfire coincides with a mast year|journal=Ecology and Evolution|year=2014|volume=4|pages=3830–3840|doi=10.1002/ece3.1247|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1247/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the key adaptation of fire-induced serotiny is seed storage in a canopy seed bank, which can be released by fire.&lt;ref name=Lamont2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamont|first=BB|author2=Enright NJ|title=Adaptive advantages of aerial seed banks|journal=Plant Species Biology|year=2000|volume=15|pages=157–166|doi= 10.1046/j.1442-1984.2000.00036.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1442-1984.2000.00036.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire-release mechanism is commonly a [[resin]] that seals the fruit or cone scales shut, but which melts when heated.&lt;ref name=Beaufait1960&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaufait|first=WR|title=Some Effects of High Temperatures on the Cones and Seeds of Jack Pine|journal=Forest Science|year=1960|volume=6|pages=194–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=EA|author2=Gutsell SL|title=Heat budget and fire behaviour associated with the opening of serotinous cones in two Pinus species|journal=Journal of Vegetation Science|year=1993|volume=4|pages=745–750|doi = 10.2307/3235610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is refined in some ''Banksia'' by the presence inside the [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]] of a winged [[seed separator]] which blocks the opening, preventing the seed from falling out. Thus the follicles open after fire, but seed release does not occur. As the cone dries, wetting by rain or humidity causes the cone scales to expand and reflex, promoting seed release.&lt;ref name=Dawson1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=C|author2=Vincent JFV |author3=Rocca A-M |title=How pine cones open|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=390|pages=668–668|doi=10.1038/37745|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v390/n6661/abs/390668a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seed separator thus acts as a lever against the seeds, gradually prying them out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles. The effect of this adaptation is to ensure that seed release occurs not in response to fire, but in response to the onset of rains following fire. Flammability is also related to serotinous species such as Gamba Grass.

The relative importance of serotiny can vary among populations of the same plant species. For example, North American populations of lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]'') can vary from being highly serotinous to having no serotiny at all, opening annually to release seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muir | first1 = P. S. | last2 = Lotan | first2 = J. E. | year = 1985 | title = Disturbance history and serotiny of Pinus contorta in western Montana | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 1658–1668 | doi=10.2307/1938028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different levels of cone serotiny have been linked to variations in the local fire regime: areas that experience more frequent crown-fire tend to have high rates of serotiny, while areas with infrequent crown-fire have low levels of serotiny.&lt;ref name=Hernandez2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoennagel | first1 = T. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. G. | last3 = Romme | first3 = W. H. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of fire interval and serotiny on postfire lodgepole pine density in Yellowstone National Park | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 2967–2978 | doi=10.1890/02-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, herbivory of lodgepole pines can make fire-mediated serotiny less advantageous in a population. Red squirrels (''[[Red squirrel|Sciurus vulgaris]]'') and red crossbills (''[[Red crossbill|Loxia curvirostra]]'') will eat seeds, and so serotinous cones, which last in the canopy longer, are more likely to be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benkman | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Holimon | first2 = W.C. | last3 = Smith | first3 = J.W. | year = 2001 | title = The influence of a competitor on the geographic mosaic of coevolution between crossbills and lodgepole pine | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 282–294 | doi = 10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[0282:TIOACO]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talluto | first1 = M.

W. | year = 2014 | title = Conflicting selection from fire and seed predation drives fine-scaled phenotypic variation in a widespread North American conifer | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 9543–9548 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400944111 | pmc = 4084486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotiny occurs less frequently in areas where this seed predation is common.

Pyriscence can be understood as an adaptation to an environment in which fires are regular, and in which post-fire environments offer the best germination and seedling survival rates. In Australia, for example, fire-mediated serotiny occurs in areas that are not only prone to regular fires, but also possess [[oligotrophic]] soils and a seasonally dry climate. This results in intense competition for nutrients and moisture, leading to very low seedling survival rates. The passage of fire, however, reduces competition by clearing out undergrowth, and results in an [[ash bed]] that temporarily increases soil nutrition; thus the survival rates of post-fire seedlings is greatly increased. Furthermore, releasing a large number of seeds at once, rather than gradually, increases the possibility that some of those seeds will escape predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradshaw|first=S. Don |author2=Kingsley W. Dixon |author3=Stephen D. Hopper |author4=Hans Lambers |author5=Shane R. Turner |title=Little evidence for fire-adapted plant traits in Mediterranean climate regions|journal=Trends in Plant Science|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=69–76|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.10.007|pmid=21095155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar pressures apply in Northern Hemisphere conifer forests, but in this case there is the further issue of [[allelopathic]] leaf litter, which suppresses seed germination. Fire clears out this litter, eliminating this obstacle to germination.

==Evolution==
Serotinous adaptations occur in at least 530 species in 40 genera, in multiple (paraphyletic) lineages.  Serotiny likely evolved separately in these species, but may in some cases have been lost by the related non-serotinous species.

In the genus ''Pinus'', serotiny likely evolved because of the atmospheric conditions during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="He2012" /&gt; The atmosphere during the Cretaceous had higher oxygen and carbon dioxide levels than our atmosphere. Fire occurred more frequently than it does currently, and plant growth was high enough to create an abundance of flammable material. Many ''Pinus'' species adapted to this fire-prone environment with serotinous pine cones.

A set of conditions must be met in order for long-term seed storage to be evolutionarily viable for a plant:
* The plant must be phylogenetically able (pre-adapted) to develop the necessary reproductive structures
* The seeds must remain viable until cued to release
* Seed release must be cued by a trigger that indicates environmental conditions that are favorable to germination,
* The cue must occur on an average timescale that is within the reproductive lifespan of the plant
* The plant must have the capacity and opportunity to produce enough seeds prior to release to ensure population replacement&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt;
* Serotiny must be heritable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hernández-Serrano|first1=Ana|title=Heritability and quantitative genetic divergence of serotiny, a fire-persistence plant trait|journal=Annals of Botany|date=2014|volume=114|pages=571–577|doi=10.1093/aob/mcu142|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/Hernandez-2014-AnnBot_heritability-serotiny.pdf|pmid=25008363|pmc=4204669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sodium hydroxide''', also known as '''lye''' and '''caustic soda''',&lt;ref name="msd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Material Safety Datasheet|url= http://www.certified-lye.com/MSDS-Lye.pdf|work=certified-lye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msd2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Material Safety Datasheet 2|url=http://www.hillbrothers.com/msds/pdf/sodium-hydroxide-10-50-liq.pdf|work=hillbrothers.com|access-date=2012-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803005424/http://www.hillbrothers.com/msds/pdf/sodium-hydroxide-10-50-liq.pdf|archive-date=2012-08-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula NaOH. It is a white solid [[ionic compound]] consisting of [[sodium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Na|+}} and [[hydroxide]] [[anion]]s {{chem|OH|−}}.

Sodium hydroxide is a highly [[corrosive|caustic]] [[base (chemistry)|base]] and [[alkali]] that decomposes [[protein]]s at ordinary ambient [[temperature]]s and may cause severe [[chemical burn]]s. It is highly soluble in [[water]], and readily absorbs [[moisture]] and [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[air]]. It forms a series of [[hydrate]]s NaOH·''n''{{chem|H|2|O}}.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt; The monohydrate NaOH·{{chem|H|2|O}} crystallizes from water solutions between 12.3 and 61.8&amp;nbsp;°C. The commercially available "sodium hydroxide" is often this monohydrate, and published data may refer to it instead of the [[anhydrous]] compound. As one of the simplest hydroxides, it is frequently utilized alongside neutral [[water]] and acidic [[hydrochloric acid]] to demonstrate the pH scale to chemistry students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.orf.od.nih.gov/EnvironmentalProtection/WasteDisposal/Pages/Examples+of+Common+Laboratory+ChemicalsandtheirHazardClass.aspx | title=Examples of Common Laboratory Chemicals and their Hazard Class}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium hydroxide is used in many industries: in the manufacture of [[wood pulp|pulp]] and [[paper]], [[textile]]s, [[drinking water]], [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s, and as a [[drain cleaner]]. Worldwide production in 2004 was approximately 60&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s, while demand was 51&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

==Properties==

===Physical properties===
Pure sodium hydroxide is a colorless crystalline solid that melts at {{convert|318|C|F}} without decomposition, and with a boiling point of {{convert|1388|C|F}}. It is highly soluble in water, with a lower solubility in polar solvents such as [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.protank.com/sodium-hydroxide|title=Sodium Hydroxide Storage Tanks &amp; Specifications|date=2018-09-08|work=Protank|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; NaOH is insoluble in ether and other non-polar solvents.

Similar to the hydration of sulfuric acid, [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of solid sodium hydroxide in water is a highly [[exothermic reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveryexpresskids.com/blog/exothermic-vs-endothermic-chemistrys-give-and-take|title=Exothermic vs. Endothermic: Chemistry's Give and Take|website=Discovery Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a large amount of heat is liberated, posing a threat to safety through the possibility of splashing. The resulting solution is usually colorless and odorless. As with other alkaline solutions, it feels slippery with skin contact due to the process of [[saponification]] that occurs between NaOH and natural skin oils.

==== Viscosity ====
Sodium hydroxide, NaOH, as a fluid solution, demonstrates a characteristic [[viscosity]], 78 m[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]·s that is much greater than water (1.0 mPa·s) and near that of olive oil (85 mPa·s) at room temperature. The viscosity of NaOH, as with any chemical, is inversely related to its service temperature; meaning viscosity decreases as temperature increases, with the opposite being true also. The viscosity of sodium hydroxide plays a direct role in its application as well as its storage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Hydrates====
Sodium hydroxide can form several hydrates NaOH·''n''{{chem|H|2|O}}, which result in a complex [[solubility diagram]] that was described in detail by [[Spencer Umfreville Pickering|S. U. Pickering]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=pick&gt;Spencer Umfreville Pickering (1893): "LXI.—The hydrates of sodium, potassium, and lithium hydroxides". ''Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions'', volume 63, pages 890-909. {{doi|10.1039/CT8936300890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The known hydrates and the approximate ranges of temperature and concentration (mass percent of NaOH) of their [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] water solutions are:&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;

Giauque (1969): "Entropies of the hydrates of sodium hydroxide. II. Low-temperature heat capacities and heats of fusion of NaOH·2H2O and NaOH·3.5H2O". ''Journal of Physical Chemistry'', volume 73, issue 1, pages 149–157. {{doi|10.1021/j100721a024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monohydrate, NaOH·{{chem|H|2|O}}: from +12.3&amp;nbsp;°C (51%) to 65.10&amp;nbsp;°C (69%) then to 62.63&amp;nbsp;°C (73.1%).&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;&lt;ref name=murch&gt;L. E. Murch, W. F. Giauque (1962): "The thermodynamic properties of sodium hydroxide and its monohydrate. Heat capacities to low temperatures. Heats of solution". ''Journal of Physical Chemistry'', volume 66, issue 10, pages 2052–2059. {{doi|10.1021/j100816a052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reports refer to hydrates with ''n'' = 0.5 or ''n'' = 2/3, but later careful investigations failed to confirm their existence.&lt;ref name=murch/&gt;

The only hydrates with stable melting points are NaOH·{{chem|H|2|O}} (65.10&amp;nbsp;°C) and NaOH·3.5{{chem|H|2|O}} (15.38&amp;nbsp;°C). The other hydrates, except the metastable ones NaOH·3{{chem|H|2|O}} and NaOH·4{{chem|H|2|O}} (β) can be crystallized from solutions of the proper composition, as listed above. However, solutions of NaOH can be easily supercooled by many degrees, which allows the formation of hydrates (including the metastable ones) from solutions with different concentrations.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;&lt;ref name=murch/&gt;

For example, when a solution of NaOH and water with 1:2 mole ratio (52.6% NaOH by mass) is cooled, the monohydrate normally starts to crystallize (at about 22&amp;nbsp;°C) before the dihydrate. However, the solution can easily be supercooled down to -15&amp;nbsp;°C, at which point it may quickly crystallize as the dihydrate. When heated, the solid dihydrate might melt directly into a solution at 13.35&amp;nbsp;°C; however, once the temperature exceeds 12.58&amp;nbsp;°C. it often decomposes into solid monohydrate and a liquid solution. Even the ''n'' = 3.5 hydrate is difficult to crystallize, because the solution supercools so much that other hydrates become more stable.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;

A hot water solution containing 73.1% (mass) of NaOH is an [[eutectic]] that solidifies at about 62.63&amp;nbsp;°C as an intimate mix of anhydrous and monohydrate crystals.&lt;ref name=brodale&gt;G. E. Brodale and W. F. Giauque(1962): "The freezing point-solubility curve of aqueous sodium hydroxide in the region near the anhydrous-monohydrate eutectic". ''Journal of Physical Chemistry'', volume 66, issue 10, pages 2051–2051. {{doi|10.1021/j100816a051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murch/&gt;

A second stable eutectic composition is 45.4% (mass) of NaOH, that solidifies at about 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C into a mixture of crystals of the dihydrate and of the 3.5-hydrate.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;

The third stable eutectic has 18.4% (mass) of NaOH. It solidifies at about −28.7&amp;nbsp;°C as a mixture of water ice and the heptahydrate NaOH·7{{chem|H|2|O}}.&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;&lt;ref name=conde&gt;M. Conde Engineering: "[http://www.aldacs.com/DocBase/AqNaOHSLEVLE.pdf Solid-Liquid Equilibrium (SLE) and Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) of Aqueous NaOH]". Online report, accessed on 2017-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

When solutions with less than 18.4% NaOH are cooled, water [[ice]] crystallizes first, leaving the NaOH in solution.&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;

The α form of the tetrahydrate has density 1.33 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It melts congruously at 7.55&amp;nbsp;°C into a liquid with 35.7% NaOH and density 1.392 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore floats on it like ice on water. However, at about 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C it may instead melt incongruously into a mixture of solid NaOH·3.5{{chem|H|2|O}} and a liquid solution.&lt;ref name=mrawIII/&gt;

The β form of the tetrahydrate is metastable, and often transforms spontaneously to the α form when cooled below −20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=mrawIII/&gt; Once initiated, the exothermic transformation is complete in a few minutes, with a 6.5% increase in volume of the solid. The β form can be crystallized from supercooled solutions at −26&amp;nbsp;°C, and melts partially at −1.83&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=mrawIII/&gt;

The "sodium hydroxide" of commerce is often the monohydrate (density 1.829 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Physical data in technical literature may refer to this form, rather than the anhydrous compound.

====Crystal structure====
The monohydrate crystallizes in the space group Pbca, with cell dimensions a = 1.1825, b = 0.6213, c = 0.6069 [[nanometer|nm]]. The atoms are arranged in a [[hydrargillite]]-like layer structure /O Na O O Na O/... Each sodium atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, three each from hydroxyl anions {{chem|HO|−}} and three from water molecules. The hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyls form strong bonds with oxygen atoms within each O layer. Adjacent O layers are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between water molecules.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;H. Jacobs and U. Metzner (1991): "Ungewöhnliche H-Brückenbindungen in Natriumhydroxidmonohydrat: Röntgen- und Neutronenbeugung an NaOH·H2O bzw. NaOD·D2O". ''Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie'', volume 597, issue 1, pages 97-106. {{doi|10.1002/zaac.19915970113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===

====Reaction with acids====
Sodium hydroxide reacts with protic acids to produce water and the corresponding salts. For example, when sodium hydroxide reacts with [[hydrochloric acid]], [[sodium chloride]] is formed:

:[[NaOH]]([[Aqueous|aq]]) + [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]](aq) → [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]](aq) + [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]([[Liquid|l]])

In general, such [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] reactions are represented by one simple net ionic equation:

:[[Hydroxide|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]](aq) + [[Proton|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]](aq) → [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]](l)

This type of reaction with a strong acid releases heat, and hence is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]]. Such [[acid-base reaction]]s can also be used for [[titration]]s. However, sodium hydroxide is not used as a [[primary standard]] because it is [[hygroscopic]] and absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from air.

====Reaction with acidic oxides====
Sodium hydroxide also reacts with [[acid anhydride|acidic oxides]], such as [[sulfur dioxide]]. Such reactions are often used to "[[Scrubber|scrub]]" harmful acidic gases (like SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) produced in the burning of coal and thus prevent their release into the atmosphere. For example,

:2 NaOH + [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Sodium sulfite|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

====Reaction with amphoteric metals and oxides====
Glass reacts slowly with aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions at ambient temperatures to form soluble [[silicate]]s. Because of this, glass joints and [[stopcock]]s exposed to sodium hydroxide have a tendency to "freeze". [[Laboratory flask|Flask]]s and glass-lined [[chemical reactor]]s are damaged by long exposure to hot sodium hydroxide, which also frosts the glass. Sodium hydroxide does not attack [[iron]] at room temperatures, since iron does not have [[amphoteric]] properties (i.e., it only dissolves in acid, not base). 
Nevertheless at high temperatures (e.g. above 500°C), iron can react [[endothermic]]ally with sodium hydroxide to form [[iron(III) oxide]], [[sodium]] metal, and [[hydrogen]] gas&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last = 祖恩
| first = 许 
| title = 钾素,钾肥溯源[J]
| date = 1992
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is due to the lower [[enthalpy of formation]] of iron(III) oxide (-824.2kJ/mol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide | title=Iron(III) oxide}}&lt;/ref&gt;) compared to sodium hydroxide (-427kJ/mol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide | title=Sodium hydroxide}}&lt;/ref&gt;), thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable, although its endothermic nature indicates non-spontaneity. Consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings:

: 4 Fe + 6 NaOH → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 Na + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

A few [[transition metal]]s, however, may react vigorously with sodium hydroxide.

In 1986, an aluminium [[tank truck|road tanker]] in the UK was mistakenly used to transport 25% sodium hydroxide solution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| first = Jim
| title = EXCEL HSC Chemistry
| pages = 199
| publisher = Pascal Press
| date = 2001
| isbn = 978-1-74125-299-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing pressurization of the contents and damage to the tanker. The pressurization was due to the hydrogen gas which is produced in the reaction between sodium hydroxide and aluminium:

: 2 Al + 2 NaOH + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Precipitant====
Unlike sodium hydroxide, the hydroxides of most transition metals are insoluble, and therefore sodium hydroxide can be used to [[precipitate]] transition metal hydroxides. The following colours are observed: blue-copper, green-iron(II), yellow/brown-iron(III). Zinc and lead salts dissolve in excess sodium hydroxide to give a clear solution of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Aluminium hydroxide]] is used as a gelatinous [[Flocculation#Flocculants|flocculant]] to filter out particulate matter in [[water treatment]]. Aluminium hydroxide is prepared at the treatment plant from [[aluminium sulfate]] by reacting it with sodium hydroxide or bicarbonate.

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NaOH → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Saponification====
Sodium hydroxide can be used for the base-driven [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s (as in [[saponification]]), [[amide]]s and [[alkyl halide]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the limited solubility of sodium hydroxide in organic solvents means that the more [[soluble]] [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) is often preferred. Touching sodium hydroxide solution with the bare hands, while not recommended, produces a slippery feeling. This happens because oils on the skin such as [[sebum]] are converted to soap.
Despite solubility in propylene glycol it is unlikely to replace water in saponificaction due to propylene glycol primary reaction with fat before reaction between sodium hydroxide and fat.

==Production==
Sodium hydroxide is industrially produced as a 50% solution by variations of the electrolytic [[chloralkali process]].&lt;ref name = Du&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.est.8b01195 | pmid = 29669210 | title = Sodium hydroxide production from seawater desalination brine: process design and energy efficiency | author = Fengmin Du, David M Warsinger, Tamanna I Urmi, Gregory P Thiel, Amit Kumar, John H Lienhard | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 52 | issue = 10 | pages = 5949–5958 | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chlorine gas]] is also produced in this process.&lt;ref name = Du/&gt; Solid sodium hydroxide is obtained from this solution by the evaporation of water. Solid sodium hydroxide is most commonly sold as flakes, [[prill]]s, and cast blocks.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

In 2004, world production was estimated at 60 million dry metric tonnes of sodium hydroxide, and demand was estimated at 51 million tonnes.&lt;ref name = Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_345.pub2 | title = Sodium Hydroxide | author = Cetin Kurt, Jürgen Bittner | }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, total world production was around 45&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s. North America and Asia each contributed around 14&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, while Europe produced around 10&amp;nbsp;million tonnes. In the United States, the major producer of sodium hydroxide is the [[Dow Chemical Company]], which has annual production around 3.7&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s from sites at [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]], Texas, and [[Plaquemine, Louisiana|Plaquemine]], Louisiana. Other major US producers include [[Oxychem]], [[PPG Industries|PPG]], [[Olin Corporation|Olin]], Pioneer Companies, Inc. (PIONA, which was purchased by Olin), and [[Formosa Plastics Group|Formosa]]. All of these companies use the [[chloralkali process]].&lt;ref name="Kirk"&gt;[http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/kirk/kirk_articles_fs.html ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''], 5th edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, sodium hydroxide was produced by treating [[sodium carbonate]] with [[calcium hydroxide]] in a [[metathesis reaction]]. (Sodium hydroxide is soluble while calcium carbonate is not.) This process was called causticizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Deming|first1=Horace G. |title=General Chemistry: An Elementary Survey Emphasizing Industrial Applications of Fundamental Principles |edition=2nd  |year=1925 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |location=New York  |page=452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ↓ + 2 NaOH(aq)

This process was superseded by the [[Solvay process]] in the late 19th century, which was in turn supplanted by the [[chloralkali process]] which we use today.

Sodium hydroxide is also produced by combining pure sodium metal with water. The byproducts are hydrogen gas and heat, often resulting in a flame, making this a common demonstration of the reactivity of alkali metals in academic environments; however, it is not commercially viable, as the isolation of sodium metal is typically performed by reduction or electrolysis of sodium compounds including sodium hydroxide.

:''For further information in historical production, see [[alkali manufacture]].''

==Uses==
[[File:Lye.jpg|thumb|Canister of sodium hydroxide.]]
Sodium hydroxide is a popular strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] used in industry. Around 56% of sodium hydroxide produced is used by industry, 25% of which is used in the paper industry. Sodium hydroxide is also used in the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, pH regulation, and organic synthesis. It is used in the [[Bayer process]] of [[aluminium]] production.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt; In bulk, it is most often handled as an [[aqueous]] [[solution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ppg.com/chemicals/chloralkali/products/Documents/CausticSodamanual2008.pdf |title=Document 2 - CausticSodamanual2008.pdf|year=2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since solutions are cheaper and easier to handle.

Sodium hydroxide is used in many scenarios where it is desirable to increase the [[alkalinity]] of a mixture, or to neutralize acids.

For example, in the petroleum industry, sodium hydroxide is used as an additive in [[drilling mud]] to increase [[alkalinity]] in [[bentonite]] mud systems, to increase the mud [[viscosity]], and to neutralize any [[acid gas]] (such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) which may be encountered in the [[geological formation]] as drilling progresses.

Poor quality [[crude oil]] can be treated with sodium hydroxide to remove [[sulfur]]ous impurities in a process known as ''caustic washing''. As above, sodium hydroxide reacts with weak acids such as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans to yield non-volatile sodium salts, which can be removed. The waste which is formed is toxic and difficult to deal with, and the process is banned in many countries because of this. In 2006, [[Trafigura]] used the process and then [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump|dumped the waste in Africa]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/16/trafigura-case-toxic-slop|title=Trafigura case: toxic slop left behind by caustic washing|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=16 September 2009 |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8259765.stm|title=Trafigura knew of waste dangers|date=16 September 2009|publisher=BBC Newsnight|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{see also|Hydrodesulfurization}}

===Chemical pulping===
{{main article|Pulp (paper)}}
Sodium hydroxide is also widely used in pulping of wood for making paper or regenerated fibers. Along with [[sodium sulfide]], sodium hydroxide is a key component of the white liquor solution used to separate [[lignin]] from [[cellulose]] [[fiber]]s in the [[kraft process]]. It also plays a key role in several later stages of the process of [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching the brown pulp]] resulting from the pulping process. These stages include [[oxygen]] delignification, [[oxidation|oxidative]] extraction, and simple extraction, all of which require a strong alkaline environment with a pH &gt; 10.5 at the end of the stages.

===Tissue digestion===
In a similar fashion, sodium hydroxide is used to digest tissues, as in a process that was used with farm animals at one time. This process involved placing a carcass into a sealed chamber, then adding a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water (which breaks the chemical bonds that keep the flesh intact). This eventually turns the body into a liquid with coffee-like appearance,&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;Ayres, Chris (27 February 2010) [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2002276.ece Clean green finish that sends a loved one down the drain] Times Online.

''Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers'', New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32482-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing [[roadkill]] dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors.&lt;ref name="carcassdisposal"/&gt; Due to its low cost and availability, it has been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian [[serial killer]] [[Leonarda Cianciulli]] used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27257822 |title= Sodium: Getting rid of dirt – and murder victims |date= 3 May 2014 |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted disposing of over 300 bodies with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/26/AR2009012602190.html | author = William Booth | title = 'Stewmaker' Stirs Horror in Mexico | publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]'' | date = January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical due to its ability to hydrolyze protein. If a dilute solution is spilled on the skin, burns may result if the area is not washed thoroughly and for several minutes with running water. Splashes in the eye can be more serious and can lead to blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MMG/MMG.asp?id=246&amp;tid=45|title=ATSDR - Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Sodium Hydroxide|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolving amphoteric metals and compounds===
Strong bases attack [[aluminium]]. Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium and water to release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium aluminate]]. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction can be useful in etching, removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] such as [[anodizing]] or [[alodining]] the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.

In the [[Bayer process]], sodium hydroxide is used in the refining of [[alumina]] containing ores ([[bauxite]]) to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) which is the raw material used to produce [[aluminium]] metal via the [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] [[Hall-Héroult process]]. Since the alumina is [[amphoteric]], it dissolves in the sodium hydroxide, leaving impurities less soluble at high pH such as [[iron oxides]] behind in the form of a highly alkaline [[red mud]]. {{see also | Ajka alumina plant accident}}

Other amphoteric metals are zinc and lead which dissolve in concentrated sodium hydroxide solutions to give [[sodium zincate]] and sodium plumbate respectively.

===Esterification and transesterification reagent===
Sodium hydroxide is traditionally used in soap making ([[cold process]] soap, [[saponification]]).&lt;ref name="Morfit"&gt;{{cite book|title =A treatise on chemistry applied to the manufacture of soap and candles|first= Campbell|last=Morfit|authorlink=Campbell Morfit|publisher=Parry and McMillan|year = 1856|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XVBDAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made in the nineteenth century for a hard surface rather than liquid product because it was easier to store and transport.

For the manufacture of [[biodiesel]], sodium hydroxide is used as a [[catalyst]] for the [[transesterification]] of methanol and triglycerides. This only works with [[anhydrous]] sodium hydroxide, because combined with water the fat would turn into [[soap]], which would be tainted with [[methanol]]. NaOH is used more often than [[potassium hydroxide]] because it is cheaper and a smaller quantity is needed.

===Food preparation===
Food uses of sodium hydroxide include washing or chemical peeling of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], [[chocolate]] and [[Cocoa mass|cocoa]] processing, [[caramel coloring]] production, [[poultry]] scalding, [[soft drink]] processing, and thickening [[ice cream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/CIIEcompounds/transcripts/NaOH.asp |title=Sodium Hydroxide |work=rsc.org | year=2014 |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olive]]s are often soaked in sodium hydroxide for softening; [[Pretzel]]s and German [[lye roll]]s are glazed with a sodium hydroxide solution before baking to make them crisp. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining food grade sodium hydroxide in small quantities for home use, [[sodium carbonate]] is often used in place of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref name="Hominy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/uga/hominy_without_lye.html| title=Hominy without Lye| publisher=National Center for Home Food Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific foods processed with sodium hydroxide include:

*German [[pretzel]]s are poached in a boiling [[sodium carbonate]] solution or cold sodium hydroxide solution before baking, which contributes to their unique crust.
*Lye-water is an essential ingredient in the crust of the traditional baked Chinese moon cakes.
*Most yellow coloured [[Chinese noodles]] are made with [[lye]]-water but are commonly mistaken for containing egg.
*Sodium hydroxide is also the chemical that causes gelling of egg whites in the production of [[Century egg]]s.
*Some methods of preparing olives involve subjecting them to a lye-based brine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ucanr.org/freepubs/docs/8267.pdf |title=Olives: Safe Methods for Home Pickling (application/pdf Object) |work=ucanr.org |year=2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Filipino dessert (''kakanin'') called ''[[kutsinta]]'' uses a small quantity of lye water to help give the rice flour batter a jelly like consistency. A similar process is also used in the kakanin known as ''[[pitsi-pitsi]]'' or ''pichi-pichi'' except that the mixture uses grated [[cassava]] instead of rice flour.
*The [[Norway|Norwegian]] dish known as [[lutefisk]] (from ''lutfisk'', "lye fish").
*[[Bagel|Bagels]] are often boiled in a lye solution before baking, contributing to their shiny crust. 
*[[Hominy]] is dried [[maize]] (corn) kernels reconstituted by soaking in [[lye]]-water. These expand considerably in size and may be further processed by frying to make [[corn nuts]] or by drying and grinding to make [[grits]]. Hominy is used to create [[Masa]], a popular flour used in Mexican cuisine to make [[Corn tortillas]] and [[tamales]]. [[Nixtamal]] is similar, but uses [[calcium hydroxide]] instead of sodium hydroxide.

===Cleaning agent===
{{Main article|Cleaning agent}}
Sodium hydroxide is frequently used as an industrial [[cleaning agent]] where it is often called "caustic". It is added to water, heated, and then used to clean process equipment, storage tanks, etc. It can dissolve [[grease (lubricant)|grease]], [[oils]], [[fat]]s and [[protein]]-based deposits. It is also used for cleaning waste discharge pipes under sinks and drains in domestic properties. [[Surfactants]] can be added to the sodium hydroxide solution in order to stabilize dissolved substances and thus prevent redeposition. A sodium hydroxide soak solution is used as a powerful degreaser on [[stainless steel]] and glass bakeware. It is also a common ingredient in oven cleaners.

A common use of sodium hydroxide is in the production of [[parts washer]] [[detergent]]s. Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide are some of the most aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} when [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]] was outlawed by the [[Montreal Protocol]]. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.

[[File:NaOH - drain-cleaner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hardware store]]s grade sodium hydroxide to be used as a type of [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|drain cleaner]].]]
[[File:Paint stripping with caustic soda.jpg|thumb|upright|Paint stripping with caustic soda]]
Sodium hydroxide is used in the home as a type of [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|drain opener]] to unblock clogged drains, usually in the form of a dry crystal or as a thick liquid gel. The alkali dissolves [[fat|greases]] to produce [[water soluble]] [[product (chemistry)|products]]. It also [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] the [[proteins]] such as those found in [[hair]] which may block water pipes. These reactions are sped by the [[exothermic|heat generated]] when sodium hydroxide and the other chemical components of the cleaner dissolve in water. Such [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|alkaline drain cleaners]] and their [[drain cleaner#Acidic drain openers|acidic versions]] are highly [[corrosive]] and should be handled with great caution.

Sodium hydroxide is used in some [[relaxer]]s to [[straighten hair]]. However, because of the high incidence and intensity of chemical burns, manufacturers of chemical relaxers use other alkaline chemicals in preparations available to average consumers. Sodium hydroxide relaxers are still available, but they are used mostly by professionals.

A solution of sodium hydroxide in water was traditionally used as the most common paint stripper on wooden objects. Its use has become less common, because it can damage the wood surface, raising the grain and staining the colour.

===Water treatment===
Sodium hydroxide is sometimes used during [[water purification]] to raise the pH of water supplies. Increased pH makes the water less corrosive to plumbing and reduces the amount of lead, copper and other toxic metals that can dissolve into drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.extension.org/pages/32302/drinking-water-treatment-ph-adjustment |title=Drinking Water Treatment - pH Adjustment|year=2011 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.water-research.net/index.php/drinking-water-issues-corrosive-water-lead-copper-aluminum-zinc-and-more|author=Brian Oram, PG|title=Drinking Water Issues Corrosive Water (Lead, Copper, Aluminum, Zinc and More)|year=2014|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical uses===
Sodium hydroxide has been used for detection of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], with blood samples of such patients turning to a [[vermilion]] color upon the addition of a few drops of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2df7-uOC8ZwC&amp;pg=PA168 Page 168] in: ''The Detection of poisons and strong drugs''.
Author: Wilhelm Autenrieth.
Publisher: P. Blakiston's son &amp; Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, carbon monoxide poisoning can be detected by [[CO oximetry]].

=== In cement mixes, mortars, concrete, grouts ===
Sodium hydroxide is used in some cement mix plasticisers. This helps homogenise cement mixes, preventing segregation of sands and cement, decreases the amount of water required in a mix and increases workability of the cement product, be it mortar, render or concrete.

=== Experimental ===
====Flavonoids====
See: [[Sodium hydroxide test]] for flavonoids

====Summer-winter heat storage====
[[EMPA]] researchers are experimenting with concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the thermal storage or seasonal reservoir medium for domestic [[HVAC|space-heating]].  If water is added to solid or concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat is released. The dilution is [[Exothermic process|exothermic]] - chemical energy is released in the form of heat. Conversely, by applying heat energy into a dilute sodium hydroxide solution the water will evaporate so that the solution becomes more concentrated and thus stores the supplied heat as [[Endothermic process|latent chemical energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/naoh-heat-storage|title=Empa - 604 - Communication - NaOH-heat-storage|website=www.empa.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:Sodium hydroxide burn.png|thumb|right|[[Chemical burn]]s caused by sodium hydroxide solution photographed 44 hours after exposure.]]

Like other [[corrosive]] [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose [[proteins]] and [[lipids]] in [[Tissue (biology)|living tissues]] via [[Hydrolysis#Esters and amides|amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis]], which consequently cause [[chemical burn]]s and may induce permanent [[blindness]] upon contact with eyes.&lt;ref name="msd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msd2"/&gt; Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature if there is water, such as water vapor. Thus, [[protective equipment]], like [[rubber gloves]], [[safety clothing]] and [[eye protection]], should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.

[[Button cell#Health issues|Lithium battery cells]], if ingested, cause serious injuries, even if not crushed. The damage is caused, not by the contents of the battery, but by the electric current it creates, which causes sodium hydroxide  to build up and burn through the [[oesophagus]] and into major [[blood vessel]]s, which can cause fatal bleeding.

Moreover, [[solvation|dissolution]] of sodium hydroxide is highly [[exothermic]], and the resulting heat may cause heat burns or ignite flammables. It also produces heat when reacted with acids.
 
Sodium hydroxide is also mildly corrosive to [[glass]], which can cause damage to [[glazing (window)|glazing]] or cause [[ground glass joint]]s to bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium_hydroxide|title=SODIUM HYDROXIDE {{!}} NaOH - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to several metals, like [[aluminium]] which reacts with the alkali to produce flammable [[hydrogen]] gas on contact:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf |title=aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf (application/pdf Object) |work=www1.eere.energy.gov |year=2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914043825/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage ==
Careful storage is needed when handling sodium hydroxide for use, especially bulk volumes. Following proper NaOH storage guidelines and maintaining worker/environment safety is always recommended given the chemical's burn hazard. Sodium hydroxide is often stored in bottles--as in laboratories, small-scale use--within [[Intermediate bulk container|intermediate bulk containers]]--medium volume containers for cargo handling and transport--or within large stationary storage tanks with volumes up to 100,000 gallons--as in manufacturing or waste water plants with extensive NaOH use. Common materials that are compatible with sodium hydroxide and often utilized for NaOH storage include: polyethylene ([[HDPE]], usual, [[Cross-linked polyethylene|XLPE]], less common), [[carbon steel]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[stainless steel]], and [[fiberglass reinforced plastic]] (FRP, with a resistant liner).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

Sodium hydroxide was first prepared by soap makers.&lt;ref name=thorpe&gt;Thorpe, Thomas Edward, ed., ''A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry'' (London, England:  Longmans, Green, and Co., 1913), vol. 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tI5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p45}}  A procedure for making sodium hydroxide appeared as part of a recipe for making soap in an Arab book of the late 13th century:  ''Al-mukhtara` fi funun min al-suna`'' (Inventions from the Various Industrial Arts), which was compiled by al-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn `Umar ibn `Ali ibn Rasul (d. 1295), a king of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;See:  [http://www.history-science-technology.com/notes/notes5.html History of Science and Technology in Islam:  Description of Soap Making]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The English chemist and archaeologist Henry Ernest Stapleton (1878–1962) presented evidence that the Persian alchemist and physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (854–925) knew about sodium hydroxide.  See:  Henry Ernest Stapleton; R. F. Azo; M. Hid'yat Ḥusain (1927) "Chemistry in 'Iraq and Persia in the Tenth Century A.D.," ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', '''8''' (6) :  317–418 ; see p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipe called for passing water repeatedly through a mixture of ''[[alkali]]'' (Arabic:  ''al-qily'', where ''qily'' is ash from [[Glasswort|saltwort]] plants, which are rich in sodium ; hence ''alkali'' was impure [[sodium carbonate]])&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton, H. E. and Azo, R. F. (1905) "Alchemical equipment in the eleventh century, A.D.," ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', '''1''' :  47–71 ; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nbobAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false see footnote 5 on p. 53.]  From p. 53:  "5. Sodium carbonate.  Qily is the ashes of certain plants, e.g. Salsola and Salicornia … , which grow near the sea, or in salty places … "&lt;/ref&gt; and quicklime ([[calcium oxide]], CaO), whereby a solution of sodium hydroxide was obtained.  European soap makers also followed this recipe.  When in 1791 the French chemist and surgeon [[Nicolas Leblanc]] (1742–1806) patented a [[Leblanc process|process for mass-producing sodium carbonate]], natural "soda ash" (impure sodium carbonate that was obtained from the ashes of plants that are rich in sodium)&lt;ref name=thorpe/&gt;{{rp|p36}} was replaced by this artificial version.&lt;ref name=thorpe/&gt;{{rp|p46}}  However, by the 20th century, the [[Chloralkali process|electrolysis of sodium chloride]] had become the primary method for producing sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. O’Brien, Tilak V. Bommaraju, Fumio Hine, ''Handbook of Chlor-Alkali Technology'', vol. 1 (Berlin, Germany:  Springer Verlag, 2005), Chapter 2:  History of the Chlor-Alkali Industry, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural health monitoring''' ('''SHM''') refers to the process of implementing a damage detection and characterization strategy for [[engineering structure]]s. Here damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of a structural system, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance.  The SHM process involves the observation of a system over time using periodically sampled dynamic response measurements from an array of sensors, the extraction of damage-sensitive features from these measurements, and the statistical analysis of these features to determine the current state of system health.  For long term SHM, the output of this process is periodically updated information regarding the ability of the structure to perform its intended function in light of the inevitable aging and degradation resulting from operational environments.  After extreme events, such as earthquakes or blast loading, SHM is used for rapid condition screening and aims to provide, in near real time, reliable information regarding the integrity of the structure.&lt;ref name="Dawson 1976 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Brian|authorlink=|year=1976|title=Vibration condition monitoring techniques for rotating machinery|journal=The Shock and Vibration Digest|volume=8|issue=12|pages=3|publisher=SpringerLink|location=London|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1177/058310247600801203|bibcode=|oclc=|id=|url=|language=|format=|accessdate=|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure inspection plays a key role in public safety in regards to both long-term damage accumulation and post extreme event scenarios. As part of the rapid developments in data-driven technologies that are transforming many fields in engineering and science, machine learning and computer vision techniques are increasingly capable of reliably diagnosing and classifying patterns in image data, which has clear applications in inspection contexts. &lt;ref name="Davoudi 2018"&gt; {{cite journal |last1=Davoudi|first1=Rouzbeh |last2=Miller |first2=Greg |last3=Kutz |first3=Nathan |title=Data-driven vision-based inspection for reinforced concrete beams and slabs: Quantitative damage and load estimation |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2018.09.024 |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=96 |pages= 292-309|doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2018.09.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Introduction==
Qualitative and non-continuous methods have long been used to evaluate structures for their capacity to serve their intended purpose. Since the beginning of the 19th century, railroad [[Wheeltapper|wheel-tappers]] have used the sound of a hammer striking the train wheel to evaluate if damage was present.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; In rotating machinery, vibration monitoring has been used for decades as a performance evaluation technique.&lt;ref name="Dawson 1976 3"/&gt; Two techniques in the field of SHM are wave propagation based techniques Raghavan and Cesnik&lt;ref&gt;Raghavan, A. and Cesnik, C.

In the last ten to fifteen years, SHM technologies have emerged creating an exciting new field within various branches of engineering. [[Academic conference]]s and [[scientific journal]]s have been established during this time that specifically focus on SHM.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/g7316t0j42957h0u/fulltext.pdf Farrar, et al., page 306]&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are currently becoming increasingly common.

==Statistical pattern recognition ==
The SHM problem can be addressed in the context of a statistical pattern recognition paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm can be broken down into four parts: (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Data Acquisition and Cleansing, (3) Feature Extraction and Data Compression, and (4) Statistical Model Development for Feature Discrimination.  When one attempts to apply this paradigm to data from real world structures, it quickly becomes apparent that the ability to cleanse, compress, normalize and fuse data to account for operational and environmental variability is a key implementation issue when addressing Parts 2-4 of this paradigm.  These processes can be implemented through hardware or software and, in general, some combination of these two approaches will be used.

== Health assessment of engineered structures of bridges, buildings and other related infrastructures ==
Commonly known as Structural Health Assessment (SHA) or SHM, this concept is widely applied to various forms of infrastructures, especially as countries all over the world enter into an even greater period of construction of various infrastructures ranging from bridges to skyscrapers. Especially so when damages to structures are concerned, it is important to note that there are stages of increasing difficulty that require the knowledge of previous stages, namely:

# Detecting the existence of the damage on the structure
# Locating the damage
# Identifying the types of damage
# Quantifying the severity of the damage

It is necessary to employ signal processing and statistical classification to convert sensor data on the infrastructural health status into damage info for assessment.

=== Operational evaluation ===

Operational evaluation attempts to answer four questions regarding the implementation of a damage identification capability:

:  i)   What are the life-safety and/or economic justification for performing the SHM?

:  ii)  How is damage defined for the system being investigated and, for multiple damage possibilities, which cases are of the most concern?

:  iii) What are the conditions, both operational and environmental, under which the system to be monitored functions?

:  iv) What are the limitations on acquiring data in the operational environment?

Operational evaluation begins to set the limitations on what will be monitored and how the monitoring will be accomplished.  This evaluation starts to tailor the damage identification process to features that are unique to the system being monitored and tries to take advantage of unique features of the damage that is to be detected.

=== Data acquisition, normalization and cleansing ===

The data acquisition portion of the SHM process involves selecting the excitation methods, the sensor types, number and locations, and the data acquisition/storage/transmittal hardware.  Again, this process will be application specific.  Economic considerations will play a major role in making these decisions. The intervals at which data should be collected is another consideration that must be addressed.

Because data can be measured under varying conditions, the ability to normalize the data becomes very important to the damage identification process.  As it applies to SHM, data normalization is the process of separating changes in sensor reading caused by damage from those caused by varying operational and environmental conditions.  One of the most common procedures is to normalize the measured responses by the measured inputs.  When environmental or operational variability is an issue, the need can arise to normalize the data in some temporal fashion to facilitate the comparison of data measured at similar times of an environmental or operational cycle.  Sources of variability in the data acquisition process and with the system being monitored need to be identified and minimized to the extent possible. In general, not all sources of variability can be eliminated.  Therefore, it is necessary to make the appropriate measurements such that these sources can be statistically quantified.  Variability can arise from changing environmental and test conditions, changes in the data reduction process, and unit-to-unit inconsistencies.

Data cleansing is the process of selectively choosing data to pass on to or reject from the feature selection process.  The data cleansing process is usually based on knowledge gained by individuals directly involved with the data acquisition.  As an example, an inspection of the test setup may reveal that a sensor was loosely mounted and, hence, based on the judgment of the individuals performing the measurement, this set of data or the data from that particular sensor may be selectively deleted from the feature selection process.  Signal processing techniques such as filtering and re-sampling can also be thought of as data cleansing procedures.

Finally, the data acquisition, normalization, and cleansing portion of SHM process should not be static.  Insight gained from the feature selection process and the statistical model development process will provide information regarding changes that can improve the data acquisition process.

=== Feature extraction and data compression ===

The area of the SHM process that receives the most attention in the technical literature is the identification of data features that allows one to distinguish between the undamaged and damaged structure. Inherent in this feature selection process is the condensation of the data.  The best features for damage identification are, again, application specific.

One of the most common feature extraction methods is based on correlating measured system response quantities, such a vibration amplitude or frequency, with the first-hand observations of the degrading system.  Another method of developing features for damage identification is to apply engineered flaws, similar to ones expected in actual operating conditions, to systems and develop an initial understanding of the parameters that are sensitive to the expected damage.  The flawed system can also be used to validate that the diagnostic measurements are sensitive enough to distinguish between features identified from the undamaged and damaged system.  The use of analytical tools such as experimentally-validated finite element models can be a great asset in this process.  In many cases the analytical tools are used to perform numerical experiments where the flaws are introduced through computer simulation.  Damage accumulation testing, during which significant structural components of the system under study are degraded by subjecting them to realistic loading conditions, can also be used to identify appropriate features.  This process may involve induced-damage testing, fatigue testing, corrosion growth, or temperature cycling to accumulate certain types of damage in an accelerated fashion. Insight into the appropriate features can be gained from several types of analytical and experimental studies as described above and is usually the result of information obtained from some combination of these studies.

The operational implementation and diagnostic measurement technologies needed to perform SHM produce more data than traditional uses of structural dynamics information.  A condensation of the data is advantageous and necessary when comparisons of many feature sets obtained over the lifetime of the structure are envisioned.  Also, because data will be acquired from a structure over an extended period of time and in an operational environment, robust data reduction techniques must be developed to retain feature sensitivity to the structural changes of interest in the presence of environmental and operational variability. To further aid in the extraction and recording of quality data needed to perform SHM, the statistical significance of the features should be characterized and used in the condensation process.

=== Statistical model development ===

The portion of the SHM process that has received the least attention in the technical literature is the development of statistical models for discrimination between features from the undamaged and damaged structures. Statistical model development is concerned with the implementation of the algorithms that operate on the extracted features to quantify the damage state of the structure. The algorithms used in statistical model development usually fall into three categories.  When data are available from both the undamaged and damaged structure, the statistical pattern recognition algorithms fall into the general classification referred to as supervised learning.  Group classification and regression analysis are categories of supervised learning algorithms.  Unsupervised learning refers to algorithms that are applied to data not containing examples from the damaged structure.  Outlier or novelty detection is the primary class of algorithms applied in unsupervised learning applications.  All of the algorithms analyze statistical distributions of the measured or derived features to enhance the damage identification process.

== Fundamental axioms ==

Based on the extensive literature that has developed on SHM over the last 20 years, it can be argued that this field has matured to the point where several fundamental axioms, or general principles, have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Worden|first=Keith |authorlink= |author2=Charles R. Farrar |author3=Graeme Manson |author4=Gyuhae Park|year=2007|title=The Fundamental Axioms of Structural Health Monitoring|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | volume=463|issue=2082|pages=1639–1664|publisher=|location=|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1098/rspa.2007.1834|bibcode=2007RSPSA.463.1639W|oclc=|id=|url=|language=|format=|accessdate=|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The axioms are listed as follows:

* Axiom I: All materials have inherent flaws or defects;
* Axiom II: The assessment of damage requires a comparison between two system states;
* Axiom III: Identifying the existence and location of damage can be done in an unsupervised learning mode, but identifying the type of damage present and the damage severity can generally only be done in a supervised learning mode;
* Axiom IVa: Sensors cannot measure damage. Feature extraction through signal processing and statistical classification is necessary to convert sensor data into damage information;
* Axiom IVb: Without intelligent feature extraction, the more sensitive a measurement is to damage, the more sensitive it is to changing operational and environmental conditions;
* Axiom V: The length- and time-scales associated with damage initiation and evolution dictate the required properties of the SHM sensing system;
* Axiom VI: There is a trade-off between the sensitivity to damage of an algorithm and its noise rejection capability;
* Axiom VII: The size of damage that can be detected from changes in system dynamics is inversely proportional to the frequency range of excitation.

==Components==

SHM System's elements include:
* [[Structure]]
* [[Sensor]]s
* [[Data acquisition]] systems
* Data transfer and storage mechanism
* [[Data management]]
* Data interpretation and diagnosis:
# System Identification
# Structural model update
# Structural condition assessment
# Prediction of remaining [[service life]]

An example of this technology is embedding [[sensor]]s in structures like [[bridge]]s and [[aircraft]]. These sensors provide real time monitoring of various structural changes like [[stress (physics)|stress]] and [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. In the case of civil engineering structures, the data provided by the sensors is usually transmitted to a remote data acquisition centres. With the aid of modern technology, real time control of structures (Active Structural Control) based on the information of sensors is possible

==Examples==

=== Bridges in Hong Kong ===
The '''Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System''' (WASHMS) is a sophisticated bridge monitoring system,  costing US$1.3 million, used by the Hong Kong Highways Department to ensure road user comfort and safety of the [[Tsing Ma Bridge|Tsing Ma]], [[Ting Kau Bridge|Ting Kau]],  [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge|Kap Shui Mun]] and [[Stonecutters Bridge|Stonecutters]] bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuous Stress Monitoring|url=http://www.invicom.com/applications/continuous-stress-monitoring.html|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to oversee the integrity, durability and reliability of the bridges, WASHMS has four different levels of operation: [[sensory system]]s, [[data acquisition system]]s, local centralised computer systems and global central computer system.

The sensory system consists of approximately 900 sensors and their relevant interfacing units. With more than 350 [[sensors]] on the Tsing Ma bridge, 350 on Ting Kau and 200 on Kap Shui Mun, the structural behaviour of the bridges is measured 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The sensors include [[accelerometer]]s, [[strain gauge]]s, displacement transducers, level sensing stations, [[anemometer]]s, temperature sensors and dynamic weight-in-motion sensors. They measure everything from [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] temperature and strains in structural members to wind speed and the [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]] and [[rotation]] of the kilometres of [[wire rope|cable]]s and any movement of the bridge decks and towers.

These sensors are the early warning system for the bridges, providing the essential information that help the Highways Department to accurately monitor the general health conditions of the bridges.

The structures have been built to withstand up to a one-minute mean wind speed of 95 metres per second. In 1997, when Hong Kong had a direct hit from Typhoon Victor, wind speeds of 110 to 120 kilometres per hour were recorded. However, the highest wind speed on record occurred during [[1962 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Wanda|Typhoon Wanda]] in 1962 when a 3-second gust wind speed was recorded at 78.8 metres per second, 284 kilometres per hour.

The information from these hundreds of different sensors is transmitted to the [[data acquisition]] outstation units. There are three data acquisition outstation units on Tsing Ma bridge, three on Ting Kau and two on the Kap Shui Mun.

The computing powerhouse for these systems is in the administrative building used by the Highways Department in [[Tsing Yi]]. The local central computer system provides data collection control, [[Finite element model data post-processing|post-processing]], transmission and storage. The global system is used for data acquisition and analysis, assessing the physical conditions and structural functions of the bridges and for integration and manipulation of the data acquisition, analysis and assessing processes.

Asset managers will have access to data for all sensors from a web-based data management interface, including automated data analysis.

==For bridges==
Health monitoring of large bridges can be performed by simultaneous measurement of loads on the bridge and effects of these loads. It typically includes monitoring of:
* Wind and weather
* Traffic
* Prestressing and stay cables
* Deck
* Pylons
* Ground

Provided with this knowledge, the engineer can:
* Estimate the loads and their effects
* Estimate the state of fatigue or other limit state
* Forecast the probable evolution of the bridge's health

The state of Oregon in the United States, Department of Transportation Bridge Engineering Department has developed and implemented a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) program as referenced in this technical paper by Steven Lovejoy, Senior Engineer.&lt;ref name="SHM Structural Health Monitoring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Loveyjoy|first=Steven|title=Applications of Structural Health Monitoring to Highway|url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/BRIDGE/docs/SHM_SCL_submission.pdf|work=APPLICATIONS OF STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING TO HIGHWAY|publisher=State of Oregon|accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9028">''Die Sechzehn Grundsätze des Städtebaus'', or ''The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design'', were from 1950 until 1955 the primary model for urban planning in the [[GDR]].

==Text==
''Decided by the Government of the German Democratic Republic on 27 July 1950:

''The urban planning and architectural design of our cities, which shall influence the construction of all of Germany, must express the social order of the German Democratic Republic, as well as the progressive traditions and great goals of our German people. They shall adhere to the following principles:

#''The city as a form of settlement did not arise by chance. The city is the richest economic and cultural form of community settlement, proven by centuries of experience. The city is in its structural and architectural design an expression of the political life and the national consciousness of the people.
#''The goal of urban planning is the harmonious fulfillments of man's basic rights to employment, housing, culture and recreation. The methodological principles of urban planning are based on the natural condition, on the social and economic foundations of the state, on the highest achievements of science, technology and art, on the needs of the economy, and on the use of progressive elements of the cultural heritage of the people.
#''Cities, per se, do not arise and do not exist. To a significant extent, cities are built by industry for industry. The growth of the city, the population, and the area are determined by city-forming factors, that is, from industry, governing bodies, and cultural sites, insofar as they have more than local significance. In the capital, industry as an urbanization factor is of secondary importance to administrative bodies and cultural sites. The precise discernment and codification of city-forming factors is a matter determined by government.
#''The growth of the city must be subordinate to efficacy and remain within certain limits. An overgrown city, its population, and its area lead to difficulties in eliminating tangles in their structure, lead to entanglements in the organization of cultural life and the daily care of the population, and lead to administrative complications, both in business and in the development of industry.
#''Urban planning must be based on the principles of organicism, and the consideration of a city's historical structure in eliminating that city's shortcomings.
#''The center forms the veritable core of the city. The center of the city is the political center for its population. In the city center are the most important political, administrative and cultural sites. On the squares in the city center one might find political demonstrations, marches and popular celebrations held on festival days. The center of the city shall be composed of the most important and monumental buildings, dominating the architectural composition of the city plan and determining the architectural silhouette of the city.
#''In cities that lie on a river, the river and its embankments shall be one of the main arteries and architectural axes of the city.
#''Traffic circulation has to serve the city and its population. It should neither divide the city nor be cumbersome to the general public. Through traffic should be removed from the center and central district and rerouted outside its borders or to an outer ring. Equipment for the carriage of goods, such as rail- and canal-ways, should also be kept away from the central district of the city. Determining locations for main roads must take into account the coherence and tranquility of residential districts. In determining the width of main roads, it is important to note that the width of these main thoroughfares is not of crucial importance to urban transportation, but rather as an outlet for crossroads in order to appropriately ease the demands of traffic flow.
#''The visage of the city-that is, its individual artistic form-shall be defined by squares, main streets, and prominent buildings in the center of the city (in those largest cities containing skyscrapers). Squares and plazas shall serve as the structural basis for the planning of the city and for its overall architectural composition.
#''Residential areas shall consist of housing districts, the cores of which shall be district centers. For the sake of the residents of these housing districts, in them shall be all necessary cultural, utility, and social services. The second aspect in the structuring of residential areas shall be the residential complex, which is formed by grouping together four housing structures, where there shall be located a central park, schools, kindergartens, and nurseries that serve the daily needs of the population. Urban transport must not be allowed within these residential areas, but neither the residential districts nor the residential complexes should be isolated entities in and of themselves. Latent in their structure and design are the demands of the city on a whole. The housing structures themselves function as a third aspect in the importance of complexes in planning and design.
#''Access to light and air are not the only determining factors for healthy and peaceful living conditions, but also population density and orientations, as well as the development of transportation systems.
#''It is impossible to transform a city into a garden. Of course, care must be taken to provide sufficient greenery, but the principle not to overturn is that in the city one lives urbanistically, whereas on the outskirts or outside the city one lives rurally.
#''The many storey high-rise is more economical than a one- or two-storey design. It also reflects the character of the metropolis.
#''Urban planning is the basis of architectural design. Central to urban planning and architectural design of a city is the creation of an individual and unique visage for that city. The architecture must embody both the progressive traditions as well as the past experiences of the people.
#''For urban planning, as for architectural design, there shall be no abstract scheme. Crucial are only the summarization of essential architectural factors and the demands of daily life.
#''Simultaneously and in accordance with the work on a city plan shall be completed designs for the planning and development of specific neighborhoods, as well as plazas and main street with neatly organized housing blocks, whose construction will be completed first.''

==Implementation==
By September 7, 1950, one day after the adoption of a national building law, the demolition of the heavily damaged Berlin City Palace began. The plan was to build a 90-meter wide stretch of road from the Frankfurter Straße via [[Alexanderplatz]], Königstraße (now Rathausstraße) and the street [[Unter den Linden]] to the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. The "central axis" was to create a new representation Magistrale arise between the Brandenburg Gate and Alexanderplatz, the center of the monumental height dominant - should be in place of the castle, the central government building - as a "city crown" the Marx-Engels-Platz. In 1951, [[Stalinallee]] emerged as the first Socialist avenue in the GDR. The first stages of construction was from 1952 to 1958, designed by [[Hermann Henselmann]], architect of [[Hochhaus an der Weberwiese]]. When the work at [[Frankfurter Tor]] was completed in 1960, the historicist style of the avenue was already outdated and perceived almost bashfully. Other major projects were in [[Dresden]] at the Altmarkt, in [[Leipzig]] on Roßplatz and at the Long Street realized in [[Rostock]]. 
From 1955 a new phase of urban development in the GDR took place after the [[Soviet Union]] adopted new directives for 1954 architecture, which called for greater standardization and the waiving of expensive ornamentation. The second phase of Stalinallee-between Strausberger Platz and [[Alexander Platz]]-was therefore built in an industrial aesthetic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22892">'''Theoretical psychology''' is concerned with theoretical and philosophical aspects of [[psychology]]. It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] with a wide scope of study. It focuses on combining and incorporating existing and developing theories of psychology non-experimentally.  Theoretical psychology originated from the [[philosophy of science]], with [[logic]] and [[rationality]] at the base of each new idea. It existed before [[Empirical psychology|empirical]] or [[experimental psychology]]. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in a wide variety of psychological branches. There have been a few prominent pioneers of theoretical psychology such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[John B. Watson]]. There has also been a number of notable contributors which include [[Jerome Kagan]], [[Alan E. Kazdin]], [[Robert Sternberg]], [[Kenneth J. Gergen]], and [[Ulric Neisser]]. These contributors often publish in a variety of journals including the most prominent for theoretical psychology, the ''[[Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology]]''. Many other organizations are beginning to recognize theoretical psychology as a formal subdivision of psychology.

==Origin==

Theoretical psychology emerged from [[philosophy]], more specifically, from the [[philosophy of science]]. Philosophy strives to understand nature and structure of concepts, the laws in which these concepts occur, and the theories that combine the laws together. One of these specific branches of philosophy of science is theoretical psychology. Philosophy of science does not use the [[scientific method]] to empirically derive ideas about the physical world through conducting experiments and interpreting results. However, it is still about science with an emphasis on the logic and rationality behind science itself, bringing to light what cannot be explained by empirical measures. It is also [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] and epistemologically focused on all humans while incorporating the nature and essence of [[human knowledge]]. Just as the philosophy of science is to science, theoretical psychology is to psychology in that it is the logic and rationality applied to [[concepts]], [[laws]], and [[theories]]. Theoretical psychology is not in place to discern which theories are more truthful or more correctly. Many consider theoretical psychology as the support or rationalization of an "idea" within psychological theory that is more "truthful". However, this is not the case. Theoretical psychology is scientifically grounded in ideas of what is known through epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bergmann, Gustav. "THEORETICAL PSYCHOLOGY." ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vol. 4. Palo Alto: ANNUAL REVIEWS, 1953. 435-458.{{doi|10.1146/annurev.ps.04.020153.002251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Theoretical psychology existed long before any branches of traditional empirical and [[experimental psychology]]. Because of this, there is much more depth and breadth of knowledge from which to draw. This also makes it less common for new developments to come about in the present day because many "new" approaches are drawing from and revitalizing past theories. This brings new knowledge, frames of reference, and mindsets to these foundational theories.  This may be due to Ideas taking longer to develop and gain momentum than related fields in empirical based psychology.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Relationship to philosophy and scope==

Theoretical psychology is a rational, non-experimental approach to [[psychology]]. In psychology, as with any field of study, there are three [[Philosophy|philosophical]] perspectives and methodologies of ways to derive knowledge about the reality of the world. [[Rationalism]] (use of intellect and reason of the mind), [[Empiricism]] (use of our individually experienced sensorium), and [[Skepticism]] (knowledge beyond mere appearance that is not able to be studied) characterize the three perspectives in understanding theoretical concepts relating to laws which help to understand larger theoretical theories.&lt;ref&gt;https://drummondphilosophy.wikispaces.com/Scepticism,+Rationalism+and+Empiricism&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the philosophical perspectives, rationalism is the most pertinent to this discipline of psychology. Theoretical psychology is not experimental or clinically based and focuses on non-experimental ways to acquire knowledge about psychological topics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It explores the theoretical knowledge behind its encompassed ideologies.  Oftentimes this includes, but is not limited to, non-experimental critiques to different schools of thought, and the usefulness of psychological concepts. Theoretical psychology is a discipline that bases its information through inference, as opposed to empirically acquired information. Hypotheses are then exchanged and further built upon from different perspectives. Theoretical Psychology also deals with manipulating non-scientific, common words ([[Construct (philosophy)|hypothetical constructs]]) into scientifically objective terms ([[intervening variable]]s). Theoretical psychology requires full agreement on the different viewpoints to be able to see the point as a theory. As a result, many of its topics remain in continuous debate.

Theoretical psychology is the [[Psychology of reasoning|logic of psychology]] and all of its components. This means when theories within psychology oppose or compete, theoretical psychology does not select which is correct. It describes the nature and composition of psychology's many ideas. To explain the logic of psychology, there has been a conclusion of the principles belonging to the three classified areas. Psychology is built on the principle of being able to reference [[Behaviorism|observable behavior]], [[physical environment]], and/or [[Mood (psychology)|physiological states]]. Theoretical psychology is an important aspect that continues to play a role in modern psychology. While there are some downfalls to theoretical psychology, there are also strengths and benefits it brings to the field.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucey, K. (2015). Pesky essays on the logic of philosophy. Reno, Nevada: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope that theoretical psychology covers is vast.  Professionals have the opportunity to use this method of seeking out theoretical knowledge to begin research in a variety of subjects. This allows for a great deal of knowledge to be explored by means of inference rather than seeking out tangible data to draw ideas. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in [[cognitive psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[perceptual psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[biological psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[Cultural-historical psychology|historical psychology]], [[economic psychology]], [[political psychology]], and [[critical psychology]].  It is important to acknowledge these fields do not discount empiricism, but rather explore new ideas with a theoretical approach first.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Pioneers==
A brief history into the field of theoretical psychology includes some prominent pioneers. To begin, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1874) originally worked as a professor of philosophy. His focus was on the subjective study of an individual's [[consciousness]], he believed that this was a key factor to the field of psychology. This aspect of psychology was unable to be shown with a large amount of empirical evidence, but remained a theory throughout the history of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=W|title=Retracing the Footsteps of Wilhelm Wundt: Explorations in the Disciplinary Frontiers of psychology and in vokerpsychologie|journal=History of Psychology|date=2009|volume=4|issue=12|pages=229–265|doi=10.1037/a0017711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, [[William James]] (1890) worked as a psychologist and a philosopher. His career focused around the idea of [[free will]], which is theoretical in nature. He also assisted in forming the [[James-Lange theory]] of [[emotion]], which is based upon many theoretical factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leary|first1=D.E.|title=Overcoming Blindness: Some historical reflections on qualitative psychology|journal=Qualitative Psychology|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Doherty|first1=K|title=Relational Being|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|date=2011|volume=1|issue=31|pages=61–64|doi=10.1037/a0022548}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]] (1905) was also an important pioneer for theoretical psychology. Freud founded the [[psychoanalytic theory]] of psychology. He did not rely on empirical data when making his theories, but instead looked for philosophical explanations. Freud often shared his view that he did not need empirical evidence for his theory, because he simply knew it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=M.|title=Psychopathology of everyday life: a critical review of Dr. Sigmund Freud's theories|journal=The Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1916|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–33|doi=10.1037/qup0000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.E.|title=Freud's Psychology|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2014|volume=4|issue=7|pages=109–128|doi=10.1037/qup0000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another pioneer was [[John B. Watson]] (1913). Watson founded the theory of [[behaviorism]] in psychology through the article "Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It".  Although Behaviorism has a strong emphasis on empirical psychology, forming the methods cannot be empirically tested, and is therefore considered theoretical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=John. B.|title=Psychology as a Behaviorist Views it|journal=Psychological Review|date=March 1913|volume=2|issue=20|pages=158–177|doi=10.1037/h0074428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slife|first1=B.D|title=Toward a Theoretical Psychology:Should a subdiscipline be formally recognized?|journal=American Psychologist|date=1997|volume=2|issue=52|pages=117–129|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable contributors==

There are some notable individuals that have, and continue to make a large impact on theoretical psychology.  [[Jerome Kagan]]'s (1971) work on [[personality traits]] and [[aging]], [[emotion]], and [[temperament]] could be considered theoretical psychology due to Kagen dedicating much of his work to psychology constructs, specifically to the developmental psychology.  As a science gains new empirical procedures it also generates new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jerome Kagen|journal=American Psychologist|volume=4|issue=43|pages=223–225|doi=10.1037/h0091993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of cognitive–behavioral therapies|Donald Meichenbaum]] (1977) had work that focused on [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]. Meichenbaum did the majority of his work in the field of cognitive psychology.  He compared his theory to [[Pandora's box]]. Its main focus is connecting [[cognitive processes]] and relations to things such as clients' feelings, behavior, and consequences of these. It also factors in physiologic and social cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donald|first1=Meichenbaum|title=Changing Conceptions of Cognitive Behavior Modification: Retrospect and Prospect.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1993|volume=2|issue=61|pages=202–204|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.61.2.202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan E. Kazdin]] (1980) had theories that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a style in children and adolescence. He focuses on child and adolescent [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and conduct problems. His writings on research strategies and methods have set a high standard for rigor in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alan E. Kazdin|journal=American Psychologist|date=2011|volume=8|issue=66|pages=682–698|doi=10.1037/a0024502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sternberg]]'s (1990) main focus revolves around some theoretical idea that include; [[creativity]], [[wisdom]], [[Collaborative method|thinking styles]], [[love]], and [[hate]]. Sternberg often includes politically charged articles that focus on admissions testing and general intelligence. He performed both empirically driven and theoretical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sternberg|first1=R.J|title=Teaching for creativity: The Sounds of Silence|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics|date=2015|volume=2|issue=9|pages=115–117|doi=10.1037/aca0000007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kenneth J. Gergen]]'s (1991) work on social psychology as history was used towards generative theories, realities and relationships, the saturated self, positive aging, and relational being. He included many theoretical ideas such as culture and science, assumptions, views on [[mental illness]], and relations.  Many of his idea's were theoretical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gergen|first1=K.J.|title=Process Without Foundations|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|volume=3|issue=34|pages=195–199|doi=10.1037/a0035424}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulric Neisser]](1995) has work that's related to [[cognitive psychology]], specifically the idea of [[flashbulb memories]].  Although he used empirical data to test this idea, he originally took the concept from theoretical work.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cutting|first1=J.E|title=Ulric Neisser|journal=American Psychologist|volume=6|issue=67|page=492|doi=10.1037/a0029351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These individual's and many others continue to impact psychology with theoretical ideas that may or may not be yet supported by empirical data.

==Modern organizational support==

The [[American Psychological Association]] has the division of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology as Division 24. Theoretical Ideas are also associated to the division of [[humanistic psychology]] (32). According to the American Psychological Association, "Division 24: Society for Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology encourages and facilitates informed exploration and discussion of psychological theories and issues in both their scientific and philosophical dimensions and interrelationships." The International Society for Theoretical Psychology, the Section of History and Philosophy of Psychology (25) of the Canadian Psychological Society, the Section of History and Philosophy of psychology of the [[British Psychological Society]], the International Human Science Conference, and the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]] also offer organizational support. Universities that currently have Theoretical Psychology/Human Science programs include [[Duquesne University]], the [[University of Dallas]], [[Seattle University]], [[West Georgia College]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[York University]], [[Brigham Young University]], [[University of Notre Dame]], And [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Research methods==

Theoretical psychology works together with empirical psychology to form a symbiotic relationship. Theoretical psychology is not constrained by empirical research or laboratory studies. It allows for scientists to freely search for knowledge that we have yet to be able to study empirically or are not yet capable of studying empirically. For theoretical psychology, its strength lies in the realm of rationality, focused on big picture ideas. However, on its own it is not a complete way to gain particular knowledge of reality. This is where the empirical based branches of psychology has strength. Theoretical psychology can more heavily rely on an idea about human nature that is universal, even when it is not known why or how this particular trend happens in the world, either individualistically or collectively. [[Empirical psychology]] is what allows for humans to make insights on these big picture ideas at a more palatable, applicable and individualistic and way that gives practical information about reality. Theoretical psychology is not a universal psychological theory able to explain all topics without the use of empirical research.  Theoretical psychology is not fundamental or comprehensive theory of psychology, rather, for theoretical psychology to operate correctly it is  important to supplement empirical psychology and give reason to topics and produce theories until they can be empirically verified by the other branches of psychology.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Issues in methodology and practice==

[[Humans]] have innate wonder, exploring many topics through experience and perception. From this wonder, individuals rationally reflects on their own experiences about a specific topic. Then the individual practices [[dialectics]], examining what others have said about the topic being explored with the hopes of finding a particular knowledge about the topic. Theoretical psychology serves as the bridge between the philosophical roots of psychology and the present day empirical psychology. This bridge has an emphasis and focus on forming concepts from moments of explicit behavior that are observable, excluding introspective mental events within [[Consciousness|individual consciousness]]. Psychological laws are created from these observable behaviors that are derived from one concept that also contain concepts from the individual’s environment of internal physiological states. These laws are categorized into [[causal]] ([[statistical]]) or [[deterministic]]/[[mechanistic]] (nonstatistical) categories which relate simultaneous parallel traits or predict future from present or past respectively.  Then these laws are organized into theories based on connections logically deduced together and open to new laws yet to be discovered or empirically verified. The ultimate and logically possible goal of theoretical psychology is to create an exact and comprehensive psychological theory. However, the concepts that are immediately observable are still abstract and difficult to define even in a basic law in an important solid theory as they relate to no physical object we can make sense of or interact with using our sensorium and empirical approaches. They are not instantiated in the world and in virtue of this they are called [[Theoretical definition|theoretical concepts]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Significance==

Theoretical psychology has many aspects that can be viewed as positive or negative, which depends on the interpreter. Theoretical psychology can play an important and also unique role in the field such that almost any claim can be reasonably thought of as true if it is theoretically appealing and empirically supported by research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Edelman, S. (2012). Six
Challenges to Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology. ''Frontiers in Psychology'', ''3'', 219. http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00219&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists must be strategic and knowledgeable when shifting through experimental psychology as the field grows. This can be beneficial in the sense that individuals know theorists have made a deliberated effort when analyzing the research surrounding a theory. However, for those who are not familiar with the theoretical psychology surrounding a theory, the abundant amount of information contributing to a theory can be overwhelming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, theories can be extremely resistant to change. As theories compete, and different evidence emerges, prior theories can be extremely difficult to change. This can make it difficult for new theories to gain traction within the field of psychology. This [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] may in part be due to theories stated in ways that are worded too abstractly, ineffectively, and contradictory at times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One challenge of theoretical psychology is the difficulty to explain [[consciousness]]: there are many competing theories revolving around consciousness, and theoretical psychology struggles to fully explain or justify consciousness. Researchers have an extremely difficult time studying it, despite there being an entire field of psychology completely dedicated to consciousness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Theoretical psychology can be extremely beneficial because it brings together scientific ideas and philosophical ideas of psychology.

'''1983'''

The national art magazine ''Art New Zealand'' dedicates its Autumn issue to female artists and the women's art movement. Art historian [[Cheryll Sotheran]] writes an overview of the current state and reception of women's art in New Zealand, noting  that 'most critics in New Zealand avoid or condemn exhibitions of women's art which use gender difference as a political weapon. The women whose art receives favourable reviews (or in many cases any reviews at all) are those whose work fits the modernist mould, are not feminists, are asexual and apolitical.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sotheran|first1=Cheryll|title=Replacing Women in Art History|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues21to30/replacing.htm|website=Art New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=Autumn 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, [[Gretchen Albrecht]] selects work for a group exhibition arranged by the Outreach Gallery in Auckland,  ''New Works By Women''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosier|first1=Pat|title=New Works By Women, 1983|journal=Broadsheet|date=June 1983|issue=110|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The June issue of feminist magazine ''Broadsheet'' includes a special feature on feminist artists.

The journal ''Antic'' is launched.

It ceases publication in 1990.&lt;ref name ='Barton 1993'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Christina|title=Ten Years On: Reviewing the terrain for women in art in New Zealand|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1993|issue=68|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antic 1986 - 1990: full list of contents|url=http://best-of-3.blogspot.co.nz/2016/03/antic-1986-1990-full-list-of-contents.html|website=Best of 3|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Lita Barrie delivers a paper, 'Remissions: toward a deconstruction of phallic unequivocality: deferrals', at the Critic's Conference at the National Art Gallery. Informed by contemporary French theory and calling for a 'critical feminist art practice', Barrie attacked the essentialist form of feminist art practice common at the time, sending 'shock waves through the community of women artists to whom her paper was addressed'.&lt;ref name = 'Barton 1993'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Rebecca|last2=Williams|first2=Mark|title=Criticism and the arts - Issues of identity, 1960s onwards|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/criticism-and-the-arts/page-4|website=Te Ara - The Online Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17858">'''Traceability''' is the capability to trace something.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|traceable|id=204180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, it is interpreted as the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification.&lt;ref&gt;"Glossary," ''[[ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code]]'', Section III, Article NCA-9000&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common definitions include the capability (and implementation) of keeping track of a given set or type of information to a given degree, or the ability to chronologically interrelate uniquely identifiable entities in a way that is verifiable.

Traceability is applicable to measurement, supply chain, software development, healthcare and security.

==Measurement==
The term ''measurement traceability'' is used to refer to an unbroken chain of comparisons relating an [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]'s [[measurement]]s to a known [[Standard (metrology)|standard]]. [[Calibration]] to a traceable standard can be used to determine an instrument's bias, [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], and [[accuracy]]. It may also be used to show a [[chain of custody]] - from current interpretation of evidence to the actual evidence in a legal context, or history of handling of any information.

In many countries, national standards for weights and measures are maintained by a National Measurement Institute (NMI) which provides the highest level of standards for the [[calibration]] / measurement traceability infrastructure in that country. Examples of government agencies include the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]] (NPL) the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in the USA, the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) in Germany, and the [[Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica]] (INRiM) in Italy. As defined by NIST, "Traceability of measurement requires the establishment of an unbroken chain of comparisons to stated references each with a stated uncertainty."

A clock providing '''{{visible anchor|traceable time}}''' is traceable to a time standard such as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] or [[International Atomic Time]]. The [[Global Positioning System]] is a source a traceable time.

==Supply chain==
In the [[supply chain]], traceability may be both a regulatory and an ethical or environmental issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moyer-Lee, J. and M. Prowse (2015) ‘How Traceability is Restructuring Malawi’s Tobacco Industry’ Development Policy Review 33:2 http://web.unitn.it/files/download/34693/moyer-leeandprowse2012iobworkingpaper-traceabilityandtobaccoinmalawi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentally friendly retailers may choose to make information regarding their supply chain freely available to customers, illustrating the fact that the products they sell are manufactured in factories with safe working conditions, by workers that earn a fair wage, using methods that do not damage the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Traceability: A Practical Approach to Advance Sustainability in Global Supply Chains|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/791|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|publisher=United Nations Global Compact}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
In regard to [[Materials science|materials]], traceability refers to the capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment, or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material. Destructive tests typically include chemical composition and mechanical strength tests. A [[heat number]] is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from, and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment (i.e., were in the same oven at the same time). Material traceability is important to the aerospace, nuclear, and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions. In these industries, a part made of the wrong material is called "counterfeit," even if the substitution was accidental.

This same practice extends throughout industries using military hardware, including the [[fastener]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Traceability Matters|url=http://www.bbem.com/military-hardware-traceability|website=B&amp;B Electro-Mechanical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logistics===
{{See also|Track and trace}}
In [[logistics]], traceability refers to the capability for tracing goods along the distribution chain on a [[Batch production|batch]] number or series number basis. Traceability is an important aspect for example in the automotive industry, where it makes recalls possible, or in the food industry where it contributes to [[food safety]].

The international standards organization [[EPCglobal]] under [[GS1]] has ratified the [[EPCglobal Network]] standards (especially the EPC Information Services [[EPCIS]] standard) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners. These standards for traceability have been used in successful deployments in many industries and there are now a wide range of products that are certified as being compatible with these standards.

===Food processing===
In [[food processing]] ([[meat processing]], fresh produce processing), the term traceability refers to the recording through means of barcodes or RFID tags &amp; other tracking media, all movement of product and steps within the production process. One of the key reasons this is such a critical point is in instances where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time &amp; exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilised to identify key high production &amp; quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved.

In ''food processing software'', traceability systems imply the use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number, generally through the use of a [[barcode]] / [[RFID]]) which can be traced through the entire production flow, linking all sections of the business, including suppliers &amp; future sales through the supply chain. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability software to find the particular transaction and/or product within the supply chain.

The European Union's General Food Law came into force in 2002, making traceability compulsory for food and feed operators and requiring those businesses to implement traceability systems. The EU introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or [[TRACES]], in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/foodlaw/traceability/factsheet_trace_2007_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has its [[National Livestock Identification System]] to keep track of livestock from birth to slaughterhouse.

India has started taking initiatives for setting up traceability systems at Government and Corporate levels. Grapenet,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/Grapenet/GrapeNet_new.htm&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative by Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India is an example in this direction. GrapeNet is an internet based traceability software system for monitoring fresh grapes exported from India to the European Union. GrapeNet is a first of its kind initiative in India that has put in place an end-to-end system for monitoring pesticide residue, achieve product standardization and facilitate tracing back from pallets to the farm of the Indian grower, through the various stages of sampling, testing, certification and packing. Grapenet won the National Award (Gold), in the winners announced for the best e-Governance initiatives undertaken in India in 2007. Grapenet was designed and developed by Logicsoft,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsipl.com/Downloads_page/Grapenet.html&lt;/ref&gt; award-winning traceability solutions company, based in New Delhi, India.

The Directorate Generate Foreign Trade (DGFT), Government of India, through its notification 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://164.100.9.245/Exim/2000/NOT/NOT12/not2812.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403154618/http://164.100.9.245/Exim/2000/NOT/NOT12/not2812.htm |archivedate=2013-04-03 |df= }} No.84(RE-2008)/2004-2009&lt;/ref&gt; dated 04.02.2009 relating to Amendment in Foreign Trade Policy (RE2008)has mandated that Export to the [[European Union]] is permitted subject to registration with APEDA, thereby making Grapenet mandatory for all exports of fresh grapes from India to Europe.

[[Uruguay]] has also designed a system called ''Traceability &amp; Electronic Information System of the Beef Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inac.gub.uy/innovanet/macros/TextContentWithMenu.jsp?contentid=4057&amp;version=1&amp;site=1&amp;channel=innova.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forest products===
Within the context of supporting legal and sustainable forest [[supply chain]]s, traceability has emerged in the last decade as a new tool to verify claims and assure buyers about the source of their materials. Mostly led out of Europe, and targeting countries where [[illegal logging]] has been a key problem ([[FLEGT]] countries), [[timber tracking]] is now part of daily business for many enterprises and jurisdictions. Full traceability offers advantages for multiple partners along the supply chain beyond certification systems, including:

* Mechanism to comply with local and international policies and regulations.
* Reducing the risk of illegal or non-compliant material entering the supply chains.
* Providing coordination between authorities and relevant bodies.
* Allowing automatic reconciliation of batches and volumes available.
* Offering a method of stock control and monitoring.
* Triggering real-time alerts of non-compliance.
* Reducing likelihood of recording errors.
* Improving effectiveness and efficiency.
* Increasing transparency.
* Promoting company integrity.

A number of timber tracking companies are in operation to service global demand.

Enhanced traceability ensures that the supply chain data is 100% accurate from the forest to the point of export. Nowadays, there are techniques to predict geographical provenance of wood and contribute to the fight against illegal logging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuri | first1 = Gori | last2 = Ana | first2 = Stradiotti | last3 = Federica | first3 = Camin | year = 2018 | title = Timber isoscapes.

==Systems and software development==
In systems and [[software development]], the term traceability (or [[Requirements Traceability]]) refers to the ability to link product requirements back to stakeholders' rationales and forward to corresponding design artifacts, code, and [[test case]]s. Traceability supports numerous [[software engineering]] activities such as change [[Change impact analysis|impact analysis]], compliance verification or traceback of code, [[Regression testing|regression test]] selection, and requirements validation. It is usually accomplished in the form of a matrix created for the [[Verification and Validation|verification and validation]] of the project. Unfortunately, the practice of constructing and maintaining a [[Traceability matrix|requirements trace matrix]] (RTM) can be very arduous and over time the traces tend to erode into an inaccurate state unless date/time stamped. Alternate automated approaches for generating traces using [[information retrieval]] methods have been developed.

In transaction processing software, traceability implies use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number) which can be traced through the entire software flow of all relevant application programs. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability key to find the particular transaction. This is also sometimes referred to as the transaction footprint.

== Health care ==
Patient safety during healthcare service plays an important role in preventing delayed recovery or even mortality, by increasing and improving the quality of life of citizens, and is considered an indicator of the quality status of health services  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaelber D.C., Bates|first=DW|year=2007|title=Health information exchange and patient safety|pmc=5017354|journal=J.

To prevent theft, and assist in locating stolen objects, goods may be marked indelibly or undetectably so that they may be determined to be stolen, and in some cases identified. For example, it is sometimes arranged that stolen banknotes are marked with indelible dye to show that they are stolen; they can be identified by their unique serial numbers.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The study of '''women and religion''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. Most religions elevate the status of men over women, have stricter sanctions against women, and require them to be submissive. While there has been progress towards equality, religions overall still lag the rest of society in addressing gender issues. There are fundamentalists within every religion who actively resist change. There is often a dualism within religion which exalts women on the one hand, while demanding more rigorous displays of devotion on the other. This leads some feminists to see religion as the last barrier for female emancipation.

== Buddhism ==
{{Further|Women in Buddhism}}
[[File:Venerabletzuchuang-cropped.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A high-ranking [[Bhikkhuni]] in the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist tradition]] during an alms round.]]
[https://file.scirp.org/pdf/OALibJ_2017042616323563.pdf Women in Buddhism] is a topic that can be approached from varied perspectives including those of theology, history, anthropology and feminism. Topical interests include the theological status of women, the treatment of women in Buddhist societies at home and in public, the history of women in Buddhism, and a comparison of the experiences of women across different forms of Buddhism. As in other religions, the experiences of Buddhist women have varied considerably.

[[Buddhism]] can be considered to be revolutionary within the social and political realms of ancient India in regards to the role of women. During this time period, members of the highest Hindu caste, called [[Brahmin]]s, did not allow women to have any involvement with religious rites or sacred texts of the Vedas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|last=Halkias|first=Georgios|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781118324004|location=UK|pages=494|doi = 10.1002/9781118324004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were further oppressed by the sacred texts of Hindu code, called the Laws of Manu, which stated that “By a girl, by a young woman, or even an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house. In childhood a female must be subject to her own father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent” (V, 147-46, 155).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu.htm|title=Laws of Manu|last=Buhler|first=George|date=|website=Internet Sacred Texts Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism can be attributed as revolutionary due to the fact that [[Gautama Buddha]] admitted women into the monastic order, during a time when monastic communities were dominated by males in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirimanne|first=Chand|date=November 2016|title=Buddhism and Women - Dhamma has no Gender|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1923&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=18|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, one of the main schools of tradition that originated from the early development of Buddhism, called [[Theravāda Buddhism]], expresses the assumption that “all men and women, regardless of their caste, origins, or status, have equal spiritual worth.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because Buddhism can be described as a religious and philosophical ideology that does not have an explicit “Creator” there is no implied “sacredness” in relation to one’s human form, which means that the practice itself is not bound to the ideas of gender, reproduction, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last=Gross|first=Rita|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is argued that Buddhist traditions still have underlying issues pertaining to gender roles. While Buddhist ideologies may be considered a revolutionary step forward in the [https://journal.fi/scripta/article/view/67383/27680 status of women], many still consider the tradition to be subject to the social and political context of undermining gender issues during its upbringing, and even up to this day. The progression of gender issues, especially between gender and authority, can be seen during the time period of [[Hinayana Buddhism]], when the Buddhist order underwent major reforms of splitting into about 20 different schools. During this time Buddhist narratives and beliefs arose limiting the status of women’s roles within the Buddhist communities, asserting that women could not reach enlightenment, or [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuichi|first=Kajiyama|date=1982|title=Women in Buddhism|jstor=44361658|journal=The Eastern Buddhist|volume=15|issue=2|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that women would not attain positions of leadership because of the fact that they could not reach enlightenment, unless they “gain good [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and are reborn as men beforehand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/forum/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition|title=Can Women Become Leaders in the Buddhist Tradition?|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Khandro Rinpoche]], a female lama in Tibetan Buddhism, shows a more optimistic view in regards to women in Buddhism:&lt;blockquote&gt;When there is a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as something new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, this is not the case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J6Ci86jyYq4C|publisher = North Atlantic Books|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9781556433252|language = en|first = Thubten|last = Chodron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a YouTube interview on why there are so few female teachers in the Buddhist communities, Rinpoche goes on to say that: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is because of a lack of education. It was a very patriarchal society back in the East. Wherever Buddhism grew, these societies were very patriarchal. It limits the opportunity women have to study and be independent – and you have study and be independent to manifest any kind of realization or understanding…fortunately, that seems to be changing. I really think that opportunities for education have now really increased for women – there becoming very competitive and learned, and things are going to change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Study Buddhism|title=Khandro Rinpoche – Why Are There So Few Female Teachers?|date=2017-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEG5OrINvNM|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Rinpoche states that while the underlying nature of the [[patriarchal system]] that still exists today creates more obstacles and limitations for women in Buddhism, she believes that there is a changing dynamic and optimistic future for women within the Buddhist community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Further|Women in Christianity}}
Some Christians believe Christianity has set a mold for women to adhere to and is one that limits a woman’s freedom in the church. According to the Christian Bible, wives are expected to be submissive in many ways. They are asked not only to be submissive to their husbands, but to the church, their community, and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openbible.info/topics/virtuous_woman|title=What Does the Bible Say About Virtuous Woman?|website=www.openbible.info|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "At the head of every household is a man; at the head of a man is Christ; and the head of every women is a man; and the head of Christ is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11:3&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 11:3 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives are seen as second in the family household, only to that of their husbands. This suggests that men are first hand in Christianity and adds to issue of equal rights for women in the religion.

As according to scripture in Genesis, “the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet (fit or suitable) for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:18&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:18 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlanta.clclutheran.org/bibleclass/thechristianwoman.html|title=The Christian Woman- - the role of women in the home, church and society|website=atlanta.clclutheran.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage suggests that women are to play a supportive role to men and is supported in further passages from Christian Scripture. For example, in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18-19&amp;version=NIV Colossians] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV Peter], the specific passages call for women to submit to their husbands and to stay silent in their shadow. Lastly, in terms of how women are suppressed by scripture, the specific passage in Titus calls for a woman to not teach or preach in public assembly for that would constitute authority of a man.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Leadership roles in the organized churches and sects of Christianity are often restricted to males. In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and also in [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses.

Although Christianity professes equality for all and says women and men were created equal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown throughout history women have been subject to the patriarchy that is embedded in the religion. “In the midst of the Greek, Roman, and Jewish cultures, which viewed women almost on the level of possessions, Jesus showed love and respect for women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/articles/A168/gods-high-call-for-women|title=God's High Call for Women|website=Grace to You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expressed in the preceding quote, Jesus Christ professed equality and Christianity does express and celebrate equality. It is the patriarchy of society that has influenced Christianity and put men in positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossway.org/articles/does-the-bible-reflect-a-patriarchal-bias/|title=Does the Bible Reflect a Patriarchal Bias?|website=www.crossway.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women have played a vital role in the church, as expressed by the Acts and many others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28:1-10&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 28:1-10 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16:13-15&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 16:13-15 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; none have ever been allowed a position of leadership.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Women such as Mary Magdalene, who played a major role in support Jesus’ and the ministry, show just how important women have been to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-mary-magdalene-119565482/|title=Who Was Mary Magdalene?|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostle Paul is a great example in showing this as he worked, “side by side with them for the furtherance of the gospel,”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracechurch.org/about/distinctives/role-of-women|title=The Role of Women|website=www.gracechurch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never appointed any women in roles of leadership or power.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Women in Christianity can be roughly summarized in the following quote: “Although women are spiritual equals with men and the ministry of women is essential to the body of Christ, women are excluded from leadership over men in the church.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

However some Christians disagree with the idea that women should not have leadership positions, popular female preachers like [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Paula White]] and [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] have had or have leadership roles in Church. It is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] that women such as [[Deborah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JDG.4.4 |title=Judges 4:4 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huldah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2KI.22.14 |title=2 Kings 22:14 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were Prophets. In the [[New Testament]] Philip was said to have four daughters who prophesied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ACT.21.8-9 |title=Acts 21:8-9 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Women in Hinduism}}
In Hinduism, women are displayed as equal or even greater than men, for instance Kali Ma (Dark Mother) "is the Hindu goddess of creation, preservation, and goddess of destruction" her power symbolized the origin of all creation's life, as well as the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themystica.com/kali-ma/|title=Kali Ma {{!}} Hindu Goddess|date=2018-02-04|work=The Mystica|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her control over life and death, Kali was seen as a goddess that should be loved as well as feared. Another important female figure is Shakti, a goddess that is embodied as the energy of the universe, "often manifested to destroy demonic forces and restore balance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chopra.com/article/shakti-universal-force|title=Shakti: A Universal Force|date=2016-05-01|work=The Chopra Center|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Shakti is a universal force, she is embodied by all the gods in Hinduism and is worshiped as the "mother goddess".

While Hinduism illustrates women as important figures that play an important role in understanding how the world works, women in Hindu society have been overlooked and their importance has been diminished throughout time due to outside forces that cause "girls being made to feel lesser and not as important as boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/whitehindu/2014/06/the-truth-about-women-and-hinduism/|title=The Truth About Women and Hinduism|last=Hindu|first=The White|date=2014-06-05|work=The White Hindu|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes created a shift in power between men and women to the point where, "a Hindu woman was preordained to be ruled by the male and was subjected to all kinds of atrocities for these were the standards of being an ideal Hindu woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basharat|first=Tahira|date=July–December 2009|title=The Contemporary Hindu Women of India: An Overview|url=http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/csas/PDF/5-Dr.%20Tahira.pdf|journal=A Research Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=24|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this change in perception, Hinduism is now seen as a Partiarchal religion that teaches sexism and inequality, when in actuality it is the people in Hindu society's perception that is sexist rather than the religion itself. However, this view of women being treated as property is slowing beginning to change, as Hindu societies are pushing for more equality and a change in the perception of women.

== Islam ==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mary in Islam|Mary]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] in a [[Persian miniature]]]]
{{Further|Women in Islam|Houri}}

[[Islam]] is a monotheistic religion that was founded in the early seventh century by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The notion of a good life for a Muslim person is defined in Islam’s sacred text, the [[Quran]], as well as the [[Hadith]] which are the direct teachings of [[Muhammad]]. Although these sources covered a lot, there were still some situations that were left to interpretation. Thus, Islamic scholars formed a consensus around a set of secondary sources, the most notable being the ijma, qiyas, ijtihad and fatwas. It is important to recognize that the Quran is not a static source with a fixed meaning but a dynamic, versatile one.&lt;ref&gt;Motahari, Ayatollah Morteza. "Jurisprudence and its principles." New York: Tahrike Tarsile Quran (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Quran emphasizes the equal treatment of all Islamic people, throughout history, the patriarchy has continued to oppress Muslim women since the religion was founded. Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was less due to the teachings of the religion but more so due to the mindsets of the era. Before Islam became so widespread, people of the Middle East lived in households in which women were seen as the property of their husbands and were only meant to perform household tasks, ultimately dehumanizing them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Women." In ''The Islamic World: Past and Present''. Ed. John L. Esposito. ''Oxford Islamic Studies Online''. Apr 11, 2018. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e370&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of Islam also gave rise to the humanization of women and the recognition of women’s rights by placing men and women as equals in their ability to carry out the wishes of Allah and the teachings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jane I. "Women in Islam: Equity, Equality, and the Search for the Natural Order." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, vol. 47, no. 4, Dec. 1979, pp. 517-537. EBSCOhost, electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000775406&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was mostly due to the cultural norms and was seen a way of life by the local community.  The three main things which [[sharia]] law introduced were a women’s rights to marriage, inheritance, and divorce. It also limited the oppressive privileges of men by placing restrictions on polygamy by limiting marriage to a maximum of four women only if they are taken care of equally and properly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Khel, Muhammad Nazeer Kaka. "THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN ISLAM."&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims must observe the five pillars of Islam: praying five times a day, fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]], making a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], donating to charity, accepting Allah as the only God and Muhammad as the messenger of God. Women have restrictions on public prayer and are either banned from mosques or have separate private spaces. On top of that they cannot pray during menstruation and if they are pregnant or in labor during the month of Ramadan, they must make up these fasting days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These restrictions and the negative impact of veiling which was otherwise seen as a respectable act yielded in the seclusion of woman from mosques and other Islamic educational centers. This drove a wedge in their advancement and forced them into a dependency of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Due to their isolation, it became the responsibility of the [[ummah]], or Muslim community, to pass down the customs and traditions that mold a Muslim women's life. This guidance, sharia, and Islamic scripture outlined the structure for her education, employment opportunities, rights to inheritance, dress, public appearance, domestic 'duties', age of marriage, freedom to consent to marriage, marriage contract, mahr, permissibility of birth control, divorce, sex outside or before marriage, her ability to receive justice in case of sex crimes, property rights independent of her husband, and when ''salat'' (prayers) are mandatory for her.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, S. &amp; Kellison, R.

== Judaism ==
{{Further|Women in Judaism}}
The role of women in Judaism is determined by the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Oral Law (the corpus of rabbinic literature), by custom, and by non-religious cultural factors. Although the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature mention various female role models, religious law treats women differently in various circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Judaism 101: The Role of Women|url = http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm|website = www.jewfaq.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout historical Jewish texts, all people were seen equal under the highest level: God.  The Hebrew bible states that “man” was made both “male and female”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis.  The Hebrew Bible|publisher=Cassell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dual gender, but was later separated into male and female.  In Judaism, God has never been exclusively viewed as male or masculine, but rather, he obtains both masculine and feminine qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and sex: What the Bible really says|date=2011|publisher=Twelve|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scriptures and ancient texts refer God as “him” because there is no neutral gender in the Hebrew language.  
  
Because it is an essential building block of marriage, family is strongly emphasized in Judaism.  Gender has a bearing on familial lines: in traditional Judaism, Jewishness is passed down through the mother, although the father's name is used to describe sons and daughters in the Torah, e.g., "Dinah, daughter of Jacob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Women|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responsibilities were not taken lightly with regards to the family.  The wife and mother in Hewbrew, Jewish language, is called "akeret habayit," which in literal English translation means "mainstay." A Jewish household is expected to live up to the Torah, in which the aketet habayit, or woman of the house, tends to the family and household duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1802936/jewish/Woman-in-Judaism.htm|title=What is the Role of the Woman in Judaism?|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were highly regarded within the Jewish community because they were capable of a great degree of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|"binah"]] (institution, understanding, intelligence).  The term, “women of valor,” describes the ideal characteristics of a Jewish woman.  Traditionally, she is one who devoted all her energies towards the “physical and spiritual well-being of her family” because she had the capabilities to do so.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wenger|first1=Beth|title=Jewish Women and Voluntarism: Beyond the Myth of Enablers|journal=American Jewish History|volume=79|issue=1|pages=16–36|jstor=23884567|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her continuous devotion allowed her husband and children to flourish; her personal reward being their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krieger|first1=Aliza|title=The Role of Judaism in Family Relationships|journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|volume=38|issue=3|pages=154–165|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.2010.tb00123.x|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, that role has reshaped itself throughout time.  The “women of valor’s” effect expanded beyond the household and into the community.  Volunteer work allowed women to acquire a sense of self-hood while sharpening leadership and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;  While it may seem that women only had influence in smaller communities, Jewish women eventually established enough authority to emerge as public figures.  In 1972, Sally Priesand, became the first female rabbi that was publicly ordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Rabbis|url=https://jwa.org/rabbis|website=Jewish Women's Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were able to lead worship services and read from the Torah on par with men, if not even better because they had an alternative perspective of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=David|title=Women Rabbis: A Novel Idea|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=21865370&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in traditional Judaism has been grossly misrepresented and misunderstood. The position of women is not nearly as lowly as many modern people think; in fact, the position of women in [[halakhah]] (Jewish Law) that dates back to the biblical period is in many ways better than the position of women under American civil law as recently as a century ago.

== Sikhism ==
[[File:Preparing langar.jpg|thumb|Volunteers preparing [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] at the [[Golden Temple]] in [[Amritsar]], [[India]].]]
{{Further|Women in Sikhism}}
According to [[Sikhism]], men and women are two sides of the same coin of the human. There is a system of inter-relation and inter-dependence where man takes birth from woman, and woman is born of a man's seed. According to Sikhism a man can not feel secure and complete during his life without a woman, and a man's success is related to the love and support of the woman who shares her life with him, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Guru Granth Sahib – A brief history {{!}}  Islam Ahmadiyya|url = https://www.alislam.org/egazette/updates/sri-guru-granth-sahib-a-brief-history/|website = www.alislam.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Sikhism, [[Guru Nanak]], reportedly said in 1499 that "It is a woman who keeps the race going" and that we should not "consider woman cursed and condemned, when from woman are born leaders and rulers."

Sikhs have had an obligation to treat women as equals, and gender discrimination in Sikh society has not been allowed. However, gender equality has been difficult to achieve.

At the time of the Gurus women were considered very low in society. Both Hindus and Muslims regarded women as inferior and a man's property. Women were treated as mere property whose only value was as a servant or for entertainment. They were considered seducers and distractions from man's spiritual path. Men were allowed polygamy but widows were not allowed to remarry but encouraged to burn themselves on their husbands funeral pyre (sati). Child marriage and female infanticide were prevalent and purdah (veils) were popular for women. Women were also not allowed to inherit any property. Many Hindu women were captured and sold as slaves in foreign Islamic countries.

'''Women in the workforce''' earning wages or  salary are part of a modern phenomenon, one that developed at the same time as the growth of paid employment for men, but women have been challenged by [[Gender inequality|inequality]] in the workforce. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation in the [[workforce]]. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor [[socio-economic status]] of women, have had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become [[professionalization|professionalized]] over the 19th and 20th centuries.

Women's lack of access to [[higher education]] had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like [[law]] and [[medicine]] was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, [[Cambridge University]] only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107063131/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html|date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term [[career]]s rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs.

The increasing rates of women contributing in the work force has led to a more equal disbursement of [[working hours|hours worked]] across the regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2007$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rdCufG2vozTpKw7TBGbyoWw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=26;dataMax=56$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=|title=Graph|publisher=[[Gapminder World]] |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in western European countries the nature of women's employment participation remains markedly different from that of men.

Although access to paying occupations (the "workforce") has been and remains unequal in many occupations and places around the world, scholars sometimes distinguish between "work" and "paying work", including in their analysis a broader spectrum of labor such as uncompensated [[household work]], childcare, [[eldercare]], and family [[subsistence farming]].

==Areas of study==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] raged in the U.S., [[Virginia Penny]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] was finishing up her research project and publish the ground-breaking book, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-women-can-make-money-married-or-single-in-all-branches-of-the-arts-and-sciences-professions-trades-agricultural-and-mechanical-pursuits/oclc/15690614 ''How women can make money married or single, in all branches of the arts and sciences, professions, trades, agricultural and mechanical pursuits'' (Philadelphia, 1862)]. Hoping to offer hard facts about what women in the workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person – when she would also interview workers. Much of her site visits were conducted in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to women as well as the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for wage differentials based on gender. She dedicated her book "to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood," and the book garnered much attention by reviewers and scholars across the country. She sold her rights to the book to another publisher who put it out instead as an encyclopedia, ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xR0EAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Employments of Women: A Cyclopaedia of Woman's Work'']&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863. It sold better once it was re-titled again in 1870 as ''How Women Can Make Money, Married or Single''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gensemer|first1=Susan H.|title=Penny, Virginia|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/14/14-01170.html|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=American Council of Learned Societies|accessdate=21 December 2016|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the several different versions of the book ended up with 36 editions published between 1862 and 2006, and six editions of the adaptation in German (first published in 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penny, Virginia 1826-|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n90694085/|website=OCLC WorldCat Identities|publisher=OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[division of labor]] by [[gender]] has been studied most systematically in [[women's studies]] (especially [[women's history]], which has frequently examined the history and biography of women's participation in particular fields) and [[gender studies]] more broadly. Occupational studies, such as the [[history of medicine]] or studies of [[professionalization]], also examine questions of gender, and the roles of women in the history of particular fields. Women dominate as accountants, auditors, and psychologists.&lt;ref name="Witz-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anne Witz | title = Patriarchy and Professions: The Gendered Politics of Occupational Closure | journal = Sociology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | date = 1990 | pages = 675–690 | url = http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/4/675 | doi = 10.1177/0038038590024004007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavanagh-2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=S.

In addition, modern [[civil right]]s law has frequently examined gender restrictions of access to a field of occupation; [[gender discrimination]] within a field; and gender harassment in particular workplaces. This body of law is called [[employment discrimination|employment discrimination law]], and gender and race discrimination are the largest sub-sections within the area. Laws specifically aimed at preventing discrimination against women have been passed in many countries; see, e.g., the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] in the United States.

==Paid employment globally==
[[File:Changes in percentages of professionals by gender.png|thumbnail|This chart depicts the change in the percentage of women in three professional occupations (dentist, physician, lawyer), from 1970 to 2007.]]
Women still contribute to their communities in many regions mainly through agricultural work. In Southern Asia, Western Asia, and Africa, only 20% of women work at paid non-agricultural jobs. Worldwide, women's rate of paid employment outside of agriculture grew to 41% by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main forms of paid employment for women worldwide is actually a traditional one, that of the market "hawker". Women have worked outside the home as vendors at markets since ancient times in many parts of the world, such as Central America, South Asia, and Africa.

During the 20th century, the most significant global shift in women's paid employment came from the spread of global travel and the development of a large migrant workforce of women [[domestic workers]] seeking jobs outside of their native country. The [[Philippines]] is a major source of female domestic workers. Before the 1990s, the majority of Filipinos working outside the Philippines were male, but by 2012, an estimated 63% of Filipinos working overseas were female.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|title=Overseas deployment of Filipino domestic workers continues to rise|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|publisher=Inquirer Global Nation|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/32067/overseas-deployment-of-filipino-domestic-workers-continues-to-rise|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of Filipino women working overseas are in the millions. Over 138,000 new domestic workers gained permission to work overseas in 2012, a number that grew 12% from the previous year.&lt;ref name="Tubeza"/&gt; Overseas employment often results in the women leaving their own children behind in the Philippines to be cared for by relatives. Domestic employees from the Philippines and other countries have also been subject to exploitation and sex and money extreme abuse, for example in several countries in the Middle East, where they are often employed. It is estimated that [[remittances]] from overseas workers (both male and female) bring $1 billion (USD) per month to the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Russell|title=People on the Move: An atlas of migration|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=0-520-26151-8|pages=78–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce participation by sector===
[[File:Computer industry entrepreneur workshop.jpg|thumb|Attendees at a computer business networking event for potential entrepreneurs, United State.]]
[[File:Woodstock press photographer.jpg|thumb|A woman press photographer covers a music fest, Poland, 2008.]]

Women and men often participate in economic sectors in sharply different proportions, a result of gender clustering in occupations. Reasons for this may include a traditional association of certain types of work with a particular gender. There is a wide range of other possible economic, social and cultural variables that impact the gender distribution in different occupations, including within a region or country. An averaging of statistics gathered by the United Nations for 2004 through 2007 reflects these differences (totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding):

'''Sectoral distribution of employed persons, by sector and sex (2004 through 2007)'''&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Women 2010|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW_full%20report_color.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=May 15, 2012|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{|class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Region'''||'''Agriculture'''||'''Industry'''||'''Services'''
|-
|Africa||43% women / 42% men||11% women / 20% men||46% women / 39% men 
|-
|Asia (excluding China)||32% women / 26% men||12% women / 25% men||56% women / 49% men 
|-
|Latin America and the Caribbean||7% women / 22% men||13% women / 27% men||80% women / 51% men 
|-
|Europe and other more developed regions||6% women / 8% men||15% women / 36% men||79% women / 55% men 
|}

More detailed statistics show large differences even within these regions. For example, 11% of employed women in East Asia are employed in agriculture, a number that rises to 55% in South Asia; 70% of women in Southern Africa are employed in the service sector, while in Eastern, Middle, and Western Africa this number is 26%.&lt;ref name="The World's Women 2010"/&gt;

===Occupational dissimilarity index===
Choice of occupation is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to the male-female wage differential. In other words, careers with a majority of female employees tend to pay less than careers that employ a majority of males. This is different from direct wage discrimination within occupations, as males in the female dominated professions will also make lower than average wages and the women in the male dominated occupations usually make higher than average wages. The occupational [[index of dissimilarity|dissimilarity index]] is a measure from 0 to 100; it measures the percent of laborers that would need to be rearranged into a job typically done by the opposite sex in order for the wage differential to disappear. In 1960, the dissimilarity index for the United States was measured at 62. It has dropped since then, but at 47 in 2000, is still one of the highest of any developed nation.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hong Li J | year = | title = Gender Differences in Class Mobility: A Comparative Study of the United States, Sweden, and West Germany | url = | journal = Acta Sociologica | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 315–333 | doi=10.1177/000169939804100402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations formed by women for rights==
In the nineteenth century women became involved in organizations dedicated to social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Visions of America A History of the United States, books a La Carte Edition. Pearson College Div, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 The National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) is established to advocate for improved wages and working conditions for women. In 1920 The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was formed to create equal rights and a safe workplace for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline2.html#ixzz3Vlm8PLZb Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.: Timeline of Events (1921-1979).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 a group called Financial Women's Association (FWA), was formed. It is an organization established by a group of Wall Street women. The goal was: to advance professionalism in finance and in the financial services industry with special emphasis on the role and development of women, to attain greater recognition for women's achievements in business, and to encourage women to seek career opportunities in finance and business.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices&gt;[http://www.diversitybestpractices.com/news-articles/20-womens-organizations-you-need-know "20 Women's Organizations You Need to Know"], Diversity Best Practices, February 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by a group of feminists including Betty Friedan. The largest women's rights group in the U.S., NOW seeks to end sexual discrimination, especially in the workplace, by means of legislative lobbying, litigation, and public demonstrations. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Nancy. "The American Women's Movement, 1945-2000: A Brief History with Documents." Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1972, the National Association of Female Executives (NAFE) provides education, networking and public advocacy to empower its members to achieve career success and financial security. Members are women executives, business owners, entrepreneurs and others who are committed to NAFE's mission: the advancement of women in the workplace.&lt;ref name=DiversityBestPractices /&gt; Many of these organizations led to legal action and protecting women's rights as workers and empowered women in the workplace.

==Laws protecting women's rights as workers==

International laws protecting women's rights as workers exist through the efforts of various international bodies.  On June 16, 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) passed C189 [[Convention on Domestic Workers|Domestic Workers Convention, 2011]], binding signatories to regulations intended to end abuses of migrant domestic workers. It was anticipated that the Convention would put pressure on non-ratifying countries to support changes to their own laws to meet the change in international standards protecting domestic workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Switzerland – A step forward for domestic workers|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/world/europe/17briefs-Switzerland.html?gwh=9875484B408842FDAE59E701E668F0EF|date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2011, Hong Kong's High Court struck down a law preventing domestic workers from having residency rights granted to other foreign workers, a move that affected an estimated 100,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeParle|first=Jason|title=Domestic workers convention may be landmark|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/world/domestic-workers-convention-may-be-landmark.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=world|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO has previously ratified the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]] in 1951, which came into force in 1953, the [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]], which went into force in 1960 and the [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]], which went into force in 2002. In 1966, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which went into force in 1976. [[UNESCO]] also adopted the [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] in 1960, which came into force in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, went into force in 2003. The [[Home Work Convention]], adopted by the ILO, went into force in 2000;the Convention protects the rights of persons doing paid work out of their home, which is frequently women workers. It offers equal protection regarding working conditions, safety, remuneration, social security protection, access to training, minimum age of employment, and maternity protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|title=Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2011|isbn=9781598844252|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human trafficking]] often targets young women who are abducted and sent outside their own country to work as domestic workers, often in conditions of extreme exploitation. A number of international laws have been ratified to address human trafficking of women and children.

Maternity protection measures are put in place to insure that women will not be discriminated against in the workplace once they return from having a child. They should also not be exposed to any health hazards while they are pregnant and at work. They are allowed time off for maternity leave as well, which allows them to bond with their child; this aspect of development is crucial for infants to gain proper attachment skills. Employers are expected to hold to these policies. Yet many women on maternity leave receive very small amounts of time off to allow for their health along with their babies' health. The amount of time allowed for maternity leave as well as the pay for maternity leave varies by country, with Sweden having the longest amount off with 68 weeks and the United States being one of the worst, with the typical period being 12 weeks without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, S.

==Women in workforce leadership==
[[File:Deli womens entre network.jpg|thumb|An information technology networking social for potential entrepreneurs. New Delhi, India]]

Female decision-makers from around Europe are organized in several national and European wide networks. The networks aim to promote women in decision-making positions in politics and the economy across Europe. These networks were founded in the 1980s and are often very different from the "service clubs" founded in the early days of the century, like Soroptimist and Zontas.

"Women in Management" is about women in business in usually male-dominated areas. Their motivation, their ideas and leadership styles and their ability to enter into leadership positions is the subject of most of the different networks.

As of 2009, women represented 20.9% of parliament in Europe (both houses) and 18.4% world average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm|publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union|title=Women in National Parliaments|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, 90 women serve in the U.S. Congress: 18 women serve in the Senate, and 73 women serve in the House Women hold about three percent of executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm |publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|title=Facts on Women Officeholders, Candidates and Voters|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private sector, men still represent 9 out of 10 board members in European blue-chip companies, The discrepancy is widest at the very top: only 3% of these companies have a woman presiding over the highest decision-making body.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

List of members of the [[European Network of Women in Decision-making in Politics and the Economy]]:

*Committee of Women Elected Representatives of Local and Regional Authorities (Council of European Municipalities and Regions)
*BPW Europe, Business and Professional Women – Europe
*[[Association of Organisations of Mediterranean Businesswomen]]
*[[Eurochambres]] Women's Network
*[[European Platform of Women Scientists]]
*Network of Parliamentary Committees for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union
*[[European Network to Promote Women's Entrepreneurship]]
*[[European Women's Lobby]]
*[[European Women's Lawyers Association]]
*CEE Network for Gender Issues
*[[European Women Inventors and Innovators Network]]
*[[European Women's Management Development International Network]], EWMD
*[[Femanet – Eurocadres]]
*[[European Professional Women's Network]], EPWN
*[[Women's Forum for the Economy and the Society]]

The European Union Commission has created a platform for all these networks. It also funded the [[Women to the Top]] program in 2003–2005 to bring more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations have been created to promote the presence of women in top responsibilities, in politics and business. One example is EWMD European Women's Management Development (cited above), a European and international network of individual and corporate members, drawn from professional organisations. Members are from all areas of business, education, politics and culture.

Women who are born into the upper class rather than the middle or lower class have a much better chance at holding higher positions of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in the work force if they choose to enter it.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} According to a study published 2015, of the women who held C-suite jobs in the U.S., 94% played [[competitive sports]], 52% at a university level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ey.com/gl/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-sport-is-a-critical-lever-in-advancing-women-at-all-levels-according-to-new-ey-espnw-report|title=Sport is a critical lever in advancing women at all levels, according to new EY/espnW report|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to equal participation==
As [[gender role]]s have followed the formation of agricultural and then industrial societies, newly developed [[profession]]s and fields of occupation have been frequently inflected by gender. Some of the ways in which gender affects a field include:

*Prohibitions or restrictions on members of a particular gender entering a field or studying a field
*[[Discrimination]] within a field, including wage, management, and prestige hierarchies
*Expectation that mothers, rather than fathers, should be the primary childcare providers

Note that these gender restrictions may not be universal in time and place, and that they operate to restrict both men and women. However, in practice, norms and laws have historically restricted women's access to particular occupations;civil rights laws and cases have thus primarily focused on equal access to and participation by ''women'' in the workforce. These barriers may also be manifested in hidden bias and by means of many [[microinequities]].

Many women face issues with sexual abuse while working in agriculture fields as well. Many of the women who work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse in order to keep their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because the fact that they are documented will be brought up and may be deported.

===Access to education and training===
[[File:Maasai women at USAID literacy event (6595762621).jpg|thumb|[[Maasai people|Maasai]] women at [[USAID]] literacy event]]
A number of occupations became "[[professionalization|professionalized]]" through the 19th and 20th centuries, gaining regulatory bodies, and passing laws or regulations requiring particular [[higher education]]al requirements. As women's access to higher education was often limited, this effectively restricted women's participation in these professionalizing occupations. For instance, women were completely forbidden access to [[Cambridge University]] until 1868, and were encumbered with a variety of restrictions until 1987 when the university adopted an equal opportunity policy.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/press/factsheets/women2.html "Fact Sheet: Women at Cambridge"].&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other institutions in the United States and Western Europe began opening their doors to women over the same period of time, but access to higher education remains a significant barrier to women's full participation in the workforce in developing countries. Even where access to higher education is formally available, women's access to the full range of occupational choices is significantly limited where access to primary education is limited through social custom.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007"&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's access to occupations requiring capital outlays is also hindered by their unequal access (statistically) to capital;this affects occupations such as entrepreneur and small business owner, farm ownership, and investor.&lt;ref&gt;"DEVELOPMENT: Gender Equality Equals Growth", ''World News'', June 2, 2004, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20040208105312/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/may00/23_11_078.html archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous [[microloan]] programs attempt to redress this imbalance, targeting women for loans or grants to establish start-up businesses or farms, having determined that aid targeted to women can disproportionately benefit a nation's economy.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004"&gt;United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) statistics. See Erwin Northoff, "FOOD: Women Farmers are Invisible Actors in Hunger Drama", ''World News'', 2004 February 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  While research has shown that women cultivate more than half the world's food — in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women are responsible for up to 80% of food production — most such work is family subsistence labor, and often the family property is legally owned by the men in the family.&lt;ref name="Northoff-2004" /&gt;

===Discrimination within occupations===

The idea that men and women are naturally suited for different occupations is known as horizontal segregation.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;Massey, D. S. Categorically Unequal. New York: Russel Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company for a long period of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, E.F. Opting out and opting in: understanding the complexities of women's career transitions. Career Development International. 12, 218 – 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to earn less money than men, despite establishing equal pay laws.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]], ''[http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/ State of the World's Children (2007)]'', p.&amp;nbsp;41 (Figure 3.3 "Estimated earnings for women are substantially lower than for men");p.&amp;nbsp;36 (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the textbook ''Race, Class, and Gender: An Anthology'', women are at a higher risk of financial disadvantage in modern-day society than men. Statistical findings suggest that  women are under paid for similar jobs men complete despite having the same qualifications. The statistical data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor suggests that women are discriminated against in the workforce based on gender. The textbook reads, “Women’s wages are also more volatile than men’s wages, and women face a much higher risk of seeing large drops in income than do men” (Kennedy 2008). Anderson clearly demonstrates a significant difference between men and women in the workforce in regards to pay. Women are left more exposed to financial devastation and unemployment. The textbook also mentions that women are often give public positions versus private or leadership positions despite having appropriate work experience, higher education, or necessary skills to qualify. According to the Joint Economic Committee, “Among women heading families, the unemployment rate has grown and is higher than the national unemployment rate and twice as high as that for either married men or married women” (Joint Economic Committee, 2009). In other words, unmarried women who are the head of household are more vulnerable to financial disadvantage than married men or women. The unemployment rate of women compared to men suggests that single women are discriminated against based on gender. Anderson writes, “All women are disproportionately at risk in the current foreclosure crisis, since women are 32% more likely than men to have subprime mortgages (One-third of women, compared to one-fourth of men, have subprime mortgages; and, the disparity between women and men increases in higher income brackets)” (Anderson 265). The statistical information illustrates the dramatic difference between men and women in regards to finances. It can be inferred that men are favored in the workforce over women. Women are discriminated against based on their gender and thus are more likely to struggle financially because of discriminatory employers.

===Actions and inactions of women themselves===
Through a process known as "employee clustering", employees tend to be grouped throughout the workplace both spatially and socially with those of a similar status job. Women are no exception and tend to be grouped with other women making comparable amounts of money. They compare wages with the women around them and believe their salaries are fair because they are average. Some women are content with their lack of wage equality with men in the same positions because they are unaware of just how vast the inequality is.

Furthermore, women as a whole tend to be less assertive and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so.&lt;ref name="women's media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmedia.com|title=Index of /|publisher=Womensmedia.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys are more likely to be pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.&lt;ref&gt;Spade, Joan Z. "Gender and Education in the US." Gender Mosaics: Social Perspectives. Ed. Dana VannoyOxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional issue that contributes to income inequality by gender is that women are much more likely than men to take "breaks" in their careers to have children, often remaining out of the workforce for extended periods of time, while men in the same role or occupation (or other women who do not leave the workforce) most likely are continuing to earn promotions and/or merit-based salary increases. When a woman in this scenario re-enters the workforce, she may be offered a smaller salary or a lower position than she might have merited had she remained in the workforce alongside her colleagues (both male and female) who have not interrupted their careers.

==Gender inequality by social class==
[[File:Mechanic at work seattle.jpg|thumb|upright|Mechanic working on a motorcycle, United States]]
In the last 50 years there have been great changes toward gender equality in industrialised nations such as the United States of America. With the [[feminist movement]] of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right back out of the labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the [[baby boomer]]s. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.

===Effects on the middle and upper classes===
The addition of women into the workforce was one of the key factors that has increased [[social mobility]] over the last 50 years, although this has stalled in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of [[birth control]], these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five states{{clarification needed|date=December 2018|reason=United States?}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} recorded 53 percent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 percent of women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, and 32 percent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women.

In comparison with other sectors, IT organisations may be offering equal salaries to women, and the density of women in technology companies may be relatively high, but this does not necessarily ensure a level playing field. For example, Microsoft (US) was sued because of the conduct of one of its supervisors over e-mail. The supervisor allegedly made sexually offensive comments via e-mail, such as referring to himself as "president of the amateur gynecology club." He also allegedly referred to the plaintiff as the "Spandex Queen. E-harassment is not the sole form of harassment. In 1999, Juno Online faced two separate suits from former employees who alleged that they were told that they would be fired if they broke off their ongoing relationships with senior executives. Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet TV network, was sued in January 2000 after male employees referred to female employees as "bimbos" and forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet. In India, HR managers admit that women are discriminated against for senior Board positions and pregnant women are rarely given jobs but only in private. In addition to this, it has been suggested that there are fewer women in the IT sector due to existing stereotypes that depict the sector as male-orientated. In a recent book, ''Own It: Leadership Lessons From Women Who Do'', author [[Aparna Jain]] interviewed 200 women in senior management and leadership positions in India about the problems they face at the workplace and noted that 86% of the women she spoke to experienced harassment in one form or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/towards-fostering-a-gender-neutral-workplace/story-32TrlU2iOhQfWGGWStcSYL.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among the issues she notes are bias, bullying, sexual harassment and the impact of motherhood on women's career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpost.com/living/book-review-aparna-jains-own-it-brings-out-of-unarticulated-darkness-the-indescribable-things-that-happen-to-women-at-the-workplace-2614092.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a sexual harassment suit against a senior member shocked the Indian IT sector, as was the sexual harassment case against the [[Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces]]' (Taj Group) CEO, Rakesh Sarna .&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/sexual-harassment-case-against-ihcl-boss-rakesh-sarna-may-have-added-to-cyrus-mistry-woes/articleshow/55361051.cms&lt;/ref&gt; A startling example of institutional mechanisms that allow for an unfettered environment for sexual harassment to fester is the [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] scandal at [[The Energy and Resources Institute]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/hostile-climate-rk-pachauri-reign-teri&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the education system could be the key to encouraging women to take up roles in this sector.

Recognizing the invisible nature of power structures that marginalize women at the workplace, the Supreme Court in the landmark case ''Vaishaka versus High Court of Rajasthan'' (1997) identified sexual harassment as violative of the women's right to equality in the workplace and enlarged the ambit of its definition. The judgment equates a [[hostile work environment]] on the same plane as a direct request for sexual favors. To quote: "Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as: physical contact and advances; a demand or request for sexual favours; sexually coloured remarks; showing pornography; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature". The judgement mandates appropriate work conditions should be provided for work, leisure, health, and hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at the workplace and no woman employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in connection with her employment.

This law thus squarely shifts the onus onto the employer to ensure employee safety but most mid-sized Indian service technology companies are yet to enact sexual harassment policies. Admits K Chandan, an advocate from Chandan Associates, "I have a few IT clients. When I point to the need for a sexual harassment policy, most tend to overlook or ignore it. It's not high on the agenda." An HR Manager of India's premier technology companies rues: "I am going to use the recent case to push the policy through. Earlier the draft proposal was rejected by the company." Yet another HR manager from a flagship company of India's leading business house, oblivious to the irony of her statement, admitted that the company had a grievance redressal mechanism but no sexual harassment policy in place. The lax attitudes transgress the Supreme Court judgment wherein the Court not only defined sexual harassment, but also laid down a code of conduct for workplaces to prevent and punish it, "Employers or other responsible authorities in public or private sectors must comply with the following guidelines: Express prohibition of sexual harassment should be notified and circulated;private employers should include prohibition of sexual harassment in the standing orders under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946." As for the complaint procedure, not less than half of its members should be women. The complaint committee should include an NGO or other organization that is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. When the offense amounts to misconduct under service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated. When such conduct amounts to an offense under the Indian Penal Code, the employer shall initiate action by making a complaint with the appropriate authority. However, the survey by Sakshi revealed 58 per cent of women were not aware of the Supreme Court guidelines on the subject. A random survey by AssureConsulting.com among hundred employees working in the IT industry revealed startling results: Less than 10 per cent were familiar with the law or the company's sexual harassment policy. Surprisingly, certain HR managers were also ignorant of the Supreme Court guidelines or the Draft Bill by the National Commission of Women against sexual harassment at the workplace.

Not surprisingly many cases go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company policy is the first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing "woman's purity," the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and there is no guarantee that the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare cases I handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement."

===Effects on the working class===
Women in lower wage jobs are more likely to be subject to wage discrimination. They are more likely to bring home far less than their male counterparts with equal job status, and get far less help with housework from their husbands than the high-earning women. Women with low educational attainment entering the workforce in mass quantity lowered earnings for some men, as the women brought about a lot more job competition. The lowered relative earnings of the men and increase in birth control made marriage prospects harder for lower income women.&lt;ref&gt;Edin, K. and Kefalas, M. (2005). ''Promises I Can Keep: Why poor women put motherhood before marriage. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in the history of this country,{{which|date=January 2014}} there were distinctive socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.&lt;ref name="Massey" /&gt;

==Impact issues of female participation in the workforce==
A 2008 study published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found that women were 46% more likely to call in sick for short time periods than men and a third more likely than men to take short term sick leave.  At 60 days or more, men and women were equal in terms of sick leave.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Science Daily]]'', "[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212846.htm Women Take Almost 50 Percent More Short-term Sick Leave Than Men]", ''[[BMJ]]'', 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women in the workforce have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers to be able to take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scharlach A. E. |author2=Grosswald B. | year = 1997 | title = The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 | url = | journal = Social Service Review | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 335–359 | doi=10.1086/604261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility===
Increased participation of women in the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]] effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well.&lt;ref name=bloom2007&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Bloom |first2=David |last2=Canning |first3=Günther |last3=Fink |first4=Jocelyn |last4=Finlay |year=2009 |title=Fertility, female labor force participation, and the demographic dividend |journal=[[Journal of Economic Growth]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1007/s10887-009-9039-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[United Nation]]s data suggests that women who work because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/completingfertility/RevisedLIMpaper.PDF|title=Female Labour-Force Participation|author=Lin Lean Lim|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}, part of {{cite book|title=Completing the Fertility Transition|year=2009|publisher=[[United Nations]] Publications|isbn=9789211513707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] area, increased female labor participation has been associated with an increased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries|author1=Namkee Ahn  |author2=Pedro Mira |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=15|issue=4|year=2002|pages=667–682|jstor=20007839 |doi=10.1007/s001480100078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causality analyses indicate that fertility rate influences female labor participation and not as much the other way around.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;

Regarding types of jobs, women who work in nurturing professions such as teaching and health generally have children at an earlier age.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt; It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable [[work–life balance]] in order to combine motherhood and employment.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C.

==History==

===19th century===
Women have worked at agricultural tasks since ancient times, and continue to do so around the world. The [[Industrial Revolution]] of the late 18th and early 19th centuries changed the nature of work in Europe and other countries of the Western world. Working for a [[wage]], and eventually a [[salary]], became part of urban life. Initially, women were to be found doing even the hardest physical labor, including working as "hurriers" hauling heavy coal carts through mine shafts in Great Britain, a job that also employed many children. This ended after government intervention and the passing of the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]], an early attempt at regulating the workplace.

During the 19th century, an increasing number of women in Western countries took jobs in factories, such as textile mills, or on assembly lines for machinery or other goods. Women also worked as "[[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s" of produce, flowers, and other market goods, and bred small animals in the working-class areas of [[London]]. [[Piecework]], which involved needlework (weaving, embroidery, winding wool or silk) that paid by the piece completed, was the most common employment for women in 19th century Great Britain. It was poorly paid, and involved long hours, up to 14 hours per day to earn enough wages to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class women were usually involved in some form of paid employment, as it provided some insurance against the possibility that their husband might become too ill or injured to support the family. During the era before [[workers' compensation]] for disability or illness, the loss of a husband's wages could result in the entire family being sent to a Victorian [[workhouse]] to pay debts.

Inequality in wages was to be expected for women. In 1906, the government found that the average weekly factory wage for a woman ranged from 11s 3d to 18s 8d, whereas a man's average weekly wage was around 25s 9d. Employers stated they preferred to hire women, because they could be "more easily induced to undergo severe bodily fatigue than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childminding was another necessary expense for many women working in factories. Pregnant women worked up until the day they gave birth and returned to work as soon as they were physically able. In 1891, a law was passed requiring women to take four weeks away from factory work after giving birth, but many women could not afford this unpaid leave, and the law was unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkin|first=Joan|title=Victorian Women|year=1993|publisher=John Murray (Publishers) Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-7195-4955-8|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1870 US Census]] was the first United States Census to count "females engaged in each occupation" and provides an intriguing snapshot of women's history. It reveals that, contrary to popular belief, not all American women of the 19th century were either idle in their middle-class homes or working in [[sweatshop]]s. Women were 15% of the total work force (1.8 million out of 12.5). They made up one-third of factory “operatives,” but [[teaching]] and the occupations of [[dressmaking]], [[Hatmaking|millinery]], and [[tailoring]] played a larger role. Two-thirds of [[teacher]]s were women. Women could also be found in such unexpected places as iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5) and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), and hunter and trapper (2).

===20th century===
[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|right|upright "[[We Can Do It!]]" by [[J. Howard Miller]].|In the United States, the "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" image, as it has become known, is an iconic representation of the US government's efforts to exhort women to work during World War II, and has been adapted numerous times to represent working women or, more broadly, women overcoming adversity and other [[proto-feminist]] messages.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such.&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10"&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p.10. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1972,&lt;/ref&gt; Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. L: "The Social and Cultural Life of the 1920s", p. 9. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the turn of the 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women and a whole coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. H: "Life in the Age of Enterprise", pp. 120-121. Capricorn Books, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Women workers Woolwich Arsenal 1917 London (30).jpg|thumb|left|Working at the Woolrich Arsenal, London, United Kingdom, 1917]]
In the United States, [[World War I]] made space for women in the workforce, among other economical and social influences. Due to the rise in demand for production from Europe during the raging war, more women found themselves working outside the home.

In the first quarter of the century, women mostly occupied jobs in factory work or as domestic servants, but as the war came to an end they were able to move on to such jobs as: salespeople in department stores as well as clerical, secretarial and other, what were called, "lace-collar" jobs.&lt;ref name="Green-57"&gt;Green, E: "The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915–1945", pp. 57-58. HarperCollins, 1992,&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1920, [[The New York Times]] ran a head line that read: "the American Woman ... has lifted her skirts far beyond any modest limitation"&lt;ref name="Davis, R.L p.10" /&gt; which could apply to more than just fashion; women were now rolling up their sleeves and skirts and making their way into the workforce.

[[World War II]] created millions of jobs for women. Thousands of American women actually joined the military:
140,000 in the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)]] WAC;
100,000 in the Navy (WAVE);
23,000 in the Marines;
14,000 in the [[Navy Nurse Corps]] and,
13,000 in the Coast Guard.
Although almost none saw combat, they replaced men in noncombat positions and got the same pay as the men would have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force.&lt;ref name="Green-57"/&gt; Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been.&lt;ref name=Moody1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Moody|title=An injury to all : the decline of American Unionism|year=1988|publisher=Verso|location=London|page=22|isbn=0860919293|quote=The rate of participation of women in the labor force rose from about 28% in 1940 to 37% in 1945 and then fell to 30% in 1947.

Newspapers and magazines directed at women encouraged them to keep a tidy home while their husbands were away at work. These articles presented the home as a woman's proper domain, which she was expected to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/05/22/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday May 22, 1949|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era|last=May|first=Elaine Tyler|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=10–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, jobs were still available to women.

The increase of women in the labor force of Western countries gained momentum in the late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity.

The first phase encompasses the time between the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era gave birth to the "independent female worker." From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of [[marriage bars]], which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more participation in the work force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.

In the third phase, labeled the "roots of the revolution" encompassing the time from 1950– mid-to-late 1970s, the movement began to approach the warning signs of a revolution. Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a "career". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in "pink-collar jobs" as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. The [[sexual harassment]] experienced by these [[Pink-collar worker|pink collar]] workers is depicted in the film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]''. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse—the so-called "M.R.S. degree". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly.

The fourth phase, known as the "Quiet Revolution", began in the late 1970s and continues on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like [[women in medicine|medicine]], law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations that only worked intermittently due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning in the 1970s;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step into and out of the labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying later in life{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women's labor force participation more than offset the decline for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2003/wp2003-22.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|title=''Do Women’s and Men’s Labor Market Outcomes Differentially Affect Real Wage Growth and Inflation?''|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for this big jump in the 1970s has been attributed by some scholars to widespread access to the [[birth control pill]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} While "the pill" was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'', 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the [[age of majority]] had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely as a consequence of the [[Vietnam War]]; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a "big bang" revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldin, Claudia | title = The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education and Family | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 96 | issue = 2 | date = 2006 | pages = 1–21 | doi=10.1257/000282806777212350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupational safety and health ==
Women tend to have different occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[tendonitis]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress may be due to the fact that women are often [[caregiver]]s at home and do [[contingent work]] and [[contract work]] at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is [[homicide]], which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/#2|title = Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work|date = June 19, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women are at lower risk for work-related death than men. However, [[personal protective equipment]] is usually designed for typical male proportions, which can create hazards for women who have ill-fitting equipment.&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; Women are less likely to report an occupational injury than men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research is ongoing into occupational hazards that may be specific to women. Of particular interest are potential [[Toxic substance|environmental causes]] of [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=NIOSH/&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] is an occupational hazard for many women, and can cause serious negative symptoms including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[insomnia]], and feelings of low self-esteem and alienation. Women are also at higher risk for [[occupational stress]], which can be caused by balancing roles as a parent or caregiver with work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Women to the Top''' ('''W2T''') was a European project for bringing more women into top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/lika-villkor-pa-jobbet-viktigt/|title=Lika villkor på jobbet viktigt|last=Björklund|first=Marianne|date=2004-11-08|work=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the [[European Commission]] and ran 2003-2005 in Estonia, Denmark, Greece and Sweden,&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w2t.se/uk/about.htm|title=Women to the Top|publisher=Women to the Top (W2T) |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in a transnational conference in Stockholm, 24–25 January 2005.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; The total budget was 5.6 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (half a million euros). The project was directed toward private and public employers.&lt;ref name="svd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/nyheter/artikel_1043415.svd|title=Gemensamt krafttag för ett mer jämställt Europa|last=Danielsson|first=Anna|date=2005-01-25|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estonia ==
In Estonia, Tiina Raitviir surveyed female executives from Estonia’s Top500 companies.  One hundred women managers were identified as the basis for an informal network and a mentorship program.  Eighty women managers participated in an initial seminar. Nine women followed up in subsequent workshops.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; All of the companies were foreign owned because it was believed they would be more willing to participate in the project than Estonian companies.&lt;ref name="svd" /&gt;

== Denmark ==
Fifty-one potential top managers attended interdisciplinary networks hosted by CeLi and two trade unions, the Danish Society of Engineers (IDA) and the Danish Association of Lawyers and Economists (DJØF). These women formed professional networks for Women in Top Management, Women in Human Resource Management and Women in Project Management.  They attended seminars and a national conference.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt; In addition, four recruitment firms were involved in a focus group to develop gender recommendations for consultants and managers.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt;

== Greece ==
In Greece, the project worked with The Research Centre for Gender Equality (KETHI). Thirty women attended counselling on entrepreneurship for women who wanted to start their own businesses. Seven more women attended vocational workshops at the organisations Amel, Elgeka and the Municipality of Athens. Members from ten recruitment companies took part in seminars and research on gender inequality and leadership. A survey was carried out to learn more about gender and employment.&lt;ref name=FinalReport/&gt;

== Sweden ==
In Sweden the project was administered by the [[Swedish Ombudsman for Equal Opportunities|Ombudsman for Equal Opportunities]] (Jämo)&lt;ref name="NIKK"&gt;{{Cite news
