== Biography ==
20syl, originally a [[graphic designer]], graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts in [[Nantes Metropolis|Nantes Métropole]]. He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in [[Rezé]].

In 1995, 20Syl and Cambia released their first [[mixtape]], ''Première Formule.'' Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of 20Syl, to form the group [[Hocus Pocus (group)|Hocus Pocus]], and released their first album as a trio, ''Seconde Formule'', in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called [[C2C (group)|C2C]] (Coups2Cross). C2C was the world champion [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]] team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two [[MC (hip hop)|MCs]] and a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] did not work on stage and went their separate ways; 20Syl continued his productions and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalmusic.fr/artiste/11135-hocus-pocus/bio|title=Biographie de Hocus Pocus - Universal Music France|website=Universal Music France|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, 20syl worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label ''On &amp; On'' and released the maxi ''Sick'', which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album ''73 Touches'' (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to [[Miles Davis]] and [[Billie Holiday]]. Mathieu Lelièvre on keyboard, Hervé Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of ''Sick'' and six new titles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The album ''Place 54'', released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category "[[Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album|Best Urban Contemporary Album]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

20syl published his first solo [[Extended play|EP]], ''Motifs,'' on the 9 June 2014; the site [http://Sourdoreille.net sourdoreille.net] considers this EP as "a real gem"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc/ |title=Le premier EP de 20syl est une pépite {{!}} Sourdoreille |deadurl=no |archivedate=14 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914053818/http://www.sourdoreille.net/20syl-et-ibrahim-maalouf-duo-de-choc |accessdate=4 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [http://wordplaymagazine.com/ wordplaymagazine.com] praises 20syl's style as "frankly remarkable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wordplaymagazine.com/2015/06/articles/reviews/20-syl-motifs-2/|title=20 Syl – Motifs 2|date=13 June 2015 |newspaper=Wordplay Magazine|language=en-US|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second EP, ''Motifs &lt;abbr&gt;II&lt;/abbr&gt;'', was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of ''Motifs &lt;abbr&gt;II&lt;/abbr&gt;'' &lt;abbr&gt;20syl&lt;/abbr&gt; explains: "For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/20syl-j-ai-envie-de-tout-controler_1685660.html|title=20syl: "I want to control everything"|last=|first=|date=4 December 2016|newspaper=LExpress.fr|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 in [[Nantes]], 20syl presented the U, an interactive musical [[Rampe|skateboard ramp]] (in collaboration with the collective Herrmutt Lobby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onandon-records.com/leU/|title=Le U rampe sonore {{!}} Rampe de skate Interactive et musicale|website=www.onandon-records.com|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://herrmuttlobby.com// herrmuttlobby.com] says regarding U "The skater is the musician and the ramp is the instrument. He composes and decomposes the rhythm, he breaks down initial binary arrangements, making the digital human again for a moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herrmuttlobby.com/|title=herrmuttlobby.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 [[Keynote (presentation software)|The Apple Keynote]] used a piece of 20syl to promote the functionality of [[Siri]] on the Apple Watch in their [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKotmAS-2Ac "Choose Colorfully"] advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.applemusic.info/|title=AppleMusic.info - The definitive list of music used by Apple Inc. in commercials, keynote addresses, presentations, and other marketing materials.|website=www.applemusic.info|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, 20syl published a remix of the Pulpalicious song ''How I Feel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewebtape.net/quand-20syl-remixe-pulpalicious/54876|title=Quand 20syl remixe Pulpalicious - TheWebTape|date=22 December 2015|newspaper=TheWebTape|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406103500/http://www.thewebtape.net/quand-20syl-remixe-pulpalicious/54876|archive-date=2016-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, he published his first year production entitled ''Inertia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenroom.fr/88013-20syl-sort-un-nouveau-single-pour-la-bonne-cause/|title=20Syl sort un nouveau single pour la bonne cause - Greenroom|date=15 January 2016 |newspaper=Greenroom|language=fr-FR|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in January 2016, he published a remix of the song ''Walk Walk'' by [[Yael Naim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.quai-baco.com/20syl-revisite-le-titre-walk-walk-de-yael-naim-24892/|title=20syl revisite le titre " Walk Walk " de Yael Naim|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he formed the group [[AllttA]] (A Little Lower Than The Angels) with the Californian rapper [[Mr. J. Medeiros]]. Their debut album, titled ''The Upper Hand'', was released on February 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/mr20syl/photos/a.138869306156683.25026.101405206569760/1273193322724270|title=facebook.com/mr20syl|last=|first=|date=|website=facebook.com|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acetyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-carnitine''', '''ALCAR''' or '''ALC''', is an [[acetylated]] form of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[carnitine]]. It is naturally produced by the body, although it is often taken as a dietary supplement. Acetylcarnitine is broken down in the blood by [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[esterase]]s to carnitine which is used by the body to transport fatty acids into the [[mitochondria]] for breakdown.

== Biochemical production and action ==
[[Carnitine]] is both a [[nutrient]] and made by the body as needed; it serves as a substrate for important reactions in which it accepts and gives up an [[acyl group]]. Acetylcarnitine is the most abundant naturally occurring derivative and is formed in the reaction:

:[[acetyl-CoA]] + carnitine {{eqm}} [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] + acetylcarnitine

where the acetyl group displaces the hydrogen atom in the central hydroxyl group of carnitine.&lt;ref name=1988Bieber&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bieber LL | title = Carnitine | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 57 | pages = 261–83 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3052273 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.001401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephens2007"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 2007|title=New insights concerning the role of carnitine in the regulation of fuel metabolism in skeletal muscle|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=581|issue=Pt 2|pages=431–44|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2006.125799|pmc=2075186|pmid=17331998|vauthors=Stephens FB, Constantin-Teodosiu D, Greenhaff PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coenzyme A (CoA) plays a key role in the [[Krebs cycle]] in [[mitochondria]], which is essential for the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which powers many reactions in cells; acetyl-CoA is the primary substrate for the Krebs cycle, once it is de-acetylated, it must be re-charged with an acetyl-group in order for the Krebs cycle to keep working.&lt;ref name=Stephens2007/&gt;

Most cell types appear to have transporters to import carnitine and export acyl-carnitines, which seems to be a mechanism to dispose of longer-chain moieties; however many cell types can also import ALCAR.&lt;ref name=1988Bieber/&gt;

Within cells, carnitine plays a key roles in importing acyl-CoA into mitochondria; the acyl-group of the acyl-CoA is transferred to carnitine, and the acyl-carnitine is imported through both mitochondrial membranes before being transferred to a CoA molecule, which is then [[Beta oxidation|beta oxidized]] to acetyl-CoA.  A separate set of enzymes and transporters also plays a buffering role by eliminating acetyl-CoA from inside mitochondria created by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] that is in excess of its utilization by the Krebs cycle; carnitine accepts the acetyl moiety and becomes ALCAR, which is then transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytosol, leaving free CoA inside the mitochondria ready to accept new import of fatty acid chains.&lt;ref name=Stephens2007/&gt;  ALCAR in the cytosol can also form a pool of acetyl-groups for CoA, should the cell need it.&lt;ref name=Stephens2007/&gt;

Excess acetyl-CoA causes more carbohydrates to be used for energy at the expense of fatty acids.  This occurs by different mechanisms inside and outside the mitochondria.  ALCAR transport decreases acetyl-CoA inside the mitochondria, but increases it outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Kiens B |title=Skeletal muscle lipid metabolism in exercise and insulin resistance |journal=Physiological Reviews |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=205–43 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16371598 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopaschuk GD, Gamble J |title=The 1993 Merck Frosst Award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3639">'''Adam of Perseigne''' ({{circa}} 1145 – 1221) was a [[France|French]] [[Cistercian Order|Cistercian]], abbot of [[Perseigne Abbey]] in the [[Diocese of Le Mans]].&lt;ref name=author&gt;{{cite web |title=Cistercian Authors |url=http://www.abbaye-ubexy.com.fr/pagesnewsite/auteurscisterciens.htm |accessdate=September 15, 2007 |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012091707/http://www.abbaye-ubexy.com.fr/pagesnewsite/auteurscisterciens.htm |archivedate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Adam of Perseigne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam was born around 1145 into a [[serf]], or peasant, family.&lt;ref name=author/&gt; He is thought to have been first a [[canon regular]], later a [[Benedictine]] of [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours]], and then a Cistercian.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; In 1188,&lt;ref name=author/&gt; he became abbot of [[Perseigne]] Abbey, to which his reputation for holiness and wisdom drew the great personages of his time to seek his advice.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; He was for a time the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confessor]] to King [[Richard Lionheart]] of England. He had at [[Rome]] a conference with the celebrated [[Christian mysticism|mystic]], [[Joachim of Fiore|Joachim, Abbot of Flora]], (in [[Calabria]], [[Italy]]), on the subject of the latter's revelations, and aided [[Foulques de Neuilly]] in preaching during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; He died in 1221.&lt;ref name=author/&gt;

His sermons were published at Rome in 1662, under the title ''Adami Abbatis Perseniæ Ordinis Cisterciensis Mariale''.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; About half his known letters remained in circulation after the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] in various collected formats. These collections were subsequently incorporated into the [[Patrologia Latina]] in volume CCXI.

Many of his letters were addressed to members of the House of Champagne (e.g. the countesses of Chartres and of Châlons) and to the bishops and leading ecclesiastics of the dioceses of Le Mans, Chartres and of Normandy (especially Rouen). A virgin, Agnes, is addressed several times in the final volume. Adam's letters have strong moral as well as spiritual content (examples among many, those to the Rouen ecclesiastics).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5352">'''Aimery II''' (or '''Aimeric II''') (died 17 July 1134) was the [[Viscount of Narbonne]] from around 1106 until his death. 

He was the eldest son of [[Aimery I of Narbonne]] and Mahalt (also Mahault or Mafalda), daughter of [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Sichelgaita]] and widow of [[Raymond Berengar II of Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  This made him a half-brother of [[Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona|Raymond Berengar III]]. He initially ruled as a minor under the regency of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 211&amp;ndash;212.&lt;/ref&gt; After he came of age he married Ermengard. 

Probably in 1112 or 1113, Aimery received the [[Fenouillèdes]] and the [[Peyrepertusès]] from his half-brother in return for swearing an oath of fealty against [[Bernard Ato IV]] of [[Béziers]], with whom Raymond Berengar was at war.&lt;ref name="Cheyette, 77 and n31."&gt;Cheyette, 77 and n31.&lt;/ref&gt; The lords of the Fenouillèdes and the Peyrepertuseès remained vassals of Narbonne until the [[Albigensian Crusade]] and the viscounts of Narbonne took the lordship of [[Rouffiac-d'Aude|Rouffiac]] near [[Peyrepertuse]] into their own hands. When [[Douce I, Countess of Provence]] died and Raymond Berengar claimed the [[County of Provence]], Aimery received the fief of [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]] and the ''terre d'Argence'' near the mouth of the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] in Provence.&lt;ref name="Cheyette, 86."&gt;Cheyette, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometime during his rule, Aimery granted the merchants of [[Narbonne]] the right to form a [[consulate]] in imitation of [[Genoa]]. Probably he saw the self-organisation of his merchants and their formation of a military in their own defence as an aid to his own rule so long as the consulate remained under vicecomital control, which in the end it did not.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Aimery also participated in 1114&amp;ndash;15 in the [[1113&amp;ndash;1115 Balearic Islands expedition|Balearic Islands expedition]] led by the [[Republic of Pisa]] and Raymond Berengar. 

In 1114, Aimery put an end to conflicting claims in the village of Le Lac on the [[Via Domitia]] by transferring his rights there to the [[abbey of Lagrasse]] in return for a large loan of gold and silver.&lt;ref name="Cheyette, 77 and n31."/&gt; He also entered into a conflict with his cousin [[Richard de Millau]], [[Ancient Diocese of Narbonne|Archbishop of Narbonne]], who may have been a compromise candidate between Aimery and the [[pope]] for the archiepiscopal throne.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard claimed that Aimery ''fecit mihi hominium propriis manibus'' ("did homage to [him] with his own hands") received ''fedovia'' ("fiefs") from the Church "in the presence of the universal synod of the [[province of Narbonne]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The archbishop accused Aimery of deceiving him concerning the extent of the Church's fiefs and attempting to hold land as his by inheritance which was his by grant of the Church; he also accused Aimery of withholding revenues from taxes and imposts that should have gone to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 209&amp;ndash;210.&lt;/ref&gt; Aimery was recorded to have even abused church property violently and there were disputes concerning who controlled the towers on the city walls. The whole dispute lasted a long time, but Aimery was made to come to terms by the [[Papacy]]'s support of Richard.&lt;ref name="Cheyette, 108&amp;ndash;109."&gt;Cheyette, 108&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, he had to swear oaths of fealty to the archbishop, recognise the archbishop's independent temporal lordship, and concede that some of the rights he held in the city of Narbonne constituted a fief of the archbishopric.&lt;ref name="Cheyette, 108&amp;ndash;109."/&gt; 

In 1124, Bernard Ato of Béziers declared war on Aimery, who responded by razing the castle (''pro justicia'', "out of justice") at [[Montséret]], which had been held by Aimery's vassal Bernard Amati until he had treacherously turned it over to Bernard Ato.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after this Aimery turned towards [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and joined the [[Reconquista]] being waged by [[Alfonso the Battler]] in the [[Ebro]] valley. 

In July 1131, Aimery was at the deathbed of his half-brother to witness his final testament, of which he was to be the executor.&lt;ref name="Cheyette, 86."/&gt; Aimery died in [[Battle of Fraga|battle]] before the walls of the [[Moorish]] city of [[Fraga]], which Alfonso had been besieging.&lt;ref&gt;Cheyette, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Aimery had a son and a daughter by Ermengard; the son, Aimery, predeceased him (ca. 1130), and he was succeeded by his daughter [[Ermengard of Narbonne|Ermengard]], who was only four or five at the time. He married a second time to a woman named Ermessende and left by her a daughter of the same name. This second daughter, Ermessende, married before 1153 a great Castilian magnate, [[Manrique Pérez de Lara]], lord of [[Molina de Aragón|Molina]].

He eventually held the post of [[Domestic of the Schools]] during the last years of the reign of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] and in the early reign of [[Leo VI the Wise]], until his death. He played a major role in the domestic affairs of Leo's early reign, especially in the dismissal and trial of Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]].

== Life ==
According to the chronicler [[Genesios]] and the [[continuator]]s of [[Georgios Monachos]], Andrew descended from the "western [[Scythians]]", whence the sobriquet "the Scythian" given to him by modern scholars. In reality, "Scythians" was an [[archaism|archaizing]] Byzantine term for the [[Slavs]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}

Andrew may be identifiable as the man of the same name who commanded the imperial bodyguard, the ''[[Hetaireia]]'', when the young [[Basil the Macedonian]] ({{reign|867–886}})) served there during his swift rise from a simple stable groom to high office in the late 850s and early 860s as a protégé of Emperor [[Michael III]] ({{reign|842–867}}).{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=28}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=439}} When Basil came to power after assassinating Michael, Andrew too rose to higher office. In the 870s, as ''[[hypostrategos]]'' (deputy commander) of the [[Opsician Theme]], he distinguished himself in the constant war of raids and counter-raids with the Muslim [[Thughur|border emirates]] of [[Malatya]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], on the eastern fringes of [[Asia Minor]]. For his service, he was eventually rewarded with the titles of ''[[patrikios]]'' and the post of [[Domestic of the Schools]] (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=438}} 

[[Theophanes Continuatus]] reports that he was dismissed due to accusations of timidity, after failing to follow up on a decisive victory against the emir of Tarsus, [[Abdallah ibn Rashid ibn Kawus]], which the Byzantine sources place in the year 878.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=438}} Genesios and the continuators of Georgios Monachos on the other hand don't mention a dismissal, but simply record that on account of his victories, he was raised further to the rank of ''[[magistros]]''. Andrew is also mentioned as leading, along with [[Christopher (Domestic of the Schools)|Christopher]], the sacking of [[Tephrike]], the [[Paulician]] capital, an event dated by modern scholars to 878. This is considered erroneous by modern scholars, since the final campaign against Tephrike was in all likelihood led by Emperor Basil in person.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}} On the other hand, the chronicle of [[Symeon Logothetes]] gives an entirely different background to his dismissal, placing it in 883 and the fall-out between Basil and his son, the future [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] ({{reign|886–912}}). According to Symeon, Theodore Santabarenos accused Andrew of being privy to a plot of the circle around Leo to depose his father. Along with other high-ranking officials connected to the heir-apparent, Andrew lost his post, even though he was on campaign at the time.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=58}} Whatever the true course of events, his disgrace did not last long, as his successor, [[Kesta Styppiotes]], was decisively beaten by the Arabs, and Andrew soon regained his post, which he held to the end of his life.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|pp=438–439}}

When Leo succeeded his father, Andrew quickly emerged as the new emperor's right-hand man.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=94}} Thus it was Andrew who headed the delegation of senior officials and senators sent by Leo immediately after his accession on 29 August 886 to [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] in order to retrieve and bring back to the capital for reburial in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] the corpse of Michael III, whom Leo believed to have been his real father.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=439}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|p=62}} Andrew was also instrumental in the downfall of the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]], who along with his protégé Theodore Santabarenos was accused by Andrew and the ''magistros'' [[Stephen (son of Kalomaria)|Stephen]] of plotting to overthrow Leo. As the emperor's trusted agent, it was Andrew who, along with the [[Logothete of the Course]], [[John Hagiopolites]], went to the [[Hagia Sophia]], read the charges brought against Photios from the pulpit, and arrested the patriarch. Photios' trial for treason took place in 887, before a tribunal of senior officials presided over by Andrew. Photios and Theodore were found guilty, with the former banished to the monastery of Gordon, where he died, while Theodore was exiled to Athens.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Guilland|1967|p=439}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|pp=73–76}}

The trial of Photios is the last mention of Andrew in the sources. He must have died sometime between then and 894, when [[Nikephoros Phokas the Elder]] is recorded as having succeeded him as Domestic of the Schools.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Andreas “der Skythe” (#20351)}}{{sfn|Tougher|1997|pp=95, 204}}

Biodemography is a multidisciplinary approach, integrating biological knowledge (studies on human biology and animal models) with demographic research on human longevity and survival. Biodemographic studies are important for understanding the driving forces of the current longevity revolution (dramatic increase in human life expectancy), forecasting the future of human longevity, and identification of new strategies for further increase in healthy and productive life span.

==Theory==
Biodemographic studies found a remarkable similarity in survival dynamics between humans and laboratory animals. Specifically, three general biodemographic laws of survival are found:

# [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]
# [[Compensation law of mortality]]
# [[Late-life mortality deceleration]].

The [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality|Gompertz–Makeham law]] states that death rate is a sum of age-independent component ([[Makeham term]]) and age-dependent component ([[Gompertz function]]), which increases exponentially with age.

The [[compensation law of mortality]] (late-life mortality convergence) states that the relative differences in death rates between different populations of the same biological species are decreasing with age, because the higher initial death rates are compensated by lower pace of their increase with age.

The [[Late-life mortality deceleration]] law states that death rates stop increasing exponentially at advanced ages and level-off to the [[late-life mortality plateau]]. An immediate consequence from this observation is that there is no fixed upper limit to human longevity &amp;mdash; there is no special fixed number, which separates possible and impossible values of lifespan. This challenges the common belief&lt;ref&gt;Gavrilov, L.A., Gavrilova, N.S. Common sense and the limits to life. Int. J. Geriatric Psychiatry, 1993, 8(8): 695–695.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavrilov L.A. Does a limit of the life span really exist? Biophysics [Biofizika], 1984, 29(5): 908–911.&lt;/ref&gt; in existence of a fixed maximal human life span.

Biodemographic studies found that even genetically identical laboratory animals kept in constant environment have very different lengths of life, suggesting a crucial role of chance and early-life developmental noise in longevity determination. This leads to new approaches in understanding causes of exceptional human longevity.

As for the future of human longevity, biodemographic studies found that evolution of human lifespan had two very distinct stages – the initial stage of mortality decline at younger ages is now replaced by a new trend of preferential improvement of the oldest-old survival. This phenomenon invalidates methods of longevity forecasting based on extrapolation of long-term historical trends.

A general explanation of these biodemographic laws of aging and longevity has been suggested based on system [[reliability theory of aging and longevity|reliability theory]].

'''Bonzun ''' is a Swedish-based company, with backing from both the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]].  Bonzun helps pregnant women get access to information previously not available online. Their main focus is pregnancy information to the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] people.

The success of the website and app in China has led to the founder receiving a number of awards for her innovation.

==History==
Bonzun was first founded in 2010, after [[Bonnie Roupé]] got seriously ill during the pregnancy of her second child and she could not find any information online. Bonnie Roupé and her baby survived, but she could not get over the fact that so many women around the world suffer and die because of lack of information online. She wanted to create a service to make research available to doctors and mothers all over the world. Information that helps and saves lives. Bonnie Roupe stated that around 20 million women a year fall pregnant in [[China]], meaning there was a large market for the [[medical]] information.[1] The website describes common and serious pregnancy complications and make information accessible in China so pregnant women and health care professionals can improve their knowledge, especially in [[rural areas]].[1]

Bonnie Roupé is a native of [[Sweden]], but started the company without a local partner in mainland [[China]]. In an interview, she stated that it was a good learning curve to go through the processes alone, but admitted that it may have been faster to use a local partner.[1]

In 2012, Bonzun was selected for the Innovation Against Poverty, which was received from the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA).[2] During the same year, the company's founder Bonnie Roupé was selected as one of Sweden’s super-talents under 40 years old, by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] magazine, [[Veckans Affärer]].[3]

The company announced in 2014 that they were receiving support for their work from both the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF|United Nations’ Children’s Rights &amp; Emergency Relief Organization (UNICEF)]]. The company's focus on the [[China|Chinese]] health market led the company to have its innovations present in various hospitals across [[China]], along with 3,700 clinics.[1] [4]

During that year, Bonzun also created a [http://kexuema.com mobile app], which is now being used by pregnant women to understand their tests at various hospitals across [[China]].[4]

In autumn of 2016, Bonzun participated in [http://chinaccelerator.com/ Chinaaccelerator]´s three-month mentorship-driven program for internet startups from all over the world. The program was finalised on December 6, 2016 at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giwlAJy5fjY Chinaccelerator Batch 10 Demo Day] in Shanghai, China.

In June 2016, [http://www.inspiringfifty.com/ InspiringFifty] selected Bonzun founder Bonnie Roupé as one of the [http://www.inspiringfifty.com/nordics2016/ Nordic region´s 50 most inspirational tech women].

In March 2017 she was listed as one of Sweden´s 125 most powerful women and ranked as the [https://www.va.se/nyheter/2017/03/06/naringslivets-maktigaste-kvinnor-2017-entreprenorerna/ 10th most powerful women entrepreneur], Trade and Industry 2017 ([https://www.va.se/ Veckans Affärer]).

[[Image:Trait-scale-bimodal.png|thumb|right|313px|[[Norms of reaction]] for two genotypes. Genotype B shows a strongly bimodal distribution indicating differentiation into distinct phenotypes. Each phenotype that results from genotype B is buffered against environmental variation—it is canalised.]]

'''Canalisation''' is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same [[phenotype]] regardless of variability of its environment or [[genotype]]. It is a form of [[robustness (evolution)|evolutionary robustness]]. The term was coined in 1942 by [[C. H. Waddington]] to capture the fact that "developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to [[natural selection]]...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington CH |title=Canalization of development and the inheritance of acquired characters |journal=Nature |volume=150 |pages=563–565 |year=1942 |doi=10.1038/150563a0 |issue=3811|bibcode=1942Natur.150..563W }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems.

Biological robustness or canalisation comes about when [[developmental biology|developmental pathways]] are [[evolutionary developmental biology|shaped by evolution]]. Waddington introduced the concept of the [[epigenetic landscape]], in which the state of an organism rolls "downhill" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley (which he called a [[creode]]) enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its "fate". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waddington CH |title=The strategy of the genes |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic assimilation==

Waddington used the concept of canalisation to explain his experiments on [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2405747 |author=Waddington CH |title=Genetic assimilation of an acquired character |journal=Evolution|volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=118–126 |year=1953 |jstor=2405747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, he exposed ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' [[pupa]]e to heat shock. This environmental disturbance caused some flies to develop a [[crossveinless]] [[phenotype]]. He then [[Artificial selection|selected]] for crossveinless. Eventually, the crossveinless phenotype appeared even without heat shock. Through this process of genetic assimilation, an environmentally induced phenotype had become inherited. Waddington explained this as the formation of a new canal in the [[epigenetic]] landscape.

It is, however, possible to explain genetic assimilation using only [[quantitative genetics]] and a threshold model, with no reference to the concept of canalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/282040 |author=Stern C |title=Selection for subthreshold differences and the origin of pseudoexogenous adaptations |journal=American Naturalist|volume=92 |pages=313–316 |year=1958 |issue=866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateman KG |title=The genetic assimilation of the dumpy phenocopy |journal=American Naturalist|volume=56 |pages=341–351 |year=1959 |doi=10.1007/bf02984790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000433 |author=Scharloo W |title=Canalization – genetic and developmental aspects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22 |pages=65–93 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Falconer DS, Mackay TF |title=Introduction to Quantitative Genetics |pages=309–310 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, theoretical models that incorporate a complex [[genotype–phenotype map]] have found evidence for the evolution of phenotypic robustness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.102303999 |vauthors=Siegal ML, Bergman A |title=Waddington's canalization revisited: Developmental stability and evolution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99 |issue=16 |pages=10528–10532 |year=2002 |pmid=12082173 |pmc=124963|bibcode=2002PNAS...9910528S }}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to genetic assimilation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Masel J |title=Genetic assimilation can occur in the absence of selection for the assimilating phenotype, suggesting a role for the canalization heuristic |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=1106–1110 |year=2004 |pmid=15312082| doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00739.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; even when selection is only for developmental stability and not for a particular phenotype, and so the quantitative genetics models do not apply. These studies suggest that the canalisation heuristic may still be useful, beyond the more simple concept of robustness.

==Congruence hypothesis==

Neither canalisation nor robustness are simple quantities to quantify: it is always necessary to specify which trait is canalised (robust) to which perturbations. For example, perturbations can come either from the environment or [[mutational robustness|from mutations]]. It has been suggested that different perturbations have '''congruent''' effects on development taking place on an epigenetic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meiklejohn CD, Hartl DL |title=A single mode of canalization |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17 |pages=e9035 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02596-X |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-010X(20001015)288:3&lt;242::AID-JEZ5&gt;3.0.CO;2-O |vauthors=Ancel LW, Fontana W |title=Plasticity, evolvability, and modularity in RNA |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=288 |issue=3 |pages=242–283 |year=2000 |pmid=11069142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msp008 |vauthors=Szöllősi GJ, Derényi I |title=Congruent Evolution of Genetic and Environmental Robustness in Micro-RNA|journal=Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution|volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=867–874 |year=2009 |pmid=19168567 |arxiv=0810.2658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2411105 |vauthors=Wagner GP, Booth G, Bagheri-Chaichian H | title=A population genetic theory of canalization| journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=329–347|year=1997 |jstor=2411105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lehner B |last2=Lehner |first2=Ben |title=Genes Confer Similar Robustness to Environmental, Stochastic, and Genetic Perturbations in Yeast|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=468–473 |year=2010 |pmid=20140261 |pmc=2815791 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009035 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009035 |editor1-last=Polymenis |editor1-first=Michael|bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9035L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, however, depend on the molecular mechanism responsible for robustness, and be different in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.07.005 |author=Masel J Siegal ML |title=Robustness: mechanisms and consequences |journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=395–403 |year=2009 |pmid=19717203 |pmc=2770586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary capacitance==

The canalisation metaphor suggests that phenotypes are very robust to small perturbations, for which development does not exit the canal, and rapidly returns down, with little effect on the final outcome of development. But perturbations whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold will break out of the canal, moving the developmental process into uncharted territory. Strong robustness up to a limit, with little robustness beyond, is a pattern that could increase [[evolvability]] in a fluctuating environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel I, Matessi C |title=Canalization, genetic assimilation and preadaptation. A quantitative genetic model |journal=Genetics |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=2119–33 |year=1998 |pmid=9691063 |pmc=1460279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic canalisation could allow for [[evolutionary capacitance]], where genetic diversity outside the canal accumulates in a population over time, sheltered from [[natural selection]] because it does not normally affect phenotypes. This hidden diversity could then be unleashed by extreme changes in the environment or by molecular switches, releasing previously cryptic genetic variation that can then contribute to a rapid burst of evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">'''Caupolicán the Younger''' according to [[Juan Ignacio Molina]] was the son of the [[toqui]] [[Caupolicán]]. He was made toqui following the capture and execution of his father in 1558.  He continued the first [[Mapuche]] rising against the Spanish conquistadors in 1558 and commaned the Mapuche army in constructing a ''[[pukara]]'' at [[Quiapo, Chile|Quiapo]] to block [[García Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Cañete|García Hurtado de Mendoza]] from rebuilding a fort in [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]] completing the chain of forts for suppression of their rebellion.  In the [[Battle of Quiapo]] the Mapuche suffered a terrible defeat and there Caupolicán the younger died.  His successor as toqui was [[Illangulién]].

The earlier historian [[Diego de Rosales]] says the toqui that led at Quiapo was [[Lemucaguin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diego de Rosales]], '''“Historia General del Reino de Chile”, Flandes Indiano''', 3 tomos. Valparaíso 1877 - 1878.

The '''Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems''' ('''NeurIPS''', formerly called '''NIPS''')  is a [[machine learning]] and [[computational neuroscience]] [[Academic conference|conference]] held every December.  The conference is currently a double-track meeting (single-track until 2015) that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. 

== History ==
{{Machine learning bar}}
The NIPS meeting was first proposed in 1986 at the annual invitation-only Snowbird Meeting on [[Artificial neural network|Neural Networks]] for Computing organized by [[The California Institute of Technology]] and [[Bell Laboratories]].  NIPS was designed as a complementary open interdisciplinary meeting for researchers exploring biological and artificial [[Artificial neural network|Neural Networks]].  Reflecting this multidisciplinary approach, NIPS began in 1987 with information theorist [[Ed Posner]] as the conference president and learning theorist [[Yaser Abu-Mostafa]] and computational neurobiologist [[James M. Bower|James Bower]] as co-program chairman.  Research presented in the early NIPS meetings including a wide range of topics from efforts to solve purely engineering problems to the use of computer models as a tool for understanding biological nervous systems.  Since then, the biological and artificial systems research streams have diverged, and recent NIPS proceedings have been dominated by papers on [[machine learning]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[statistics]].

From 1987 until 2000 NIPS was held in [[Denver]], United States. Since then, the conference was held in [[Vancouver]], Canada (2001–2010), [[Granada]], Spain (2011), and [[Lake Tahoe]], United States (2012–2013). In 2014 and 2015, the conference was held in [[Montreal]], Canada, in Barcelona, Spain in 2016, and in Long Beach, United States in 2017.  Reflecting its origins at [[Snowbird, Utah]], the meeting was accompanied by workshops organized at a nearby ski resort up until 2013, when it outgrew ski resorts.

The NIPS Conference is organized by the NIPS Foundation, established by [[Ed Posner]] in 1987.  [[Terrence Sejnowski]] has been the president of the NIPS Foundation since 1993, when Posner had a bicycle accident. The board of trustees consists of previous general chairs of the NIPS Conference.

The [[proceedings]] from the conferences have been published in book form by [[Morgan Kaufmann]] (1987–1993), [[MIT Press]] (1994–2004) and Curran Associates (2005–present) under the name ''Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems''.

=== Name ===
Conference organizers considered abandoning the ''NIPS'' name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/08/13/organisers-of-ai-conference-nips-are-asking-people-whether-they-should-change-its-name/#4d68dc084da7|title=Organisers Of 'NIPS' AI Conference Ask Whether They Should Change Name|last=Shead|first=Sam|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of a slang connotation with the word ''nipples''. After a comment period and survey of 2270 conference participants, conference organizers decided to keep the name.&lt;ref name=officialNameChange&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nips.cc/public/NameChange|title=NIPS Name Change|website=NIPS Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hub.packtpub.com/nips-foundation-decides-against-name-change-as-poll-says-it-is-an-unpopular-superficial-move-instead-increases-focus-on-diversity-and-inclusivity-initiatives/|title=NIPS Foundation decides against name change|date=2018-10-24|work=Packt Hub|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the survey respondents, 1,881 were men and 294 were women. Of the women, 44% agreed a name change should occur and 40% disagreed. Of the men, 28% agreed a name change should occur and 55% disagreed.&lt;ref name=officialNameChange /&gt; However, on November 17th, 2018, the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation Board of Trustees decided to change the official acronym of the conference from NIPS to NeurIPS.

== Topics ==
[[File:Judea Pearl at NIPS 2013 (11781981594).jpg|thumb|[[Judea Pearl]] at his poster at the 2013 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.]]
The conference had 5,000 registered participants in 2016{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and 8,000 in 2017{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}, making it the largest conference in Artificial Intelligence{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}.  Besides machine learning and neuroscience, other fields represented at NIPS include [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], [[computer vision]], statistical [[linguistics]], and [[information theory]]. Although the 'Neural' in the NIPS acronym had become something of a historical relic, the resurgence of [[deep learning]] in neural networks since 2012, fueled by faster computers and big data, has led to impressive achievement in speech recognition, object recognition in images, image captioning, language translation and world championship performance in the game of Go, based on neural architectures inspired by the hierarchy of areas in the visual cortex (ConvNet) and reinforcement learning inspired by the basal ganglia (Temporal difference learning).
===Named lectures===
In addition to invited talks and symposia, NIPS also organizes two named lectureships to recognize distinguished researchers. The NIPS Board introduced the Posner Lectureship in honor of NIPS founder [[Ed Posner]]; two Posner Lectures were given each year up to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Vancouver 2010 - VideoLectures - VideoLectures.NET|url=http://videolectures.net/nips2010_vancouver/|website=videolectures.net|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past lecturers have included:
*2017 - [[John Platt (computer scientist)|John Platt]]
*2016 – [[Yann LeCun]]
*2015 – [[Zoubin Ghahramani]] and [[Vladimir Vapnik]]
*2014 – [[Michael Kearns (computer scientist)|Michael Kearns]] and [[John Hopfield]]

*2011 – [[Richard S. Sutton|Rich Sutton]] and [[Bernhard Scholkopf]]
*2010 – [[Josh Tenenbaum]] and [[Michael I. Jordan]]

In 2015, the NIPS Board introduced the Breiman Lectureship to highlight work in statistics relevant to conference topics. The lectureship was named for statistician [[Leo Breiman]], who served on the NIPS Board from 1994 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NIPS 2015 Conference|date=7 December 2015|publisher=Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation|page=10|url=https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/2015/NIPS-2015-Conference-Book.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past lecturers have included:

== The NIPS experiment ==
In NIPS 2014, the program chairs duplicated 10% of all submissions and sent them through separate reviewers to evaluate randomness in the reviewing process.&lt;ref name="lawrennd 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lawrence| first=Neil| title=The NIPS Experiment | website=Inverse Probability | date=2014-12-16  | url=http://inverseprobability.com/2014/12/16/the-nips-experiment/ | accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several researchers interpreted the result.&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fortnow | first=Lance | title=The NIPS Experiment | website=Computational Complexity | date=2014-12-18  | url=http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/12/the-nips-experiment.html | accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moody Rd 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hardt| first=Moritz | title=The NIPS Experiment | website=Moody Rd | date=2014-12-15  | url=http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html | accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding whether the decision in NIPS is completely random or not, [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]] writes: "Clearly not—a purely random decision would have arbitrariness of ~78%. It is, however, quite notable that 60% is much closer to 78% than 0%." He concludes that the result of the reviewing process is mostly arbitrary.&lt;ref name="Langford 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Langford | first=John | title=The NIPS Experiment | website=Communications of the ACM | date=2015-03-09  | url=http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/181996-the-nips-experiment/fulltext | accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''crime of Gádor''' was the name given to the kidnapping and subsequent murder of a seven-year-old boy by [[Francisco Leona]] in [[Gádor]], [[Almería]]. The purpose of the crime was to use the child's blood and body fat as a folk cure for a wealthy patron's tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jiménez Elizari |first=Iker |author-link=Iker Jiménez Elizari |title=El paraíso maldito |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=JiRSQ6HnVhQC&amp;pg=PA199 |chapter=Jáncanas y brujas: Señoras de la magia |chapter-url=https://books.google.es/books?id=JiRSQ6HnVhQC&amp;pg=PA185 |publisher=EDAF |date=April 6, 2006 |page=199 |isbn=9788441417724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Francisco Leona 02.jpg|thumb|Francisco Leona {{circa|1910}}]]
At the time, it was believed that drinking the [[human blood|blood]] of a human child and using their body fat as [[cataplasm]] was a remedy for [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Costa |first=Pedro |title=La vampira del carrer Ponent |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2006/01/01/eps/1136100421_850215.html |date=January 1, 2006 |access-date=March 27, 2018 |newspaper=[[El País]] |language=es |publisher=Ediciones El País, S.L. |editor-last=Caño |editor-first=Antonio |issn=0213-4608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco Ortega ''El Moruno'' (''The Moor'') had recently been diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and was desperately seeking a cure.&lt;ref name=SanzyDíaz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanz y Díaz |first=José |year=1984 |title=Etnografía negra. El crimen que dio lugar a la leyenda de "El Sacamantecas" |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/etnografia-negra-el-crimen-que-dio-lugar-a-la-leyenda-de-el-sacamantecas/ |pages=171–174 |magazine=Revista de Folklore |issue=47 |volume=4b |access-date=March 27, 2018 |location=Valladolid}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited the local [[curandera]] Agustina Rodriguez, who in turn sent for the barber and healer [[Francisco Leona]].&lt;ref name=SanzyDíaz/&gt; Leona, who also had a criminal record, agreed to cure Ortega in exchange for 3000  [[Spanish real|real]]es.&lt;ref name=SanzyDíaz/&gt;

Leona and Julio ''El Tonto'' (''The Fool'') Hernández, a son of Agustina the healer, offered to find a child. On the evening of June 27, 1910, Francisco Leona [[child abduction|kidnapped]] Bernardo Gonzalez Parra, a seven year old from [[Rioja, Almería|Rioja]], drugged him with [[chloroform]] and put him in a sack.{{sfn|Fernández Juárez|2008|p=22}}

== Murder ==
A brother of Julio "Tonto" Hernández, Joseph Hernández, was to advise the client Ortega, leaving his wife Elena to make dinner.

Little Bernardo's murder was as follows: after he was removed from the sack, dazed, Bernardo was stabbed in the [[heart]] by Leona, and Ortega mixed his blood with sugar and drank it.{{sfn|Fernández Juárez|2008|p=22}} After that they took the boy to a place known as [[Las Pocicas]] where Leona killed him, crushing his skull with a rock. Then he extracted [[human fat|fat]] and [[mesentery]] to make a compress to apply to Ortega's chest.

To finish the ritual, Bernardo's body was concealed in a crevice, unburied but covered with herbs and stones, located in Las Pocicas.

When distributing the actual 3000 Ortega paid him for his services, the healer Leona tried and failed to trick his accomplice ''Tonto'' Hernández. Realizing Leona's intentions, Hernández told the Civil Guard who had seen the body of a child while he was chasing [[partridge]]s.

== Judicial and police intervention ==
[[File:CottageAlm 01.jpg|thumb|Cortijo de San Patricio at present]]

As a subfield in [[artificial intelligence]], '''Diagnosis''' is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct.  If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing.  The computation is based on ''observations'', which provide information on the current behaviour.

The expression ''diagnosis'' also refers to the answer of the question of whether the system is malfunctioning or not, and to the process of computing the answer.  This word comes from the medical context where a [[diagnosis]] is the process of identifying a disease by its symptoms.

==Example==

An example of diagnosis is the process of a garage mechanic with an automobile.  The mechanic will first try to detect any abnormal behavior based on the observations on the car and his knowledge of this type of vehicle.  If he finds out that the behavior is abnormal, the mechanic will try to refine his diagnosis by using new observations and possibly testing the system, until he discovers the faulty component; the mechanic plays an important role in the vehicle diagnosis.

==Expert diagnosis==

The expert diagnosis (or diagnosis by [[expert system]]) is based on experience with the system.  Using this experience, a mapping is built that efficiently associates the observations to the corresponding diagnoses.

The experience can be provided:
* By a human operator.  In this case, the human knowledge must be translated into a computer language. 
* By examples of the system behaviour.  In this case, the examples must be classified as correct or faulty (and, in the latter case, by the type of fault).  [[Machine learning]] methods are then used to generalize from the examples.

The main drawbacks of these methods are:
* The difficulty acquiring the expertise.  The expertise is typically only available after a long period of use of the system (or similar systems). Thus, these methods are unsuitable for safety- or mission-critical systems (such as a nuclear power plant, or a robot operating in space).  Moreover, the acquired expert knowledge can never be guaranteed to be complete.  In case a previously unseen behaviour occurs, leading to an unexpected observation, it is impossible to give a diagnosis.
* The [[complexity]] of the learning.  The off-line process of building an expert system can require a large amount of time and computer memory.
* The size of the final expert system.  As the expert system aims to map any observation to a diagnosis, it will in some cases require a huge amount of storage space.
* The lack of [[wikt:robust|robustness]]. If even a small modification is made on the system, the process of constructing the expert system must be repeated.

A slightly different approach is to build an expert system from a model of the system rather than directly from an expertise.  An example is the computation of a [[Diagnoser (Sampath)|diagnoser]] for the diagnosis of [[discrete event systems]].  This approach can be seen as model-based, but it benefits from some advantages and suffers some drawbacks of the expert system approach.

==Model-based diagnosis==

Model-based diagnosis is an example of [[abductive reasoning]] using a [[model (abstract)|model]] of the system.  In general, it works as follows:

[[File:principle-diagnosis.png|600px|center|Principle of the model-based diagnosis]]

We have a model that describes the behaviour of the system (or artefact).  The model is an abstraction of the behaviour of the system and can be incomplete.  In particular, the faulty behaviour is generally little-known, and the faulty model may thus not be represented.  Given observations of the system, the diagnosis system simulates the system using the model, and compares the observations actually made to the observations predicted by the simulation.

The modelling can be simplified by the following rules (where &lt;math&gt;Ab\,&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Ab''normal predicate):

&lt;math&gt;\neg Ab(S) \Rightarrow Int1 \wedge Obs1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Ab(S) \Rightarrow Int2 \wedge Obs2&lt;/math&gt; (fault model)

The semantics of these formulae is the following: if the behaviour of the system is not abnormal (i.e. if it is normal), then the internal (unobservable) behaviour will be &lt;math&gt;Int1\,&lt;/math&gt; and the observable behaviour &lt;math&gt;Obs1\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Otherwise, the internal behaviour will be &lt;math&gt;Int2\,&lt;/math&gt; and the observable behaviour &lt;math&gt;Obs2\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Given the observations &lt;math&gt;Obs\,&lt;/math&gt;, the problem is to determine whether the system behaviour is normal or not (&lt;math&gt;\neg Ab(S)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Ab(S)\,&lt;/math&gt;).  This is an example of [[abductive reasoning]].

==Diagnosability==

A system is said to be '''diagnosable''' if whatever the behavior of the system, we will be able to determine without ambiguity a unique diagnosis.

The problem of diagnosability is very important when designing a system because on one hand one may want to reduce the number of sensors to reduce the cost, and on the other hand one may want to increase the number of sensors to increase the probability of detecting a faulty behavior.

Several algorithms for dealing with these problems exist. One class of algorithms answers the question whether a system is diagnosable; another class looks for sets of sensors that make the system diagnosable, and optionally comply to criteria such as cost optimization.

The diagnosability of a system is generally computed from the model of the system. In applications using model-based diagnosis, such a model is already present and doesn't need to be built from scratch.

'''Diwanus''' (also ''Diwan'', ''Diwane'') was the leader (''capitaneus'') of the [[Bartians]], one of the [[Old Prussians|Prussian clans]], during the [[Great Prussian Uprising]] (1260–1274) against the [[Teutonic Knights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=William |last=Urban |title=The Prussian Crusade |publisher=Lithuanian Research and Studies Center |location=Chicago, Illinois |year=2000 |edition=2nd |page=273 |isbn=0-929700-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was son of Kleckis ([[Old Prussian]]: ''bear'') and therefore is sometimes referred to by a nickname derived from the word ''bear''.&lt;ref name=zi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Ivinskis | first=Zenonas | editor= Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Divanas | year=1937 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=6 | location=Kaunas | page=1084 |language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first major victory came when [[Sępopol|Schippenbeil]] fell in 1263 after almost three years of siege. Twenty knights and their men sallied out to fight the joint forces of Batians and [[Sudovians]] in an open battle. However, the pagans blocked escape routes and all Teutons were killed.&lt;ref name=u&gt;Urban, William. ''The Prussian Crusade'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of knights killed, it was one of the top ten losses by the Teutonic Knights during the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Tomas |last=Baranauskas |authorlink=Tomas Baranauskas | url=http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=10760927 |title=Ar priminsime Europai apie Šiaulių mūšį? | publisher=Delfi.lt | date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2007-07-12|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garrison at Schippenbeil was left with too few soldiers and supplies to withstand the siege and escaped through [[Galindians|Galindia]] to [[Masovia]]. Diwanus expected that fugitives would take a shorter route north to [[Balga]] or [[Königsberg]], therefore the knights had a [[head start (positioning)|head start]]. Diwanus soon learned about the true route and, with a handful of his best men, hurried to pursue the fugitives. During a charge on the escapees, Bartians killed three knights, but Diwanus was seriously injured.&lt;ref name=u/&gt; 

Since all major Teutonic castles in Bartia fell, Bartians did not have the need to safeguard their land from potential attacks from Teutonic strongholds. They were free to send men to help other Prussian clans. Diwanus and his men were making minor expeditions into [[Pogesanians|Pogesania]] and [[Chełmno Land]]. In 1271, a major campaign was organized together with Pogesanian leader Linko.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; The Bartian infantry and Pogesanians besieged a border castle, but were fended off by the Knights from [[Dzierzgoń|Christburg]]. The Prussians, who managed to escape, joined their cavalry while the Knights set up their camp on the opposite bank of the [[Dzierzgoń River]], blocking the route home. When Christians retired for the night, one half of the Prussian army crossed the river in a distance, in order to attack the Knights from the rear, while the other half charged straight across the river. The Knights were encircled.&lt;ref name=u2&gt;Urban, William. ''The Prussian Crusade'', pp. 326–327.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Paganstin]] saw twelve knights and 500 men killed. The Prussians immediately assaulted Christburg and almost captured it. The Prussians were still looting the surrounding area when cavalry from [[Elbląg|Elbing]] arrived. Many of the Prussian infantry perished while cavalry escaped. Despite these losses, Diwanus was soon back and blocked roads leading to Christburg hoping to starve the castle. Three times the Knights tried to send supplies to the castle via the Dzierzgoń River, and each time the vessels were intercepted by the Bartians. However, Christburg refused to surrender.&lt;ref name=u2/&gt; 

In 1273, Diwanus brought 800 men for a siege on [[Wąbrzeźno|Schönsee]].&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; The small outpost had only three knights and a handful of sergeants. Diwanus tried to persuade them to surrender, but they refused and tried to hide their true strength by dressing every soldier as a noble knight. When Bartians attacked, brother Arnold shot and killed Diwanus.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, William. ''The Prussian Crusade'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bartians, left without a leader, returned home. They withdrew from the uprising, and within a year the war was lost.

According to its [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], size and other properties, most forms of gametogamy are as follows:

*'''[[Isogamy]]''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ισο -  ''iso''= "equal  + γάμος ''gámos'' = "marriage") – in [[cell biology]] – is a type  of [[sexual reproduction]] that includes [[gamete]]s of similar morphological similar shape and size,  with difference  in general only in [[genom]] content and  [[gene expression]] in one or more [[mating-type region]]s. Both gametes look alike, and they cannot be classified as "[[male]]" or "[[female]]."  Actually, organisms characterized as  isogametic have different [[mating type]]s, most commonly noted as "+" and "&amp;minus;" strains, although in some species there are more than two mating types (designated by numbers or letters). Izogamic [[fertilization]] includes  two  gametes fusion, when  different mating types form a [[zygote]]. &lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell  N. A.  et al.|year=2008|title=Biology. 8th Ed. |publisher=Person International Edition, San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-53616-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Heterogamy]]''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ἕτερος ''heteros'' =  "other, another" + γάμος ''gámos'' = "marriage") – in [[cell biology]] – is a synonym  of [[anisogamy]], involving  differently sized male and female [[gamete]]s produced by different sexes or mating types in a [[species]].

*'''[[Apogamy]]'''  ([[Ancient Greek]] αρο - ''apo''  = from, of +  γάμος ''gámos'') – in [[botany]] –  is defined as a replacement of normal [[sexual reproduction]] by [[asexual reproduction | asexual propagation]], without [[fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46760#page/313/mode/1up|author=Winkler, H.|year=1908|title=Über Parthenogenesis und Apogamie im Pflanzenreich|volume=2|issue=3|journal=Progressus Rei Botanicae|pages=293–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruits can be developed without [[fertilization]]. In this case, [[embryo]]  occurs without fertilization or without the presence of [[pollen]] . A special form of apogamia  is when the embryo  develops klijavo seed. It is the phenomenon called [[parthenogenesis]]. So, fruits contain seeds, which although not fertilized, maintaining viability. In this case the embryo or germ arises from unfertilized [[oocyte]]. This phenomenon is widespread example  in  [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s. 
From such seeds develop plants whose features are identical properties of  mothers from which  the seed was taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2949">In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], '''hybrid seed''' is used produced by  [[pollination|cross-pollinated]] [[plant]]s. Hybrid seed production is predominant in modern agriculture and home gardening. It is one of the main contributors to the dramatic rise in agricultural output during the last half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving Corn; based on "Hybrid Corn", published in the Yearbook of Agriculture, 1962 |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/timeline/corn.htm |accessdate=14 December 2014 |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternatives to hybridization are [[open pollination]] and clonal propagation.&lt;ref name=stpt/&gt;

All of the hybrid seeds planted by the farmer will produce similar plants, while the seeds of the next generation from those hybrids will not consistently have the desired characteristics. Controlled hybrids provide very uniform characteristics because they are produced by crossing two [[inbred]] strains. Elite inbred strains are used that express well-documented and consistent [[phenotype]]s (such as high [[crop yield]]) that are relatively good for inbred plants.&lt;ref name=stpt&gt;{{cite book |title=Seeds: Trade, Production and Technology |url=http://www.seedconsortium.org/PUC/pdf%20files/23-Vegetable%20Hybrid%20Seed%20Production.pdf |author=David Tay |chapter=Vegetable Hybrid Seed Production |pages=128–139 |year=n.d. |publisher=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids are chosen to improve the characteristics of the resulting plants, such as better yield, greater uniformity, improved color, [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]].
An important factor is the [[heterosis]] or ''combining ability'' of the parent plants. Crossing any particular pair of inbred strains may or may not result in superior offspring. The parent strains used are therefore carefully chosen so as to achieve the uniformity that comes from the uniformity of the parents, and the superior performance that comes from heterosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Internet traffic engineering''' is defined as that aspect of [[Internet]] network [[engineering]] dealing with the issue of performance evaluation and performance optimization of operational [[IP networks]]. Traffic engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and control of Internet traffic [RFC-2702, AWD2].

Enhancing the performance of an operational [[Computer network|network]], at both traffic and resource levels, are major objectives of Internet engineering. This is accomplished by addressing traffic performance requirements, while utilizing network economically and reliably. Traffic oriented performance includes [[packet transfer delay]], [[packet delay variation]], [[packet loss]], and [[throughput]].

An important objective of Internet traffic engineering is to facilitate reliable network operations [RFC-2702]. This can be done by providing mechanisms that network integrity and by embracing policies emphasizing survivability. This results in a minimization of the network to service outages arising from errors, faults and failures occurring within the infrastructure.

The Internet exists in order to transfer information from nodes to [[destination node]]s.  Accordingly, one of the most crucial functions performed by the Internet is the routing of traffic [[ingress node]]s to [[egress node]]s.

Ultimately, it is the performance of the network as seen by network services that is truly paramount. This crucial function should be considered throughout the development of engineering mechanisms and policies. The characteristics visible to end users are the emergent properties of the network, which are characteristics of the network when viewed as a whole. A goal of the service provider, therefore, is to enhance the properties of the network while taking economic considerations into account.

The importance of the above observation regarding the properties of networks is that special care must be taken when choosing network performance metrics to optimize. Optimizing the wrong metrics may achieve certain local objectives, but may have repercussions elsewhere.

'''James Bumphrey''' (4 May 1884 – after 1919) was an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who played 136 games and scored 7 goals in [[the Football League]] for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=Matthews76&gt;{{cite book |first=Tony |last=Matthews |title=Birmingham City: A Complete Record |year=1995 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |isbn=978-1-85983-010-9 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joyce |first=Michael |title=Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939 |publisher=SoccerData (Tony Brown) |location=Nottingham |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-899468-67-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumphrey was born in [[Morpeth, Northumberland]], and played for Ashington Alliance before joining Birmingham in August 1908. A heavily built man, he was a strong tackler, though "a little wild", and headed the ball well despite being only {{height|ft=5|in=8}} tall.&lt;ref name=Matthews76/&gt; He made his debut in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] on 31 December 1908, playing at [[inside forward|inside left]] in a 1–1 draw away to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p.&amp;nbsp;155.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next couple of seasons he played sporadically, always in the forward line, until becoming a regular in the side at [[wing half]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He made 143 appearances in all competitions for Birmingham in seven years, before moving back to his native north-east when the Football League suspended during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Matthews76/&gt;

During the First World War, he served in the [[Royal Navy]] from 1917–19, serving aboard {{HMS|Princess Royal|1911|6}}.&lt;ref name="navy"&gt;James Bumphrey; Birth Date: 4 May 1884; Birth Place: Morpeth Northumberland; ''UK, Royal Navy Registers of Seamen's Services, 1848-1939''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] '''Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (6 June 1768 – 5 May 1831) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]]. As a junior officer he saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in April 1782 during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He commanded {{HMS|Stag|1794|6}} at the [[Action of 22 August 1795|defeat of the Dutch fleet]] in August 1795 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and went on to be [[First Sea Lord|First Naval Lord]] during the closing stages of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

==Family and early life==
Yorke was born in [[Berkhamsted|Great Berkhampstead]], Hertfordshire, on 6 June 1768, the second son, by his second marriage, of the politician [[Charles Yorke]].&lt;ref name="United Service"&gt;{{cite book |last= |title=United Service Magazine |pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the navy at the age of 11, becoming a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}}, then under the command of [[Sir Charles Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Douglas]], on 15 February 1780. He followed Douglas to his next command, {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}}, which flew the flag of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|George Rodney]].&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;  Yorke was then present at Rodney's victory over [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse]] at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] from 9 April to 12 April 1782. The end of the American Revolutionary War led to the ''Formidable'' returning to Britain to be paid off. Yorke remained in employment however, transferring with Douglas to {{HMS|Assistance|1747|6}}, and then moving to {{HMS|Salisbury|1769|6}}, under the command of Sir [[Erasmus Gower]], filling the post of [[master's mate]].  Yorke spent three years in total serving on the [[Newfoundland Station]].&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;

==Promotions==
Yorke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 16 June 1789, and moved aboard the 50-gun {{HMS|Adamant|1780|6}} to serve under Admiral [[Sir Richard Hughes, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Hughes]].&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; He later served as lieutenant aboard {{HMS|Thisbe|1783|6}} and {{HMS|Victory}} and in February 1791 he was appointed master and commander of the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Rattlesnake|1791|6}}. He remained aboard her, carrying out cruises into the [[English Channel]] until the outbreak of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]] with France in 1793. He was promoted to [[Post-Captain]] on 4 February 1793 and given command of the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Circe|1785|6}}, then part of a squadron under Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]]. He patrolled off the French port of [[Brest, France|Brest]], and captured the [[corvette]] ''L'Espiegle''.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;

[[File:Defeat of the Dutch Fleet off Egero, 22 August 1795.jpg|thumb|left|''Defeat of the Dutch Fleet off Egerö, 22 August 1795'', [[Nicholas Pocock]], 1795; Yorke took part in the action]]
Yorke moved to {{HMS|Stag|1794|6}} in July 1794, and continued to serve in the Channel, occasionally ranging into the [[North Sea]]. On 22 August 1795 the ''Stag'' and a small British squadron chased two large ships and a [[cutter (ship)|cutter]], eventually bringing the sternmost one to battle. [[Action of 22 August 1795|An hour-long fight]] ensued, after which the enemy, subsequently found to be the [[Batavian Republic|Batavian]] frigate ''Alliance'', was forced to surrender.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; Yorke moved to command the newly built {{HMS|Jason|1800|6}} in March 1800, and by 1801 was in command of the 74-gun [[third rate]] {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}}. He commanded her until the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802 brought a period of temporary peace.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; On the resumption of the war in 1803 Yorke was appointed to the 98-gun {{HMS|Prince George|1772|6}}, followed by {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|6}} and then {{HMS|Christian VII|1807|6}}, an 80-gun former Danish ship captured at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]] in 1807.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;

==Knighthood and flag rank==
Yorke was knighted during this period of service, on 21 April 1805, by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15809|page=683|date=21 May 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April, Yorke was present at the installation of the [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]], standing in for his brother, [[Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]], [[Earl of Hardwicke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15800|page=550|date=23 April 1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was at this time [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and so was unable to be present in person.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; In 1810 Joseph Yorke's brother, [[Charles Philip Yorke]] became [[Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] and Joseph was transferred from command of the ''Christian VII'' to take up a seat on the [[Board of Admiralty]].&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;

Joseph Yorke was promoted to [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral of the Blue]] on 31 July 1810 and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun {{HMS|Vengeance|1774|6}} in January 1811.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; He sailed to the [[Tagus]] carrying reinforcements for [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley's]] army, fighting in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; After carrying this out he escorted a fleet returning to Britain from the [[East Indies]]. Yorke was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the White on 12 August 1812,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16632|page=1584|date=11 August 1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear-Admiral of the Red on 4 December 1813&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16821|page=2432|date=4 December 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice-Admiral of the Blue on 14 June 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16906|page=1187|date=7 June 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[First Sea Lord|First Naval Lord]] in the [[Liverpool ministry]] from October 1813 until May 1816&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; but remained on the Admiralty Board until April 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sainty, JC, ''Lord High Admiral and Commissioners of the Admiralty 1660–1870, Office-Holders in Modern Britain: Volume 4: Admiralty Officials 1660–1870'' (1975), pp. 18–31.|url=http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16652| accessdate =4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the restructuring of that order in January 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16972|page=19|date=4 January 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted Vice-Admiral of the White on 12 August 1819,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17505|page=1446|date=12 August 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to Admiral of the Blue on 22 July 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18709|page=1539|date=23 July 1830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
Yorke stood as a candidate for the constituency of [[Reigate (UK Parliament constituency)|Reigate]] in 1790, and was returned as its [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|member]].&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13217|page=433|date=10 July 1790}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented the borough&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15497|page=747|date=13 July 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1806, when he was elected as member for [[St Germans (UK Parliament constituency)|St Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15976|page=1506|date=18 November 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stood aside, "taking the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]]" in 1810 so that his brother, Charles Philip Yorke, could be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16366|page=644|date=1 May 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1812|1812 general election]] Joseph Yorke stood as a candidate for [[Sandwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Sandwich]] and was returned as its member.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; He represented the borough until 1818 when he was re-elected to the Reigate constituency, which he represented until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18719|page=1783|date=20 August 1830}}&lt;br /&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18802|page=901|date=10 May 1831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yorke's business interests include the chairmanship of the Waterloo Bridge Company.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;

==Family and personal life==
On 29 March 1798, Yorke married Elizabeth Weake Rattray, the daughter of James Rattray, in Ireland. The couple had a number of children before Elizabeth's death on 20 January 1812.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; His eldest son, [[Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke|Charles Yorke]] also served in the navy, rising to the rank of admiral, and on the death without heir of Joseph Yorke's brother Philip, the 3rd Earl of Hardwicke in 1834, Charles became the 4th Earl. His daughter Agneta Elizabeth Yorke married the banker [[Robert Cooper Lee Bevan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bevan, Robert Cooper Lee (1809–1890)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47420|website=ODNB|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 1813, Joseph married a second time, to Urania Anne, the [[Earl of Clanricarde|Dowager Marchioness of Clanricarde]], and daughter of [[George Paulet, 12th Marquess of Winchester]], at St. Martin in the Fields, Westminster, London. The marriage did not produce any children.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;

==Death==
On 5 May 1831 Yorke was returning from visiting [[Henry Hotham]]'s [[flagship]], {{HMS|St Vincent|1815|6}}, then moored at [[Spithead]]. He was making his way back to shore aboard the yacht ''Catherine'', in company with Captains Matthew Barton Bradby and Thomas Young, and a seaman named John Chandler, when the boat was struck by lightning in [[Stokes Bay]], causing it to capsize.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laughton, ''ODNB''&lt;/ref&gt; All aboard were drowned. The bodies were later recovered and an inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt; Yorke was buried at the family tomb in the parish church at [[Wimpole]], close to [[Wimpole Estate|Wimpole Hall]], the seat of the Earls of Hardwicke.&lt;ref name="United Service"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YorkeDeaths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpole.info/yorke_deaths.htm#jsy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17809">'''Le Châtelier's principle''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|l|ə|_|ʃ|æ|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|j|eɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|t|əl|j|eɪ}}), also called '''Châtelier's principle''' or "The Equilibrium Law", can be used to predict the effect of a change in conditions on some [[chemical equilibrium|chemical equilibria]]. The principle is named after [[Henry Louis Le Châtelier]] and sometimes [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] who discovered it independently. It can be stated as:

:When any system at equilibrium for a long period of time is subjected to change in [[concentration]], [[temperature]], [[volume]], or [[pressure]], then the system readjusts itself to partly counteract the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established. But the new equilibrium wasn’t the same old equilibrium.

In other words, whenever a system in equilibrium is disturbed the system will adjust itself in such a way that the effect of the change will be reduced or moderated.

This principle has a variety of names, depending upon the discipline using it (see [[homeostasis]], a term commonly used in [[biology]]). It is common to take Le Châtelier's principle to be a more general observation,&lt;ref name="Systemantics"&gt;{{cite book | quote = ''The System always kicks back'' | first = John | last = Gall | title = The Systems Bible | edition = 3rd | publisher = General Systemantics Press | year = 2002 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly stated:

:''Any change in [[status quo]] prompts an opposing reaction in the responding system''.

In [[chemistry]], the principle is used to manipulate the outcomes of reversible reactions, often to increase the [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] of reactions. In [[pharmacology]], the binding of [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] to the receptor may shift the equilibrium according to Le Châtelier's principle, thereby explaining the diverse phenomena of receptor activation and desensitization.&lt;ref name="Bio-balance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-balance.com/Graphics.htm|title=The Biophysical Basis for the Graphical Representations|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], the principle has been generalized to help explain the [[Economic equilibrium|price equilibrium]] of efficient economic systems. In simultaneous equilibrium systems, phenomena that are in apparent contradiction to Le Châtelier's principle can occur; these can be resolved by the theory of [[response reactions]].

==Status as a physical law==
Le Châtelier's principle describes the qualitative behavior of systems where there is an externally induced, instantaneous change in one parameter of a system; it states that a behavioural shift occurs in the system so as to oppose (partly cancel) the parameter change. The duration of adjustment depends on the strength of the [[negative feedback]] to the initial [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]]. Where a shock initially induces [[positive feedback]] (such as [[thermal runaway]]), the new equilibrium can be far from the old one, and can take a long time to reach. In [[Dynamical systems theory#Chaos theory|some dynamic systems]], the end-state cannot be determined from the shock. The principle is typically used to describe closed negative-feedback systems, but applies, in general, to thermodynamically closed and isolated systems in nature, since the [[Second law of thermodynamics#Energy dispersal|second law of thermodynamics]] ensures that the [[Disequilibrium (thermodynamics)|disequilibrium]] caused by an instantaneous shock must have a finite [[Half-life#Half-life in non-exponential decay|half-life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Application of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and Le Châtelier's Principle to the Developing Ecosystem |quote= ''As systems are moved away from equilibrium, they will utilize all available avenues to counter the applied gradients''... Le Châtelier's principle is an example of this equilibrium seeking principle. |origyear= 1999 |first= J. J. |last= Kay  |title= Handbook of Ecosystem Theories and Management |series= Environmental &amp; Ecological (Math) Modeling |editor1-first= F. |editor1-last= Muller |publisher= CRC Press |date=February 2000 |isbn= 978-1-56670-253-9 }}&lt;br/&gt;'''''For full details, see''''': {{cite paper | citeseerx = 10.1.1.11.856 | title = Ecosystems as Self-organizing Holarchic Open Systems: Narratives and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has analogs throughout the entire physical world.

The principle while well rooted in chemical equilibrium and extended into economic theory, can also be used in describing mechanical systems in that the system put under stress will respond in a way such as to reduce or minimize that stress. Moreover, the response will generally be via the mechanism that most easily relieves that stress. Shear pins and other such sacrificial devices are design elements that protect systems against stress applied in undesired manners to relieve it so as to prevent more extensive damage to the entire system, a practical engineering application of Le Châtelier's principle.

==Chemistry==

===Effect of change in concentration===
Changing the concentration of a chemical will shift the equilibrium to the side that would reduce that change in concentration. The chemical system will attempt to partly oppose the change affected to the original state of equilibrium. In turn, the rate of reaction, extent, and yield of products will be altered corresponding to the impact on the system.

This can be illustrated by the equilibrium of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]] gas, reacting to form [[methanol]].

:[[Carbon|C]][[Oxygen|O]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;#8652; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH

Suppose we were to increase the concentration of CO in the system. Using Le Châtelier's principle, we can predict that the amount of methanol will increase, decreasing the total change in CO. If we are to add a species to the overall reaction, the reaction will favor the side opposing the addition of the species. Likewise, the subtraction of a species would cause the reaction to "fill the gap" and favor the side where the species was reduced. This observation is supported by the [[collision theory]]. As the concentration of CO is increased, the frequency of successful collisions of that reactant would increase also, allowing for an increase in forward reaction, and generation of the product. Even if the desired product is not [[thermodynamic]]ally favored, the end-product can be obtained if it is continuously removed from the [[solution]].

The effect of a change in concentration is often exploited synthetically for [[Condensation reaction|condensation reactions]] (i.e., reactions that extrude water) that are equilibrium processes (e.g., formation of an [[ester]] from carboxylic acid and alcohol or an [[imine]] from an amine and aldehyde).  This can be achieved by physically sequestering water, by adding desiccants like anhydrous magnesium sulfate or molecular sieves, or by continuous removal of water by distillation, often facilitated by a [[Dean–Stark apparatus|Dean-Stark apparatus]].

===Effect of change in temperature===
The effect of changing the temperature in the equilibrium can be made clear by 1) incorporating heat as either a reactant or a product, and 2) assuming that an increase in temperature increases the heat content of a system. When the reaction is [[exothermic]] (Δ''H'' is negative, puts energy out), heat is included as a product, and, when the reaction is [[endothermic]] (Δ''H'' is positive, takes energy in), heat is included as a reactant. Hence, whether increasing or decreasing the temperature would favor the forward or the reverse reaction can be determined by applying the same principle as with concentration changes.

Take, for example, the [[reversible reaction]] of [[nitrogen]] gas with [[hydrogen]] gas to form [[ammonia]]:

:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) &amp;#8652; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Δ''H'' = -92 [[Kilojoule|kJ]] mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

Because this reaction is exothermic, it produces heat:

:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) &amp;#8652; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + ''heat''

If the temperature was increased, the heat content of the system would increase, so the system would consume some of that heat by shifting the equilibrium to the left, thereby producing less ammonia. More ammonia would be produced if the reaction was run at a lower temperature, but a lower temperature also lowers the rate of the process, so, in practice (the [[Haber process]]) the temperature is set at a compromise value that allows [[ammonia]] to be made at a reasonable rate with an equilibrium concentration that is not too unfavorable.

In [[exothermic reaction]]s, increase in temperature decreases the [[equilibrium constant]], ''K'', whereas, in [[endothermic reaction]]s, increase in temperature increases the K value.

Le Châtelier's principle applied to changes in concentration or pressure can be understood by having ''K'' have a constant value.  The effect of temperature on equilibria, however, involves a change in the equilibrium constant.  The dependence of ''K'' on temperature is determined by the sign of Δ''H''. The theoretical basis of this dependence is given by the [[Van 't Hoff equation]].

[[File:NO2-N2O4.jpg|thumb|The value of K changes with temperature. In the endothermic reaction N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(g) &amp;#8652; 2NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g), the equilibrium position can be shifted by changing the temperature. When heat is added and the temperature increases, the reaction shifts to the right and the flask turns reddish brown due to an increase in NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When heat is removed and the temperature decreases, the reaction shifts to the left and flask turns colorless due to an increase in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This demonstrates Le Châtelier’s Principle because the equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes energy.]]

===Effect of change in pressure===

The equilibrium concentrations of the products and reactants do not directly depend on the [[total pressure]] of the system. They may depend on the [[partial pressure]]s of the products and reactants, but if the number of moles of gaseous reactants is equal to the number of moles of gaseous products, pressure has no effect on equilibrium.

Changing total pressure by adding an inert gas at constant volume does not affect the equilibrium concentrations (see [[#Effect of adding an inert gas|§Effect of adding an inert gas]] below).

Changing total pressure by changing the volume of the system changes the partial pressures of the products and reactants and can affect the equilibrium concentrations (see [[#Effect of change in volume|§Effect of change in volume]] below).

===Effect of change in volume===
Changing the volume of the system changes the partial pressures of the products and reactants and can affect the equilibrium concentrations.  With a pressure increase due to a decrease in volume, the side of the equilibrium with fewer moles is more favorable&lt;ref name=Atkins-1993-p114&gt;{{harvnb|Atkins1993|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with a pressure decrease due to an increase in volume, the side with more moles is more favorable.  There is no effect on a reaction where the number of moles of gas is the same on each side of the chemical equation.

Considering the reaction of nitrogen gas with hydrogen gas to form ammonia:

:{{underset|4 moles|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} &amp;#8652; {{underset|2 moles|2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ΔH = -92kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

Note the number of [[mole (unit)|moles]] of gas on the left-hand side and the number of moles of gas on the right-hand side. When the volume of the system is changed, the partial pressures of the gases change. If we were to decrease pressure by increasing volume, the equilibrium of the above reaction will shift to the left, because the reactant side has a greater number of moles than does the product side. The system tries to counteract the decrease in partial pressure of gas molecules by shifting to the side that exerts greater pressure. Similarly, if we were to increase pressure by decreasing volume, the equilibrium shifts to the right, counteracting the pressure increase by shifting to the side with fewer moles of gas that exert less pressure. If the volume is increased because there are more moles of gas on the reactant side, this change is more significant in the denominator of the [[equilibrium constant]] expression, causing a shift in equilibrium.
&lt;!-- If we take the above reaction at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP), &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; would be as follow:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{{[NH_3]} ^2} {{[N_2]}^1 {[H_2]}^3}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{{(12)} ^2} {{(4)}^1 {(2)}^3}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=1.125&lt;/math&gt;

If we double the pressure of the above situation, by halving the volume of both sides then &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt; would now be as follow:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{{[NH_3]} ^2} {{[N_2]}^1 {[H_2]}^3}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\frac{{(6)} ^2} {{(2)}^1 {(1)}^3}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=18&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

===Effect of adding an inert gas===
{{See also|#Effect of change in pressure}}
An [[Inert gas|inert]] gas (or [[noble gas]]), such as [[helium]], is one that does not react with other elements or compounds.  Adding an inert gas into a gas-phase equilibrium at constant volume does not result in a shift.&lt;ref name=Atkins-1993-p114/&gt; This is because the addition of a non-reactive gas does not change the equilibrium equation, as the inert gas appears on both sides of the chemical reaction equation.  For example, if A and B react to form C and D, but X does not participate in the reaction: &lt;chem&gt;\mathit{a}A{} + \mathit{b}B{} + \mathit{x}X &lt;=&gt; \mathit{c}C{} + \mathit{d}D{} + \mathit{x}X&lt;/chem&gt;. While it is true that the total pressure of the system increases, the total pressure does not have any effect on the equilibrium constant; rather, it is a change in partial pressures that will cause a shift in the equilibrium. If, however, the volume is allowed to increase in the process, the partial pressures of all gases would be decreased resulting in a shift towards the side with the greater number of moles of gas. The shift will never occur on the side with less moles of gas.

===Effect of a catalyst===
A [[catalyst]] increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the reaction.  The use of a catalyst does not affect the position and composition of the equilibrium of a reaction, because both the forward and backward reactions are sped up by the same factor.

For example, consider the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;):

:N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇌ 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In the above reaction, iron (Fe) and molybdenum (Mo) will function as catalysts if present. They will accelerate any reactions, but they do not affect the state of the equilibrium.

==General statements related to Le Châtelier's principle==

For thermodynamics, when complicated equilibria are considered, it has turned out to be difficult or unfeasible to make valid and very general statements that echo Le Châtelier's principle.&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), ''Classical Thermodynamics'', translated by E.S. Halberstadt, Wiley–Interscience, London, {{ISBN|0-471-62430-6}}, pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954). ''Chemical Thermodynamics'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, pp. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; Prigogine &amp; Defay demonstrate that a thermodynamic system may or may not exhibit moderation, depending upon exactly what conditions are imposed after the perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954). ''Chemical Thermodynamics'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Châtelier's principle refers to thermodynamic equilibria, which are [[Mechanical equilibrium|stable]], and mostly does not apply to metastable and unstable equilibria.

==Applications in economics==
In economics, a similar concept also named after Le Châtelier was introduced by U.S. economist [[Paul Samuelson]] in 1947. There the generalized Le Châtelier principle is for a maximum condition of [[economic equilibrium]]: Where all unknowns of a function are independently variable, [[Constraint (mathematics)|auxiliary constraints]]—"just-binding" in leaving initial equilibrium unchanged—reduce the response to a parameter change. Thus, factor-demand and commodity-supply [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] are hypothesized to be lower in the short run than in the long run because of the fixed-cost constraint in the short run.&lt;ref name="PaulS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Samuelson|first=Paul A|title=Foundations of Economic Analysis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-31301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[The Survivor (Star Trek: The Animated Series)|The Survivor]]", McCoy mentions he has a daughter, Joanna.

In the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 ''Star Trek'' film]], which takes place in an "alternate, parallel" reality,&lt;ref name="bglobe1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/05/05/a_fresh_frontier/|title=Star Trek|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-05-06|date=2009-05-05|first=Ty|last=Burr|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCoy and Kirk become friends at [[Starfleet Academy]], which McCoy joins after a divorce that he says "left [him] nothing but [his] bones." This line, improvised by Urban,&lt;ref&gt;''Star Trek'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt; explains how McCoy earned the nickname ''Bones''. McCoy later helps get Kirk posted aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. He later becomes the chief medical officer after Doctor Puri is killed during an attack by Nero. McCoy remains aboard to see the ''Enterprise'' defeat Nero and his crew, with Kirk becoming the commanding officer of the ship.

''[[The Guardian]]'' called Urban's portrayal of McCoy in the 2009 film an "unqualified success",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/apr/21/star-trek|title=JJ Abrams's Star Trek: we have liftoff|accessdate=2009-04-22|first=Phil|last=Hoad|date=2009-04-21 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the character "wild-eyed and funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/movies/08trek.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=A Franchise Goes Boldly Backward|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=2009-05-08|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] said Urban came closer than the other actors to impersonating a character's original depiction.&lt;ref name="slatereview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2217854/|title=Go See Star Trek|last=Stevens|first=Dana|date=2009-05-06|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Kelley had worked with ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] on previous [[television pilot]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/cast/bio/69074.html|title=DeForest Kelley profile at Startrek.com|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was Roddenberry's first choice to play the doctor aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']].&lt;ref name="insidestartrek152"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H. Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=June 1997|page=152|isbn=0-671-00974-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the rejected pilot "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]" (1964), Roddenberry went with [[television director|director]] [[Robert Butler (director)|Robert Butler]]'s choice of [[John Hoyt]] to play Dr. Philip Boyce.&lt;ref name="insidestartrek37"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H.

Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=June 1997|page=75|isbn=0-671-00974-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Roddenberry wanted Kelley to play the character of ship's doctor, he did not put Kelley's name forward to [[NBC]]; the network never "rejected" the actor as Roddenberry sometimes suggested.&lt;ref name="insidestartrek152" /&gt;

Kelley's first broadcast appearance as Doctor Leonard McCoy was in "[[The Man Trap]]" (1966). Despite his character's prominence, Kelley's contract granted him only a "featuring" credit; it was not until the second season that he was given "starring" credit, at the urging of producer [[Robert H. Justman|Robert Justman]].&lt;ref name="Inside Star Trek pg 240"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solow|first1=Herbert|authorlink1=Herbert Franklin Solow|first2=Robert|last2=Justman|authorlink2=Robert H. Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|date=June 1997|page=240|isbn=0-671-00974-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley was apprehensive about ''Star Trek''{{'}}s future, telling Roddenberry that the show was "going to be the biggest hit or the biggest miss God ever made".&lt;ref name="rioux2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy|first=Terry Lee|last=Rioux|isbn=978-0-7434-5762-0|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHqtNdfIdi8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rioux+kelley&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-E-FTYfJO4P0tgOY49hP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|146}} Kelley portrayed McCoy throughout the original ''Star Trek'' series and voiced the character in the animated ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name="compendium" /&gt;

Kelley, who in his youth wanted to become a doctor like his uncle, but whose family could not pay for a medical education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/367110.stm|title=Star Trek's Dr McCoy dies|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-26|date=1999-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part drew upon his real-life experiences in creating McCoy: a doctor's "matter-of-fact" delivery of news of Kelley's mother's terminal cancer was the "abrasive sand" Kelley used in creating McCoy's demeanor.{{r|rioux2005}}{{rp|145}} ''Star Trek'' writer [[D. C. Fontana]] said that while Roddenberry created the series, Kelley essentially created McCoy; everything done with the character was done with Kelley's input.{{r|rioux2005}}{{rp|156}}

"Exquisite chemistry" among Kelley, [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]] manifested itself in their performances as McCoy, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] and science officer [[Spock]], respectively.{{r|rioux2005}}{{rp|154}} [[Nichelle Nichols]], who played [[Uhura]], referred to Kelley as her "sassy gentleman friend";{{r|rioux2005}}{{rp|154}} the friendship between the [[African American|African-American]] Nichols and [[Southern United States|Southern]] Kelley was a real-life demonstration of the message Roddenberry hoped to convey through ''Star Trek''.{{r|rioux2005}}{{rp|154}}

For the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] saw McCoy as an "arbiter" in Kirk and Spock's relationship.&lt;ref name="scifiwireinterview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/orci-kurtzman-how-star-tr.php|title=Orci &amp; Kurtzman: How Star Trek deals with Kirk, Spock and McCoy|work=[[Sci Fi Wire]]|date=2009-03-25|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Spock represented "extreme logic, extreme science" and Kirk symbolized "extreme emotion and intuition", McCoy's role as "a very colorful doctor, essentially a very [[Humanism|humanistic]] scientist" represented the "two extremes that often served as the glue that held the trio together."&lt;ref name="scifiwireinterview" /&gt; They chose to reveal that McCoy befriended Kirk first, explaining the "bias" in their friendship and why he would often be a "little dismissive" of Spock.&lt;ref name="scifiwireinterview" /&gt; Urban said the script was "very faithful" to the original character, including the "great compassion for humanity and that sense of irascibility" with which Kelley imbued the character.&lt;ref name="urbanvideo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_seyret&amp;Itemid=227&amp;task=videodirectlink&amp;id=522|title=Karl Urban|accessdate=2009-01-26|date=2008-01-17|publisher=IESB.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317071342/http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_seyret&amp;Itemid=227&amp;task=videodirectlink&amp;id=522|archivedate=March 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand-born Urban trained with a dialect coach to create McCoy's accent &lt;ref name="urbanvideo" /&gt; and reprised the role in its sequels ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-09-22/dredd-3d-star-karl-urban-star-trek-into-darkness-will-be-epic-emotional-exclusive-video/ |title=‘Dredd 3D’ Star Karl Urban: ‘Star Trek Into Darkness’ Will Be ‘Epic’, ‘Emotional’ (EXCLUSIVE VIDEO) |publisher=Celebuzz |date=2012-09-22 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]''.

==Cultural impact==
McCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself, but is a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to Spock.&lt;ref name="Inside Star Trek pg 240" /&gt; He is Kirk's "friend, personal bartender, confidant, counselor, and priest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=84|first=Grace Lee|last=Whitney|authorlink=Grace Lee Whitney|title=The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy|year=1998|isbn=978-1-884956-03-4|publisher=Quill Driver Books|first2=James D.|last2=Denney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spock and McCoy's bickering became so popular that Roddenberry wrote in a 1968 memo "we simply didn't realize ... how much the fans loved the bickering between our [[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]] and our Alien".&lt;ref name="davis20130907"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/gene-roddenberrys-1968-memo-on-improving-star-treks-c-1267131265 | title=Gene Roddenberry's 1968 memo on improving Star Trek's characters | work=io9 | date=2013-09-07 | accessdate=2013-09-07 | last=Davis|first=Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban said McCoy has a "sense of irascibility with real passion for life and doing the right thing", and that "Spock's logic and McCoy's moral standing gave Kirk the benefit of having three brains instead of just one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scifipulse.net/?p=581 |publisher=Sci Fi Pulse |title=Urban On Star Trek &amp; McCoy |accessdate=2009-01-26 |date=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205194252/http://scifipulse.net/?p=581 |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelley said that his greatest thrill at ''Star Trek'' conventions was the number of people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Up Till Now: The Autobiography|first=William|last=Shatner|authorlink=William Shatner|page=149|year=2008|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-37265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley's portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, "You can win awards and that sort of thing, but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry".{{r|rioux2005}}{{rp|273}}

In a humor column for the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'', the ethicist Michael Yeo described the character of McCoy as "TV’s only true physician" and "someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yeo M |date=December 15, 1998 |title=To boldly go: we have to look beyond the Simpsons for a true medical hero |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/159/12/1476.full.pdf |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=159 |issue=12 |pages=1476-1477 |pmid=9988569 |access-date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="He's dead, Jim!"===
Twenty times on the original ''Star Trek'', McCoy declares someone or something deceased with the line, "He's dead", "He's dead, Jim", or something similar. The phrase so became a [[catchphrase]] of the character that Kelley joked that the line would appear on his tombstone&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book | title = Star Trek and Sacred Ground: Explorations of Star Trek, Religion, and American Culture | last = Porter | first = Jennifer E. | year = 1999 | publisher = SUNY Press | page = 127 | isbn = 0-7914-4334-5 | contribution = Darcee L.

The line has entered popular culture as a general metaphor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The [[University of Southern California|USC]] literature professor [[Henry Jenkins]] cites Dr. McCoy's "He's dead, Jim" line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-41-553328-7 |page=76 |edition=updated 20th anniversary |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Textual_Poachers.html?id=xxwAZj22IdoC&amp;q=%22he%27s+dead%2C+jim%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Undue weight inline|date=October 2018|reason=passing mention as a "favorite line" only}}

McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as the "classic moment" when he is confronted with the unusual [[silicon]]-based Horta alien in "[[The Devil in the Dark]]" (1967), saying, "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."&lt;ref name="Lass"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lass|first1=Martin|first2=Rickie|last2=Hilder|title=Musings of a Rogue Comet: Chiron, Planet of Healing|edition=2nd|year=2002|publisher=Galactic Publications|isbn=0-9715924-2-X|page=212|chapter=The Discovery of Chiron|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiYNPFOnLLwC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=2009-04-07|quote=In a classic moment (episode: "The Devil in the Dark"), McCoy, challenged with healing a being that was made more of rock than flesh, spouts out, "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line was used in ''[[Terra Nova (TV series)|Terra Nova]]''.&lt;ref name="Terra-Nova"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Now you see me |number=10 |season=1 |series=Terra Nova |url=http://thevoiceoftv.com/recaps-and-reviews/terra-nova-review-now-you-see-me |airdate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103102217/http://thevoiceoftv.com/recaps-and-reviews/terra-nova-review-now-you-see-me/ |archivedate=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Likely Herman "Like" McBrien OBE''' (7 December 1892 – 22 December 1956) was a leading [[Australian rules football]] administrator in the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) and a [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n politician.

Likely McBrien was born on 7 December 1892 in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]] and educated at Middle Park Central School.  In 1906 he commenced work as a messenger for ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper.  He served in World War I in a clerical capacity and was based in London. Following his discharge from the services in 1917 he resumed work at ''The Age'', becoming assistant circulation manager and advertising manager.  In 1922–29 he was secretary of the Authorised News Agents' Association of Victoria.

On 16 July 1919 he married Madge Margaret Summers at St Luke's Anglican Church, South Melbourne.

McBrien was an avid sportsman with a variety of interests.  He played cricket and tennis, and later golf and bowls, and was a prominent rower. Australian rules football was the passion of his life. From 1909 to 1911 he was a player and treasurer of the Leopold Football Club (later the South Melbourne Football Club's second XVIII).  He went on to a long career in football administration.

He was a qualified accountant, and a fellow of the International Institute of Accountants and of the Institute of Commerce, England. In addition, he was a director of Disher &amp; McBrien Pty Ltd.

Likely McBrien died of cerebral thrombosis on 22 December 1956 and was survived by his wife, daughter and son.

== Public life ==
McBrien held many public posts: chairman of the Edith Cavell Fund Trust, the Homes for Aged and Infirm Society, and the Yarra Bend National Park Trust; honorary treasurer of the Travellers' Aid Society and of the Victorian Anti-Sweating and Industrial Improvement League; executive-member of the Playgrounds and Recreation Association of Victoria; and trustee of the Heidelberg branch of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia.

== Political career ==
McBrien was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] in 1943 as an Independent member for the province of [[Melbourne North Province|Melbourne North]].  He served as commissioner of public works and vice-president of the Board of Land and Works in [[Ian MacFarlan]]'s short-lived ministry in 1945. One of his chief commitments was to campaign for the rehabilitation of returned servicemen. In 1949 he was defeated in the elections for the Legislative Council.

== Football administration ==
He was a committee-member of [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne Football Club]] from 1912 and Secretary from 1922 to 1928.

He was VFL Secretary from 1929 to 1956.  He was instrumental in the VFL buying its first head office, [[Harrison House (Melbourne)|Harrison House]], in Spring Street, [[Melbourne]], in 1929. He played a leading role in negotiations with the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) Trustees, which led to the finals being played at the MCG.  He also campaigned strongly (but unsuccessfully) for the amalgamation of the VFL and the [[Victorian Football Association]].

McBrien recruited other key administrators of the VFL, [[Eric McCutchan]] and [[Jack Hamilton (footballer, born 1928)|Jack Hamilton]].

== Honours ==
McBrien was appointed [[OBE]] in 1950. He was inducted to the [[Australian Football Hall of Fame]] in 1996.

| The children played outside when the animal fell on them – the parents could then expel it again. Among other things, the children came to the hospital with bite wounds on their legs. According to media reports, it was not the only alleged wolf attack in the region: there was a suspicion that in mid-June a tourist was bitten by the same animal in a campsite. - Scientists from the department of biology from the University of Warsaw confirmed that the animal that bit three people in June was in all certainty a wolf.

He also stated that dogs could not do this sort of attack.

|In their leisure time at night two border guards heard screams for help. Approaching the spot, they saw a man being attacked by a wolf. To rescue the resident who was already in serious condition from the bites, they had to use their knives and kill the wolf. Both guards were wounded on hands and arms, while the first attacked victim was severely injured. All of them got the necessary treatments and vaccinations later in the hospital.

|Two children were attacked in two different incidents in the same area. While a boy due to his protection by family members escaped with no more than a fright, when a wolf tapped with its claws on his shoulders, the 7-year-old girl was seriously injured. While playing in a garden a little bit further away from her resting family suddenly a wolf came in, grabbed her and ran away. In the following wild chase the wolf had to stop two times because of its burden so its chasers could outrun it and save the victim. The wolf escaped and the girl was taken by family members to Valiasr Hospital Razan. Later a wolf was shot and sent to rabies examination.

Standing face to face with the predator, the fight started. In the battle, and despite his bitten hands, Aslan was able to grab its head and twist it.

|Lance Grangaard||30||♂||week of December 10, 2012||Rabid||30 miles off Taylor Highway in remote area known as Ketchumstuk near [[Tok, Alaska]], [[United States|USA]]|| Lance was "putting along" on his snow machine on a frozen river when a lone wolf attacked his right arm, ripped through his parka and three layers of underclothing and inflicted a superficial 3" long laceration above his elbow. Lance, taking the offensive, jumped onto the wolf's back and knocked it hard onto the ice. The wolf freed itself from his grip, ran 15–20 feet away, stopped and turned back again facing him. Lance threw his arms up and yelled, which scared the wolf away. He subsequently escaped on his snow machine. Although the Alaska wildlife authorities were unaware of any rabid animals in the area, Lance was treated for potential rabies exposure. Authorities could not capture the wolf.||&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mowry|first1=Tim|title=Wolf Attacks Trapper on Snowmachine Near Tok|url=http://www.newsminer.com/wolf-attacks-trapper-on-snowmachine-near-tok/article_78ddd3dd-a279-5bab-ab4a-3a95db4c6549.html|website=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner|accessdate=1 August 2015|location=Fairbanks, Alaska|date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alaska State Medical Examiner ruled that her death was caused by "multiple injuries due to animal mauling." A series of necropsies performed on wolves culled in the surrounding area shortly after the attack ruled out rabies, sickness, or wolf-dog hybridisation as being causes of the attack. The case was notable as being the first fatal wolf attack in North America in which DNA evidence was gathered to confirm wolf involvement. ||&lt;ref&gt;Butler, L., B. Dale, K. Beckmen, and S.

a wolf jumped out from behind the trees, grabbed the boy and dragged him deep into the forest. His two frightened and helpless friends alarmed the adults in the village and in an immediate chase they could get close to the beast, which left back the body of the boy and fled. But it was too late. Kolya had already been strangled. Later an expert stated, that the animal was probably too old and weak to hunt proper prey.

|Principal chief conservator of forest, RL Singh demanded the villagers in nearby areas for constant alertness and stated:  "Since the man eater wolves will not kill grown up humans they can be rounded up and killed. Without the tacit co-operation of villagers and licensed firearm support of the public, the forest officials alone will not be able to contain the wolf menace. This we know from our experience in the worst recorded incident of wolf menace in the history of the 20th century wherein 170 children were killed," he said.

|Sleeping outside his tent on Vargas Island in the early morning the student was awakened by a dark-colored wolf tugging at the foot of his sleeping bag. He yelled and kicked at it without success. Fighting each other the wolf and the man rolled over the campsite. Eventually, Mr. Langevin's screams alarmed his fellow campers in nearby tents, and they scared the animal off. Seriously injured, he was transferred to Victoria for treatment. Later two wolves were destroyed.

| John Stenglein || 6 || ♂ || April 26, 2000 || Predatory || logging camp at [[Icy Bay, Alaska]] || The nearly 7-year-old John Stenglein and 9-year-old Keith Gamble were playing at the edge of the woods, when a wolf appeared and attacked John. The wolf didn't growl; it just looked at him, John said later. Keith's mother, Teresa Thompson credits their family's dog with saving the boys. John thinks the dog rushed in to save him too. But the wolf fought off the [[Labrador retriever]] and went back after the boys. While the dog and the wolf were fighting, John said, he ran in mud boots about as far as the hospital room door - maybe 20 feet - before the wolf caught him and started biting. John received 19 laceration and puncture wounds on the back, legs, and buttocks, before adult arrived, fought the wolf off and shot it. First he was treated at a Yakutat health clinic and went home to Icy Bay the day after the attack. But two days later, John got really sick, his mother Diane Stenglein said, "He had a fever and said his feet felt like needles". In the Yakutat clinic John's stitches were removed and he was put on antibiotics. Doctors cut away the infected area in the small of his back so it would heal cleanly, the boy's back and legs were covered in bandages.
The wolf was found to have been neither sick nor starving, but in "excellent condition" with good teeth and healthy deposits of fat around its organs. Although a rumor has circulated around both camps that someone had fed the wolf before the attack, but a necropsy of the wolf's carcass found no sign of human food in its stomach

|Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada
|From the Congressional Record [Pages H7152-H7177]:-- "In August, 1996, the Delventhal family of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, were spending a nine-day family vacation in Algonquin and joined a group of Scouts in ''howling&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the wolves. They were answered by the howl of a solitary wolf. That night the Delventhals decided to sleep out under the stars. Young Zachariah was dreaming when he suddenly felt excruciating pain in his face. A lone wolf had bit him in the face and was dragging him from his sleeping bag. Zach screamed and Tracy, Zach's Mother, raced to his side and picked him up, saturating her thermal shirt with blood from Zach's wounds. The wolf stood menacingly less than a yard away. Tracy yelled at her husband, Thom, who leapt from his sleeping bag and charged the wolf. The wolf retreated and then charged at Tracy and Zach. The charges were repeated. Finally the wolf left. Thom turned a flashlight on 11-year-old Zach and saw, that the boy's face had been ripped open. His nose was crushed. Parts of his mouth and right cheek were torn and dangling. Blood gushed from puncture wounds below his eyes, and the lower part of his right ear was missing. Zach was taken to a hospital in Toronto where a plastic surgeon performed four hours of reconstructive surgery. Zach received more than 80 stitches in his face. Canadian officials baited the Delventhals' campsite and captured and destroyed a 60-lb wild male wolf. No further &amp;nbsp;attacks have occurred since.

|  || Elderly || ♀ || 1980 || Rabid || Estonia || 1982.a. ründas marutõbine hunt Mahtra külas üksikus metsatalus elavat vanainimest Anna Pärtelit, viimane suri. Hunt läks sealt edasi naabertallu, kus ta majaperemehe poolt maha löödi.
Sellest oli juttu ka tolleaegses Rapla rajooni ajalehes "Ühistöö". 
See oli 1950.a., Põlvamaal, Prangli 4-kl. Algkooli naabruses elavat elanikku ründas marutõbine hunt. Olin 6-aastane, koos venna (3) ja vanatädiga peedipõllul. Meist möödus hunt, välimuselt vibalik, peenike, pea longus. Tädi, kes oli eluaegne karjus, pidevalt lambaid kaitsnud huntide eest, hakkas karjuma: hunt, hunt ja meie ka. Õnneks hunt ei pannud meid tähele. Hunt sörkis Prangli kooli poole ja mõne aja pärast kostis inimeste kisa.
Kooli direktor nägi hunti tulemas naabite juurde ja hüüdis naabrimeele, et hunt on sinu aia taga. Mees, kes oli Siberis paljude huntidega võidelnud, otsustas hundile vastu hakata. Ta hüppas üle aia, õnnetuseks seljaga hundi poole, rünnak tuli ootamatult, mees võttis küll hundi pea haardesse, kuid hunt ulatas kõri kallale. Mehe vapper naine surus rusika hundi kurku ja nii päästis mehe elu. Hunt lasti maha. Kannatanud viibisid haiglaravil.
Läbi metsatuka viis minu koolitee ( 600m), mis oli talvel hundikarja poolt sisse sõtkutud. Hommikuti liikus väike rongkäik kooli poole: eespool väikene koer, jumalalaulev vanaema laternaga, mina, viimasena suurem koer. ||&lt;ref name="lin17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Linnell|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Fuge armed with an axe arrived in order to fight the wolf, he himself was attacked and injured. Other farmers arrived and killed the wolf fighting with Fuge and held by him to the ground. Immediately after the attacks the four victims were treated by medical doctors in the nearby town of Rössel.

'''Martial Bourdin''' (1868 – 15 February 1894) was a [[French people|French]] [[anarchist]], who died on 15 February 1894 when [[chemical explosive]]s that he was carrying prematurely detonated outside the [[Greenwich Observatory|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich Park]], [[London]].

Although Bourdin sustained massive injuries, he remained alive and able to speak.  He did not, however, reveal his name, specific target, or motives. He was carried to the [[Seamen's Hospital Society|Seamen's Hospital]] nearby, where he died 30 minutes later.

Later, police investigators discovered that Bourdin had left his room on Fitzroy Street in [[London]] and travelled by tram from [[Westminster]] to [[Greenwich Park]].  The police concluded that "some mischance or miscalculation or some clumsy bungling" had caused the bomb to explode in Bourdin's hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Propaganda by Deed - the Greenwich Observatory Bomb of 1894 | url = http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/astronomy-facts/history/propaganda-by-deed-the-greenwich-observatory-bomb-of-1894 | publisher = Royal Museums of Greenwich }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he was found with a large sum of money, the police speculated that he had planned to leave for France immediately.

The police later raided the Club Autonomie in London, a popular club for foreign anarchists, including Bourdin.

==Legacy==
Bourdin's gruesome death and the mystery surrounding his attempted act inspired [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel, ''[[The Secret Agent]].'' Some scholars believe [[T. S. Eliot]] references Bourdin in his [[T. S. Eliot's Ariel poems|Ariel poem "Animula"]] when he writes "Pray...// For Boudin, blown to pieces," although Eliot uses the spelling "Boudin" and may not have had the anarchist in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Southam, B. C., A Guide to the Selected Poems of T.S. Eliot, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1994, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Metasequoia''''' ('''dawn redwood''') is a fast-growing [[deciduous]] tree, and the sole living species, ''[[Metasequoia glyptostroboides]]'', is one of three species of [[pinophyta|conifers]] known as redwoods. It is native to [[Lichuan, Hubei|Lichuan]] county in [[Hubei]] province, [[China]]. Although the shortest of the [[Sequoioideae|redwoods]], it grows to at least 165 feet (50 meters) in height. Local villagers refer to the original tree from which most others derive as ''Shui-sa'', or "water fir", which is part of a local shrine. Since its rediscovery in 1944, the dawn redwood has become a popular ornamental.

Together with ''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'' (coast redwood) and ''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'' (giant sequoia) of [[California]], ''Metasequoia'' is classified in the [[Cupressaceae]] subfamily [[Sequoioideae]]. ''M.&amp;nbsp;glyptostroboides'' is the only living species in its genus, but three [[fossil]] species are known. Sequoioideae and several other genera have been transferred from the former [[Taxodiaceae]] family to Cupressaceae based on DNA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Paul A.

==Paleontology==
''Metasequoia'' redwood fossils are known from many areas in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]; more than 20 fossil species have been named (some were even identified as the genus ''Sequoia''), but are considered as just three species, ''[[Metasequoia foxii|M.&amp;nbsp;foxii]]'', ''[[Metasequoia milleri|M.&amp;nbsp;milleri]]'', and ''[[Metasequoia occidentalis|M.&amp;nbsp;occidentalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A. Farjon |year=2005 |title=Monograph of Cupressaceae and ''Sciadopitys'' |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |isbn=1-84246-068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]], extensive forests of ''Metasequoia'' occurred as far north as [[Strathcona Fiord]] on [[Ellesmere Island]] and sites on [[Axel Heiberg Island]] (northern [[Canada]]) at around [[80th parallel north|80°&amp;nbsp;N]] latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Christopher J. Williams |author2=Arthur H. Johnson |author3=Ben A. LePage |author4=David R. Vann |author5=Tatsuo Sweda |year=2003 |title=Reconstruction of Tertiary ''Metasequoia'' forests. II. Structure, biomass, and productivity of Eocene floodplain forests in the Canadian Arctic |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=271–292 |url=http://edisk.fandm.edu/chris.williams/pubs/williams_etal_2003b.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2003)029&lt;0271:ROTMFI&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metasequoia'' was likely [[deciduous]] by this time. Given that the high latitudes in this period were warm and tropical, it is hypothesized that the deciduous habit evolved in response to the unusual light availability patterns, not to major seasonal variations in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ralph W. Chaney |year=1948 |title=The bearing of the living ''Metasequoia'' on problems of Tertiary paleobotany |journal=[[Botany (journal)|Botany]] |volume=34 |pages=503–515 |jstor=88221 |pmid=16588827 |pmc=1079159 |issue=11 |doi=10.1073/pnas.34.11.503}}&lt;/ref&gt; During three months in the summer, the sun would shine continuously, while three months of the winter would be complete darkness. It is also hypothesized that the change from [[evergreen]] to deciduous habit occurred before colonizing the high latitudes and was the reason ''Metasequoia'' was dominant in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard Jagels  |author2=Maria A. Equiza  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Competitive advantages of ''Metasequoia'' in warm high latitudes |pages=335–349}} In [[#LWY|LePage ''et al'' (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Large petrified trunks and stumps of the extinct ''Metasequoia occidentalis'' (sometimes identified as ''Sequoia occidentalis'') also make up the major portion of Tertiary fossil plant material in the badlands of western [[North Dakota]].

The trees are well known from late [[Cretaceous]] to [[Miocene]] strata, but no fossils are known after that. Before its discovery, the taxon was believed to have become extinct during the Miocene; when it was discovered [[wikt:extant|extant]], it was heralded as a "[[Lazarus taxon|living fossil]]".

==Appearance==
[[File:MetaseqLeaves.jpg|left|thumb|Dawn redwood foliage - note opposite arrangement]]
The bark and foliage are similar to ''[[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]]'', but ''Metasequoia'' is [[deciduous]] like ''[[Taxodium distichum]]'' (bald cypress), and, similarly, older specimens form wide buttresses on the lower trunk. It is a fast-growing tree to 130–150 feet (40–45 m) tall and 6 feet (2 m) in trunk diameter in cultivation so far (with the potential to grow even higher).

The leaves are opposite, 0.4-1.25 inches (1–3&amp;nbsp;cm) long, and bright fresh green, turning foxy red-brown in fall. The [[pollen]] cones are 0.25 inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) long, produced on long spikes in early spring; they are only produced on trees growing in regions with hot summers. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose to ovoid, 0.6-1.0 inches (1.5-2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter with 16–28 scales, arranged in opposite pairs in four rows, each pair at right angles to the adjacent pair; they mature in about 8–9 months after pollination.

''Metasequoia'' has experienced morphological stasis for the past 65 million years: the modern ''[[Metasequoia glyptostroboides]]'' appears identical to its late [[Cretaceous]] ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ben A. LePage, Hong Yang &amp; Midori Matsumoto |year=2005 |title=The evolution and biogeographic history of ''Metasequoia'' |pages=3–115}} In [[#LWY|LePage ''et al'' (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Metasequoia branchlet 03.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Eocene]] ([[Ypresian]]) age [[Metasequoia occidentalis|M.&amp;nbsp;occidentalis]]'' branchlet]]
''Metasequoia'' was first described as a fossil from the [[Mesozoic]] Era by [[Shigeru Miki]] in 1941, but in 1944, a small stand of an unidentified tree species was discovered in China in Modaoxi (磨刀溪; presently, Moudao (谋道), in [[Lichuan City|Lichuan County]], Hubei&lt;ref name=langlois2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Gaytha A. Langlois |year=2005 |title=A conservation plan for ''Metasequoia'' in China |pages=367–418 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfiWU-1GSqEC&amp;pg=PA369 |isbn=9781402026317}} In [[#LWY|LePage ''et al'' (2005)]].
&lt;/ref&gt;) by Zhan Wang. Due to [[World War II]], these were not studied further until 1946, and only finally described as a new living species of ''Metasequoia'' in 1948 by [[Wan Chun Cheng]] and [[Hu Hsen Hsu]]. In 1948, the [[Arnold Arboretum]] of [[Harvard University]] sent an expedition to collect seeds and, soon after, seedling trees were distributed to various universities and arboreta worldwide for growth trials.

Presently, a number of natural ''Metasequoia'' populations exist in the hills and wetlands of Hubei's Lichuan County. Most of them are small, with fewer than 30 trees each; however, the largest of them, in Xiaohe Valley, is estimated to consist of around 5,400 trees.&lt;ref name=langlois2005/&gt; A few trees are also said to exist in neighboring [[Hunan]] Province.&lt;ref name=langlois2005/&gt;

== Metasequoia in gardens, parks and streets ==
Dawn redwoods are fast-growing trees. They will grow too large for small gardens, but can be good in a wide range of larger gardens and parks. Although they live in wet sites in their native habitat they will also tolerate dry soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=B.G. Hibberd |year=1989 |title=Urban Forestry Practice, Forestry Commission Handbook 5 |page=61}} In [[#BGH|Hibberd (1989)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most conifers, their deciduous habit means they do not cast too much shade in winter. They are grown as street trees in London and elsewhere.

[[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|Strawberry Fields]] is a landscaped section in New York City's Central Park dedicated to Beatle John Lennon. At the northern end of the lawns are three dawn redwood trees. The trees drop their needles each fall and regrow them each spring, a symbol of eternal renewal. The trees are expected to reach a height of 36 metres (118&amp;nbsp;ft), making them visible from great distances.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A '''mirror punishment''' is a penal form of [[poetic justice]] which reflects the nature or means of the crime in the means of (often physical) punishment as a form of [[retributive justice]]—the practice of "repaying" a wrongdoer "in kind".

It can be an application of the ''lex talionis'' (“[[an eye for an eye]]”), but is not always [[proportional justice]], as a similar method may be used to produce a worse or milder effect than the crime it "retaliates".

The simplest method of mirror punishment is to enact the same action upon the criminal as the criminal perpetrated upon the victim. For example, thieves have the same amount of money taken from them as they stole; one who strikes another is struck in the same way; one who willfully causes another person's death is killed; and so on.

Often, however, a more esoteric method of mirror punishment is used, which implies punishing the part of the criminal's body used to commit the crime. Extreme examples include the amputation of the hands of a [[thief]], as still permitted by [[Sharia]] law, or during the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]]; or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. 
[[File:Station 1 Handabschlagen Bamberger Kreuzweg.jpg|thumb]]

Other examples include the punishment of [[adultery|adulterous]] women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). A less extreme example is putting soap into a child's mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as "washing someone's mouth out with soap"). 	

Another method to accomplish "poetic justice" is to mirror the physical method of the crime, e.g., executing a murderer with his own weapon, burning [[arson]]ists alive, or in a more far-fetched example, boiling a counterfeiter alive (because [[bullion]] is boiled to be minted{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}).

==Popular culture==
W. S. Gilbert's comic opera ''[[The Mikado]]'' contains a song satirizing mirror punishment. For example:

:The billiard-sharp whom anyone catches 
:His doom’s extremely hard—
:He’s made to dwell 
:In a dungeon cell 
:On a spot that’s always barred.
:And there he plays extravagant matches 
:In fitless finger-stalls, 
:On a cloth untrue 
:With a twisted cue
:And elliptical billiard balls.

The refrain line "to let the punishment fit the crime" has sometimes been quoted in the course of British political debates, though the concept predates Gilbert.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, Edward. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3634126.stm "Ballads,songs and speeches",] ''BBC News'', 20 September 2004, accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://keithwiley.com/mindRamblings/deathPenalty.shtml Keith Wiley webpage], referring to the Code of [[Hammurabi]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, episode 80 of the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', entitled "Let the Punishment Fit the Crime", features bits of several songs from ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of Magnum, P.I. episodes|Wikipedia List of Magnum, P.I. episodes]] and [http://www.tv.com/magnum-p.i./let-the-punishment-fit-the-crime/episode/16074/summary.html TV.com Magnum, P.I. Episode Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase and the Mikado's song also are featured in the ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode, "A Soldier's Farewell." In ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1961), the camp director quotes the phrase before sentencing the twins to the isolation cabin together.

'''Sir Murrough O'Brien, 10th Baron of Inchiquin, 5th Baron O'Brien of Burren, 1st Baron Thomond of Taplow, 5th Earl of Inchiquin, 1st Marquess of Thomond''' [[Order of St Patrick|KP]], [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC (Ire)]] (1726 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1808), known from 1777 to 1800 as the 5th Earl of Inchiquin, was an [[Ireland|Irish]] peer, soldier and politician.

==Life==
Murrough O'Brien was born in 1726 to the [[James O'Brien (1695–1771)|Hon. James O' Brien]] and Mary Jephson in [[Drogheda]]. James' brother (and Murrough's uncle) was [[Henry O'Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond]], whose heir was Percy Wyndham O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond (c. 1713 – 1774), brother of [[Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont]] (1710–1763) of [[Petworth House]].

He joined the [[Grenadier Guards]] and was an officer in Germany, where he carried colours at the [[Battle of Lauffeld]] in 1747. He retired in 1756 and entered the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[Clare (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Clare]] in the following year. He represented the constituency until 1761 and sat then as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Harristown (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Harristown]] until 1768.

Because of his support for the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] of Great Britain and Ireland, on 29 December 1800 he was created '''Marquess of Thomond''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], with a special remainder to his younger brother, and '''Baron Thomond''', of Taplow in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] on 2 October 1801 (which title allowed him to sit in the United Kingdom House of Lords), but this time with no special remainder. He had a close relationship with [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]]. In 1783 he was one of the Founding Knights of the [[Order of St Patrick]].  His Irish seat was Rostellan, near Cork.

He was a drinker, called a "'six bottle man", and a gambler{{fact|date=April 2018}}. He was a keen farmer and oversaw enclosure of lands around Taplow and mechanisation{{fact|date=April 2018}}.

==Marriages &amp; progeny==
[[File:Mary, Countess of Inchiquin (1750-1820) by Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|200px|Mary, Countess of Inchiquin (1750&amp;ndash;1820), by [[Thomas Lawrence]]]]
He married twice:
* Firstly in 1753 to [[Mary O'Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney]] (died 1790), by whom he had a daughter, [[Mary O'Brien, 4th Countess of Orkney]] (1755–1831).  
* Secondly on 25 July 1792, to [[Mary Palmer (1750-1820)]]

He also is reputed to have had an illegitimate son, [[Thomas Carter (composer)|Thomas Carter]] (1769&amp;ndash;1800), who was a composer in London during the 1790s. Thomas lived with Inchiquin at Taplow Court after his return from India in July 1789, and lent the earl all the money he earned in a benefit concert in Calcutta. In return, Inchiquin recommended Thomas to all his friends as a coal merchant; he had gone into that field after his marriage to Mary Wells in 1793 in order to support his growing family.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Death &amp; succession==
He died after a fall from his horse in Grosvenor Square, London on 10 February 1808. The title of Marquess of Thomond passed to his nephew [[William O'Brien, 2nd Marquess of Thomond]]. The barony of Thomond became extinct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5048">'''Objective idealism''' is an [[idealism|idealistic]] [[metaphysics]] that postulates that there is in an important sense only one perceiver, and that this perceiver is one with that which is perceived.  One important advocate of such a metaphysics, [[Josiah Royce]] (the founder of '''American idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Sommer Robinson, ''The Self and the World in the Philosophy of Josiah Royce'', Christopher Publishing House, 1968, p. 9: "Josiah Royce and [[William Ernest Hocking]] were the founders and creators of a unique and distinctly American school of idealistic philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that he was indifferent "whether anybody calls all this [[Theism]] or [[Pantheism]]". [[Plato]] is regarded as one of the earliest representatives of objective idealism. It is distinct from the [[subjective idealism]] of [[George Berkeley]], and it abandons the [[thing-in-itself]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s dualism.

==Overview&lt;!--'Analytic idealism' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Idealism]], in terms of metaphysics, is the philosophical view that the mind or spirit constitutes the fundamental reality. It has taken several distinct but related forms. Among them are objective and subjective idealism. Objective idealism accepts [[Naïve realism|common sense realism]] (the view that material objects exist) but rejects [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] (according to which the mind and spiritual values have emerged from material things), whereas subjective idealism denies that material objects exist independently of human perception and thus stands opposed to both realism and naturalism.

{{Quotation| If [[subjective idealism]] locks itself within the sphere of the cognizing individual and the sensuous form of his cognition, objective idealism, on the contrary, lifts the result of human thought, of man's entire culture, to an absolute, ascribing to it absolutely independent suprapersonal being and active power. — [[Alexander Spirkin]]. [https://archive.org/details/FundamentalsOfPhilosophy ''Fundamentals of Philosophy'']. Moscow: [[Progress Publishers]], 1990. p. 30. }}
{{quote |text = Objective idealism … interprets the spiritual as a reality existing outside and independent of human consciousness. |author= [[Teodor Oizerman|Oizerman, T. I.]] |source=  [https://archive.org/details/TheMainTrendsInPhilosophy ''The Main Trends in Philosophy'']. Moscow, 1988, p. 57. }}

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] had forms of objective idealism. 

The [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] stated his own version of objective idealism in the following manner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The one intelligible theory of the universe is that of objective idealism, that matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws (Peirce, CP 6.25).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. C. Ewing]] is an [[analytic philosopher]] influenced by the objective idealist tradition. His approach has been termed '''analytic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Beaney (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of the History of Analytic Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 5. n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[video games]], an '''open world''' is a [[virtual world]] in which the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.kotaku.com.au/2008/07/pandemic_working_on_new_open_world_sandbox_ip/ | title = Pandemic Working On New 'Open World / Sandbox' IP | first = Logan | last = Booker | publisher = Kotaku | date = 2008-07-14 | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cvg_history2&gt;{{Cite web | title = The complete history of open-world games (part 2) | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = May 25, 2008 | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=189599 | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s, the implementation in ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' (2001) set a standard that has been used since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2015/12/open-world-games-2015/ | title = Open-World Games Are Changing the Way We Play | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = December 3, 2015 | accessdate = June 6, 2017 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games with open or free-roaming worlds typically lack the [[invisible wall]]s and loading screens common in linear level designs. Generally, open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment, either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game's linearity.&lt;ref name="gsutra_20games"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Harris | first = John | title = Game Design Essentials: 20 Open World Games | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = September 26, 2007 | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1902/game_design_essentials_20_open_.php | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open world concept such as the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series. The main appeal of open-world gameplay is that they provide a simulated reality and allow players to develop their character and its behavior in the direction of their choosing. In these cases, there is often no concrete goal or end to the game.

== Gameplay and design ==
An open world is a [[Level design|level]] or game designed as [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]], open areas with many ways to reach an objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2008/01/assassins-creed-2/ | title = Assassin's Creed And The Future Of Sandbox Games | publisher = Wired | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = 2008-01-04 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some games are designed with both traditional and open-world levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Harris | first = John | title = Game Design Essentials: 20 Open World Games - Air Fortress | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = September 26, 2007 | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1902/game_design_essentials_20_open_.php | accessdate = 2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open world facilitates greater exploration than a series of smaller levels,&lt;ref name=gsutra_20games/&gt; or a level with more linear challenges.&lt;ref name= "assassinfails"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/11/review-why-assa.html | title = Review: Why Assassin's Creed Fails | first = Chris | last = Kohler | publisher = Wired | date = 2007-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers have judged the quality of an open world based on whether there are interesting ways for the player to interact with the broader level when they ignore their main objective.&lt;ref name="assassinfails"/&gt; Some games actually use real settings to model an open world, such as [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/10/sierra-unveils-prototype-not-the-first-sandbox-adventure/ | title = Sierra unveils Prototype, not the first sandbox adventure | author = James Ransom-Wiley | publisher = Joystiq | date = 2007-08-10 | accessdate=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major design challenge is to balance the freedom of an open world with the structure of a dramatic storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Trigger Happy | page = 101 | first = Steven | last = Poole | year = 2000 | publisher = Arcade Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since players may perform actions that the game designer [[emergent gameplay|did not expect]],&lt;ref name=cvg_fl&gt;{{Cite web | last1 =Bishop | first1 =Stuart | title =Interview: Freelancer | publisher =[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] | date =March 5, 2003 | url =http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=88288 | accessdate =2007-12-30  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the game's writers must find creative ways to impose a storyline on the player without interfering with their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3727/redefining_game_narrative_.php | title = Redefining Game Narrative: Ubisoft's Patrick Redding On Far Cry 2 | publisher = GamaSutra |author1 = Chris Remo  |author2 =[[Brandon Sheffield]] | accessdate = 2008-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, games with open worlds will sometimes break the game's story into a series of missions, or have a much simpler storyline altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18545 | title = Opinion: 'All The World's A Sandbox' | publisher = GamaSutra | date = 2008-05-12 | first = Chris | last = Plante | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other games instead offer side-missions to the player that do not disrupt the main storyline. Most open-world games make the character a blank slate that players can project their own thoughts onto, although several games such as ''[[Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole]]'' offer more character development and dialogue.&lt;ref name=gsutra_20games/&gt; Writing in 2005, [[David Braben]] described the narrative structure of current videogames as "little different to the stories of those [[Harold Lloyd]] films of the 1920s", and considered genuinely open-ended stories to be the "Holy Grail we are looking for in fifth generation gaming".&lt;ref name="braben_bbc"&gt;{{cite news | last = Braben | first = David | title = Towards games with the wow factor | publisher = BBC News | date = 31 December 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4553620.stm | accessdate = 2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gameplay designer Manveer Heir, who worked on ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect Andromeda]]'' for [[Electronic Arts]], said that there are difficulties in the design of an open-world game since it is difficult to predict how players will approach solving gameplay challenges offered by a design, in contrast to a linear progression, and needs to be a factor in the game's development from its onset. Heir opined that some of the critical failings of ''Andromeda'' were due to the open world being added late in development.&lt;ref name="eg heir me"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-23-manveer-heir-bioware-mass-effect-ea-monetisation | title = "I've seen people literally spend $15,000 on Mass Effect multiplayer cards" | first = Robert | last = Purchase | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some open-world games, to guide the player towards major story events, do not provide the world's entire map at the start of the game, but require the player to complete a task to obtain part of that map, often identifying missions and points of interest when they view the map. This has been derogatorily referred to as "[[Ubisoft]] towers", as this mechanic was promoted in Ubisoft's ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series (the player climbing a large tower as to observe the landscape around it and identify waypoints nearby) and reused in other Ubisoft games, including ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]'', ''[[Might &amp; Magic X: Legacy]]'' and ''[[Watch Dogs]]''. Other games that use this approach include ''[[Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/exploring-the-dreaded-ubisoft-tower | title = Exploring and Uncovering the Dreaded Ubisoft Tower | first = Mike | last = Williams | date = March 27, 2017 |  accessdate = March 27, 2017 | work = [[US Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/far-cry-5/guns-for-hire | title = How Far Cry 5 is shaking itself free from Ubisoft’s open-world template | first = Ben | last = Maxwell | date = June 28, 2017 | accessdate = June 28, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/how-collectibles-stealth-and-climbing-came-to-define-the-ubisoft-open-world-game/ | title = How collectibles, stealth and climbing came to define the Ubisoft open world game | first = Dave | last=  Meikleham  | date = January 21, 2017 | accessdate = January 21, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Chris |title=Here's a tip for easily descrambling Spider-Man PS4's towers |url=https://www.destructoid.com/here-s-a-tip-for-easily-descrambling-spider-man-ps4-s-towers-520310.phtml#disqus_thread |website=Destructoid |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games with open worlds typically give players infinite [[1-up|lives]] or [[continue (video gaming)|continues]], although games like ''[[Blaster Master]]'' force the player to start from the beginning should they die too many times.&lt;ref name=gsutra_20games/&gt; There is also a risk that players may get lost as they explore an open world; thus designers sometimes try to break the open world into manageable sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Game Design Complete | first = Patrick | last = O'Luanaigh | publisher = Paraglyph Press | year = 2006 | pages = 203, 218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedural generation and emergence ===
[[Procedural generation]] refers to content generated algorithmically rather than manually, and is often used to generate game levels and other content. While procedural generation does not guarantee that a game or sequence of levels are nonlinear, it is an important factor in reducing game development time, and opens up avenues making it possible to generate larger and more or less unique seamless game worlds on the fly and using fewer resources. This kind of procedural generation is known as [[worldbuilding]], in which general rules are used to construct a believable world.

Most [[4X]] and [[roguelike]] games make use of procedural generation to some extent to generate game levels. [[SpeedTree]] is an example of a developer-oriented tool used in the development of ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and aimed at speeding up the level design process. Procedural generation also made it possible for the developers of ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'', David Braben and Ian Bell, to fit the entire game—including thousands of planets, dozens of trade commodities, multiple ship types and a plausible economic system—into less than 22 [[kilobytes]] of memory.&lt;ref name=cavg_elite&gt;{{Cite web | last = Shoemaker | first = Richie | title = Games that changed the world: Elite | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = August 14, 2002 | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=78368 | accessdate = 2008-06-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211011328/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=78368 | archivedate = February 11, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emergent gameplay|Emergence]] refers to complex situations in a [[video game]] that emerge (either expectedly or unexpectedly) from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Le Gameplay emergent|language=French | work = jeuxvideo.com | url = http://www.jeuxvideo.com/dossiers/00006203/le-gameplay-emergent.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Molyneux]], emergent gameplay appears wherever a game has a good [[simulation]] system that allows players to play in the world and have it respond realistically to their actions. It is what made ''[[SimCity]]'' and ''[[The Sims]]'' compelling to players. Similarly, being able to freely interact with the city's inhabitants in ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' added an extra dimension to the series.&lt;ref name="moly_spy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kosak |first=Dave |title=The Future of Games from a Design Perspective |publisher=gamespy.com |date=2004-03-07 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/march04/dice/molyneux/index.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114164207/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/march04/dice/molyneux/index.shtml |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years game designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing players with tools to expand games through their own actions. Examples include in-game [[web browser]]s in ''[[EVE Online]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Online]]''; [[XML]] integration tools and [[programming language]]s in ''[[Second Life]]''; shifting exchange rates in ''[[Entropia Universe]]''; and the complex object-and-grammar system used to solve puzzles in ''[[Scribblenauts]]''. Other examples of emergence include interactions between physics and artificial intelligence. One challenge that remains to be solved, however, is how to tell a compelling story using only emergent technology.&lt;ref name="moly_spy"/&gt;

In an [[op-ed]] piece for [[BBC News]], [[David Braben]], co-creator of ''Elite'', called truly open-ended game design "The Holy Grail" of modern video gaming, citing games like ''Elite'' and the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series as early steps in that direction.&lt;ref name="braben_bbc"/&gt; [[Peter Molyneux]] has also stated that he believes emergence (or [[emergent gameplay]]) is where video game development is headed in the future. He has attempted to implement open-world gameplay to a great extent in some of his games, particularly ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' and ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]''.&lt;ref name="moly_spy"/&gt;

=== 20th century ===
There is no consensus on what the earliest open world game is, due to differing definitions of how large or open a world needs to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-four-decade-history-of-open-world-games-1680367028|title=The Four-Decade History of Open World Games|first=András|last=Neltz|website=Kotaku.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ars Technica]] traces the concept back to the free-roaming exploration of 1976 [[text adventure]] game ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/youre-now-free-to-move-about-vice-city-a-history-of-open-world-gaming/ | title = Roam free: A history of open-world gaming | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = March 25, 2017 | accessdate = October 6, 2017 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | quote = "Amazingly, open-world games can be traced back to the days of mainframes—namely, to the 1976 text-only game ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' for the PDP-10.

Other notable examples include ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' series of games, which feature a large and diverse world offering tasks and possibilities to play.

The popular ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, which began in 2007, allows players to explore historic open-world settings. These include the [[Holy Land]] during the [[Crusades]], [[Renaissance]] [[Rome]], [[New England]] during the [[American Revolution]], the [[Caribbean]] during The [[Golden Age of Piracy]], [[Paris]] during the [[French Revolution]], [[London]] at the height of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Ancient [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. The series intertwines factual history with a fictional storyline. In the fictional storyline, the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and the [[Assassins]] have been mortal enemies for all of known history. Their conflict stems from the Templars' desire to have peace through control, which directly contrasts the Assassins' wish for peace with free will. Their fighting influences much of history, as the sides often back real historical forces. For example, during the American Revolution depicted in ''[[Assassin's Creed 3]]'', the Templars support the British, while the Assassins side with the American colonists.

''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was developed by [[GSC Game World]] in 2007, followed by two other games, a prequel and a sequel. The free world style of the zone was divided into huge maps, like sectors, and the player can go from one sector to another, depending on required quests or just by choice.

In 2011, Dan Ryckert of ''Game Informer'' wrote that open-world crime games were "a major force" in the gaming industry for the preceding decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[Game Informer]] |issue=216 |date=April 2011 |publisher=GameStop |title=Embracing the Crazy |last1=Ryckert |first1=Dan |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Outerra]] Engine is a world rendering engine in development since 2008 that is capable of seamlessly rendering whole planets from space down to ground level. [[Anteworld]] is a world-building game and free tech-demo of the Outerra Engine that builds up on real world data to render planet Earth realistically on a true-to-life scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Outerra Tech Demo - Free tech demo, upgradable to the Anteworld sandbox game (alpha)|first=Brano|last=Kemen|url=http://forum.outerra.com/index.php?topic=637.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[No Man's Sky]]'', released in 2016, is an open-world game set in a virtually infinite universe. According to the developers, through [[procedural generation]], the game is able to produce more than 18 quintillion (18*10^15 or 18,000,000,000,000,000) planets to explore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/tech/no-mans-sky-sean-murray/|title = 18 quintillion planets: The video game that imagines an entire galaxy|date = 18 June 2015|accessdate = 21 October 2015|website = [[CNN]]|last = Hiranand|first = Ravi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics found that the nature of the game can become repetitive and monotonous, with the survival gameplay elements being lackluster and tedious. Jake Swearingen in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' said, "You can procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique planets, but you can’t procedurally generate 18.6 quintillion unique things to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/08/why-you-should-play-no-mans-sky.html|title=Why Everyone Should Play No Man’s Sky — Even If It’s Not a Great Game|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent updates made post-release have since aimed to address these criticisms.

'''Pi de les Tres Branques''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈpi ðə ləs ˈtɾɛz ˈβɾaŋkəs}}, "the three-branched pine") is a dead [[pine]] tree located in the countryside near the town of [[Berga]] in north-central [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. It has long been regarded by some [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]] as representing the unity of the three "[[Catalan Countries]]" and is the site of regular political-cultural gatherings.

The tree has been dead since 1915 and is in poor structural condition, due in part to politically-motivated [[vandalism]], but there is a very similar living tree a short distance away known as ''Pi Jove de les Tres Branques'' ("the young three-branched pine"), which is regarded as its successor. Both are protected as "monumental trees" by the Catalan government.

==Situation==

The tree is a [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), {{convert|25|metre}} tall, and as its name suggests, consists of three main branches or trunks rising from a common base.&lt;ref name=gencat1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parcsnaturals.gencat.cat/web/.content/home/coneix-nos/arbres_monumentals/arbres_monumentals_fitxes/bergueda/pi_de_les_tres_branques_i/AM140500_Pi_Tres_BranquesI.pdf|title=Arbre Monumental: Pi de les Tres Branques I|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6c0gdNhTJ|archivedate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the centre of the Campllong plain, which measures about {{convert|2|km}} by {{convert|500|m}} and occupies the flat floor of a valley, surrounded by forested mountains of the [[Pre-Pyrenees]], at an altitude of {{convert|1294|metre}}.&lt;ref name=gencat1/&gt; To the south, separating the valley from Berga town, is the {{Interlanguage link multi|Serra de Queralt|ca|3=Serra de Queralt (Berguedà)}} ridge, home to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Queralt Sanctuary|ca|3=Santuari de Queralt}} religious complex, and to the north are the [[Rasos de Peguera]] mountains and [[ski resort]]. Berga is {{convert|9|km}} away by road.&lt;ref name=vissir /&gt;

The tree previously dominated the valley's farmed and grazed land, due to its height and full foliage, and was visible from a long distance, as is shown in old photographs. However, much of the surrounding land has now been taken over by forest, and Pi de les Tres Branques now has many other trees in its vicinity, which, together with its current skeletal form, make it much less visible than before.

The valley is traversed by a minor road which terminates at the small settlement of [[Castellar del Riu]] at its western end.&lt;ref name=vissir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc.cat/vissir3/index.html?Y=4618295.5&amp;X=396905.5&amp;zoom=0&amp;layers=Topogr%26agrave%3Bfic,vector,Marker&amp;layers_opacity=1,1,1&amp;lang=eng|title=Local map|publisher=Cartographic and Geographic Institute of Catalonia|accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road passes close by Pi de les Tres Branques, which is indicated by a signpost.

==History==
[[File:Pi de les Tres Branques 1905.jpg|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption|Pi de les Tres Branques in about 1905]]

===Origin===
Although legend places the tree much earlier, it has been estimated that Pi de les Tres Branques took root between 1630 and 1632, when the local farmhouse was built.&lt;ref name=felipo-book/&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El Pi|author=[[:ca:Jaume Farguell i Sitges|Jaume Farguell i Sitges]]|publisher=[[:ca:Regió7|Regió7]]|language=Catalan|date=15 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural recognition===

The tree had been traditionally celebrated as a symbol of the [[Holy Trinity]], and it is still a venue for religious ceremonies. The first reference in extant records was in 1685, when a cartographer wrote that it was known as the Tree of the Trinity.&lt;ref name=felipo-book&gt;{{cite book|title=Verdaguer i el Pi de les Tres Branques|author=[[:ca:Ramon Felipó i Oriol|Ramon Felipó i Oriol]]|publisher=Llibres de l'Índex|date=December 2014|language=Catalan|isbn=9788494288920}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Erol/issue/view/21105/showToc|title=Mapes en temps de conflicte, molt més que una ratlla sobre un paper|trans-title=Maps in time of conflict, much more than a line on paper|journal=L'Erol: Revista Cultural del Berguedà|author=Rosa Serra Rotés|date=2014|issue=121|language=Catalan|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eAXw7fVI|archivedate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also recorded that in 1746, the bishop of [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]] granted [[indulgence]]s to those who prayed at the site.&lt;ref name=gencat1 /&gt;

In 1876, the landowner of the site, in a letter to a local magazine denying that he was planning to sell the tree for timber, pointed out that it also represented the revolutionary ideals of [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality and fraternity]].&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

The [[Renaixença|Catalan language cultural revival of the 19th century]] saw a great increase in Catalan literature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lletra.net/en/period/la-renaixenca|title=La Renaixença (The Catalan Cultural Renaissance)|publisher=Lletra: Catalan literature online|accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, playwright {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesc Pelagi Briz|ca}} published a play ''[[:File:Lo Pi de las Tres Brancas (1875).pdf|Lo Pi de las Tres Brancas]]'',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Spellings varied until the early-20th-century language reforms of [[Pompeu Fabra]].&lt;/ref&gt; which is set in Berga and at the tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parcsnaturals.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/Lo-pi-de-les-tres-branques-una-obra-de-teatre-de-lany-1875|title="Lo pi de les tres branques", una obra de teatre de l’any 1875|trans-title="Lo pi de les tres branques", a theatrical work from 1875|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|date=5 June 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bzXKgX0T|archivedate=2015-10-03|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains a passage suggesting that the tree was already a Catalan national symbol.&lt;ref group=note&gt;From the play (translated):&lt;br&gt;Guenyo: ... Look, see at the foot of the slope, on the plain, that gigantic pine with the half-bare stump.&lt;br&gt;Tivat: Pi de les Tres Branques.&lt;br&gt;Guenyo: You know its name?&lt;br&gt;Tivat: Every good Catalan knows it; it's the household tree.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the 1888 poem "Lo Pi de les Tres Branques" by the poet Fr [[Jacint Verdaguer]], published in his anthology ''[[:File:Pátria (1888).djvu|Pàtria]]'', which brought the tree to widespread attention, converting what was mainly a local religious symbol into a significant secular national symbol. In his poem, Jacint Verdaguer created the so-called 'legend'&lt;ref name=gencat1/&gt; of the king-child King [[James I of Aragon]] who after being released from captivity in [[Narbonne]] ([[France]]) travelled with his retinue through Catalonia back to his seat at [[Monzón]] in [[Aragon]], supposedly spending one of the nights sleeping under Pi de les Tres Branques, and it was there that he had an inspirational dream that he was destined to rule three kingdoms, represented by the three trunks of the tree, conquering the [[Balearic Islands]] and the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] from the [[Moors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parcsnaturals.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Article/LArbre-de-Mambre-i-el-Pi-de-les-Tres-Branques|title=L’Arbre de Mambré i el Pi de les Tres Branques|trans-title=The Tree of Mamre and Pi de les tres Branques|author=Ricard Estrada i Arimon|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]] (Natural parks dept.)|language=Catalan|date=13 July 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6chT8oSWa|archivedate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Les Millors Llegendes Populars|trans-title=The Best Popular Legends|page=118|author=[[Joan Amades]]|publisher=La Butxaca|date=5 November 2009|language=Catalan|isbn=9788499300252}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in fact [[James I of Aragon#Reconquest|he later achieved]].

&lt;poem&gt;
''Preguem que sia aqueix Pi''
''l'arbre sagrat de la pàtria.''

Per on baixa el Llobregat
dels Pirineus a la plana,
don Guillem de Mont-rodon
a trenc de dia davalla,
voltat de comtes i ducs
en ufanosa colcada.
De l'alta sella en l'arçó,
sobre arabesca gualdrapa,
seu en Jaume nostre rei;
no du més corona encara
que la de son cabell d'or
que algun àngel li ha deixada.
Lo tenia presoner
Narbona dins sa muralla:
al vencedor de Muret
Mont-rodon lo demanava;
Montfort no l'hi vol donar,
per gendre diu que se'l guarda.
Si serà son gendre o no
Mont-rodon ho diu al Papa;
la resposta que li fa
al vell Montfort no li agrada:
—Que torne el Rei a Aragó
i als Pirineus la seva àliga.—

Catalunya, aixeca el front,
doble sol avui t'aguaita,
lo sol que et surt a Orient
i el que t'ix a tramuntana.
Lo que et surt al Pirineu
te vol donar una ullada,
mes ell, infant de sis anys,
no vol ésser vist encara,
ja el veuran a Lleida prou
davant la cort catalana.
Abans d'arribar a Berga
s'enfilen per la muntanya,
per entre Estela i Queralt
de Campllong envers la plana;
quan són al mig de Campllong
la nit fosca és arribada.

Lo Campllong té com un breç
dues serres per barana,
per coberta un bosc de pins
verds tot l'any com l'esmaragda.
Corona immensa de tots
és una hermosa Pinassa,
pinetells semblen los pins
entorn de llur sobirana,
geganta dels Pirineus
que per sang té rius de saba.
Com una torre és son tronc
que s'esbadia en tres branques
com tres titans rabassuts
que sobre els núvols s'abracen,
per sostenir en lo cel
una cúpula de rama
que fa ombra a tot lo pla
com una nova muntanya.

Don Jaume cau de genolls
i en son èxtasis exclama:
—Al Pare, Fill i Esperit
per tots los segles hosanna!
tres persones i un sol Déu
que aquí sa firma ha posada,
com en l'arbre de Mambré
on Abraham reposava.—
Fent la senyal de la creu
se recolza a la Pinassa,
i la son del paradís
a ses parpelles davalla.
Don Guillem de Mont-rodon,
que és son àngel de la guarda,
l'abriga amb son gran escut
on vermellegen les Barres.
Alça els ulls a l'Infinit
que obira en sa tenda blava
clavetejada d'estels
i al cim lluna minvanta.

En dolça contemplació
lo sorprèn lo bes de l'alba;
al bes de l'alba i al seu
don Jaume se desvetllava:
—He somniat que era gran
i d'un bell país monarca,
d'un bell país com aqueix
entre el mar i la muntanya.
Com eix Pi meravellós,
mon regne posà tres branques,
foren tres regnes en un,
ma corona els coronava.—
Esbrinant somni tan dolç
lo sol li dóna a la cara
i esporuguida a ponent
la mitja lluna s'amaga.
Lo somni del rei infant
lo vell templari l'acaba
en extàtica oració,
espill de visió més clara.
Veu Catalunya la gran
fer-se més gran i més ampla,
robant als moros València,
prenent-los l'Illa Daurada.
Unides veu a les tres
com les tres cordes d'una arpa,
les tres nimfes d'eixa mar,
d'aqueix jardí les tres Gràcies.
Mes al veure desvetllar
lo lligador d'eixa garba,
profeta, al Conqueridor
sols li diu eixa paraula:
—Preguem, que sols Déu és gran,
los homes són ombra vana;
preguem que sia aqueix Pi
l'arbre sagrat de la pàtria.—
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
''We pray that this Pine will be''
''the sacred tree of the fatherland.''

Where the [[Llobregat]] descends
from the [[Pyrenees]] to the plain,
Sir [[:ca:Guillem de Mont-rodon|William of Mont-rodon]]
goes down at break of day,
surrounded by counts and dukes
in a pompous cavalcade.
On the pillion of the high saddle,
over an arabesque blanket,
sits James our king;
he wears no more crown
than that of his golden hair
that some angel has loaned him.
He was held prisoner
inside the walls of [[Narbonne]]:
to the [[battle of Muret|victor of Muret]]
Mont-rodon asks for him back;
[[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Montfort]] will not give him back,
saying he is growing up into a son-in-law.
Will he be a son-in-law or not
Mont-rodon asks the Pope;
the reply he gives him
does not please old Montfort:
—The King should return to [[Aragon]]
and his eagle to the Pyrenees.—

Catalonia, raise your brow,
a double sun watches over you today,
the sun which rises for you in the east
and the one that appears in the north.
The one that comes from the Pyrenees
wants to have a look at you,
but he, infant of six years,
does not want to be seen yet,
as they will see him full well at [[Lleida]]
before the Catalan court.
Before arriving at Berga
they climb through the mountains,
between [[:ca:Cogulló d'Estela|Estela]] and [[:ca:Serra de Queralt (Berguedà)|Queralt]]
towards the plain of Campllong;
on reaching the middle of Campllong
the dark night has arrived.

Campllong has like a cradle
two ridges as a railing,
for cover a forest of pines
green all year like an emerald.
The biggest crown of all
is a beautiful Great Pine,
other trees look like mushrooms
around their overlord,
giantess of the Pyrenees
who has rivers of sap for blood.
Its trunk is like a tower
that splits into three branches
like three stout [[Titan (mythology)|titans]]
embracing above the clouds,
to support in the sky
a dome of branches
casting a shadow over the whole plain
like a new mountain.

King James falls to his knees
and in his ecstasy exclaims:
—To the Father, Son and Spirit
through all the ages [[hosanna]]!
three persons and only one God
who has put his signature here,
like on the tree of [[Mamre]]
where Abraham rested.—
Making the sign of the cross
he rests against the Great Pine,
and the sleep of paradise
descends on his eyelids.
Sir William of Mont-rodon,
who is his guardian angel,
covers him with his big shield
where the [[Coat of arms of Catalonia|Bars]] blaze red.
He raises his eyes to the Infinite
which he discerns in its blue canopy
studded with stars
and at the summit a waning moon.

In sweet contemplation
the kiss of dawn surprises him;
at dawn's kiss and his kiss
King James awakens:
—I dreamed that I was great
and monarch of a beautiful country,
of a beautiful country like this
between the sea and the mountain.
Like this wonderful Pine,
my kingdom had three branches,
they were three kingdoms in one,
my crown crowned them.—
Finding this dream so sweet
the sun shines on his face
and frightened at the west
the half-moon hides.
The dream of the infant king
is finished by the old [[Knights Templar|Templar]]
in an ecstatic speech,
mirror of a clearer vision.
He sees the great Catalonia
make itself greater and bigger,
stealing [[Valencia]] from the [[Moors]],
taking from them the [[Mallorca|Golden Island]].
He sees all three united
like the three strings of a harp,
the [[Thriae|three nymphs]] of that sea,
the [[Charites|three Graces]] of that garden.
But seeing awake
the binder of that sheaf,
a prophet, the Conqueror
says to him only these words:
—We pray, since only God is great,
men are a feeble shadow;
we pray that this Pine will be
the sacred tree of the fatherland.—
&lt;/poem&gt;

The previous year, Verdaguer had stayed a few days in the nearby Queralt Sanctuary and visited the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://raco.cat/index.php/Erol/issue/view/13322/showToc|title=Les estades de Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer al Berguedà|trans-title=Fr Cinto Verdaguer's stays in Berguedà|journal=L'Erol: Revista Cultural del Berguedà|author=Josep Noguera i Canal|date=1994|issue=44|language=Catalan|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6epY8Nidx|archivedate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lo Pi de les Tres Branques" recounts the story of James and the tree's symbolism of the Trinity and the unity of the Catalan Countries, and expressed the wish that it be adopted as Catalonia's national tree. The poem has remained the tree's principal literary connection, regularly recited at gatherings there.&lt;ref name=elpunt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/556904-vora-un-simbol-dunitat-dels-paisos-catalans.html|title=Vora un símbol d'unitat dels Països Catalans|trans-title=Beside a symbol of unity of the Catalan Countries|publisher=[[El Punt]]|language=Catalan|date=15 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSIVBJm9|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It starts and ends with the often-quoted lines "Preguem que sia aqueix Pi / l'arbre sagrat de la pàtria." ("We pray that this Pine will be / the sacred tree of the fatherland.").

It is accepted that in fact Verdaguer invented the story of James's sojourn for his poem, since there is no record of it before then, and that the poem's popularity created the legend.&lt;ref name=lerol-21-23/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tasta.cat/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tasta03.pdf|title=El Pi de les Tres Branques, un símbol viu|trans-title=Pi de les Tres Branques, a symbol lives|journal=Tasta: El Berguedà|author=Quirze Grifell|date=Summer 2008|issue=3|language=Catalan|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LCWMMXPf|archivedate=2013-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

In 1901, when Verdaguer was presiding at the [[Floral Games]], a traditional Catalan poetry contest, he coined the sobriquet "Guernica of Catalonia" for the tree, referring to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Tree of Guernica]], an oak tree which symbolises Basque freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.324.cat/noticia/24462/altres/Berga-recorda-Verdaguer-i-el-Pi-de-les-Tres-Branques-amb-una-exposicio-a-lOficina-de-Turisme|title=Berga recorda Verdaguer i el Pi de les Tres Branques amb una exposició a l'Oficina de Turisme|trans-title=Berga remembers Verdaguer and Pi de les Tres Branques with an exhibition at the Tourism Office|publisher=[[TV3 (Catalonia)]]|date=9 November 2006|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSJEq2Lr|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggested the tree's trunks symbolised the three major awards of the contest: country, faith, and love.&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://raco.cat/index.php/Erol/issue/view/13416/showToc|title=El Pi de les Tres Branques i Mn.

In May 1901 the landowner transferred ownership of the tree to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Catalanist Union|ca|3=Unió Catalanista}} (''Unió Catalanista''), a grouping of various nationalist organisations, at their meeting in [[Terrassa]], though the transaction was never legally registered.&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|4}}
This new popularity coincided with the slow decay of the tree, which eventually died in 1915.&lt;ref name=gencat1/&gt;

In 1987 the [[Generalitat|Catalan regional government]] listed the tree as a protected "monumental tree", one of the first three such trees (along with Pi Jove and ''Roure de Can Codorniu'' in [[Sant Sadurní d'Anoia]]).&lt;ref name=gencat1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogc.gencat.cat/ca/pdogc_canals_interns/pdogc_resultats_fitxa/?action=fitxa&amp;documentId=34301|title=Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya: ORDRE de 20 d'octubre de 1987, sobre declaració d'arbres monumentals|trans-title=Order of 20 October 1987, concerning declaration of monumental trees|date=20 October 1987|publisher=Generalitat of Catalonia|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fGtIwjnX|archivedate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A silhouette of Pi de les Tres Branques (while it was alive) is now used by the government as a generic logo for monumental trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parcsnaturals.gencat.cat/web/.content/home/coneix-nos/arbres_monumentals/per_saber_ne_mes/altres_fonts_dinformacio/catam_inf_2_3_20130131a.pdf|title=Arbres monumentals: Information sources|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eMyKeT4b|archivedate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage and death===
Before its death, Pi de les Tres Branques had been attacked several times, for economic and/or political reasons.

[[File:Pi de les Tres Branques (abans 1915).jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Pi de les Tres Branques, already dead, with the 1907 wall in place]]
In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer reported that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut down one of the trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover.&lt;ref name=quanvamorir/&gt;{{rp|2}} It was also reported that around 1895, cuts had been made to [[resin extraction|tap the tree for resin]], and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree.&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|5}} By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Erol/article/view/169597/250119|title=Jaume Huch i Guixer, fotògraf (1)|trans-title=Jaume Huch i Guixer, photographer|journal=L'Erol: Revista Cultural del Berguedà|author=Domènic Huch, Jaume Huch|date=1983|issue=6|language=Catalan|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6coms280e|archivedate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;as shown in the photograph in the cited source, also seen at [[:File:Pi de les Tres Branques 1915.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, it was reported that the tree had lost its leaves, though others suggest a date of 1913, and it was completely dead by 1915.&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name=quanvamorir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festes.org/arxius/pitresbranques.pdf|title=Quan va morir El Pi de les Tres Branques?|trans-title=When did Pi de les Tres Branques die?|author=[[:ca:Ramon Felipó i Oriol|Ramon Felipó i Oriol]]|publisher=Rebombori Digital|date=June 2008|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSJzXTRk|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scots pines have a natural lifespan of up to over 700 years, depending on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_sylvestris.php|title=Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) description|author=Christopher J.

Many years later,&lt;ref group=note&gt;An anonymous internet forum comment says in the 1940s [http://www.racocatala.cat/forums/fil/45784/estat-del-pi-les-tres-branques]&lt;/ref&gt; the trunk that was damaged as reported by Verdaguer, was struck by [[lightning]] and the top half broke off.&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|6}} The remnant of that trunk is still supported by a small stone wall.

===Later damage===
[[File:Restauració Pi 3 Branques - 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=refer to caption|Preparing to restore the severed trunk, July 2015]]
Following its death, the tree has continued to be attacked many times by elements opposed to its political symbolism.

In 1939, after the end of the Civil War, supporters of the victorious [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] started an attempt to topple the tree, but were repelled by local people.&lt;ref name=gencat1 /&gt; It has also been subject to regular minor damage such as [[anti-Catalanism|anti-Catalan]] graffiti.

However, the most serious deliberate damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a [[chainsaw]], by unknown perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4190898/20140513/symbolic-tree-representing-catalan-countries-vandalized.html|title=Symbolic tree, representing Catalan Countries, vandalized|publisher=[[VilaWeb]]|date=13 May 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PeG1kYfk|archivedate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/05/13/catalunya/1399979176_682805.html|title=Los Mossos buscan a los autores del ataque contra el Pi de les Tres Branques|trans-title=The Police seek the perpetrators of the attack against Pi de les Tres Branques|author=Maiol Roger|publisher=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=13 May 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PeGDlghI|archivedate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work was carried out in early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the [[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona provincial]] administration.&lt;ref name=regio7-repairs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regio7.cat/bergueda/2015/07/08/pi-vell-tres-branques-recupera/321104.html|title=El Pi de les Tres Branques torna a fer honor al seu nom|trans-title=Pi de les Tres Branques honours its name again|publisher=[[:ca:Regió7|Regió7]]|language=Catalan|date=9 July 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aEagG4F4|archivedate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the tree was again attacked (along with Pi Jove) with a 10&amp;nbsp;cm chainsaw cut into one of the other trunks. This damage was quickly patched up with steel straps as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regio7.cat/bergueda/2016/02/09/subjecten-ferules-metalliques-brac-serrat/348242.html|title=Fotogaleria: Subjecten amb fèrules el braç serrat del Pi de les Tres Branques|trans-title=Photo gallery: Steel straps are applied to the cut branch of Pi de les Tres Branques|publisher=[[:ca:Regió7|Regió7]]|language=Catalan|date=9 February 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fRq7k8aq|archivedate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Pi de les Tres Branques, another three-branched pine {{convert|300|metre}} away had been adopted as its successor.&lt;ref name=naciodigital/&gt; ''Pi Jove de les Tres Branques'', or ''Pi de les Tres Branques II'', is also hundreds of years old, but smaller at {{convert|19|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=gencat2 /&gt; Its similarities to the main tree had been noticed as far back as 1810, when the [[Baron of Maldà]] mentioned it in his diary.&lt;ref name=elmati&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmati.cat/article/4657/el-pi-jove-de-les-tres-branques|title=El Pi Jove de les Tres Branques|author=[[:ca:Ramon Felipó i Oriol|Ramon Felipó i Oriol]]|publisher=El Matí Digital|language=Catalan|date=19 June 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dR9delnv|archivedate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1921 rally at the site, following a campaign by poet-politician [[Ventura Gassol]], Pi Jove was inaugurated as the successor to the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited the landowner, who was present, to donate the tree to the [[Commonwealth of Catalonia]] (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical effort is more important than symbols.&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|7}}

It has since become the main attraction for younger and more radical elements of the nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=festes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festes.org/articles.php?id=673|title=Aplec del Pi de les Tres Branques|author=Bernat Ferrer i Frigola|publisher=Rebombori Digital|date=22 May 2007|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSJd1RS0|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/naciobergueda/noticia/2536/intenten/serrar/branques/pi/jove|title=Intenten serrar unes de les branques del Pi Jove|trans-title=Attempt made to saw off one of the branches of Pi Jove|author=Aida Morales|publisher=[[:ca:Nació Digital|Nació Digital]]|language=Catalan|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older and younger trees are often simply called "el Pi Vell" (the old pine) and "el Pi Jove" (the young pine) respectively, to distinguish the two.

Along with Pi Vell, Pi Jove was registered as a protected "monumental tree" in 1987.&lt;ref name=gencat2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parcsnaturals.gencat.cat/web/.content/home/coneix-nos/arbres_monumentals/arbres_monumentals_fitxes/bergueda/pi_de_les_tres_branques_ii/am1405002f.pdf|title=Arbre Monumental: Pi de les Tres Branques II (Pi Jove)|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6c0giVLRS|archivedate=2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Unlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove had escaped the attentions of vandals until more recently, due to its lower political profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a circumferential cut through the [[Bark (botany)|bark]], in addition to apparent [[shotgun]] damage.&lt;ref name=elmati/&gt; Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting to saw through one of its trunks, though it was not thought that the damage was serious enough to kill the affected trunk. As a precaution, in December 2015 [[arborist]]s installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and ensure their stability.&lt;ref name=naciodigital&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/naciobergueda/noticia/4207/experts/asseguren/pi/jove/es/mant/amb/vida/despr/atac|title=Els experts asseguren que el Pi Jove es manté amb vida després de l'atac|trans-title=Experts satisfied that Pi Jove remains alive following the attack|author=Aida Morales|publisher=[[:ca:Nació Digital|Nació Digital]]|language=Catalan|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged trunk which are believed harsh enough to kill the trunk altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.&lt;ref name=tv3-feb16 /&gt;

==The annual gathering==
Pi de les Tres Branques, as a symbol of the united Catalan Countries, or simply of Catalan self-determination, has been the site of large political rallies since the turn of the 20th century, at first sporadically, but annually since 1980.&lt;ref name=enciclopedia /&gt;

The first record of a political assembly there was in October 1900, when a large&lt;ref group=note&gt;between 50 and 400, depending on the sources&lt;/ref&gt; group of [[Carlist]] troops, led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Josep Grandia|ca|3=Josep Grandia i Soler}}, based themselves there in preparation for their part in the failed {{Interlanguage link multi|October 1900 Carlist uprising|es|3=Sublevación carlista de octubre de 1900|lt=Carlist uprising}}.&lt;ref name=felipo-book/&gt;{{rp|119–122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001284393|title=El Carlismo en Armas|trans-title=Carlism at Arms|journal=[[:es:Nuevo Mundo (revista)|Nuevo Mundo]]|pages=14–15|date=7 November 1900|language=Spanish|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuevo_mundo_%28Madrid%29._7-11-1900.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major rally was in 1904 when the Catalanist Union organised an assembly there to celebrate its acquisition of the site, on Sunday 25 September. The ceremony, and associated events in Berga the day before, attracted several hundred activists, with messages from foreign sympathisers being read out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Joventut_no._242,_1904-09-29.pdf|title=La Festa del Pi de las Tres Brancas|journal=Joventut: Periòdich catalanista|author=Arnau Martínez y Seriñá|date=29 September 1904|issue=242|language=Catalan|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Another rally was held in 1915.&lt;ref name=lerol-21-23&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://raco.cat/index.php/Erol/issue/view/13416/showToc|title=Les set ombres de les tres branques|trans-title=The seven shadows of the three branches|journal=L'Erol: Revista Cultural del Berguedà|author=Jan Grau|date=2002|issue=72|language=Catalan|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSLz3RxT|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

The next major rally was held in 1921, on 25 July, the [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] holiday;&lt;ref name=lerol-10-20/&gt;{{rp|7}} a key point of that event included the inauguration of Pi Jove as the intended replacement for the original tree.

Subsequent political developments made it difficult to hold large organised rallies at the site. Catalan political gatherings were banned during the 1923–1930 dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], travel was difficult during the 1936–1939 [[Spanish Civil War]], and political gatherings were again banned in [[Francoist Spain]] (1939–1975) and for some time after.&lt;ref name=festes /&gt;

It was not until 1980, following the [[Spanish transition to democracy|restoration of democracy in Spain]], that the first annual gathering of the modern era took place, starting a tradition of a large gathering at the site on the third Sunday of July each year.&lt;ref name=enciclopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0050841.xml?s.q=pi+de+les+tres+branques|title=el Pi de les Tres Branques|publisher=[[Enciclopèdia Catalana]]|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSIisH6H|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It attracts Catalan nationalists of many different viewpoints, including those attending a [[mass (Catholic Church)|mass]], political activists from the entire nationalist spectrum left and right giving speeches, organisations hosting stands and selling political books and souvenirs, and performers of traditional Catalan cultural activities such as ''[[sardana]]'' bands and dancers, ''[[castell]]ers'' (human towers), and ''[[gegants]]'' (giant puppets).

Because of the shortage of parking at the site, [[shuttle bus]]es are provided by Berga town council, who also organise catering for the crowds in the town after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajberga.cat/ajberga/agenda/detall.php?apartat=&amp;activitat=909|title=Aplec Pi de les Tres Branques 2015|publisher=Berga town council|language=Catalan|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6carOfl4M|archivedate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Events at the gathering have several times resulted in controversies, and clashes between rival political factions. Following the 1981 event, the Catalan parliament president [[Heribert Barrera]], two parliamentary deputies, and several others, faced criminal charges of "insulting the feelings and unity of the Spanish nation and distributing illegal publications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1982/02/11/espana/382230013_850215.html|title=Barrera quiere declarar ante un tribunal que aun no existe|publisher=[[El País]]|trans-title=Barrera wants to answer charges at a court which does not yet exist|date=11 February 1982|language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6emf0vH9h|archivedate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dropped after three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://raco.cat/index.php/Erol/issue/view/20986/showToc|title=Preguem que sia aquest pi l'arbre sagrat de la Pàtria|trans-title=We pray that this pine will be the sacred tree of the fatherland|author=[[:ca:Ramon Felipó i Oriol|Ramon Felipó i Oriol]]|journal=L'Erol: Revista Cultural del Berguedà|date=2014|issue=120|language=Catalan|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6epUdBWGe|archivedate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 gathering was marred by the [[flag desecration|burning]] of Spanish flags and harassment of moderate groups.

==Management and development plans==
Although both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, they are easily accessible in an isolated wooded area, and therefore vulnerable to vandalism as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire. Several proposals have been made over the years to improve the site.

Around 1990, a private business identified the Campllong valley, with Pi de les Tres Branques as a central attraction, as one of the possible locations for a large-scale Catalan-identity [[theme park]] called "Identirama". A different site was eventually selected, but the project was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca-paginas.lavanguardia.com/LVE01/PUB/1999/10/20/TAR19991020-001.pdf|title=El Port Aventura que no fue|trans-title=The Port Aventura that never was|author=Enric Alfonso|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|format=PDF|date=20 October 1999|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6emsRTHxN|archivedate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Catalan parliament]] passed a resolution urging development of a government plan to improve the site. A government report in 2001, re-published in 2004, included a proposal to cut down the fragile Pi Vell, leaving the stump in place along with a commemorative monument, and purchase and develop the site as a public amenity.&lt;ref name=felipo-book/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regio7.mynewsonline.com/?method=content&amp;ref=RE7201003060002|title=El Berguedà exigeix protecció al Pi de les Tres Branques, que és monumental des del 1987|trans-title=Berguedà urges protection for Pi de les Branques, which is a monument since 1987|author=Pilar Marquez|publisher=[[:ca:Regió7|Regió7]]|language=Catalan|date=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack on Pi Jove in 2010 prompted activists to complain about perceived ongoing lack of action by the authorities, and prompted the local municipality of [[Castellar del Riu]] to start work with interested parties to develop a plan to secure the site. In 2012 the mayor announced plans to take over the maintenance of the land around the two trees and develop facilities for visitors, including a car park and information panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/44697/ara/parc/tematic/tres/branques|title=I ara... el parc temàtic del Pi de les Tres Branques!|trans-title=And now... the Pi de les Tres Branques theme park!|publisher=[[:ca:Nació Digital|Nació Digital]]|language=Catalan|date=13 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSMcKQCB|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, following the serious attack on Pi Vell ten months before, the government set up a working group consisting of representatives of the Barcelona provincial administration, the local municipality, and the [[Institute of Catalan Studies]], to manage the maintenance and protection of the two trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogc.gencat.cat/ca/pdogc_canals_interns/pdogc_resultats_fitxa/?action=fitxa&amp;documentId=710168|title=Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya: Resolució ARP/2770/2015|publisher=Generalitat of Catalonia|language=Catalan|date=30 November 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fGqe36sI|archivedate=2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first result was the repair of the damaged tree in July, and in February 2016 they decided to place [[Closed-circuit television|video security cameras]] at the site, watching both trees.&lt;ref name=tv3-feb16&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccma.cat/324/el-pi-de-les-tres-branques-estara-vigilat-amb-cameres/noticia/2714095/|title=El Pi de les Tres Branques estarà vigilat amb càmeres|trans-title=Pi de les Tres Branques will be watched with cameras|publisher=[[TV3 (Catalonia)]]|language=Catalan|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other associated three-branched pines==
Another similarly named tree is ''Pi de les Tres Branques de Freixinet'', located near the village of Freixinet in the municipality of [[Riner]] in central Catalonia.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Coordinates: {{coord|41.931758|1.573682|name=Pi de les Tres Branques de Freixinet}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tree is also protected by the Catalan government, since 1988, but was killed in a [[forest fire]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/parcsnaturals/Home/Coneix-nos/Arbres_monumentals/Arbres_monumentals_declarats/Solsones/Pi%20de%20les%20Tres%20Branques%20de%20Freixenet/am3518601_pi_tres_branques_freixinet_m.pdf|title=Pi de les Tres Branques de Freixinet|publisher=[[Generalitat of Catalonia]]|language=Catalan|date=22 September 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FSL698Oq|archivedate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, local bodies such as the municipality of Castellar del Riu or Berga or the local branch of the [[Catalan National Assembly]], have adopted the practice of presenting a young three-branched pine tree or sapling claimed to be a descendant of Pi de les Tres Branques to other bodies, as symbols of solidarity. Early examples include presentations to the [[Castle of Gallifa]] in 1986, and the Castle of St. Ferran in Berga in 1992 (along with a sapling of the Tree of Guernica).&lt;ref name=felipo-book/&gt;{{rp|17}} The practice gained momentum following the February 2014 presentation of a young tree to the town of [[Folgueroles]], to commemorate Jacint Verdaguer who was born there; that tree has since been vandalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/osona/noticia/43084/mutilen/pi/tres/branques/folgueroles|title=Mutilen el Pi de les Tres Branques de Folgueroles|trans-title=Pi de les Tres Branques of Folgueroles is mutilated|publisher=Nació Digital|language=Catalan|date=16 September 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XifwDHim|archivedate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent 2014 recipients have included [[Andorra la Vella]], [[Sant Hipòlit de Voltregà]], and [[Saldes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/societat/Mutilen-pi-tres-branques-Folgueroles_0_1213678744.html|title=Mutilen el pi de les tres branques de Folgueroles|trans-title=Pi de les Tres Branques of Folgueroles is mutilated|publisher=[[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]]|language=catalan|date=17 September 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XigdkVZA|archivedate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forest Museum in [[Sant Celoni]] also claims to have five descendants of Pi de les Tres Branques in its grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140515/54406947871/nietos-pi-de-les-tres-branques-sant-celoni.html|title=Cinco nietos del Pi de les Tres Branques crecen vigorosos en Sant Celoni|trans-title=Five grandchildren of Pi de les Tres Branques grow vigorously in Sant Celoni|author=Sílvia Hinojosa|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|date=15 May 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eJgq2uJo|archivedate=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prehistoric Park''''' is a six-part [[docu-fiction]] [[television mini-series]] that premiered on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 July 2006 and on [[Animal Planet]] on 29 October 2006. The program was produced by [[Impossible Pictures]], who also created ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]''. Each episode is an hour long including commercial breaks. Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]].

The program is narrated by [[David Jason]] and presented by [[Nigel Marven]]. The fictional component is the theme that Nigel goes back to various geological time periods through a space-[[time portal]], and brings live specimens of extinct animals back to the present day, where they are exhibited in a [[wildlife park]] named Prehistoric Park, which is a big area between high steep mountains and ocean, with varied environments, in what looks like [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province in [[South Africa]].

==Story==
The story, which is told in the style of a documentary, focuses on naturalist Nigel Marven leading missions to find and collect extinct animals from the distant past by use of a time machine. The animals are then placed in the confines of Prehistoric Park, a private wildlife park that is situated in a dry, mountainous region of an unspecified part of the world. Marven's core motivation in the series is to defy extinction and to give select extinct species a second chance at life.

==Characters==
* [[Nigel Marven]] as himself - the main presenter of the show.
* Rod Arthur as Bob - the long-suffering head keeper at the park. In charge of feeding, cleaning and controlling the animals in the park.
* Suzanne McNabb as Suzanne - the head veterinarian. Responsible for treating animals when they're sick or injured.
* Morgan Williams as Ben - one of Nigel's crew. Four ''[[Mei long]]'' attacked him for meat in his backpack. Introduced in episode 3.
* [[Saba Douglas-Hamilton]] as herself - a big cat specialist, whom Nigel invites back to catch [[Smilodon]] in episode 4.
* Unknown as Bill - a crew member who travels back with Nigel. Introduced in episode 5.
* Unknown as Jim - an associate of Nigel who travels with him through time. Also introduced in episode 5.

There are various other staff members, but none of their names have been given. One of the more prominent is Suzanne's blonde assistant, who appears in all episodes except episode 1.

==Locations within the park==
{{main article|List of locations in Prehistoric Park}}
When the animals are brought back to the park, they are placed into a nearby enclosure. The enclosures are named after the extinct animals that they are housing.
* '''Mammoth Mount''': This enclosure houses the park's [[woolly mammoth]] Martha.
* '''T. rex Hill''': T. rex Hill is home to the park's pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', Terence and Matilda.
* '''Big Cat Climb''': This two part enclosure features a pair of breeding [[sabre-tooth cat]]s.
* '''Triceratops Creek''': Theo is the resident ''[[Triceratops]]'' at Triceratops Creek.
* '''Deinosuchus Dip''': This is a huge lake, where the park's ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' is kept.
* '''Ornithomimus Pond''': This paddock features a herd of ''[[Ornithomimus]]''.
* '''The Bug House''': This state of the art enclosure keeps its Carboniferous period creatures safe. Its oxygen levels inside are double what they are today, and this keeps the ''[[Arthropleura]]'', ''[[Meganeura]]'' and ''[[Pulmonoscorpius]]'' happy.

'''Pseudosenility''' also '''reversible dementia''' is a condition where older people are in a state of [[memory loss]], [[Mental confusion|confusion]], or [[Disorientation#Disorientation|disorientation]] that may have a cause other than the ordinary [[Ageing|aging process]].&lt;ref name=libow1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Libow |first=LS |date=1973-03-21 |title=Pseudo-senility: acute and reversible organic brain syndromes |publisher=American Geriatric Society |pmid = 4702407 |volume=21 |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |pages=112–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1973.tb00855.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the term "reversible dementia" is used to describe most cases.&lt;ref name="Nixon, S.J. 1996 pp. 107-130"&gt;Nixon, S.J. (1996) Secondary dementias: reversible dementias and pseudomentia in R.L. Adams, O.A. Parsons, J.L. Culbertson &amp; S.J. Nixon (Eds.) ''Neuropsychology for Clinical Practice: etiology, assessment, and treatment of common neurological disorder''. (pp. 107-130). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;  A more specific term "Pseudodementia" is referring to "behavioral changes that resembler those of the progressive degenerative dementias, but which are attributable to so-called functional causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, R.D., Tranel, D., Benton, A. &amp; Paulsen, J |title=Differentiating dementia from "pseudodementia" early in the clinical course: utility of neuropsychological tests. |journal=Neuropsychology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |year=1992 |doi=10.1037/0894-4105.6.1.13 |issn=1931-1559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reports that illnesses such as the [[Influenza|flu]] and [[hydrocephalus]], as well as side-effects to common medications, can produce symptoms in the elderly that are difficult to distinguish from ordinary [[dementia]] caused by aging. However, if the real cause of the effects is caught early enough, the effects can be reversed.&lt;ref name=isisnt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/when-it-isnt-really-senility/ |title=When It Isn't Really Senility |last=Henig |first=Robin Marantz |date=2009-03-11 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alfoa&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-03-17 |url=http://www.alfa.org/alfa/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=39&amp;SnID=3 |title=Caregivers May Observe 'Pseudosenility' |publisher=Assisted Living Federation of America |accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to studies cited in Cunha (1990), approximate 10% to 30% of patients who have exhibited symptoms of dementia might have a treatable or reversible pathologic process to some extent.&lt;ref name="Cunha, U.G.V. 1990 261–263"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cunha, U.G.V. |title=An investigation of dementia among elderly outpatients |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=261–263 |year=1990 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb03063.x |issn=1600-0447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
It should be noticed that describing the causation of reversible dementia is extremely difficult due to the complicated biopsychological systems and the hard-to-define collection of factors associated with cognitive decline. 
Roughly, the etiological factors that contribute to cognitive decline could be assigned into four categories: chemical, environmental, physical, and psychiatric. Chemical intoxication might be attributed to anesthesia, alcohol, heavy metal and commonly used medications.  Jenike (1988) has recorded a certain amount of medications which may induce cognitive change in elder people.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, T.L. (1987) Dementia. in R.E. Hales &amp; S.C. Yudofsky (Eds), ''Textbook of neuropsychiatry'' (pp.107-124). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sources include overstimulation, radical changes in lifestyle, and sensory impairment. Physical disorders which are mostly induced by the aging process, consist of thyroid and other endocrine-system deprivation; metabolic disturbance, and vitamin deficiency. Psychiatric disorders, such as chronic schizophrenia and depression could also produce cognitive decline.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

In summary, the etiological factors of reversible dementia are various, subtle and frequently interactive. Therefore, in-depth medical and psychosocial evaluations are vital for accurate diagnosis and treatment design. It is important for families and patients to understand the difficulties in determining an correct diagnosis and be prepared for probable frustration and confusion during evaluation and assessment process.&lt;ref name="Nixon, S.J. 1996 pp. 107-130"/&gt;

==Differentiating Pseudodementia from Dementia==
As certain of pseudodementia remains potentially treatable, it is essential that they are distinguished from primarily dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), and multi-infarct dementia (MID). For instance, pseudodementia associated with depression (DD) has been found as the most frequently appearing, while as many as 10% to 20% patients are misdiagnosed as primary degenerative dementia (PDD) or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=desRosiers, G. |title=Primary or depressive dementia: psychometric assessment |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=307–343 |year=1992 |doi=10.1016/0272-7358(92)90140-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant overlapping in cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction in DD and PDD patients seemed to increase the difficulty in diagnosis. However, differences in the severity of impairment and quality of patients' responses could be observed, and DD patients exhibited a greater depressive symptomatology. Additionally, a test of antisaccadic movements may be used to differentiate DD from PDD patients. as PDD patients significantly display poorer performance on this test.&lt;ref name="Nixon, S.J. 1996 pp. 107-130"/&gt; A general comparison between aspects of DD and PDD is shown below.

In general, pseudodementia patients present a considerable cognitive deficits, including disorders in learning, memory and psychomotor performance. Substantial evidences from brain imaging such as CT scanning and positron emission tomography (PET) have also revealed abnormalities in brain structure and function.&lt;ref name="Nixon, S.J. 1996 pp. 107-130"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Since the term of "reversible" has been used, it simply implies a high possibility of recovery from the disease. Cunha (1990) examined the recovery process of 26 patients with reversible dementia. Unfortunately, only 2 patients have found as return to normal function indicated by the MMSE scores.&lt;ref name="Cunha, U.G.V. 1990 261–263"/&gt;  Poor results have also been reported in Copeland et al. (1992)'s studies, as 1 out of 21 DD patients had fully recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Copeland, J.R.M., Davidson, I.A., Dewey, M.E., Gilmore, C., Larkin, B.A., McWilliam, C., Saunders, P.A., Scott, A., Sharma, V., &amp; Sullivan, C. |title=Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, depression and pseudodementia: prevalence, incidence and three-year outcome in Liverpool. |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=Aug |pages=230–239 |year=1992 |doi=10.1192/bjp.161.2.230 |issn=1472-1465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, attention should be arisen that the diagnosis of reversible or pseudodementia needs to be given with extreme care, and the recovery pattern for individual patient remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Nixon, S.J. 1996 pp. 107-130"/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Dolgov was born into a family of [[farmer]]s in the village of Bogoyavlenskoye (now Dolgovo) in [[Zemetchinsky District]], [[Penza Oblast]].  He served with the [[Soviet airborne]]  in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="warheroes"/&gt; In January 1945, Dolgov became a company commander in the [[350th Guards Rifle Regiment]] of the [[114th Guards Airborne Division|114th Guards  Rifle Division]]. Dolgov participated in the [[Budapest Offensive]] and the [[Vienna Offensive]]. On 6 April, Dolgov reportedly knocked out a self-propelled gun and killed 40 German soldiers. He was wounded but allegedly refused to leave the battlefield. Dolgov graduated from the [[Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="warheroes" /&gt;

He reportedly designed the [[ejection seat]]s for the [[Vostok spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Der Spiegel]]|title=DER SPIEGEL 47/1962 - PJOTR IWANOWITSCH DOLGOW|issue=47|date=21 November 1962|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45125021.html|language=German|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 1 November 1962, Dolgov and [[Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev|Eugene Andreyev]] ascended in a Volga [[balloon]] gondola from [[Volsk]], near [[Saratov]],&lt;ref name="StratoCat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/globos/1962e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloons launched worldwide in 1962|year=2012|publisher=StratoCat|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make high-altitude parachute jumps. Andreyev successfully completed his jump. Dolgov, testing an experimental [[pressure suit]], jumped at 28,640 meters (93,970&amp;nbsp;ft).  The helmet visor of Dolgov's pressure suit hit part of the gondola as he exited, and the suit depressurized, killing him.&lt;ref name="warheroes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Astronautix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vector Site"/&gt;  On 12 December 1962, Dolgov was posthumously named a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="warheroes"/&gt;

If Dolgov's jump had been successful, he still would not have exceeded the record set by [[Joseph Kittinger]] for the highest-altitude parachute jump in history (31,300 meters, 16 August 1960). The current world record is held by [[Alan Eustace]] (41,425 meters, 24 October 2014).

==Legacy==
At the time of Dolgov's death, the [[Soviet Army]] newspaper ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda|Red Star]]'' announced that he had died in the course of "carrying out his duties".&lt;ref name="Spiegel"/&gt; Over the years there have been [[Lost cosmonauts|false reports]] that Dolgov actually died on 11 October 1960, in a failed flight of a Vostok spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Astronautix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vector Site"/&gt;

A fictionalized version of Dolgov's death (incorrectly dated in February 1961) appears in the short story "[[The Chief Designer (novella)|The Chief Designer]]" by [[Andy Duncan (writer)|Andy Duncan]], which was published in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine and was a [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] finalist.

{{Texas History}}

'''Richard Andrews''' (died October 28, 1835) was the first Texian killed during the [[Texas Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna J. Hardwicke Pennybacker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xDwVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+History+of+Texas+for+Schools&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ymJRU53OL4OdyASt8YGQDQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20History%20of%20Texas%20for%20Schools&amp;f=false A History of Texas for Schools]''. rev. ed. Austin, TX: Author, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Andrews, an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] fighter, joined the Texian army at the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Andrews was nicknamed "Big Dick" because of his large size and great strength. He was wounded in the [[Battle of Gonzales]] on October 2, 1835. He fought at the [[Battle of Concepcion|Battle of Concepción]] on October 28, 1835, where he was the only Texian killed in the battle.

A memorial to Captain Andrews was erected by the State of Texas and stands approximately .15 miles west of Mission Road on E. Theo Avenue near Concepcion Park, in [[San Antonio, Texas]].

[[Andrews County, Texas]], and its county seat, [[Andrews, Texas]], were named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarpley|first=Fred|title=1001 Texas Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4B7n7pJyZIC&amp;pg=PA11|date=5 July 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-78693-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Roadside Memorial.JPG|thumb|Roadside memorial, [[Virginia]], United States]]
A '''roadside memorial''' is a marker that usually commemorates a site where a person died suddenly and unexpectedly, away from home.  Unlike a grave site headstone, which marks where a body is laid, the memorial marks the last place on earth where a person was alive&amp;nbsp;– although in the past travelers were, out of necessity, often buried where they fell.

Usually the memorial is created and maintained by family members or friends of the person who died. A common type of memorial is simply a bunch of flowers, real or plastic, taped to [[street furniture]] or a tree trunk. A handwritten message, personal mementos, etc. may be included. More sophisticated memorials may be a [[memorial cross]], [[ghost bike]], or a plaque with an inscription, decorated with flowers or wreaths.

Roadside memorials tend to be clustered along the busiest roadways and often times at intersections. This is evident when examining the clustering of tribute sites on a map such as this one showing how many sites are along US 30 in northern Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/|title=Roadside Tribute: A Site to Remember|last=|first=|date=|website=Roadside Tribute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning and message==
Roadside memorials are a statement of [[grief]] and [[love]] from the loved ones of the accident victim(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first= A.|year= 2015|title= Place, Meaning, and the Visual Argument of the Roadside Cross, Savannah Law Review| volume= 2|pages=265–300 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2633661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But apart from their personal significance, these memorials also serve as a reminder and warning to other road users of the dangers of driving, and to encourage safer driving.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, R., Churchill, A. &amp; de Barros, A. 2011. Effect of roadside memorial on traffic flow, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. 43, pp.483–486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tay, R. 2009. Drivers’ perceptions and reactions to roadside memorials, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. pp.41, 663–669&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, the [[Arizona]] [[Highway patrol|State Highway Patrol]] began using white crosses to mark the site of fatal car accidents. This practice was continued by families of road-crash victims after it had been abandoned by the police{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. The [[ghost bike]] phenomenon, where an old bicycle is painted white and locked up at an accident site, serves the same purpose in relation to cycling casualties. Some tribute sites include elaborate displays to memorialize the personality of the person to whom the tribute site is dedicated, including action figures and lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/tribute-sites/united-states/california-1/searles-valley/tributes/superman-the-rock-searle-valley-trona/|title=Superman &amp; The Rock Searle Valley/Trona|last=|first=|date=|website=Roadside Tribute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, roadside memorials were personal memorials, but there is a modern trend toward public memorials of increasingly large size.  Typically little or no effort is made to make the memorials accommodate the natural beauty of the landscape and many roadside memorials, over time, lack proper maintenance.

The phenomenon of roadside memorials may be associated with another growing trend:  public outpouring of grief for celebrities. The death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], for example, precipitated an avalanche of flowers and wreaths at the [[Pont de l'Alma]] road tunnel in Paris, the site of her death, and at [[Kensington Palace]], her home in London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} While car-crash victims are rarely so well known, something of the same sort of impulse to make a public display of emotion at the site of a tragedy may be partly responsible for the growing popularity of roadside memorials. The broad phenomenon of creating improvised and temporary memorials after traumatic death (accidents, murder, disasters etc.) has become popular since the 1980s. Because of their non-institutionalized character they are generically coined as grassroots memorials.&lt;ref&gt;''Grassroots Memorials: The Politics of Memorializing Traumatic Death'', eds Peter Jan Margry and Cristina Sánchez-Carretero (New York: Berghahn, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and practice==
Roadside memorials have been erected around the world for centuries. Their legality varies from country to country. A web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/|title=Roadside Tribute: A Site to Remember|website=Roadside Tribute: Remembering Lost Loved Ones}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created in order to preserve in a more permanent manner the physical roadside tributes in a virtual manner. This helps to preserve in a longer term manner the original beauty of the tribute site that tends to degrade over time without regular maintenance. It also provides a means of creating a virtual tribute site for those who haven't yet built a physical memorial at the accident scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://roadsidetribute.com/about-us/|title=About Roadside Tribute|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The number of memorials erected in [[Australia]] since 1990 has increased considerably. In 2003, it was estimated that one in five road deaths were  memorialized at the site of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Ukraine===
[[File:Ukrainian roadside memorial.png|thumb|A roadside memorial in Ukraine]]
It is traditional in [[Ukraine]] to place a roadside memorial on the site of a deadly car or motorcycle crash. It is usually a [[cross]] or a small monument with a [[wreath]] of flowers. There are also usually fresh flowers regularly placed by the cross if the relatives of the person who died live close enough to look after the memorial. Sometimes Ukrainian roadside memorials can be more elaborate, including a small granite or marble gravestone and/or a picture of the loved one.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the practice of erecting roadside memorials has recently generated a media debate about the danger these memorials may pose to other road users and to people erecting them in unsafe places. This debate has been sparked by accounts of dangerous actions, such as when an adult crosses a main road with a child to place a tribute. Some jurisdictions already enforce local regulations, and police officials and local councilors have suggested that uniform rules be introduced across the country. For example, according to the [[BBC]], in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], memorials will only be allowed where it is deemed safe and appropriate, and they will be removed after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4806870.stm | work=BBC News | title='Dangerous' road tributes concern | date=15 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread  of spontaneous roadside memorials to mark the site of fatal [[traffic accident]]s in the [[United States]] is a relatively new phenomenon. There is a gravestone-style memorial in Ellington, CT marking a child's death in 1812.  A typical memorial includes a cross (usually wooden), flowers, hand-painted signs, and, in the case of a child's death, [[stuffed animal]]s. 

The spread of roadside memorials in the United States has increased in recent decades as a result of large immigrant populations from Mexico entering the country {{Clarify|United States|date=July 2017}}. And while not limited to Mexican populations, roadside memorials are most common in areas with large Mexican populations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Formerly, in funerary processions where a group would proceed from a church to a graveyard carrying a coffin, the bearers would take a rest, or ''[[wikt:descanso|descanso]]'' in Spanish, and wherever they set the coffin down, a cross would be placed there in memory of the event. The modern practice of roadside shrines commemorate the last place a person was alive before receiving fatal injuries, even if they should actually die in a hospital after the crash.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/environment/environment_krqe_albuquerque_125_crews_protect_roadside_memorial_200903032140 |title=I25 crews protect roadside memorial |publisher=Krqe.com |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306024108/http://www.krqe.com/dpp/news/environment/environment_krqe_albuquerque_125_crews_protect_roadside_memorial_200903032140 |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[southwestern United States]], they are also common at historic [[paraje]]s on old [[long distance trail]]s, going back to the roots of the tradition, and also marked the graves of people who died while traveling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} A descanso memorial may be decorated especially for the holidays, and for significant anniversaries in the person's life.  A descanso memorial for a child may be decorated with special toys, even toy vignettes of family life, and votive candles may be placed there on special nights.

In the United States, the legal situation varies from state to state.

In [[California]], Streets and Highways Code Section 101.10 directs the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to place and maintain memorial signs along state highways that read “Please Don't Drink and Drive” followed by “In Memory of {victim's name}.” Caltrans places signs at the request of victims’ relatives when there is a fatality as a result of an alcohol or drug-impaired driver. The signs are to remain in place for a period of seven years.

[[File:Original Nomogram Rumack BH Matthew H, Acetaminophen Pediatrics 1975 (55) 871 - 876.pdf|thumb|Rumack-Matthew Nomogram]]
The '''Rumack-Matthew nomogram''', also known as '''Rumack-Matthews nomogram''' or the '''acetaminophen nomogram''' is an [[acetaminophen]] toxicity nomogram plotting serum concentration of acetaminophen against the time since ingestion in an attempt to prognosticate possible liver toxicity as well as allowing a clinician to decide whether to proceed with [[N-Acetylcysteine]] (NAC) treatment or not. It is a logarithmic graph starting not directly from ingestion, but from 4 hours post ingestion after absorption is considered likely to be complete.&lt;ref name=yek/&gt;&lt;ref name=dew/&gt;&lt;ref name=se/&gt;

In hands of skilled clinicians this nomogram allows for timely management of acetaminophen overdose. Generally, a serum plasma concentration (APAP) of 140–150 microgram/mL (or milligrams/L) at 4 hours post ingestion, indicates the need for NAC treatment. This nomogram is not used alone if the patient has altered mental status or if the history is not reliable. Rather, a second level should be drawn and plotted to see if the slope of the line remains at or above the nomogram. A formal half life may also be determined. Measure at time upon admission of the patient to the [[emergency department]], and a blood value at time (t=4 hrs) should be obtained and [[half-life]] calculated. If half-life is more than 4 hours, then treatment is necessary to prevent hepatotoxicity and liver failure.&lt;ref name=yek&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Acetaminophen |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cp-n9DMkpo0C&amp;pg=PA167 |title=Tarascon Adult Emergency Pocketbook |first=Steven G. |last1=Rothrock |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=[[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] |year=2008 |pages=167–8 |isbn=978-0-7637-6588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dew&gt;{{cite journal |pages=380–5 |doi=10.1001/archinte.141.3.380 |title=Acetaminophen overdose. 662 cases with evaluation of oral acetylcysteine treatment |year=1981 |last1=Rumack |first1=B.

The original line starting at 200 microgram/mL at 4 hours was published in 1975 by Rumack BH. and Matthew H. When the NAC study was begun in 1976, the FDA required a line that was 25% below the original line now called the treatment line.  The study line which is now referred to as the treatment line was created starting at 150 at 4 hours and is the usual line used in the United States to determine treatment of acetaminophen overdose. This was published in 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">A '''sacral anterior root stimulator''' is an implantable [[medical device]] enabling patients with a [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord lesion]] to empty their [[bladder]]s.

==History==

From 1969 onwards [[Giles Brindley]]&lt;ref&gt;Brindley GS, Polkey CE, Rushton DN (1982): Sacral anterior root stimulator for bladder control in paraplegia. Paraplegia 20: 365-381.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the sacral anterior root stimulator, with successful [[clinical trials|human trials]] from the early 1980s onwards. Although both [[sphincter]] and [[detrusor urinae muscle|detrusor muscles]] are stimulated at the same time, the slower contraction kinetics of the bladder wall ([[smooth muscle tissue]]) compared to the sphincter ([[striated muscle tissue]]) mean that [[voiding]] occurs between the stimulation pulses, rather than during them.

==Description==

This device is implanted over the sacral anterior root of the [[spinal cord]]; controlled by an external transmitter, it delivers intermittent stimulation which improves the ability to empty the bladder. It may also assist in [[defecation]] and also may enable male patients to have a sustained full [[erection]]. The device is implanted in one of two regions, either through [[intrathecal administration]] or extradurally. It is often performed in conjunction with a dorsal [[rhizotomy]], and many groups believe that the best results are only seen when this procedure is performed alongside the implantation. The rhizotomy will remove sensory reflexes, which in men may include sexual reflexes. For some patients this is a major drawback to the device. For others, the benefits outweigh the downside.

'''Secular spirituality''' is the adherence to a [[spiritual philosophy]] without adherence to a [[religion]]. Secular spirituality emphasizes the [[personal development]] of the individual, rather than a relationship with the [[Divinity|divine]]. Secular spirituality is made up of the search for meaning outside of a religious institution; it considers one's relationship with the self, others, nature, and whatever else one considers to be the ultimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Elkins, D. N.|author2=Hedstrom, L. J.|author3=Hughes, L. L.|author4=Leaf, J. A.|author5=Saunders, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1988|title=Toward a humanistic-phenomenological spirituality|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|volume=28|issue=4|page=10|doi=10.1177/0022167888284002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the goal of secular spirituality is living [[Happiness|happily]] and/or helping others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Art of Being Happy: Spirituality for Sceptics|author=Tony Wilkinson|publisher=Findhorn Press|year=2007|ISBN=1-84409-116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Robert C. Solomon]], an American Professor of Philosophy, "spirituality is coextensive with religion and it is not incompatible with or opposed to science or the scientific outlook. Naturalized spirituality is spirituality without any need for the 'other‐worldly'. Spirituality is one of the goals, perhaps the ultimate goal, of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spirituality for the Skeptic: The Thoughtful Love of life|author=Robert C. Solomon|publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online |year=2003|ISBN=9780195134674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornel W Du Toit, head of the Research Institute for Theology and Religion at the University of South Africa, suggests secular spirituality is unique in that it adapts so well to modern world views, and is therefore compatible with other modern beliefs and ways of life, building community through shared experiences of "awe".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spirit|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175183411X12968355482330|journal = Material Religion|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 1743-2200|pages = 124–130|volume = 7|issue = 1|doi = 10.2752/175183411X12968355482330|first = Peter van der|last = Veer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter van der Veer|Peter Van der Veer]] also argues an important aspect of secular spirituality is its promotion of community, creating solidarity through shared universal truth.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1101}} This 'universal truth' can be experienced through a [[Secularity|secular]] or non-religious world view, without the need for a concept of 'higher power' or a '[[supernatural]] being'.

Instances of secular spirituality are mediated differently, as instances of awe can be encouraged through a diversity of unique environments and situations.&lt;ref name="Mahan, Jeffrey 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mahan, Jeffrey|year=2012|title=Religion and Media|journal=Religion Compass|volume=6|issue=1|pages=14–25|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8171.2011.00330.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, individuals increasingly connect with the secularly spiritual through technology.&lt;ref name="Mahan, Jeffrey 2012"/&gt; As follows, the connection between contemporary spiritual practices and technology is deepening profoundly.&lt;ref name="Mahan, Jeffrey 2012"/&gt; Some traditionally religious practices have been adapted by secular practitioners under strictly spiritual understandings, such as [[yoga]] and [[Mindfulness|mindfulness meditation]]. Secular spirituality affects education, relationships to nature, and community togetherness.

==Definition==
Secular spirituality emphasizes [[humanistic]] qualities such as [[love]], [[compassion]], [[patience]], [[forgiveness]], [[Personal responsibility|responsibility]], harmony and a concern for others.&lt;ref name="Dalai2"&gt;Dalai Lama, ''Ethics for the New Millennium'', NY:Riverhead Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Du Toit argues aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely [[Materialism|materialistic]] view of the world are spiritual; spirituality does not require belief in a supernatural reality or divine being.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spirituality in Modern Society|last = Van der Veer|first = Social Research: An International Quarterly|date = |journal = Social Research: An International Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 1097–1120|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1126671/component/escidoc:2051462/WP_09-10_Veer_New-School-Spirituality.pdf|volume=76|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1098}} Mindfulness and meditation can be practiced in order to cherish, foster, and promote the development of one's [[empathy]] and manage selfish drivers of behavior, with solicitude and forgiveness. This can be experienced as beneficial, or even necessary for human fulfillment, without any supernatural interpretation or explanation. Spirituality in this context may be a matter of nurturing thoughts, emotions, words and actions that are in harmony with a belief that everything in the universe is mutually dependent. Scholar [[Daniel Dennett]] suggests spirituality as connected to "[[awe]] and [[joy]] and sense of peace and [[Wonder (emotion)|wonder]]," explaining "people make a mistake of thinking spirituality... has anything to do with either religious doctrines... or the supernatural," instead claiming spirituality can be and is often entirely secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Daniel Dennett Discusses Secular Spirituality {{!}} Big Think|url = http://bigthink.com/videos/daniel-dennett-discusses-secular-spirituality|website = Big Think|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However critics  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = J. B. | year = 2014 | title = Measuring spirituality as personal belief in supernatural forces: Is the Character Strength Inventory-Spirituality subscale a brief, reliable and valid measure? | url = | journal = Implicit Religion | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 211-222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = H.

== Theorists ==

=== Cornel W Du Toit ===
Cornel W Du Toit is a professor at the [[University of South Africa]], who completed his studies at the Institute for Theology and Missiology.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Du Toit defines "secular spirituality" as a [[Contemporary history|contemporary]] [[phenomenon]] of spirituality experienced in spheres separate from structured, institutionalized religion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sabinet - Secular spirituality versus secular dualism : towards postsecular holism as model for a natural theology|url = http://reference.sabinet.co.za/sa_epublication_article/hervorm_v62_n4_a5|website = reference.sabinet.co.za|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Toit cites Alister E. McGrath's definition of spirituality in his discussion of the secularly spiritual, arguing that spirituality generally concerns: "the quest for a fulfilled and authentic life, involving the bringing together of the ideas distinctive of ... [some] religion and the whole experience of living on the basis of and within the scope of that religion."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Du Toit argues that, as a contemporary phenomenon, secular spirituality is different than earlier spiritualities. A number of changes in prevailing worldviews have affected the concept of spirituality. The concept of spirituality means something different in the current techno-scientific world than it did in a world of phantoms, magic, gods, and demons, in which humans believed themselves to be at the mercy of forces they could not control.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Du Toit believes that the increase in scientific explanations for what were previously seen as spiritual, "unexplainable" instances of [[awe]], has increased individuals' tendency to call any experience that seems special "spiritual." Du Toit argues that any realm can evoke an experience of spirituality whether it may be reading a novel, watching a movie or going on a hike.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Secular spirituality is not a new religion, but rather the potential for all experiences to assume a [[spirituality|spiritual]] quality, not limited to any one religious or [[transcendentals|transcendent]] realm. Du Toit argues that industrialism has led to an increase in materialism in the West. Du Toit further argues that materialism has contributed to a more individualistic Western culture, which underpins secularism. In saying this, though Du Toit connects secularism to individualism, Du Toit maintains that secular spirituality is inherently communal, as he argues that while instances of awe can be experienced individually, they ultimately contribute to the collective – as these instances of awe can motivate people to influence others and nature. Du Toit argues that if they do not meaningfully contribute to the collective, they can not be considered secular spiritual experiences. Du Toit argues that "the spiritual experiences was never an end in itself... [as] any spirituality that does not produce service is false.

===Peter Van der Veer===
[[Peter van der Veer|Peter Van der Veer]] suggests secular spirituality began with the emphasis on forming group identities, both national and political, and the need for these communities to share a spiritual identity. For Van der Veer, secular spirituality arose in communities through the simultaneous rise of [[secularism]] and spirituality, as well as their interaction in the context of nineteenth century [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1101}} He identifies spirituality, the secular, and religion as three interacting but independent concepts that create frameworks for different systems of belief. For Van der Veer the combination of the spiritual and the secular allows the bridging of discursive traditions in the global-historical context which preserves identities of the communities who share spiritual beliefs across national boundaries.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Van der Veer suggests the phenomenon of secular spirituality develops as many different expressions of belief because of the inconsistent integration of spirituality into secular society within social, market and political spaces.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1098}} Secular spirituality reflects [[individualism]] and self-reflexivity through forming group identities outside of a modern geopolitical context. Secular spirituality does not imply rejecting modern ideas of [[liberalism]], socialism or science, but instead exists as a parallel reading of the discourse with contemporary society. For Van der Veer,  secular spirituality uses these contemporary ideas to create communities of individuals who have a shared secular interest written into their system of awesome belief. Van der Veer identifies the use of these contemporary ideas to create communities of individuals who share secular interests in a system of awesome belief as instances of secular spirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1101}}

=== Kim Knott ===
Kim Knott focuses specifically on the secular sacred, in her discussion of secular spirituality. More specifically, Knott focuses on the possibility of experiencing the sacred outside the context of institutionalized religion. She believes that the sacred functions both within and outside of a theological context through the beliefs of individual persons.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Identities Between the Sacred and the Secular|last = Knott|first = Kim|publisher = Ashgate|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knott deconstructs the common conceptional separation of the sacred from the profane. She argues that the concept of religion should not be conflated with the concept of the sacred, and that the concept of the secular should not be conflated with the concept of the profane.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Throughout the enlightenment this separation between religion and the spiritual has occurred, as wilderness sites, marshes, coves, and other sites have been called sacred or spiritual places, without having religious influence or belonging to a religion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this understanding the sacred is based in nature as these sacred sites serve in an individuals spatial sacred experience. This is how Knott breaks down the sacred experience, as it is achieved through the individuals embodiment, spatiality, and the awareness of ones the body and the spaces inside and around it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As these the sacred as the basis of the sacred as it becomes an operative connection within boundary crossing situations taking place inside and outside the human body and the inhabited territory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Technology ==

=== Online spirituality ===
Religions and religious movements have [[Religion and the Internet|strong online presence]], which are often sorted into two categories: "religion-online" and "online-religion."&lt;ref name=":322"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helland, C.|year=2000|chapter=Online-religion/religion-online and virtual communitas|editor1=J. K. Hadden|editor2=D. E. Cowan|lastauthoramp=y|title=Religion on the Internet: Research prospects and promises|pages=205–223|location=New York|publisher=JAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As coined by Christopher Helland, "religion-online" is understood as "importing traditional forms of religion online", while "online-religion" is uniquely secularly spiritual, in that it "[creates] new forms of networked spiritual interactions," promoting discussions of ritual and 'awe'-filled moments within a secular, online community.&lt;ref name=":322" /&gt; Because of the Internet's ability to "cross social and cultural borders", Helland argues that this has created "non-threatening environment" that is ideal for anonymous users to engage in "spiritual searching."&lt;ref name=":422"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Religion and the Internet|journal = Communication Research Trends|date = 2006|doi = |url = |last = Campbell|first = Heidi|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online spiritual discussion outside of the aegis of any particular religious movement is often thought to have begun with and have been most influenced by "Communitree", a "California-based online social networking system".&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religion and Canadian Society: Contexts, Identities, and Strategies|last = Beaman|first = Lori G.|publisher = Canadian Scholars' Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |page = 376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Origins" board on Communitree promoted "open-ended forms of religious discussion", resulting in an unofficial "set of religious and quasi-religious beliefs and practices that is not accepted, recognized or controlled by official religious groups."&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Scholars often associate Communitree with personal religiosity and individualized spirituality, as this entirely secular platform allowed for conversation to occur without a "set doctrine, code of ethics or group of religious professionals to regulate belief and practices".&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Outside of Communitree, the Internet contains countless forums, websites, and messaging systems. These platforms allow for information regarding spiritual ideas to be accessed, and connections to be made between those who are offering or seeking spiritual advice.&lt;ref name=":422" /&gt;

=== Techno-spirituality ===
A defining feature of secular spirituality is that instances of secular spirituality can occur in any realm. In the present techno-scientific age, spiritual practices are increasingly mediated through [[technology]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Newman, Jay|year=1997|title=Religion and Technology: A Study in the Philosophy of Culture|pages=110–111|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Praeger Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many religious people, technology can be seen as an alienating force – "the encapsulation of human [[rationality]]" – that competes with religion and spirituality as opposed to mediating or facilitating religion and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The recognition of a spiritual dimension of technology represents a recent shift in the discussion. According to philosopher Jay Newman, "technology's very success is contributing to the realization of ideals such as freedom, knowledge, happiness, and peace."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; This may lead people to believe that "technology is a proper successor to religion", but this is certainly not the case in sociological trends. General levels of religiosity in the West have barely declined since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment period]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The current "attribution of spiritual meaning to the digital realm" represents a remarkable change in how spirituality has traditionally been mediated. Secular spirituality is a phenomenon that recognizes the link between technology and spirituality, as opposed to viewing technology as in competition with spirituality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Yoga ==

The popularity of the '[[Yoga]]' in the West is integrally linked to [[secularization]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Carrette|first1 = Jeremy|last2 = King|first2 = Richard|title = Selling spirituality: the silent takeover of religion|date = 2005|publisher = Routledge|location = New York, NY|isbn = 0415302099|edition = 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}} This secularization began in [[India]] in the 1930s, when yoga teachers began to look for ways to make yoga accessible to the general public who did not have the opportunity to practice yoga as part of the Hindu faith.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt; As such, yoga began to move from the realm of religion to the realm of secularity, promoting Yoga as a non-Hindu practice both within the West and East.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt; Yoga has undeniably [[Hindu]] roots, first mentioned in the ''[[Katha Upanisad]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Shattuck|first1 = Cybelle|title = Hinduism|date = 1999|publisher = Routledge|location = London|isbn = 0415211638|page = 29|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these roots, yoga has been secularized, and often referred to as being "ancient Indian," "Eastern," or "[[Sanskritic]]," rather than as Hindu due to a desire to avoid any religious connotations.&lt;ref name="Jain"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Jain|first1 = Andrea R.|title = Selling yoga: from counterculture to pop culture|date = 2014|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0199390243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}} Modern Western yoga is thought to "not require adoption of religious beliefs or dogma," despite Hindu origins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Büssing|first1 = Arndt|last2 = Hedtstück|first2 = Anemone|last3 = Khalsa|first3 = Sat Bir S.|last4 = Ostermann|first4 = Thomas|last5 = Heusser|first5 = Peter|title = Development of Specific Aspects of Spirituality during a 6-Month Intensive Yoga Practice|journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date = 2012|volume = 2012|issue=2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/981523}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}  In the West, yoga has been "modernized, medicalized, and transformed into a system of physical culture".&lt;ref name="Jain"/&gt;{{rp|61–2}} This system of physical culture has transformed yoga "into an individualized spirituality of the self", creating an activity that is very popular within secular societies, drawing off portrayals of yoga as "mystical, experiential and individualistic."&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;{{rp|115, 116}} Western yoga students cite health, fitness, and stress reduction as reasons for yogic practice, rather than traditional Hindu motivations and goals such as enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Jain"/&gt;{{rp|39}} However, many practice in order to reach "contemplative states of consciousness and spirituality", a goal that falls within the realm of secular spirituality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In a study of [[Ashram]] residents, researchers found residents were more likely to respond they had an "experience of oneness" during or after a yoga class and felt more "in touch with [[divine]] or spiritual" after a class than control groups, leaving researchers to believe yoga practice enhances transformational processes, including spiritual states.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

== Meditation ==
[[File:Toronto Falun Gong Exercises 13.jpg|thumb|Meditation has transformed into a secular, spiritual experience that promotes a sense of community.]]
While [[meditation]] is traditionally considered a component of [[Buddhism]], [[Mindfulness|mindfulness meditation]] has become a way to exercise secular spirituality, particularly in the West.&lt;ref name="McMahan"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Buddhism in the Modern World|last = McMahan|first = David L.|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = |location =}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241}} Meditation is considered a "spiritual alternative"&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; to conventional values and goals, such as those found in traditional Western religions.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spirituality: What It Is and Why it Matter|last = Gottlieb|first = Roger S.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]], while traditionally linked to the Buddhist understanding of [[Samadhi]], has become medicalized in the secular aim of reducing illness, rather than the traditional Buddhist goal of liberation from the suffering that occurs in worldly experiences.&lt;ref name="McMahan"/&gt;{{rp|278}} As such, this medicalized, secularized version of meditation has been allowed into secular institutions within Western society, such as hospitals and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mindful America|last = Wilson|first = Jess|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |page = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done at Bowling Green State University has shown that mindfulness practitioners who identify as spiritual, as opposed to non-spiritual, benefit more fully from mindfulness practice, and more significantly decreasing their anxiety, increasing the positivity of their moods and increasing their ability to tolerate pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Is Spirituality a Critical Ingredient of Meditation?

While meditation is entirely individual, it also relies on and creates social connection, building community through shared spirituality despite secular contexts.&lt;ref name="McMahan"/&gt;{{rp|283}}

== Education ==
Marisa Crawford points to the importance of including secular spirituality in the Canadian [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Secular Spirituality of Youth: Implications for Religious Education|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0141620960180302|journal = British Journal of Religious Education|date = 1996-06-01|issn = 0141-6200|pages = 133–143|volume = 18|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/0141620960180302|first = Marisa|last = Crawford|first2 = Graham|last2 = Rossiter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford argues that a push for a secular public education system deprives students of the opportunity to explore life's "ultimate questions of heart and soul."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Crawford believes that there is a way to integrate spirituality into the secular sphere without [[indoctrination]]. She advocates allowing students to investigate how individuals and cultures have addressed spiritual concerns and issues.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Public schools in Canada generally exclude the spiritual or [[transcendental idealism|transcendent]] dimension of human life from their explanation of religion and have thus bought into a brand of secularism that has excluded spirituality, giving students the false impression that spirituality has never been an important part of the human experience.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Crawford argues that the deflection of students' questions about religion or spirituality is commonplace and contributes to misunderstandings and ignorance about religion and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to Crawford, knowledge about religion and spirituality is essential for understanding and living in a [[Religious pluralism|pluralistic]] society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While textbooks include explanations of the rituals and practices of certain religious groups, textbooks rarely discuss religion's role in shaping human thought and action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In British Columbia, the School Act states that public schools must be conducted on "strictly [[Secularism|secular]] and [[Nonsectarian|non-sectarian]] principles," thereby alienating young people to "questions that both enliven and vex the human spirit."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lois Sweet argues that "public schools must begin to examine ways to include the spiritual dimension of human existence in a non-indoctrinating way," by teaching worldviews that are sensitive to religious differences and by emphasizing the features of religion and spirituality that overlap.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Sweet points to the fact that the requirement for secularism in Canadian public schools simply signals the need for "educational decisions and policies, whatever their motivation, to respect the multiplicity of religious and moral views that are held by families in the school community," not to ignore their discussion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to a [[UNESCO]] report on education: "It is thus education's noble task to encourage each and every one, acting in accordance with their traditions and convictions and paying full respect to [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], to lift their minds and spirits to the plane of the universal and, in some measure, to transcend themselves."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to Crawford, excluding religion from the curriculum endorses a passive hostility towards all religious points of view. According to Thomas Groome, by nurturing a [[sacramentals|sacramental]] [[cosmology]] – an awareness that each aspect of life manifests visible signs of invisible grace – educators can promote an attitude of reverence and gratitude for the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He argues that doing so can encourage students to "bring light to the thousands of wonders and transcendent signals in the ordinary things of life ...contemplating the world with a gaze of faith that encourages seeking meaning and celebrating instances of [[awe]]."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through integrating a sacramental cosmology into the Canadian Public Education system, Groome argues that students will have more opportunities to understand and appreciate the web of humanity – including love, friendship, and "the intricate and consistent designs and patterns of science ... leading to contemplative wonder that is rooted in compassionate and loving relationships that embrace meaningful knowing."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Crawford argues that the curriculum will have to avoid promoting one particular religious or irreligious point of view. The curriculum would have to introduce students to a [[Cultural diversity|diversity]] of worldviews and spiritual options "allowing them critical access to alternative traditions so that informed insight and wisdom may flourish through the development of spiritual literacy."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Spirituality and nature ==
[[File:Ocean_Beach.jpg|thumb|Kathleen Fischer argues secular spirituality is inherently linked to nature, and can be found in the beauty of "the delicate mist that arises from the spray of a waterfall, a hummingbird hovering at a flowering bush, white beaches bordering turquoise waters."]] Nurse and researcher Kathleen Fischer notes that [[nature]] is a common context for a secular spiritual experience. In her view, individuals can foster a connection to the sacred through experiencing nature with an openness to joy and wonder.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Long Life on a Fragile Planet: Nature, Spirituality, and Aging|last = Kathleen|first = Fischer|date = 2011|journal = Journal of Religion, Spirituality &amp; Aging|doi =10.1080/15528030.2010.533408 |pmid = |volume=23|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fischer, spirituality is the broader reality, the search for meaning and purpose for those who long to discover a deeper dimension to their lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She characterizes spiritual experience as being rooted in the feeling of awe in nature, which, in her words, may be inspired by sensing "the intricacy, majesty, and beauty of creation: the delicate mist that arises from the spray of a waterfall, a hummingbird hovering at a flowering bush, white beaches bordering turquoise waters."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fischer's work is intended to affirm that not only that the lives of human beings, but all aspects of nature, are filled with a sacred mystery or power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Fischer's own experience, the sacred power of spirituality has deepened and extended her spiritual practices, such as meditation or deep reflection to maintain strong mental wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Through researching Aboriginal Australian groups, Vicki Grieve's has begun using research on their spiritual lives as a method for analyzing and interpreting the contemporary development of Australian Aboriginal groups.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Vicki, Grieves (2009). "Aboriginal spirituality : Aboriginal philosophy, the basis of Aboriginal social and emotional wellbeing". ''Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health''.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Aboriginal spirituality while diverse seems to attend to similar themes on the sacredness of nature that is seen in Fischer's work. Australian Aboriginals are often taught that life is a sacred hoop in which everything has a place. All elements of nature, whether plants, animals, or insects, should be treated with the same respect as humans. Grieves believes that Aboriginal Australian spiritualities deep connection to nature builds a strong community belief system which has the potential to unite all living beings.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Through researching Australian Aboriginal spirituality Grieves has noted how "spirituality stems from a philosophy that establishes the wholistic notion of the interconnectedness of the elements of the earth and the universe, animate and inanimate."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As part of her research, Grieves conducted a focus group with an inter-city contemporary Aboriginal group in Australia to better understand the impact spirituality has on their lives. This inter-city group described spirituality as a feeling of interconnectedness to their people's past, of community and a connectedness with land and nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It is through spirituality that these inter-city aboriginals attained "knowledge, inner strength, and a better understanding of their cultural roots" contributing to feelings of "acceptance, balance and focus" as well as an overall sense of "deep wellbeing".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== In communities ==

=== Chicano spirituality ===
[[Chicano]] spirituality is a form of [[Mexicayotl|Mexicanism]]; a nationalist spiritual ideology that developed in Mexico and the Southern United States in the 1960s as a response to political and cultural mistreatment by both Mexican and American law.&lt;ref name="De La Torre"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chicano Spirituality in the Construction of an Imagined Nation|last = De La Torre|first = Renee|date = June 2013|journal = Social Compass|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Gutiérrez Zùñiga|first2 = Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219}} Chicano spirituality uses a combination of rituals from the Mexica, popular Catholic traditions, and secular Mexican traditions to forge an identity for the Chicano people. Chicanos understand their identity to be that of an independent ethnic minority in between Indigenous and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] people, as such blending secular ethnic positionality with a variety of spiritual traditions.&lt;ref name="De La Torre"/&gt;{{rp|222}} The Chicano identify as heirs to the [[Aztec]] lineage, and use this genealogy to justify their demands for territory and recognition in civil rights.&lt;ref name="De La Torre"/&gt;{{rp|220}} [[Aztlán]] is the imagined territory that is the centre of the Anhuac tribes of whom the Chicano claim to be descendants.&lt;ref name="De La Torre"/&gt;{{rp|223}} Aztlán is identified by the Chicano as the first settlement of the Anhuac people in North America before their southern migration to found the Aztec Empire. Chicano spiritual practice includes the celebration of Mexican civic holidays, and uniquely Chicano-Mexicanist rites of passage. One ritual, called Xilonen, is a rite of passage celebrated by fifteen-year-old Chicano girls that symbolically teaches them the place of women in the social order and in families.

In the context of the modern Chicano movement, the Chicano identity is used to transcend the modern national boundaries of Mexico and the United States as a distinct population. The territory of Atzlán allows the Chicano to justify their separation from other ethnic and cultural groups in these countries by providing them with Aztec ancestors, and a historical connection to territory in what is now the southern United States.&lt;ref name="De La Torre"/&gt;{{rp|223}} The idea of the Aztlán homeland is imaginary, but supported by factors in pre-Hispanic history, allows the Chicano to more firmly stake their position to be recognized as a form of secular spirituality occurring in communities in both Mexico and the United States that desires political recognition of their minority identity as a tool to engage in contemporary society.

The three main arguments that the Chicano use in their fight for a distinct political identity are that the origin of the Chicano ancestors, the Nahua tribes were in North America, that until 1848 the modern national boundaries between Mexico and the United States were not set, and that there is a history of transient Mexican workers in the United States. By claiming a historical link to territory in both countries, the Chicano distinguish themselves as developing a cultural identity separate from either. Chicano spirituality is a combination of American and Mexican encounters with modern politics of human rights.&lt;ref name="De La Torre"/&gt;{{rp|224}}

=== Indian national spirituality ===

English rhetorician [[I. A. Richards|I.A. Richards]] has argued that the lack of a word for ''spirituality'' in [[Sanskrit]] makes it possible for the concept to be used in a nationalist capacity that transcends individual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mencius on the Mind|last = Richards|first = I.A.|publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]]'s principle in establishing Indian National Spirituality was that each person could discover a universal truth in the Indian struggle with British colonialism. His vision of Indian National Spirituality transcended the bounds of individual religious traditions, to enact a shared nationalist fervour in the fight for independence. Gandhi's Indian National Spirituality was an adaption of Hindu tradition in light of Western thought proposed an independent India to operate within.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1109}} Gandhi used the Hindu principle of ''[[Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava|Sarva Dharma Sambhava]]'' which argues that all religions are equal as a way to invite participation of minority communities in his vision of a politically independent India.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1110}} Gandhi's national spirituality relied on the entire population of India presenting themselves as a united front against colonialism. After the [[Lucknow Pact]] of 1916 Gandhi was forced as an act of Indian congress to give separate political representation to Muslims, and later to Sikhs. Gandhi felt that separating them from the political whole was a "vivisection" of Indian National spirituality as formed a shared ideology for fight for Indian Nationalism.&lt;ref name=Tejani&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crisis of Secularism in India|last = Tejani|first = Shabnum|publisher = Duke University Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Durham |editor-last = Dingwaney Needham|editor-first = Anuradha|chapter = Reflections on the Category of Secularism in India|editor-last2 = Rajan|editor-first2 = Sunder}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}

In addition to arguing for religious equality in India, Gandhi's ideology called for the equality of humankind, a secularly spiritual demand based on peace and kindness for the betterment of all. He believed that Indian National Spirituality would allow the East to be an example to the West in promoting national communities tied by belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Spirit|last = Van der Veer|first = Peter|date = 2011-03-01|journal = Material Religion|doi =10.2752/175183411X12968355482330 |pmid = |volume=7 |issue=1|page = 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi saw the endemic oppression of the [[Dalit]] or untouchable population by the caste system of Hinduism as a heinous institution. He promoted embracing the Dalit population as also being ''Harijan'' or children of God, and the British programs implemented to raise Dalit status through educational and employment opportunity programs.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1111}}

==== Responses to Indian national spirituality ====
Gandhi's proposed universalist national spiritual identity for India faced criticism by both religious and secular nationalist groups. Hindu Nationalists opposed an all-encompassing spiritual tradition that accepted Muslims. They believed that being forced to share an identity with a group of the population that they saw as foreign would be another form of colonial emasculation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1110}}

Another response to the universalism of Indian National Spirituality as proposed by Gandhi was by [[B. R. Ambedkar]] in the fight for the Dalit. Ambedkar criticized the use of Hinduism as a basis for a universal spirituality because of the implied inequality of the embedded caste system.&lt;ref name=Tejani/&gt;{{rp|47}} He saw the lack of mobility between castes and the systematic oppression of the Dalits, the lowest caste in the Hindu system, as necessitating a political separation from their oppressors in a contemporary Indian legal situation.&lt;ref name=Tejani/&gt;{{rp|53}} Ambedkar believed that the community of the Dalit had to divorce itself from Hindu tradition in order to escape caste based oppression, explaining that Dalit problem "would never be solved unless [the Dalit] got political power in their own hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahir, D. C.|title=Dr. Ambedkar at the Round Table Conferences London (1930–1932)|location=Delhi|publisher=Blu-moon Books|year=1999|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar's method for achieving the goals of the Dalit meant that their identity needed to be reimagined as secular, separate from the Hindu caste system.

Ambedkar used conversion to Buddhism as a means to promote the Dalit cause through a different spiritual framework than Gandhi's Indian National Spirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{rp|1110}} In 1956 Ambedkar and a number of his Dalit followers converted from Hinduism to Buddhism. The conversion was symbolic shift for the untouchable community to escape the implications of the Hindu caste system on the Dalit population in a secular realm.&lt;ref name=Tejani/&gt;{{rp|61}} The tradition of Buddhism was seen by Ambedkar as "a guide for right relations between man and man in all spheres of life," embodying the egalitarian character missing from Indian society.&lt;ref name=Tejani/&gt;{{rp|63}} He hoped that converting the Dalit population to a religion that lacked a caste system would help to create a situation in which they had equal human rights in India as a minority group. Ambedkar's interpretation of Buddhism was based on a secular and this-worldly reading, wherein suffering was defined as the oppression of one culture by another, and freedom from suffering, and [[nirvana]] defined as righteous behaviour on earth between all people.&lt;ref name=Tejani/&gt;{{rp|63}}

The '''solitary tract''' ({{lang-la|'''tractus solitarius''', or '''fasciculus solitarius'''}}) is a compact fiber bundle that extends longitudinally through the posterolateral region of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]].  The solitary tract is surrounded by the [[Solitary nucleus|nucleus of the solitary tract]], and descends to the upper cervical segments of the [[spinal cord]]. It was first named by [[Theodor Meynert]] in 1872.

==Composition==
The solitary tract is made up of primary sensory fibers and descending fibers of the [[Vagus nerve|vagus]], [[glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]], and [[facial nerve]]s.

==Function==
The solitary tract conveys afferent information from [[Mechanoreceptors|stretch receptors]] and [[chemoreceptors]] in the walls of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and intestinal tracts.   Afferent fibers from cranial nerves [[facial nerve|7]], [[glossopharyngeal nerve|9]] and [[vagus nerve|10]] convey taste ([[special visceral afferent|SVA]]) in its rostral portion, and general visceral sense ([[general visceral afferent fibers|general visceral afferent fibers, GVA]]) in its caudal part. [[Taste bud]]s in the mucosa of the tongue can also generate impulses in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] regions of the solitary tract.  The efferent fibers are distributed to the solitary tract nucleus.

==Synonyms==
There are numerous synonyms for the solitary tract: 
*round fasciculus (Latin: fasciculus rotundus)
*solitary fasciculus (Latin: fasciculus solitarius)
*solitary bundle (Latin: funiculus solitarius)
*Gierke respiratory bundle (Named for German anatomist [[Hans Paul Bernhard Gierke]]).&lt;ref name=ST&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=isqcnR6ryz0C&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=%22+Gierke+respiratory+bundle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4AaH1AGHW3&amp;sig=Kt1prtuLe7rpKrf_tLMqMsSM0Ns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aw40Uq2KL8ycigKMhYCQCQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Gierke%20respiratory%20bundle%22&amp;f=false Stedman's Medical Eponyms] by Thomas Lathrop Stedman; Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2005 - Medical - 899 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Lawrence Lime.jpg|thumb|upright|The St Lawrence Lime in 2003]]
The '''St Lawrence Lime Tree''' was a {{convert|90|ft||adj=mid|-high [[lime tree]]|disp=flip|abbr=out}}&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite web|last=Sapsted |first=David |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1480905/Crickets-famous-lime-tree-stumped-after-200-years.html |title=Cricket's famous lime tree stumped after 200 years |work=Telegraph |date=2005-01-11 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[St Lawrence Ground]] in [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]], England. It was located within the boundary ropes of the [[cricket]] pitch which required special rules. In 2005, it was broken in two in high winds.

== History ==
It is not known when the tree was planted but it is known that it was already full-grown in its location in 1847, when the St Lawrence Ground was opened.&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; The St Lawrence Ground was built around the tree, which was located within the boundary ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4160973.stm |title=End of innings for cricket tree |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-01-10 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the St Lawrence Ground being the only first-class ground with a tree in the playing area, special laws were enacted regarding the tree. These laws may have been instigated pre-1910 where a [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]] batsman was claimed to be caught by a [[Kent County Cricket Club]] fielder off the tree.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/218839.html |title=Wisden &amp;ndash; The end of the lime |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws stated that if the ball hit the tree, it was scored as a four even if it would have gone on to score six otherwise and no batsman could be caught out from a rebound off the tree.&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; It was viewed as a challenge to hit a ball over the tree; only four batsmen, [[Arthur Watson (cricketer, born 1884)|Arthur Watson]], [[Learie Constantine]], [[Jim Smith (cricketer)|Jim Smith]] and [[Carl Hooper]], managed to do so.&lt;ref name=tele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watson was missed from several reports which named only Constantine, Smith, and Hooper but his place on this list is specifically noted by [[Frank_Keating_(journalist)|Frank Keating]] in the following: Keating F (2005) [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jan/14/comment.frankkeating Notes from the touchline], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2005-01-14. Retrieved 2016-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and replacement===
[[File:Lime tree view (33886298086).jpg|thumb|The replacement St Lawrence Lime in 2017]]
In 1999, the St Lawrence Lime was diagnosed with [[Heart rot|heartwood fungus]] and given an expected lifespan of 10 years despite [[pollarding]] aimed to promote growth.&lt;ref name=new /&gt; In preparation, a replacement ''Tilia'' sapling was planted at the St Lawrence Ground by [[E. W. Swanton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cricket/Trees-demise-stumps-officials/2005/01/11/1105423488891.html |title=Tree's demise stumps officials |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2005-01-12 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weakened by the fungus, the trunk of the tree was broken in two by high winds on 8 January 2005, leaving a {{convert|7|ft|abbr=on|disp=flip}} stump. Kent initially planned to use the replacement to take the place of the St Lawrence Lime and had permission from the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] to do so.&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; However, because the replacement was still small and was deemed unable to take a cricket ball and being less visible to players,&lt;ref name=espn /&gt; it was planted in the playing area outside the boundary ropes instead of inside to take the place of the St Lawrence Lime in a ceremony including [[Chris  Cowdrey]].&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4328651.stm |title=Cricket club reveal new lime tree |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12271">'''Svātantrya''' (from the [[Sanskrit]] ''sva'' meaning ''self'' and ''tantram'' meaning ''dependence''&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 'self-dependency', or '[[free will]]') is the [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivite]] concept of divine sovereignty. ''Svātantrya'' is described as an energy that emanates from the Supreme (''Paramaśiva''),&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; a wave of motion inside consciousness (''spanda'') that acts as the fundament of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; or in another view, the original word ([[logos]], pārāvak).&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 16"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; It does not use any external instrument&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijna Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– G.V. Tagare, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; as it itself is the first stage of creation.

In antithesis with the [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of [[Brahman]], which is a mere conscious witness without effective power, being inflicted by the illusory power (or ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' of the Brahman), in the Kashmiri Shaivite viewpoint creation is actively willed into existence by the supreme consciousness (''[[Śiva]]'') by the means of his irresistible will-force (''Svātantrya'').&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; This is an important aspect of the [[Pratyabhijna]] school of ''Kashmir Shaivism''.

''Svātantrya'' is a concept that goes to the root of many spiritual matters in Kashmir Shaivism,&lt;ref&gt;The Mirror of Self-Supremacy or Svatantrya-Darpana&amp;nbsp;– B.N. Pandit, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; like, the divine sovereignty of ''Śiva'' (God),&lt;ref&gt;History of Kashmir Saivism&amp;nbsp;– B.N. Pandit, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; consciousness (''caitanya''), creative power (''vimarśa''), [[mantra|mantric efficiency]] and ''[[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]]''.

==Divine sovereignty==
In its acception of divine sovereignty, ''svātantrya'' is described as an absolute power of action, or, absolute power of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Saivism of Kashmir&amp;nbsp;– M.L. Pandit, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; This power arises from the mirror-like ability of the supreme consciousness (''caitanya'') to contain images (''vimarśa'')&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Triadic mysticism&amp;nbsp;– P.E. Murphy, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the whole universe being a mere image shining inside this unique god-consciousness.

''Svātantrya'' has a number of traditional attributes such as: perfect fullness (of the energy of will),&lt;ref name="Vac&amp;nbsp;– Andre Padoux, p. 247"&gt;Vac&amp;nbsp;– Andre Padoux, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; self-sufficiency,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; autodetermination,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; the power of doing and undoing&amp;nbsp;– essence of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; supreme creativity,&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; sovereignty,&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; source of knowledge (''jñāna'') and action (''kriyā'')&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; and being beyond contradictions:&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 122"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; it exists beyond laws of any kind and is the source of all laws in the universe.

==Supreme creative energy==
The Kashmir Shaivism theory of creation affirms that the world was willed into existence by the sovereign force of ''Śiva''. Thus, the world has no external causes outside ''Śiva's Svātantrya''.&lt;ref&gt;Towards Transcendence&amp;nbsp;– M.L. Pandit, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijna Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– G.V. Tagare, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This power creates multiplicity (''māyā'') from the original unity of the absolute,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 17"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– B. Marjanovic, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, it exists inside and beyond ''māyā''.&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; It is the seed of the universe,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; the matrix (''mātrkā'') of generative phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; the ultimate creative force.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanzas on Vibration&amp;nbsp;– M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to consciousness==
Disclaimer: on this topic there is a certain amount of melding and unification of the seemingly distinct concepts of will, freedom, consciousness, speech and bliss in the speciality texts. This is due to the insufficient ability of common language to describe the mystical states of consciousness.

The ''prakāśa-vimarśa'' theory affirms the world is based on two principles: the self shining conscious light (''[[Prakasa|prakāśa]]'')  and its ability to contain a reflection of itself and of the creation (''vimarśa'').&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Divine Recognition&amp;nbsp;– K.C. Pandey, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Lakshmanjoo p. 110"&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect itself is to know absolute bliss (''ānanda'')&amp;nbsp;– thus, free will (''svātantrya''), conscious reflection (''vimarśa'') and bliss (''ānanda'') are three concepts describing the same reality.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247"&gt;Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss (''ānanda'') is the internal state of consciousness, its natural state. The same is true of svātantrya: it too is a fundamental quality of the subject.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 122"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Towards Transcendence&amp;nbsp;– M.L. Pandit, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Svātantrya is the first stage of creation, an undifferentiated energy, or, looking from bottom up, we could also say that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creation&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The first creation of ''svātantrya'' is the energy of will (''icchā śakti''). Then come the energies of knowledge (''jñāna śakti'') and action (''kriyā śakti'') and together with the energy of consciousness (''cit śakti'') and the energy of bliss (''ānanda śakti'') they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called "pure creation".&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything related to consciousness is also related to ''svātantrya''. Speech is seen in Kashmir Shaivism as differentiated in four classes : external (''vaikharī''), mental (''madhyamā''), subtle (''paśyanti'') and supreme (''parā''). ''Svātantrya'' is equated to ''pārāvak'', the creative [[logos]] / ''logos spermatikos''.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 16"/&gt;

==In relation to mystical practices==
In the mystical practices of Kashmir Shaivism, ''svātantrya'' is both the sovereign will of ''Śiva'', solely deciding the descent of divine grace (''[[śaktipāt]]'') and the will of the adept as he becomes more and more submerged into the divine.

According to Kashmir Shaivism, spiritual realization is more than a state of illumination (defined as ''pure witness'', ''non-dual consciousness'' or ''atma-vyapti'').&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Full spiritual realization means to know bliss (''ānanda'') and to control the energies (''śakti'') and the mantras&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; (or, the so-called ''śiva-vyāpti''). The root of spiritual efficiency is ''svātantrya'', the operative, dynamic aspect of the absolute.

An adept who reaches spiritual illumination needs to learn how to stabilize his experience. The Kashmir Shaivism scriptures declare that stability is based on the assimilation of the energy of ''svātantrya''.&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 149"&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the incipient practitioner aims for the experience of the nondual consciousness, the advanced ones focus on the assimilation of all the energies into non-duality. ''Svātantrya'' being the root of all energies, it becomes automatically the final step of the spiritual practice.&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 149"/&gt;

The will of such an advanced practitioner becomes more and more efficient as it identifies with the will of ''Śiva''. Yet, his actions are necessarily without base in egoism (without the attributes of good or bad)&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and this is an attitude that defines the discipline of [[karma yoga]].

All the spiritual paths (''upāyas''): that of Śiva (''śāmbhavopāya''), that of Śakti (''śāktopāya'') and that of the man (''āṇavopāya'') are subsumed under the umbrella of ''svātantrya'' as it is the sole mediator of divine grace.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The adept who has attained ''svātantrya'' is beyond the need for formal meditation&amp;nbsp;– that is&amp;nbsp;– for him to meditate or to act in everyday life is identical&amp;nbsp;– he does all his actions from a state of perfect unity with ''Śiva'' from now on. This is the culmination of the Kashmiri Shaivite spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Such an adept does not exert himself in maintaining this state of consciousness because it is his own nature. From his point of view, everything is made of just forms of consciousness, his own consciousness, also identified with the consciousness of ''Śiva'' at this stage. The energy he possesses is the risen form of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].&lt;ref&gt;The Aphorisms of Siva&amp;nbsp;– M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; His mantras have spiritual efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;The Aphorisms of Siva&amp;nbsp;– M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; His heart (''hṛdaya'') is the receptacle of all objects.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– B. Marjanovic, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmir Shaivism doctrine affirms that nothing can compel ''Śiva'' to bestow the final spiritual realization&amp;nbsp;– it is solely based on the unconditioned ''svātantrya'', or, from the opposite perspective, there is no obstacle that can separate the disciple from becoming one with ''Śiva'' because he has ''svātantrya'' which is the ultimate power that cannot be impeded by anything.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kashmir Shaivism there is this paradoxical concept that nothing needs to be done, as the supreme realization can appear without effort, but also, no matter what effort one undergoes, he cannot compel ''Śiva'' to liberate his self (''ātman'').&lt;ref&gt;The Himalayan mysticism&amp;nbsp;– [[R. Nataraj]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this is not an invitation to abandon hard work but a justification for humility.

In a meditation prescribed in [[Vijnana Bhairava|Vijñana Bhairava Tantra]], one is supposed to unite his vital energy (''[[prana|prāṇa]]'') with ''svātantrya'' in the mystical force center that exists 12 finger widths above the head, ''dvadaśānta''.&lt;ref&gt;Vijnana Bhairava&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshman Joo, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
''Svātantrya'' has a number of synonyms such as: ''maheśvaraya'' (from maheśvara which means supreme lord),&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 17"/&gt; or ''aiśvarya'' (similarly, from the word Iśvara which also means Lord).&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It has been personalized as the Goddess (''[[Devi]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; the virginal feminine deity ''[[Parvati|Uma]]'' (virginity being a symbol of existence outside the reach of the profane world)&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and the playful goddess ''Kumārī''.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Other scriptures also refer to ''svātantrya'' as the ''Glory of Siva''&lt;ref name="Swami Lakshmanjoo p. 110"/&gt; on account of it being identical to the 'ocean' of uncreated light (''prakāśa'') and cosmic bliss (''ānanda'')&amp;nbsp;– ''cidānanda-Ghana''.

'''''The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans''''' is a 2010 nonfiction book by U.S. author [[Mark Jacobson]].&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress catalog record http://lccn.loc.gov/2010015455&lt;/ref&gt; It recounts the attempt to ascertain the origin of a [[Lampshades made from human skin|lampshade]] claimed to be made out of human skin.

==Synopsis==
In the aftermath of  [[Hurricane Katrina]], a lampshade, purported to be made from the skin of a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victim, turned up in a sidewalk [[Garage sale|rummage sale]] in [[New Orleans]]. Purchased for $35 by Skip Henderson, the lampshade was sent to his friend Mark Jacobson, a writer living in [[Brooklyn|New York]]. Jacobson embarked on a quest to discover the origin of the lampshade. [[Genetic testing]] initially confirmed it was made from [[human skin]]. However, because of the condition of the tanned skin, there was no way to determine the ethnic origin of the person whose skin was used, or if it was indeed a relic of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;National Public Radio, [https://www.npr.org/2010/12/28/132416206/New-Book-Tells-Story-Of-The-Lampshade New Book Tells Grim Story Of 'The Lampshade'] December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next few years, Jacobson attempted to track down the origin of and examine the meaning of the lampshade, how it ended up in New Orleans, and to decide what to ultimately do with the gruesome object. Both the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Yad Vashem]] museum in [[Jerusalem]], declined  to take possession of the lampshade,  saying that the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] lampshades made of human skin were probably a "myth".&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Over the course of his investigation, Jacobson examines the history of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where such objects were reputed to have been made, as well as the racial and post-Katrina history of New Orleans, the world of [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], the [[black market]] trafficking in such goods, and the mythology surrounding objects made from human skin.

==Cow skin==
In 2012 the lampshade was subjected to more sophisticated next-generation DNA testing and was found to be most likely cow skin.&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic'' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuqupFyq1o at 38m 30s&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Viking program''' consisted of a pair of American [[space probe]]s sent to [[Mars]], ''[[Viking 1]]'' and ''[[Viking 2]]''.&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=David R. Dr. |title=Viking Mission to Mars |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/viking.html |date=December 18, 2006 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[spacecraft]] was composed of two main parts: an [[orbiter]] designed to photograph the surface of Mars from [[orbit]], and a [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]] designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.

The Viking program grew from [[NASA]]'s earlier, even more ambitious, [[Voyager program (Mars)|Voyager]] Mars program, which was not related to the successful [[Voyager program|Voyager deep space probes]] of the late 1970s. ''Viking 1'' was launched on August 20, 1975, and the second craft, ''Viking 2'', was launched on September 9, 1975, both riding atop [[Titan IIIE]] rockets with [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stages. ''Viking 1'' entered Mars orbit on June 19, 1976, with ''Viking 2'' following suit on August 7.

After orbiting Mars for more than a month and returning images used for landing site selection, the orbiters and landers detached; the landers then entered the Martian [[atmosphere]] and [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft-landed]] at the sites that had been chosen. The ''Viking 1'' lander touched down on the surface of Mars on July 20, 1976, and was joined by the ''Viking 2'' lander on September 3. The orbiters continued imaging and performing other scientific operations from orbit while the landers deployed [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]s on the surface.

The project cost roughly 1 billion USD in 1970s dollars,&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1975-075A|title=NASA – NSSDCA – Spacecraft – Details – Viking 1 Orbiter|last=|first=|date=|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/18234-viking-1.html|title=Viking 1: First U.S. Lander on Mars|newspaper=Space.com|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to about {{Inflation|US-GDP|1|1970|r=0}} billion USD in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}} The mission was considered successful and is credited with helping to form most of the body of knowledge about Mars through the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://planetary-science.org/mars-research/mars-landings/the-viking-program/| publisher=The Center for Planetary Science| title=The Viking Program| access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://californiasciencecenter.org/exhibits/air-space/mission-to-the-planets/viking-lander | publisher=California Science Center| title=Viking Lander| access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science objectives==
*Obtain high-resolution images of the Martian surface
*Characterize the structure and composition of the atmosphere and surface
*Search for evidence of [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]

==Viking orbiters==
The primary objectives of the two Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars, perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites, act as communications relays for the landers, and to perform their own scientific investigations. Each orbiter, based on the earlier [[Mariner 9]] spacecraft, was an [[octagon]] approximately 2.5 m across. The fully fueled orbiter-lander pair had a [[mass]] of 3527&amp;nbsp;kg. After separation and landing, the lander had a mass of about {{Nowrap|600 kg}} and the orbiter {{Nowrap|900 kg.}} The total launch mass was {{Nowrap|2328 kg,}} of which {{Nowrap|1445 kg}} were propellant and [[attitude control]] gas. The eight faces of the ring-like structure were 0.4572 m high and were alternately 1.397 and 0.508 m wide. The overall height was 3.29 m from the lander attachment points on the bottom to the launch vehicle attachment points on top. There were 16 modular compartments, 3 on each of the 4 long faces and one on each short face. Four solar panel wings extended from the [[Coordinate axis|axis]] of the orbiter, the distance from tip to tip of two oppositely extended solar panels was 9.75 m.

===Propulsion===
The main [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] unit was mounted above the [[satellite bus|orbiter bus]]. Propulsion was furnished by a [[bipropellant]] ([[monomethylhydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]]) liquid-fueled [[rocket engine]] which could be [[gimbal]]led up to 9 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. The engine was capable of {{convert|1323|N|lbf|abbr=on|lk=on}} thrust, translating to a [[delta-V|change in velocity]] of 1480 [[metres per second|m/s]]. [[Attitude control]] was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.

===Navigation and communication===
An acquisition [[Sun sensor]], a cruise Sun sensor, a [[Canopus]] [[star tracker]] and an inertial reference unit consisting of six [[gyroscope]]s allowed three-axis stabilization. Two [[accelerometers]] were also on board. Communications were accomplished through a {{Nowrap|20 W}} [[S-band]] (2.3 [[gigahertz|GHz]]) [[transmitter]] and two {{Nowrap|20 W}} [[TWTA]]s. An [[X-band|X band]] {{Nowrap|(8.4&amp;nbsp;GHz)}} [[downlink]] was also added specifically for [[Doppler effect|radio science]] and to conduct communications experiments. [[Uplink]] was via S band {{Nowrap|(2.1&amp;nbsp;GHz).}} A two-axis steerable [[Directional antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] with a diameter of approximately 1.5 m was attached at one edge of the orbiter base, and a fixed low-gain antenna extended from the top of the bus. Two tape recorders were each capable of storing 1280 [[megabit]]s. A 381-[[MHz]] relay radio was also available.

===Power===
The power to the two orbiter craft was provided by eight 1.57 × 1.23 m [[solar panels]], two on each wing. The solar panels comprised a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 W of power at Mars. Power was also stored in two [[nickel-cadmium]] 30-[[Ampere-hour|A·h]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]].

The combined area of the four panels was {{convert|15|m2|ft2|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and they provided both regulated and unregulated direct current power; unregulated power was provided to the radio transmitter and the lander.

Two 30-amp-hour, nickel-cadmium, rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was not facing the Sun, and during launch, correction maneuvers and Mars occultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/viking.pdfx|title=Sitemap – NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=March 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304104054/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/viking.pdfx|archive-date=March 4, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main findings===
[[File:Mars Valles Marineris.jpeg|thumb|Mars image mosaic from the ''Viking 1'' orbiter]]
By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water, the images from the orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about [[water on Mars]]. Huge river valleys were found in many areas. They showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and travelled thousands of kilometers. Large areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched stream networks, suggesting that rain once fell. The flanks of some volcanoes are believed to have been exposed to rainfall because they resemble those caused on Hawaiian volcanoes. Many craters look as if the impactor fell into mud. When they were formed, ice in the soil may have melted, turned the ground into mud, then flowed across the surface. Normally, material from an impact goes up, then down. It does not flow across the surface, going around obstacles, as it does on some Martian craters.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H. Kieffer|title=Mars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoDvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=March 7, 2011|date=1992|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raeburn, P. 1998.

==Viking landers==
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] with a model of a Viking lander.]]
[[File:Viking Lander Model.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's concept depicting a Viking lander on the surface of Mars.]]  
Each lander comprised a six-sided aluminium base with alternate {{convert|1.09|and|0.56|m|abbr=on}} long sides, supported on three extended legs attached to the shorter sides. The leg footpads formed the vertices of an equilateral triangle with {{convert|2.21|m|abbr=on}} sides when viewed from above, with the long sides of the base forming a straight line with the two adjoining footpads. Instrumentation was attached inside and on top of the base, elevated above the surface by the extended legs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aOIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NyQLFf2FSd&amp;sig=5ah6XvTjZCljGWBCLK1XB-oYHbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yL0YUMWlDoTAiwKTr4CYBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Amazing Search for Life On Mars."] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1976, pp. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each lander was enclosed in an [[aeroshell]] heat shield designed to slow the lander down during the entry phase. To prevent contamination of Mars by Earth organisms, each lander, upon assembly and enclosure within the aeroshell, was enclosed in a pressurized "bioshield" and then [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] at a temperature of {{convert|111|°C|sp=us}} for 40 hours. For thermal reasons, the cap of the bioshield was jettisoned after the Centaur upper stage powered the Viking orbiter/lander combination out of Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Soffen, G. A., and C. W. Snyder, First Viking mission to Mars, ''Science'', 193, 759–766, August 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
===Descent and landing===
Each lander arrived at Mars attached to the orbiter. The assembly orbited Mars many times before the lander was released and separated from the orbiter for descent to the surface. Descent comprised four distinct phases, starting with a [[Deorbit#Deorbit and re-entry|deorbit burn]]. The lander then experienced [[atmospheric entry]] with peak heating occurring a few seconds after the start of frictional heating with the Martian atmosphere. At an altitude of about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} and traveling at a velocity of 900 kilometers per hour (600&amp;nbsp;mph), the parachute deployed, the aeroshell released and the lander's legs unfolded. At an altitude of about 1.5 kilometers (5,000 feet), the lander activated its three retro-engines and was released from the parachute. The lander then immediately used [[retrorockets]] to slow and control its descent, with a [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]] on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.if.ufrgs.br/solar/viking.htm Viking]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wide image|Mars_Viking_12a001.png|800px|First "clear" image ever transmitted from the surface of Mars – shows [[List of rocks on Mars#Viking|rocks]] near the ''[[Viking 1]]'' lander (July 20, 1976).}}

===Propulsion===

Propulsion for deorbit was provided by the [[monopropellant]] [[hydrazine]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), through a rocket with 12 [[Rocket engine nozzles|nozzle]]s arranged in four clusters of three that provided {{convert|32|N|lk=in|sp=us}} thrust, translating to a [[delta-V|change in velocity]] of {{convert|180|m/s|abbr=on}}. These nozzles also acted as the control [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] for [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] of the lander.

Terminal [[descent (aircraft)|descent]] (after use of a [[parachute]]) and [[landing]] utilized three (one affixed on each long side of the base, separated by 120 degrees) monopropellant hydrazine engines. The engines had 18 nozzles to disperse the exhaust and minimize effects on the ground, and were [[throttle]]able from {{convert|276|to|2667|N|lk=in|sp=us}}. The hydrazine was purified in order to prevent contamination of the Martian surface with Earth [[microbes]]. The lander carried {{convert|85|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant at launch, contained in two spherical [[titanium]] tanks mounted on opposite sides of the lander beneath the RTG windscreens, giving a total launch mass of {{convert|657|kg|abbr=on}}. Control was achieved through the use of an [[inertial reference unit]], four [[gyroscope|gyros]], a [[radar altimeter]], a terminal descent and landing [[radar]], and the control thrusters.

===Power===
Power was provided by two [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) units containing [[plutonium|plutonium-238]] affixed to opposite sides of the lander base and covered by wind screens. Each generator was {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|58|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, had a mass of {{convert|13.6|kg|abbr=on}} and provided 30 watts continuous power at 4.4 volts. Four [[wet cell]] sealed nickel-cadmium 8 [[ampere-hours]] (28,800 [[coulomb]]s), 28 volts [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] were also on board to handle peak power loads.

===Payload===
[[File:Viking2lander1.jpg|thumb|right|Image from Mars taken by the ''Viking 2'' lander]] 
Communications were accomplished through a 20-watt S-band transmitter using two [[traveling-wave tube]]s. A two-axis steerable high-gain parabolic antenna was mounted on a boom near one edge of the lander base. An [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] low-gain S-band antenna also extended from the base. Both these antennae allowed for communication directly with the Earth, permitting Viking 1 to continue to work long after both orbiters had failed. A [[UHF]] {{Nowrap|(381 MHz)}} antenna provided a one-way relay to the orbiter using a 30 watt relay radio. Data storage was on a 40-Mbit tape recorder, and the lander computer had a 6000-[[Word (data type)|word]] memory for command instructions.

The lander carried instruments to achieve the primary scientific objectives of the lander mission: to study the [[biology]], chemical composition ([[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]]), [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties, appearance, and physical properties of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Two 360-degree cylindrical scan cameras were mounted near one long side of the base. From the center of this side extended the sampler arm, with a collector head, [[Sensor#Thermal|temperature sensor]], and [[magnet]] on the end. A [[Climate of Mars|meteorology]] boom, holding temperature, wind direction, and wind velocity sensors extended out and up from the top of one of the lander legs. A [[seismometer]], magnet and camera [[test target]]s, and magnifying [[mirror]] are mounted opposite the cameras, near the high-gain antenna. An interior environmentally controlled compartment held the [[biology]] experiment and the [[gas chromatography|gas chromatograph]] mass spectrometer. The [[X-ray]] [[fluorescence]] spectrometer was also mounted within the structure. A [[pressure]] sensor was attached under the lander body. The scientific [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] had a total mass of approximately {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}}.

===Biological experiments===
{{Main|Viking biological experiments}}
The Viking landers conducted [[Viking biological experiments|biological experiments]] designed to detect [[life on Mars (planet)|life in the Martian soil]] (if it existed) with experiments designed by three separate teams, under the direction of chief scientist Gerald Soffen of NASA. One experiment turned positive for the detection of [[metabolism]] (current life), but based on the results of the other two experiments that failed to reveal any [[Organic matter|organic molecules]] in the soil, most scientists became convinced that the positive results were likely caused by non-biological chemical reactions from highly oxidizing soil conditions.&lt;ref name=Beegle &gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Concept for NASA's Mars 2016 Astrobiology Field Laboratory|journal=Astrobiology|date=August 2007|first=LUTHER W.|last=BEEGLE|display-authors=etal |volume=7 | issue = 4|pmid=17723090 |pages=545–577|doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0153|bibcode=2007AsBio...7..545B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is consensus that the Viking lander results demonstrated a lack of [[biosignature]]s in soils at the two landing sites, the test results and their limitations are still under assessment. The validity of the positive 'Labeled Release' (LR) results hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the Martian soil, but one was later discovered by the [[Phoenix lander]] in the form of [[perchlorate]] salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-sci-phoenix6-2008aug06,0,4986721.story|title=Perchlorate found in Martian soil|date=August 6, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Johnson|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080805192122.htm|publisher=Science Daily|date=August 6, 2008|title=Martian Life Or Not? NASA's ''Phoenix'' Team Analyzes Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that organic compounds could have been present in the soil analyzed by both ''Viking 1'' and ''Viking 2'', but remained unnoticed due to the presence of perchlorate, as detected by Phoenix in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2010JE003599.shtml |title=Reanalysis of the Viking results suggests perchlorate and organics at midlatitudes on Mars |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=115 |issue=E12010 |date=December 15, 2010 |accessdate=January 7, 2011 |first=Rafael |last=Navarro–Gonzáles |author2=Edgar Vargas |author3=José de la Rosa |author4=Alejandro C. Raga |author5=Christopher P.

The question of microbial life on Mars remains unresolved. Nonetheless, on April 12, 2012, an international team of scientists reported studies, based on mathematical speculation through [[complexity analysis]] of the [[Viking biological experiments#Labeled Release|Labeled Release experiments]] of the 1976 Viking Mission, that may suggest the detection of "extant microbial life on Mars."&lt;ref name="Bianciardi-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bianciardi |first1=Giorgio |last2=Miller |first2=Joseph D. |last3=Straat |first3=Patricia Ann |last4=Levin |first4=Gilbert V. |title=Complexity Analysis of the Viking Labeled Release Experiments |url=http://ijass.org/PublishedPaper/year_abstract.asp?idx=132 |journal=IJASS |date=March 2012 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=14–26 |accessdate=April 15, 2012 |doi=10.5139/IJASS.2012.13.1.14 |bibcode=2012IJASS..13...14B |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415162537/http://ijass.org/PublishedPaper/year_abstract.asp?idx=132 |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery-20120412"&gt;{{cite web |last=Klotz |first=Irene |title=Mars Viking Robots 'Found Life' |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-life-viking-landers-discovery-120412.html |date=April 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel|DiscoveryNews]] |accessdate=April 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camera/imaging system===
The leader of the imaging team was Thomas Mutch, a geologist at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The camera uses a movable mirror to illumate 12 photo diodes. Each of the 12 silicon diodes are designed to be sensitive to different frequences of light. Several diodes are placed to focus accurately at distances between six and 43 feet away from the lander.

The cameras scanned at a rate of five vertical scan lines per second, each composed of 512 pixels. The 300 degree panorama images were composed of 9150 lines. The cameras scan was slow enough that in a crew shot several members show up several times in the shot as they moved themselves as the camera scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-425/ch8.htm|title=The Martian Landscape|author=The Viking Lander Imaging Team|publisher=NASA|date=1978|chapter=Chapter 8: Cameras Without Pictures|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/21/archives/viking-cameras-light-in-weight-use-little-power-work-slowly.html|title=Viking Cameras Light in Weight, Use Little Power, Work Slowly|last=McElheny|first=Victor K.|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 21, 1976|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control systems==
The Viking landers used a Guidance, Control and Sequencing Computer (GCSC) consisting of two [[Honeywell]] HDC 402 24-bit computers with 18K of [[Plated wire memory|plated-wire memory]], while the Viking orbiters used a Command Computer Subsystem (CCS) using two custom-designed 18-bit serial processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tomayko|first=James|publisher=NASA|date=April 1987|url=https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html|accessdate=February 6, 2010|title=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Holmberg|first=Neil A.|author2=Robert P.

==Financial cost of the Viking program==
The two orbiters cost 217 million USD (at the time), which is about {{Inflation|r=0|US-GDP|.217|1970}} billion USD in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} year-dollars.&lt;ref name="marsmoney"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Dy6z6DQDNoC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=cost+of+viking+in+inflation+adjusted+dollars#v=onepage&amp;q=cost%20of%20viking%20in%20inflation%20adjusted%20dollars&amp;f=false|title=Faster, Better, Cheaper: Low-Cost Innovation in the U.S. Space Program|last=McCurdy|first=Howard E.|date=2001-11-14|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801867200|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most expensive single part of the program was the lander's life-detection unit, which cost about 60 million then or {{Inflation|r=-2|US-GDP|60|1970}} million USD in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} year-dollars.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Development of the Viking lander design cost 357 million USD.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; This was decades before "faster, better, cheaper", Viking needed to pioneer never before imagined technologies under the pressure of national prestige pulled by the Global [[Cold War]] conflict and a Space race, not to mention a possibility they might discover extraterrestrial life for the first time (it would only be after the mission, with results created by Viking that such an idea rang less plausible).&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; The experiments had to adhere to a special 1971 directive that mandated that no single failure shall stop the return of more than one experiment{{mdash}}a difficult and expensive task for a device with over 40,000 parts.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;

The Viking camera system cost 27.3 million USD to develop, or about {{Inflation|r=-2|US-GDP|27.3|1970}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} year-dollars.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When the Imaging system design was completed, it was difficult to find anyone who could manufacture it so advanced.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; The program managers were later praised for fending off pressure to go with a simpler, less advanced imaging system, especially when the views rolled in.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; The program did save some money by cutting out a third lander and reducing the number of experiments on the lander.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;

Overall NASA says that US$1 billion in 1970s dollars was spent on the program,&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; which when inflation-adjusted to {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars is about {{Inflation|r=0|US-GDP|1|1970}} billion USD.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;As the Viking program was a government expense, the inflation index of the United States [[Nominal GDP|Nominal Gross Domestic Product]] per capita is used for the inflation-adjusting calculation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission end==
The craft eventually failed, one by one, as follows:&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|}
The Viking program ended on May 21, 1983. To prevent an imminent impact with Mars the orbit of ''Viking 1'' orbiter was raised on August 7, 1980 before it was shut down 10 days later. Impact and potential contamination on the planet's surface is possible from 2019 onwards.&lt;ref name="v1osd"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1975-075A |title=Viking 1 Orbiter spacecraft details |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |date=May 14, 2012 |work=National Space Science Date Center |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's unknown if the ''Viking 2'' orbiter's orbit was also raised to prevent an impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1975-083A&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Viking 1'' lander was found to be about 6 kilometers from its planned landing site by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in December 2006.

'''''Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise''''' is a [[life simulation game]] developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[video game console]] and based on ''[[Viva Piñata]]''.

It was developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s handheld team, as opposed to ''[[Viva Piñata: Party Animals]]'' and the [[Viva Piñata (PC game)|PC version]] of the original game, which were developed by separate [[third-party developer]]s.

==Gameplay==
[[File:VP Pocket Paradise Screenshot 002.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Main game view (info panel displaying the Garden Terrain % and the appearance of a [[Chocolate|Choc]][[Ostrich|strich]])]]
''Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise'' is, like its [[Viva pinata|predecessor]], a [[Sandbox (video games)|sandbox game]] that tasks the player with turning a neglected plot of land into a beautiful garden. The game retains the majority of features and all of the piñata from the original. As the game was built from the ground up for the ''DS'', Rare’s handheld team took the opportunity to add additional features and changes.

===Controls===
The most obvious difference between ''Pocket Paradise'' and the original is that the entire game is controlled using the stylus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14903 |title=Exclusive: Rare Talks '&amp;#39;Viva Piñata'&amp;#39; DS |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  giving the player a very direct, intuitive method of interacting with their garden. It is now possible to simply ‘draw’ grass onto soil, or double tap a flower to remove its head.

The game also makes use of the two screens on the DS where, for the majority of the game, the main garden view is displayed in the lower screen of the DS. In the upper screen, there is a context sensitive information panel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oli Welsh |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=149255&amp;page=2 |title=Viva Pińata: Pocket Paradise Hands On - DS - Page 2 |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is unique to this version of the game. The information that is displayed dynamically changes to reflect what is currently selected - ranging from an individual piñata's romance requirements to a percentage breakdown of the garden's floor tiles. It is even possible to swap the screens around and interact with the information panel, to view a comprehensive piñata encyclopedia, a journal, an awards page and a piñata pyramid (amongst other things).

===Unique features===
[[File:VP Pocket Paradise Screenshot 003.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Overhead map]]
Other than control changes, there is a handful of design changes that are unique to this version of the game. First off, it is no longer possible to buy fertiliser or romance sweets.&lt;ref name="ds.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= Matt Wales IGN UK |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/880/880554p2.html |title=Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise UK Preview - Nintendo DS Preview at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertiliser (which is now accessed via the main tools pallet) is only produced when a Taffly is made to interact with a piece of fruit - the colour of the fruit dictates the colour of the fertiliser. Romance sweets are now earned by completing Viva Piñata Central challenges, putting much more emphasis on what was originally a purely optional aspect of the game. Another major difference between the DS version and the original is the addition of an overhead map &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Matt Wales IGN UK |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/880/880554p1.html |title=Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise UK Preview - Nintendo DS Preview at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that not only enables the player to view the whereabouts of their piñata instantly, but allows them to zoom in on any pinata by simply tapping their icon.

A new game mode has also been added that mirrors the "Just for fun"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/v/vptip/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813113610/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/v/vptip/ |date=August 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mode in ''[[Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise]]'', named “Playground”.&lt;ref name="ds.ign.com"/&gt; This is a no-pressure version of the main game (set on a beach) where young or inexperienced players can experiment without having to deal with the challenging aspects of the game, such as Dastardos or Ruffians, or having to pay for items.

Rare explains on their website that "you'll also be given free rein with an expanded selection of tools and tool actions, upgraded forms of the Journal and Encyclopedia... and Episodes (tying in more closely to the TV series and allowing fans of the show to spend quality time with familiar faces)." They also state that “DS wireless connectivity... lets you send prime Piñata specimens to your friends, making the act of parading your Doenut around in a humiliating pirate outfit easier than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rareware.com/company/news.html |title=30/7/07: Handheld Horstachios |publisher=Rareware.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Back in 2005, [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] reported that Rare was hard at work on two projects for the Nintendo DS. Their first Nintendo DS game released was ''[[Diddy Kong Racing DS]]'', so that game and ''Viva Piñata'' were most likely the two projects mentioned.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

''Viva Piñata'' for the Nintendo DS was first hinted at in an interview between [[Microsoft Game Studios]] and [[1UP.com]] at the DICE 2007 Summit in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The game was announced later at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2007{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and on May 13, 2008 [[THQ]] officially announced the release of ''Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise'' in the Fall of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thq-games.com/uk/game/show/4311/Viva%20Pinata:%20Pocket%20Paradise |title=THQ Press Release |publisher=Thq-games.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162101/http://www.thq-games.com/uk/game/show/4311/Viva%20Pinata:%20Pocket%20Paradise |archive-date=2011-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rareware.com/company/press-vppocket1.html |title=THQ press release on Rare's website |publisher=Rareware.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 22, 2008 Rare opened a dedicated ''Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise'' section on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rareware.com/games/vivapinata-pocket/index.html |title=Rare's VP:PP Homepage |publisher=Rareware.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2008 interview with members from the team, the question "Was it always the plan to transfer Viva Piñata across to the DS, or did it take some prompting?" received the response "In discussions for a follow-on project for ''[[Diddy Kong Racing DS#Diddy Kong Racing DS|DKR DS]]'' it became a greater focal point, and in hindsight, seeing what we came up with, it's proven to be a complete no-brainer. We love it." from the game's producer, Paul Machacek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rareware.com/games/vivapinata-pocket/interview.html |title=May 2008 Interview |publisher=Rareware.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''wetware''' is used to describe the protocols and molecular devices used in [[molecular biology]] and [[synthetic biology]].

Where biological components and systems are treated in a similar manner to software, and similar development models and methodologies are applied, the term 'wetware' can be used to imply an approach to their problems as 'bugs' and their beneficial aspects as 'features'. In this manner, genetic code can be subjected to [[Version Control Systems]] such as [[Git]], for the development of improvements and new gene edits, therapeutic components and therapies.

== Examples ==
The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded Wiki project Open Wetware (OWW) provides a resource for reagent, project and laboratory notebook sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page|title=Open Wetware (OWW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A somewhat related NSF consortium Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) constructs and distributes wetware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://synberc.org|title=NSF SynBERC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Queen Æthelburg''', (also '''Æthelburh''' or '''Ethelburga''') (ca. 673-740) was Queen of Wessex by marriage to King [[Ine of Wessex]]. Perhaps most famed for her act in 722, when she destroyed the stronghold of [[Taunton]] (which had been built by Ine) in an attempt to find the rebel [[Ealdbert]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Mike|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens|publisher=Robinson Publishing|location=London|year=1998|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Æthelburg was born circa 673. She was the wife of King [[Ine of Wessex]]. Æthelburg is considered by some historians to be one of the few Anglo-Saxon women warriors.&lt;ref name="BrineCiletti2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin R.

==Legacy==
Æthelburg of Wessex  is sometimes confused with [[Æthelburg of Kent]], the wife of [[Edwin of Northumbria]], who founded the Lyminge monastery in [[Kent]]. Æthelburg is a featured figure on [[Judy Chicago]]'s installation piece ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', being represented as one of the 999 names on the ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]].

In ''The Dinner Party'' the character Æthelburg is actually a combination of Æthelburg of Wessex and Æthelburg of Kent.&lt;ref name="C105"&gt;Chicago, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aethel"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Aethelburg | work=Elizabeth A.
