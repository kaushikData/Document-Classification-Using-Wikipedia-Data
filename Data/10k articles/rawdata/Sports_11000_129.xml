The '''1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad''' was the sixth edition of [[International Workers' Olympiads]]. The games were held from 25 July to 1 August at [[Antwerp]] in [[Belgium]]. They were originally planned for [[Barcelona]] 1936, but cancelled due the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/labourolympia.html#37 1937 Labour Olympiads] Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation. Retrieved 23 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

1937 Olympiad was a joint event with the [[Red Sport International]] organized [[Spartakiads]]. It was the first time as a delegation from [[Soviet Union]] took part at the Workers' Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;John Nauright &amp; Charles Parrish (ed.): "Sports Around the World – History, Culture and Practice" (p. 463). Retrieved 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; German athletes no longer participated since the [[Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund|Workers' Gymnastics and Sports Federation of Germany]] had been banned by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in 1933.

The '''[[1984–85 NHL season|1984–85]] [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] [[Season (sports)|season]]''' was the team's [[Pittsburgh Penguins seasons|18th]] in the [[National Hockey League]]. It marked the debut of [[Mario Lemieux]] for the [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Penguins]]. Lemieux debuted on October 11, 1984, against the [[Boston Bruins]] and scored a goal with his very first NHL shot, on his first shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/feature/?fid=10600&amp;hubname= | title = Mario Lemieux Retires | publisher = TSN | accessdate = 2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that season, Lemieux played in the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] and became the first rookie to be named the All-Star Game's [[Most Valuable Player]]. Despite missing seven games during the season, Lemieux scored 100 points and won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the rookie of the year.

==Offseason==

Before the [[1984 NHL Entry Draft]], Lemieux announced he wanted to play for whoever drafted him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Christopher | first = Matt | title = On the Ice With... Mario Lemieux | origyear = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5D6CaqcQhkgC | accessdate = 2007-09-21 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | isbn = 0-316-13799-5 | pages = 3 | date = 2002-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his agent were deadlocked with the Penguins and could not negotiate a contract. Because of this, when the Penguins called his name as the first overall draft pick, he did not shake [[General manager#Sports teams|general manager]] [[Eddie Johnston]]'s hand or don the Penguins jersey, as is NHL tradition. He claimed he was upset about the contract negotiation, and said that "Pittsburgh doesn't want [him] bad enough."&lt;ref name="Christopher, 23"&gt;Christopher, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the draft was held in Montreal, over 3,000 fans viewed a broadcast in [[Mellon Arena|Pittsburgh's Civic Arena]] &amp;mdash; a typical Penguins game drew less than 7,000 fans at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Lemieux's actions upset many fans and led to accusations of arrogance and aloofness.&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deacon |first=James |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0010639 |title=Lemieux, Mario (profile) |work=[[Maclean's Magazine]] |date=1996-04-08 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015163600/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTM0010639 |archivedate=2007-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the draft, Johnston signed Lemieux to a two-year contract for $600,000, plus a $150,000 bonus for signing.&lt;ref name="Christopher, 23"/&gt;  Although Lemieux wore the jersey #27 during his time with the Laval Voisins, he wanted to adopt Wayne Gretzky's #99 when he entered the NHL.  However, his agent advised him to create his own identity; thus, Lemieux turned #99 upside down and landed on #66, which stuck with him throughout his career.

The '''2012 Indian Premier League spot-fixing case''' was a [[Controversies involving the Indian Premier League|controversy]] which arose during the [[2012 Indian Premier League]] and led to the banning of five [[cricket]]ers. It started when a [[Hindi]] news channel, [[India TV]], aired a [[sting operation]] which accused five players of seeking money in exchange for [[spot-fixing]].&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite web|title=BCCI suspends five players accused in spot-fixing|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/IPL-2012-BCCI-suspends-five-players-accused-in-spot-fixing/14619|publisher=Cricketcountry.com|accessdate=15 May 2012|author=CricketCountry Staff|date=15 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519050951/http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/IPL-2012-BCCI-suspends-five-players-accused-in-spot-fixing/14619|archive-date=19 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bans were imposed on all five, with a life-ban on [[Deccan Chargers]]'s [[TP Sudhindra]], a five-year ban on [[Kings XI Punjab]]'s [[Shalabh Srivastava]], and a one-year ban on [[Pune Warriors India]]'s [[Mohnish Mishra]] and Kings XI Punjab's [[Amit Yadav]].&lt;ref name="ht"&gt;{{cite news|title=Day of shame for cricket's Youngistan|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/sports-news/cricketnews/BCCI-bans-five-players-caught-in-IPL-spot-fixing-scandal/Article1-881320.aspx|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=30 June 2012|author=Amol Karhadkar|author2=Firoz Mirza|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition [[Abhinav Bali]], who was not in contact with any team during the 2012 season, was banned for a year. In the sting operation, Bali claimed to have spot-fixed during the [[2009 Indian Premier League|2009 season]].&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; According to the sting operation, some of the players revealed that they had received more money from the franchises' owners than agreed on in the players' auction; they said that this money was [[Indian black money|black money]].&lt;ref name=indiatv&gt;{{cite news|title=India TV sting reveals spot-fixing and black money in IPL|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket/india-tv-sting-reveals-spot-fixing-and-black-money-ipl-5829.html|publisher=[[India TV]]|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=16 May 2012|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sting operation==
The sting operation was performed by reporters of India TV Jamshed Khan and Sushant Pathak posing as representatives of various teams.&lt;ref name=mumbaimirror&gt;{{cite web|title=10 lakh for no-ball: TV stings IPL underbelly|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=15&amp;contentid=20120515201205150210128002146809d|publisher=[[Mumbai Mirror]]|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was started in May 2011 and lasted until April of the following year.&lt;ref name=mumbaimirror/&gt; According to the operation, Srivastava revealed that the money they received from the franchises was black money.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; According to India TV, he was ready to spot-fix; however, the conversation is only recorded in an audio tape.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; Bali, who was not in contact with any franchise, claimed to have been involved in spot-fixing during the 2009 season.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; Mishra claimed that his franchise, Pune Warriors India, gave him around {{INRConvert|12|m|nolink=yes}} to {{INRConvert|14|m|nolink=yes}}. This was against the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] guidelines; being an uncapped player, Mishra could not receive more than {{INRConvert|3|m|nolink=yes}}.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;&lt;ref name=indiatv/&gt; TP Sudhindra also bowled a [[no-ball]] in a domestic match on the wish of the reporter.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

==Preliminary inquiry==
The BCCI carried out a preliminary inquiry headed by Ravi Sawani, the '''ICC Anti-Corruption Unit''''s former chief and the current head of the '''BCCI Anti-Corruption Unit'''.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; IPL chairman [[Rajiv Shukla]] announced that the IPL would recommend "strict action against those players who were found guilty" and that "the five players have been suspended from all cricket activities with immediate effect."&lt;ref name=cc/&gt; BCCI president [[N. Srinivasan]] added that the organisation has zero tolerance for corruption and would "not tolerate this nonsense".&lt;ref name=cc/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5772">'''ABC Sports Award of the Year''' was one of the premier sports awards in Australia. From 1951 to 1983, it was called the ABC Sportsman of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sporting heroes to walk over water at awards|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page12970193|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=Canberra Times|date=14 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was originally voted for by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] sports supervisors and the sports editors of major Australian newspapers. After 1983, members of the Australian Sportswriters' Association also voted.&lt;ref name=ampol&gt;{{cite book|title=Ampol Australian Sporting Records|date=1988|publisher=Bantam|location=Sydney|edition=8th rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were first presented on television in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC TV firsts|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/50years/didyouknow/firsts.htm|website=ABC website|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimmer [[Dawn Fraser]] was voted as the best Australian sportsman of the 25 years in 1975 as part of the award silver jubilee celebrations.&lt;ref name=ampol/&gt;

In 1993, there was a merger of the [[Australian Sport Awards|Sport Australia Awards]] and the ABC Sports Award of the Year with the new award known as ABC Sport Australia Awards.&lt;ref name=merger&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inaugural ABC Sport Awards|journal=Sport Report|date=1993–1994|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1994, the new award removed the ABC from its title.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; The award was later known as the [[Australian Sport Awards]] and ceased in 2006. The main national annual awards are [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame Awards]] and the [[Australian Institute of Sport Awards]].

The '''Anaheim Convention Center''' is a major [[convention center]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. It is located across from the [[Disneyland Resort]] on Katella Avenue. The original components, designed by Adrian Wilson &amp; Associates, opened in July 1967—including a basketball arena followed shortly by the convention hall. It holds many events, like [[VidCon]], [[BlizzCon]], [[Anime Expo]], [[D23 Expo|D23 expo]], [[WonderCon]], [[NAMM Show]], competitions, etc. In addition to hosting various types of conventions, the Anaheim Convention Center was used to host the [[Wrestling at the 1984 Summer Olympics|wrestling]] during the [[1984 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102235952/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf |date=2010-11-02 }} Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 153–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The center has subsequently undergone six major expansions (1974, 1982, 1990, 1993, 1999–2000, 2016-2017). It is the largest exhibit facility on the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/city-381065-resort-center.html|title=Anaheim clears way for resort-area expansion|first=ERIC|last=CARPENTER|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the arena was home to the [[Anaheim Amigos]] of the [[American Basketball Association (1967–1976)|American Basketball Association]] during the first ABA season, 1967–68. The franchise relocated to the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] and became the [[Los Angeles Stars]] immediately thereafter; the team eventually moved to Salt Lake City and became the [[Utah Stars]], capturing the 1970–71 ABA Championship. The Stars' subsequent fan support in Utah set the foundation for the NBA's [[Utah Jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remembertheaba.com/Anaheim-Amigos.html Anaheim Amigos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306022726/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Anaheim-Amigos.html |date=2007-03-06 }}.

According to frequent news reports, the largest exposition held at the Convention Center in recent years has been the Winter [[NAMM Show]]. This music-equipment convention (trade only, not open to the general public) had 1,560 exhibitors and a record-breaking 88,100 attendees during the 2008 show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namm.org/press-room/news/news-releases/2008January21a/view NAMM Unifies Industry at Record-Breaking Show — NAMM, The International Music Products Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127123352/http://www.namm.org/press-room/news/news-releases/2008January21a/view |date=January 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NAMM Show has been running at the Anaheim Center since 1977, except for a 3-year break in 1998–2000 while the Convention Center underwent major renovations. In 2008, news reports indicated that NAMM's long-term lease with the Anaheim Convention Center authority would end in 2010, and NAMM was applying pressure to the City of Anaheim to further expand and improve the convention center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2008/01/16/anaheim-convention-center-explores-expansion/|title=Anaheim Convention Center explores expansion|first=SARAH|last=TULLY|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobsleigh''' or '''bobsled''' is a [[winter sport]] in which teams of two or four teammates make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered [[sled|sleigh]]. The timed runs are combined to calculate the final score.

The various types of sleds came several years before the first tracks were built in [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland, where the original bobsleds were adapted upsized [[luge]]/[[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] sleds designed by the adventurously wealthy to carry passengers. All three types were adapted from boys' delivery sleds and [[toboggan]]s.

Competition naturally followed, and to protect the working class and rich visitors in the streets and byways of St Moritz, bobsledding was eventually banned from the public highway.  In the winter of 1903/1904 the Badrutt family, owners of the historic Kulm Hotel and the  [[Badrutt's Palace Hotel|Palace Hotel]], allowed Emil Thoma to organise the construction of the first familiarly configured 'half-pipe' track in the Kulm Hotel Park, ending in the village of Cresta. It has hosted the sport during two Olympics and is still in use today.

International bobsleigh competitions are governed by the [[International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation]], also known as FIBT from the French {{lang|fr|Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing}}.  National competitions are often governed by bodies such as the [[United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation]] and [[Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton]].

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the action some early competitors adopted of bobbing back and forth inside their sleds to increase speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70808/bobsledding |title=bobsledding (sport) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:Bobfahrer Davos.jpg|thumb|left|The Swiss bobsleigh team from [[Davos]], c. 1910]]
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-09740-0004, Oberhof, II. Wintersportmeisterschaften, Bobfahren.jpg|thumb|left|An East German bobsleigh in 1951, [[Oberhof bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Oberhof track]], [[East Germany]]]]
Although [[sledding]] on snow or ice had long been popular in many northern countries, the origins of bobsleighing as a modern sport are relatively recent. Its foundation began when hotelier [[Caspar Badrutt]] (1848–1904) convinced some [[Grand Tour|English regulars]] to remain through the entire winter at his hotel in the [[mineral spa]] town of [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland. Keeping them entertained with food, alcohol, and activities, he quickly established the concept of "winter resorting". Badrutt has done it because he was annoyed his regular English clientele were only staying at his hotel during the summer months. It only took a couple of years for wintering at Badrutt's St Moritz hotel to become very fashionable in [[Victorian Britain]]. But increased numbers led some guests to search for new diversions. In the early 1870s some adventurous English guests began adapting boys' delivery sleds for recreational purposes. However, they soon began colliding with pedestrians in the icy lanes, alleyways and roads of St Moritz.

Guests soon began to invent "steering means" for the sleds. This led to the development of the bobsleigh (bobsled): two cresta's (skeleton sleds) attached together with a board that had a steering mechanism at the front. However, the impetus to steer the sleds permitted longer runs through the town. Longer runs also meant higher speeds on curves. Local sentiments varied about these informal competitions but eventually complaints grew so vociferous that Badrutt was forced to take action. His solution was to build a basic natural ice run for his guests near the town. Badrutt had worked hard to popularize wintering in the mountain resort and was worried customers would stop coming due to boredom. He also did not want to make enemies in the town from locals injured by bobsleds. He opened the world's first natural ice half-pipe track in the late 1870s.

===Competitive discipline===
Formal competitions started down the natural ice [[Cresta Run]] in 1884, which was built in an annual partnership between guests and local people. The run, which is still in operation {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}}, has served as a host track for [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] at two [[Winter Olympics]] ([[Skeleton at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and [[Skeleton at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]]). As one of the few natural weather tracks in the world, it does not use artificial refrigeration. It is not known how much the original track evolved in the early years as the three sports matured and stabilized. The first club formed in 1897, and the first purpose-built track solely for bobsleds opened in 1902 outside St Moritz. Over the years, bobsleigh tracks evolved from straight runs to twisting and turning tracks. The original wooden sleds&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g_EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3jf_TOt2o96dB_u50OkJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Rounding The Zigzag Turn Of A Bobsleigh Run", April 1932, Popular Science] photo of wooden bobsleigh used in early 1930s&lt;/ref&gt; gave way to streamlined fiberglass and metal ones.

The ''[[International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation]]'' (FIBT) was founded in 1923.  Men's four-man bobsleigh appeared in the first ever [[Winter Olympic Games]] in 1924, and the men's two-man bobsleigh event was added in 1932.  Though not included in the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], bobsleigh has featured in every [[Winter Olympics]] since. Women's bobsleigh competition began in the US in 1983 with two demonstration races in Lake Placid, New York, one held in February and the second held during the World Cup races in March 1983. Women's two-woman bobsleigh made its Olympic debut at the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]]. Bobsleigh is also contested at American, European, and World Cup championships.

Germany and Switzerland have proven the most successful bobsleighing nations measured by overall success in European, World, World Cup, and Olympic championships. Since the 1990s Germans have dominated in international competition, having won more medals than any other nation. Italy, Austria, United States and Canada also have strong bobsleigh traditions.

Bobsleighs can attain speeds of {{Convert|150|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with the reported world record being {{Convert|201|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamsontour.com/activities/bobsleigh.asp|title=Bobsleigh Activity {{!}} TeamsOnTour.com|website=www.teamsontour.com|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
===Tracks===
[[Image:Bobbahn-Altenberg-4.JPG|thumb|[[Altenberg bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Altenberg track]], Germany]]
{{Details|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}
Modern tracks  are made of [[concrete]], coated with ice. They are required to have at least one straight section and one labyrinth (three turns in quick succession without a straight section). Ideally, a modern track should be {{convert|1200|to(-)|1300|m|ft}} long and have at least fifteen curves.  Speeds may exceed {{convert|120|km/h|mph}}, and some curves can subject the crews to as much as 5 [[g-force|''g'']].

Some bobsleigh tracks are also used for [[luge]] and skeleton competition.

Some tracks offer tourists rides in bobsleighs, including those at [[Sigulda bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Sigulda]], Latvia; Innsbruck-Igls, Austria; [[Canada Olympic Park bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada; [[Whistler Sliding Centre|Whistler]], [[British Columbia]], Canada; [[Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track|Lillehammer]], Norway; [[Cesana Pariol]], Italy; [[Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run|Lake Placid]], US;  [[Utah Olympic Park Track|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], US and [[La Plagne bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|La Plagne]], France.

===Sleighs and crews===
[[Image:Army Bobsleigh on a wall.jpg|thumb|Team USA on a wall, [[Shauna Rohbock]] (pilot) and [[Valerie Fleming]] (brakes) during their [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] silver run on [[Cesana Pariol]], Italy]]
Modern day sleighs combine light metals, steel runners, and an aerodynamic composite body.  Competition sleighs must be a maximum of {{convert|3.80|m|ft}} long (4-crew) or {{convert|2.70|m|ft}} long (2-crew).  The runners on both are set at {{convert|0.67|m|ft}} [[Rail gauge|gauge]].  Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed.  Nowadays, the maximum [[weight]], including crew, is {{convert|630|kg|lb}} (4-man), {{convert|390|kg|lb}} (2-man), or {{convert|340|kg|lb}} (2-woman), which can be reached via the addition of metal weights.  The bobsleighs themselves are designed to be as light as possible to allow dynamic positioning of mass through the turns of the bobsleigh course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Niller|first=Eric|title=U.S. Olympic Team Gets BMW Bobsleds|url=http://news.discovery.com/adventure/extreme-sports/bmw-designed-bobsleds-offer-us-team-sleek-speed-140203.htm#mkcpgn=rssnws1|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=[[Discovery News]]|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bobsleigh crews once consisted of five or six people, they were reduced to two- and four-person sleighs in the 1930s. The crew has a pilot, a brakeman, and pushers. Athletes are selected based on their speed and strength, which are necessary to push the sleigh to a competitive speed at the start of the race. Pilots must have the skill, timing, and finesse to steer the sleigh along the path, or "line", that will produce the greatest speed.

In modern bobsleighs, the steering system consists of two metal rings that actuate a pulley system located in the forward cowling that turns the front runners. For example, to turn left, the pilot would pull the left ring. Only subtle steering adjustments are necessary to guide the sled; at speeds up to {{convert|80|mph|km/h}}, anything larger would result in a crash. The pilot does most of the steering, and the brakeman stops the sled after crossing the finish line by pulling the sled's brake lever.

Women compete in women's bobsleigh (which is always two-woman) and men in both two and four-man competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fibt.com/ |title= FIBT the international home of Bobsleigh and Skeleton Sports |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were confirmed as being able to compete in any four-"man" bobsleigh event, as from 25 September 2014, either as part of a mixed-sex team or an all-female team.

===Racing===
[[Image:USA-1 in heat 3 of 4 man bobsleigh at 2010 Winter Olympics 2010-02-27.jpg|thumb|USA-1 in heat 3 of 4-man bobsleigh at 2010 Winter Olympics, 27 Fevruarb 2010]]

Individual runs down the course, or "heats", begin from a standing start, with the crew pushing the sled for up to {{convert|50|m|ft}} before boarding; though the pilot does not steer, grooves in the ice make steering unnecessary until the sled leaves the starting area. While poor form during the initial push can lose a team the heat, it is otherwise rarely, if ever, decisive.  Over the rest of the course, a sleigh's speed depends on its weight, aerodynamics, runners, the condition of the ice, and the skill of the pilot.

Race times are recorded in hundredths of seconds, so even seemingly minor errors – especially those at the beginning, which affect the remainder of the heat – can have a measurable impact on the final race standings.

The men's and women's standings for normal races are calculated over the aggregate of two runs or heats. At the Olympic Winter Games and World Championships, all competitions (for both men and women) consist of four heats.

'''Bolas criollas''' is a traditional team sport from [[Venezuela]], very popular in the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]] and most rural regions. It is one of the most representative icons of [[Llanero]] culture. Its origins can be traced back to traditional European sports, such as [[bocce]] and [[pétanque]].

==Objective==
Two teams of two participants equipped with eight heavy balls throw in turns and attempt to place them as close as possible to a much smaller metal ball. The team that reaches a maximum of 100 points in several attempts wins the match.

==Description==
It is played in a court shaped as a large level rectangle, built of flattened earth (typically rich in sand or clay), clear of trees or visible obstacles. The court must keep a 3:2 proportion ratio and its actual dimensions may vary, but an approximate size of {{convert|20|x|30|m|yd}} is preferred.
The court is usually enclosed with logs, wooden boards or concrete slabs. On occasion an internal string perimeter fitted at no more than {{convert|20|cm|in|sigfig=1}} from the enclosure signals valid gaming ground. The solid balls (roughly {{convert|15|cm|in|sigfig=1}} diameter, made of synthetic material) are coloured red and green respectively to separate each team. The small steel or iron ball called ''mingo'' has a diameter no greater than {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1}} and is used as a marker. At the beginning of a match, a previously drawn member of either team throws the ''mingo'' from one established end of the court (called the ''calzador'') to the opposite end. If the ''mingo'' rests in the opposite half of the court, the toss is valid. From then, participants of each team alternatively toss one ball each from the ''calzador'' attempting to make their balls rest as close to the ''mingo'' as possible (or touching it). After all balls have been thrown, a designated judge awards points to the winning team based on their balls' proximity to the ''mingo''. If the match is not ended by a winning score, the whole routine is repeated from the alternate end (for ease, as there is no need to carry the heavy balls back to the original place). A valid toss in ''bolas criollas'' is done with the palm of the hand facing ''downward'' (in opposition to [[bowling]], for example), and the arm must swing in a graceful arc, body resting on one flexed leg and the other leg extended. Running to gain momentum is allowed, as long as the player does not overshoot the ''calzador''.

==Scoring==
Points are awarded in the following fashion: the judge identifies the winning colour as the ball that is closest to the ''mingo''. An imaginary circle with the ''mingo'' in the center is drawn, its radius being the center of the first ball of the opposite colour. Any balls of the winning colour that fall within this circle are counted as points. A maximum of eight and minimum of zero (a draw) can be counted by each "set". As measurements can be imprecise and somewhat subjective in loose soil, discussions frequently arise. The judge may require a bit of string (to use as a "ruler") or other tools, and more than one judge may be required for unbiased decisions. When not officially competing, participants may use steps (counting the number of steps placed in front of the other - tip to heel to the ''mingo''), outstretched hands, twigs or whatever means available, giving rise to somewhat hilarious situations.

==Tricks and moves==
Though a simple game, experienced ''bolas criollas'' players display great skill at their throws. Several valid moves and tricks are commonly exploited that completely alter the course of a game.
*'''''Arrime''''' - When a player throws a ball in a gentle calculated arc and it lands just beside the ''mingo''.
*'''''Boche''''' - A difficult move where a skilled thrower hits the winning ball of an opponent with his own, displacing the opponent's ball and leaving the thrower's team in a winning position. An alternative version of this move is hitting the ''mingo'' itself, thus changing completely the geometry of the game.
*'''''Clavao''''' - A ''Boche'' with effect, that leaves the "aggressive" ball in the exact position of the original ball as if "nailed".

==Popularity==
The first report about the arrival of this game to Venezuela mention that Spanish monks brought it with the [[conquistadores]]. Since 1930, it has become widely popular, and during the first National Sports Games event in 1956, it was elevated to a sport, and official rules were set. Since then, it has been one of the most popular attractions in this event. The National ''Bolas Criollas'' Championship takes place every year during the months of August and September. The game is also very popular in [[Colombia]] (mostly in the city of [[Cúcuta]]) and in Cuba. It is played without distinction by all social classes and genders.

'''Chaparral Cars''' was a pioneering American automobile racing team and race car developer that engineered, built, and raced cars from 1963 through 1970. Founded in 1962 by American [[Formula One]] racers [[Hap Sharp]] and [[Jim Hall (race car driver)|Jim Hall]], it was named after the [[roadrunner]], a fast-running ground [[cuckoo]] also known as a ''[[chaparral]] bird''.
 
==Background==
Troutman and Barnes were builders of the original Chaparral race cars (later referred to as Chaparral 1).  Jim Hall purchased two Chaparral 1s to race.  When Hall and Sharp began building their own cars, they asked Troutman and Barnes if they could continue to use the Chaparral name.  That is why the Hall/Sharp cars are all named Chaparral 2s (models 2A through 2J for sports cars/CanAm cars, and the 2K which was the 1979–1982 Indycar).  Despite winning the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1980, they left motor racing in 1982.  Chaparral cars also featured in the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]]/[[Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs|CASC]] [[Can-Am]] series and Endurance racing.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}

Jim Hall  was a leader in the innovation and design of spoilers, wings, and ground effects.  A high point was the 1966 2E Can-Am car.  The 2J Can-Am "sucker car" was the first "[[Ground effect (cars)|ground-effects]]" car.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}

The development of the Chaparral chronicles the key changes in race cars in the 1960s and 1970s in both aerodynamics and tires. Hall's training as an engineer taught him to approach problems in a methodical manner, and his access to the engineering teams at [[Chevrolet]] and at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] was instrumental in changing race car aerodynamics and handling from an art to an empirical science. The embryonic data acquisition systems created by the [[General Motors|GM]] research and development group aided these efforts. An interview with Hall by Paul Haney illustrates many of these developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1957, Hall raced the front-engined Chaparral (retroactively called the "Chaparral 1") through 1962, bought from Troutman and Barnes (like the Scarab, the Chaparral 1 cars were built in California by Troutman and Barnes).  Hall and Hap Sharp extensively modified their Chaparral, and eventually decided to build their own car.  They obtained permission from Trouman and Barnes to use the Chaparral name, which is why all of Hall's cars are called Chaparral 2s.

The first Chaparral 2-series was designed and built to compete in the United States Road Racing Championship and other sports car races of the time, particularly the West Coast Pro Series races that were held each fall.  Hall had significant "under the table" assistance from GM, including engineering and technical support in the development of the car and its automatic transmission (this is evidenced by the similarity between the Chevy Corvette GS-II "research and development" car and the Chaparral 2A through 2C models).

First raced in late 1963, the Chaparral 2 developed into a highly competitive car in the [[Can-Am]] series in 1966 and 1967. Designed for the 200 mile races of the CanAm series, it was also a winner in longer endurance races.  In 1965 it shocked the sportscar world by winning the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in a pouring rain storm, on one of the roughest tracks in North America.

The Chaparral 2 featured the innovative use of fiberglass as a chassis material. The Chaparral 2C had a conventional aluminum chassis.

It is very difficult to identify all iterations of the car as new ideas were being tested continually.

* The 2A is the car as originally raced, featuring a very conventional sharp edge to cut through the air. It also featured a concave tail reminiscent of the theories of [[Wunibald Kamm]]. The first aerodynamic appendages began to appear on the 2A almost immediately to cure an issue with the front end being very light at speed with a consequent impact on steering accuracy and driver confidence.
* As the car evolved, it grew and changed shape. Most call these 2Bs, as raced through the end of 1965.
* The 2C was the next car with the innovative in-car adjustable rear wing. The integrated spoiler-wing was designed to lie flat for low drag on the straights and tip up under braking through the corners. This was a direct benefit of the clutchless semi-automatic transmission which kept the driver's left foot free to operate the wing mechanism. The 2C was based on a Chevrolet designed aluminum chassis and was a smaller car in every dimension than the 2B. Without the natural non-resonant damping of the fiberglass chassis,  Hall nicknamed it the EBJ&amp;nbsp;— "eye ball jiggler".

Alongside the development of aerodynamics was Hall's development of race tires.&lt;!-- This is a complex subject that should have a separate article. --&gt; Jim Hall owned Rattlesnake Raceway adjacent to his race shop; the proximity allowed him to participate in much of Firestone's race tire development.

A two-article series in ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine featured Hall's design theories. The article turns speculation about vehicle handling into applied physics. Hall's theories were the precursor to the elaborate data collection and management of current racing teams.

The 2D was the first closed cockpit variant of the 2-series, designed for endurance racing in 1966. It won at [[1000 km Nürburgring]] in 1966 with [[Phil Hill]] and [[Joakim Bonnier]] driving. It also competed in the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], withdrawing after 111 laps. The Chaparral 2D was equipped with a 327 cubic inch displacement (5.3 liter) aluminum alloy Chevrolet engine producing 420 horsepower, and the car weighed only 924&amp;nbsp;kg.

The 2E was based on the Chevrolet designed aluminum 2C chassis and presented Hall's most advanced aerodynamic theories to the racing world in the 1966. The 2E established the paradigm for virtually all racing cars built since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The wing was the opposite of an aircraft wing in that it generated down-force instead of lift and was attached directly to the rear suspension uprights, loading the tires for extra adhesion while cornering. A ducted nose channeled air from the front of the car up, creating extra down-force as well. By depressing a floor pedal that was in the position of a clutch pedal in other cars, Hall was able to feather, or flatten out, the "normally" negative-incidence wing's angle when down-force was not needed, such as on a straight section of the track, to reduce drag and increase top speed. In addition, an interconnected air dam closed off the nose ducting for streamlining as well. When the pedal was released, the front ducting and wing returned to their full down-force position. Until they were banned many sports racing cars, as well as [[Formula One]] cars, had wings on tall struts, although many were not as well executed as Hall's. The resulting accidents from their failures caused movable/pivoted wings mounted on the suspension, as well as movable/pivoted aerodynamic devices of any variety, to be outlawed.

The 2E scored only one win, at the 1966 [[Laguna Seca Raceway]] Can-Am with Hill driving. Hall stuck to an aluminum 5.3 liter Chevrolet engine in his lightweight racer, while the other teams were using 6 to 7 liter iron engines, trading weight for power.

The 2E was a crowd favorite and remains Hall's favorite car.

In the 2F Hall applied the aerodynamic advances of the aluminum 2E to the older fiberglass chassis closed-cockpit 2D for the 1967 racing season. A movable wing mounted on struts loaded the rear suspension while an air dam kept the front end planted. The radiators were moved to positions next to the cockpit.&lt;ref name="Bissett"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bissett|first1=Mark|title='67 Spa 1000km: Chaparral 2F|url=https://primotipo.com/2014/06/26/67-spa-1000km-chaparral-2f/|website=primotipo.com|accessdate=22 April 2016 |quote=INFECTED LINK as of June 20, 2017-do not use!}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aluminum [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#Generation 2: Mark IV Series|7 liter Chevrolet 'big block' engine]] replaced the 5.3 liter engine of the 2D. While always extremely fast, the extra power of the larger engine was too much for the automatic transmission to handle and it broke with regularity. After solving the transmission problems, the 2F scored its only win on 30 July 1967 in the BOAC 500 at [[Brands Hatch]] with Hill and [[Mike Spence]] driving.&lt;ref name="Bissett" /&gt; After this race, the FIA changed its rules, outlawing not only the 2F, but also the [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk.IV]] (winner at Le Mans that year) and the Ferrari 330 P3/4 and 365 P4 (winner at Daytona, second at Le Mans).&lt;ref name="Bissett" /&gt;

As with the 2D, the 2F raced wearing Texas license plates.

The 1967 2G was a development of the 2E. It featured wider tires, and a 427 aluminum Chevrolet V-8 engine. While on par with its competitors in terms of power, the lightweight 2C chassis was stretched to the limit and it was only Hall's driving skill that kept the car competitive. For the 1968 Can-Am series, still larger tires were added to increase grip.

Hall's racing career was effectively ended in a severe crash at the [[Stardust Grand Prix]] Can-Am race when he rear ended the slow moving McLaren of Lothar Motschenbacher, although he did drive in the 1970 [[Trans-Am Series]] while fielding a team of [[Camaro]] Trans-Am cars.

Never one to be complacent, Hall noted that the increasing down-force also created enormous drag. Seeking a competitive edge, the 2H was built in 1969 as the replacement for the 2G to minimize drag, rather than maximize down-force. However, the anticipated gains in speed were more than offset by the reduced cornering speeds and the car was consistently slower than anticipated.

A failure, it eventually was fitted with a huge wing.

===2J===
[[File:Chaparral 2J.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Chaparral 2J at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]]]]
The most unusual Chaparral was the 2J. On the chassis' sides bottom edges were articulated plastic skirts that sealed against the ground (a technology that would later appear in Formula One). At the rear of the 2J were housed two fans (sourced from a military tank engine) driven by a single two stroke twin cylinder engine.&lt;ref&gt;Sports Car Graphic No. 5 "Chevrolet's Ground-Effects Car" by Burge Hulett&lt;/ref&gt; The car had a "skirt" made of Lexan extending to the ground on both sides, laterally on the back of the car, and laterally from just aft of the front wheels. It was integrated with the suspension system so the bottom of the skirt would maintain a distance of one inch from the ground regardless of G forces or anomalies in the road surface, thereby providing a zone within which the fans could create a partial vacuum which would provide a downforce
on the order of 1.25–1.50 G of the car fully loaded (fuel, oil, coolant). This gave the car tremendous gripping power and enabled greater maneuverability at all speeds. Since it created the same levels of low pressure under the car at all speeds, down-force did not decrease at lower speeds. With other aerodynamic devices, down-force decreases as the car slows down or achieves too much of a slip angle, both of which were not problems for the "sucker car".

The 2J competed in the Can-Am series and qualified at least two seconds quicker than the next fastest car, but was not a success as it was plagued with mechanical problems. It ran for only one racing season, in 1970, after which it was outlawed by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA). Although originally approved by the SCCA, they succumbed to pressure from other teams, [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] in particular, who argued that the fans constituted "movable aerodynamic devices", outlawed by the international sanctioning body, the FIA, a rule first applied against the 2E's adjustable wing.  There were also complaints from other drivers saying that whenever they drove behind it the fans would throw stones at their cars. McLaren argued that if the 2J were not outlawed, it would likely kill the Can-Am series by totally dominating it&amp;nbsp;— something McLaren had been doing since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''CHAPARRAL&amp;nbsp;— Complete History of Jim Hall's Chaparral Race Cars 1961–1970'', by Richard Falconer and Doug Nye, 1992 Motorbooks&lt;/ref&gt; A similar suction fan was used in Formula One eight years later on the [[Brabham BT46B]], which won the [[1978 Swedish Grand Prix]], but Brabham reverted to the non-fan BT46 soon afterwards due to complaints from other teams that the car violated the rules. The car was found to be within technical specifications allowing the victory to remain.

===2K===
[[File:Chaparral 2K.jpg|thumb|right|Chaparral 2K on display in the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Hall of Fame Museum]]
The 2K was a Formula One-inspired [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] Indy car designed by Briton [[John Barnard]]. Debuting in 1979 with driver [[Al Unser|Al Unser Sr.]], it went on to win six races in 27 starts over three seasons. Its greatest success came in 1980, when [[Johnny Rutherford]] won both the [[1980 Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]] and the [[Champ Car|CART]] championship.

===1970s===
Chaparral started fielding Indy cars in [[1978 USAC Championship Car season|1978]] with Al Unser driving the No. 2 [[First National City Traveler's Checks]] [[Lola Cars|Lola T500]]-[[Cosworth|Cosworth DFX]]. Unser then managed to win the [[1978 Indianapolis 500]]. Later in the season Unser added wins at the [[Ontario Motor Speedway#Past winners|California 500]] at [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] and the [[Pocono IndyCar 400|Schafer's 500]] at [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono International Raceway]], as of [[2013 IndyCar Series season|2013]] this remains the only time a driver has won the [[Triple Crown of Motorsport|Fuzzy's Premium Vodka Triple Crown]]. Despite the three wins Unser lost the championship to [[Tom Sneva]] (who failed to win a race). With the formation of [[Champ Car|CART]] Hall decided to field a car for Unser in that series. Unser now drove the No. 2 [[Pennzoil]] Lola T500-Cosworth DFX. At the [[1979 Indianapolis 500]] Hall, along with fellow CART boardmen [[Roger Penske]], [[U.E. "Pat" Patrick|Pat Patrick]], [[Teddy Mayer]], [[Ted Field]], and [[Fletcher Racing|Robert Fletcher]] were not allowed to compete in the race due to the race being part of the [[List of USAC Championship Car seasons|USAC National Championship]]. At the same Hall was going to introduce the [[Chaparral Cars#2K|Chaparral 2K]]-Cosworth DFX. A lawsuit occurred and the six car owners were allowed to field their cars. In the race Unser lead for 89 of the 200 laps. But on lap 105 an engine fire broke out and Unser's bid for a second consecutive, and fourth overall, win was halted. Unser later won the season-ending [[XM Satellite Radio Indy 200|Miller High Life 150]] at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]. Unser finished fifth in the CART standing and was ineligible for USAC points.

===1980s===
By 1980 Unser had left the team due to disagreements with Hall, and Johnny Rutherford took over driving duties. The only change to the car was that the 2K was now numbered four. Rutherford won five races that season, including the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]], along with the [[Ontario Motor Speedway#Past winners|Datsun Twin 200]] at Ontario Motor Speedway, the [[Honda Indy 200|Red Roof Inn 150]] at the [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]]; the [[Firestone Indy 400|Norton 200]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]], and the [[Milwaukee IndyFest|Tony Bettenhausen 200]] at the [[Milwaukee Mile|Wisconsin State Fair Park Speedway]]. Rutherford went on to win the [[1980 IndyCar season]] and [[1980 USAC Championship Car season|CRL]] championships. In [[1981 IndyCar season|1981]] Rutherford returned with the No. 1 Pennzoil Chaparral 2K-Cosworth DFX. Rutherford pulled off a win in the season-opening [[XM Satellite Radio Indy 200|Kraco Car Stereos 150]] at Phoenix International Raceway. The rest of the season proved to be inconsistent as Rutherford dropped to fifth in points. The team also competed in the opening round of the [[1981-82 USAC Championship Car season|USAC Gold Crown season]], the [[1981 Indianapolis 500]], Rutherford led for three laps early on but fuel pump issues ended the team's day after only 25 laps. By the [[1982 IndyCar season]] the 2K was getting outdated and the best result for the car was a fourth-place finish at the Miller High Life 150 at Phoenix International Raceway. After four races Rutherfoed was ranked 18th in points. By the time the [[Firestone Indy 400|Norton Michigan 500]] at Michigan International Speedway came around the team was using a [[March Engineering|March 82C]]-Cosworth DFX purchased from [[Bob Fletcher Racing]]. Rutherford's results managed to improve as he took his season best finish of third at the [[Riverside International Raceway#Races held at Riverside International Raceway|AirCal 500K]] at [[Riverside International Raceway]]. Rutherford went on to finish 12th in points. The team also competed at the USAC Gold Crown season finale, the [[1982 Indianapolis 500]], where Rutherford started 12th and finished 8th.

===1990s===
In the [[1991 CART season]] Hall returned to Indy cars in conjunction with [[VDS Racing]], with the team being called Hall-VDS Racing with [[John Andretti]] driving the No. 4 Pennzoil Z-7 Lola T91/00-[[Ilmor]]-Chevrolet Indy V8. The team managed to get a victory in their debut, the [[1991 Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix|Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix]] on the [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit]]. The team also got a second-place finish at the [[Milwaukee IndyFest|Miller Genuine Draft 200]] at the [[Milwaukee Mile]]. Also, at the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]] Andretti got a fifth-place finish. At the end of the season Andretti was ranked a career-best eighth in points. In the [[1992 CART season]] Andretti drove the No. 8 Pennzoil Z-7 Lola T92/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8 for the team. However, Andretti's best finish came at the [[Honda Indy 200|Pioneer Electronics 200]] at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course where he came in fourth place. At the end of the year Andretti finished eighth in points again. He then left the team at the end of the season to compete in the [[NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series|NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series]] for [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]]. So in the [[1993 CART season]] the team fielded [[Teo Fabi]] in the No. 8 Pennzoil Lola T93/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8. Fabi's best finish was fourth, at the [[Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]] on his way to an 11th-place finish in points. In the [[1994 CART season]] Fabi drove the No. 11 Pennzoil [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard 94i]]-Ilmor D. Fabi's best results that season were a pair of fourth-place finishes at the [[1994 IndyCar season#Round Ten: Marlboro 500 at Michigan|Marlboro 500]] at Michigan International Speedway and the [[1994 IndyCar season#Round Fourteen: Road America|Texaco/Havoline 200]] at [[Road America]]. Fabi went on to end the season ranked ninth in points. At the end of the season he left to drive for [[Forsythe/Pettit Racing|Forsythe Racing]]. For the [[1995 CART season]] VDS dropped out of the venture and the team became known as Hall Racing and rookie [[Gil de Ferran]] was signed on to pilot the No. 8 Pennzoil Reynard 95i-Ilmor-[[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport#IndyCar|Mercedes-Benz IC108]]. In four of the first six races de Ferran  managed to qualify in the top-10. Although he only scored two points during that time. His season soon turned around starting with a pole position at the [[1995 IndyCar season#Cleveland|Budweiser Grand Prix of Cleveland]] at [[Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport#Events|Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport]] where he was leading with five laps to go when he collided with the lapped car of [[Scott Pruett]] taking him out of the race. De Ferran avenged this later in the season when he won the season-ending [[Monterey Grand Prix|Toyota Monterey Grand Prix]] at Laguna Seca Raceway. He  finished 14th in points and  also won the [[Jim Trueman]] [[Champ Car#Champions|PPG IndyCar World Series Rookie of the Year]] Award. For the [[1996 IndyCar season]] de Ferran returned to drive the No. 8 Pennzoil Reynard 96i-[[Honda#Motorsports|Honda Indy V8]]. De Ferran qualified on the pole at the 1996 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. H also won the [[Grand Prix of Cleveland|Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland]] and finished sixth in the final points standings. Despite the recent success Hall closed up the Indy car team for good and de Ferran drove for [[Walker Racing]] in the [[1997 CART season]]. Hall ended up getting 13 wins and two championships in [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] and CART sanctioned Indy car races.

[[File:ChaparralCarMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Museum entrance to the Chaparral display]]

==Museum==
In 2005, a wing of the [http://petroleummuseum.org/chaparral-gallery-exhibits/ Permian Basin Petroleum Museum] in [[Midland, Texas]] was dedicated to the permanent display of the remaining Chaparral cars and the history of their development by [[Abilene, Texas]] native Jim Hall. To aid in keeping these cars in an optimal state of performance, live runnings are performed on a semi-regular basis at the museum grounds.

==Tributes==
*The 2005 [[Monterey Historic Automobile Races]] honored Chaparrals as the featured marque. Hall's Chaparral 2A had won the [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]] at Laguna Seca Raceway in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iDesign Studios|url=http://www.sandcastlevi.com/racing/chap-us.htm |title=Auto Racing Classics – Hall's Chaparrals – Racing Record |publisher=Sandcastle V.I. |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[2009 Monterey Sports Car Championships]], [[Gil de Ferran]] painted his [[Acura ARX-02a]] to resemble a Chaparral in tribute to [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]], for whose team de Ferran drove in his first two seasons in [[Champ Car|CART]], and also to commemorate de Ferran's final professional race. An exhibition race featuring the Acura and three Chaparrals was held that Friday, and Hall performed a demonstration lap shortly before the race.

'''''Game 6''''' (stylized as '''Game6''') is a 2005 American film directed by [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]], first presented at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], released in the United States in 2006, and starring [[Michael Keaton]]. It follows a fictional playwright, Nicky Rogan, on the day he has a new stage play opening which is also the same day as the sixth game of the [[1986 World Series]] is played. It realizes a 1991 screenplay by [[Don DeLillo]], with a soundtrack written and performed by [[Yo La Tengo]].

==Plot==
Nicky Rogan has written several plays and has achieved success.  It's now opening night of his latest effort and everyone around him assure him that this one will be the best yet. But as opening hour approaches, Rogan falls prey to doubts and fears, egged on by another playwright whose last work was trashed by the local newspaper's new drama critic, Steven Schwimmer. He eventually lets those fears drive him to resolve to kill the critic (who he assumes will also trash his play) and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed.

Instead of attending the play's opening night, Rogan spends time in a bar, accompanied by a lady [[Taxicab|cab driver]] and her grandson; earlier in the evening she misidentified Rogan as a local, small-time hoodlum but he doesn't correct her misidentification.

They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets. The Sox have won 3 games and could clinch the title by winning Game 6 but Rogan, a lifelong Sox fan, knows how easily the team can lose when they should win. He spends the evening waiting for the inevitable, even though the Sox are lead most of the time. When the inevitable does occur (due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end of the final inning), he snaps and leaves to take out his rage on the newspaper critic.

Rogan not only finds the critic but sees him in the early stages of deflowering the playwright's daughter. He begins firing wildly and is finally calmed when he learns the critic is equally devastated by the Sox's loss.  They end up together, watching an interminable rerun of the final error on a small television set in the critic's apartment.

==Production==
The film was made as an independent effort, largely as a labor of love, with all the "name" players working for little more than scale (Keaton's salary was $100/day, for instance).  Filming was completed in 20 days, and the filming budget was $500,000.  Most of the filming occurred in [[New York City]].

== Reception ==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] 41 critics gave ''Game 6'' a 61% positive review, with an average rating of 5.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Game 6 (2005) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/game_six/ |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as "a writer’s film if there ever was one”.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard (2009), p. 511. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide. {{ISBN|1-101-10660-3}}. Signet Books. Accessed May 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gay Meadow''' was the home ground of [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] football club in [[Shropshire]], [[England]]. Just outside the town centre, on the banks of the [[River Severn]], it opened in 1910.

The ground closed at the end of the 2006-07 [[Football League]] season and the club moved to a new stadium, provisionally titled The [[New Meadow]], on the outskirts of the town.

Local legend says that over 22,000 were inside the stadium for the league match against [[Wrexham A.F.C]] on 21 August 1950, although the official figure is given as 16,000.  The official record attendance is 18,917, on 26 April 1961 against local rivals [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Because it had only one entrance/exit road, in the years following the [[Taylor Report]] the capacity of the ground was reduced from 16,000 to around 8,000.

== Early history of Gay Meadow ==

Centuries before Shrewsbury Town occupied the site, Gay Meadow was known locally for the fairs, carnivals and circuses which took place there. The origin of the name is not entirely clear, although it is widely believed to related to its use for entertainment purposes. An alternative origin states that the land was originally owned by the Gay family.

In 1740, stuntman [[Robert Cadman]], a 'steeple-flyer', attempted to 'fly' across the River Severn using a rope attached to [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary's Church]] at one side and a tree at Gay Meadow some two hundred feet below. Tragically for Cadman, the rope broke, and he plunged to his death.

===First matches===
In 1910, Shrewsbury Town, were looking for a new ground to play at, having been told they could no longer use the Army-owned pitch at [[Copthorne Barracks]]. A consortium bought the site and leased it to the club. Despite objections from the local hospital, the Salop Infirmary, who feared crowd noise might disturb patients across the River Severn, the first official match took place on 20 August 1910, when a crowd of up to 1,000 watched a pre-season practice match between the 'Reds' and the 'Whites'.

The first league game at Gay Meadow was between Shrewsbury Town and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] Reserves, on 10 September 1910. Shrewsbury lost the match 2-1, with 'Shinton' scoring the first league goal for Wolves, and [[Billy Scarratt]] scoring Shrewsbury Town's first goal at the ground. Shrewsbury's first win at Gay Meadow occurred two weeks later against [[Halesowen F.C.|Halesowen]].

===Ground improvements===
The ground did not see major improvements until the mid-1950s, when trees which lined the road to Gay Meadow (The Narrows) were felled to improve access. It was around this time that the club's supporters launched a floodlight committee in order to raise £12,000 for the installation of floodlights. On 25 November 1960, a crowd of 5,448 saw Shrewsbury Town beat [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 5-0 in a match to mark the installation of the lights. The previous Saturday, over 10,000 witnessed the turning on of the lights in the game against [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] which was a 3.15 kick off. The floodlights formed part of the Shrewsbury skyline for almost 47 years.

1965 saw new offices built at the club, with the Riverside terrace being built in the early 1970s. This terrace would gain legendary status amongst home fans in years to come.

In the early 1980s, the club promotion to the old Second Division required further improvements. The old 600 seater Station Stand was demolished and a new 4,500 capacity centre stand built. Until the ground's demolition in 2007, this was the last major building work to take place at the ground. Minor changes in the 1990s included a new Executive Suite, the controversial demolition of the ground's wooden scoreboard, and, following the [[Taylor Report]], the removal of perimeter fencing with the exception of the away Station end.

==General overview==

In its latter years, Gay Meadow was seen as a picturesque 'traditional' football ground, with three sides being terraced, standing areas and little change in the final 25 years of its existence. It was also arguably one of the most picturesque grounds in the [[Football League]].

On the banks of the [[River Severn]], the ground was surrounded by trees and parkland, with the town centre towering above the ground on the hilltop behind. A number of the town's landmarks, including [[Shrewsbury Castle]] and [[Shrewsbury Abbey]] were visible from the ground.

For many years, Shrewsbury [[coracle]] maker Fred Davies would sit in his coracle during [[Shrewsbury Town]] home matches and retrieve stray footballs from the River Severn. Although Davies died long ago, his legend is still associated with the club.&lt;ref&gt;Gentlemen of the River by Phyllis Blakemore. Stenlake Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-84033-473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the ground being rather small and cramped, between the river and a major railway junction, there was little scope for expansion or renovation. Access, via a small side street known as 'The Narrows', was poor and one of the main reasons the ground's capacity was reduced following the [[Taylor Report]]. Problems with evacuation and access for emergency services was one of the reasons cited by the club for moving to a new ground.

=== North ===
'''Station End'''  - So-called due to its proximity to the town's railway station. A partially covered terrace, normally allocated to visiting fans, although it was also a home terrace until the 1970s. Its capacity, depending on the away allocation, ranged from 1,500 to 2,000. Unusually it kept the bottom half of its perimeter fencing right up until its final game, most other stadia in the country having removed theirs following the [[Taylor Report]]. It was also notable for housing the oldest working football [[turnstile]] in the country, although this was only used on rare occasions. With the ground closed, the old turnstile sold for £3,050 at an auction staged at the ground on 17 June 2007, to a local Shrewsbury Town fan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/6763797.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gay Meadow riverside terrace.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Riverside Terrace viewed from the Station End]]

=== West ===
'''Riverside Terrace''' - So-called due to its position on the bank of the [[River Severn]]. The Riverside was a partially covered terrace running the length of the pitch, with a refreshments bar situated halfway along the terrace and roof mounted TV gantry (used only occasionally for high-profile matches). This part of the ground was where the most lively element of the home crowd were to congregate, with the most vocal of home chanting and support coming from supporters from 'The Riverside' with frequent exchanges with visiting fans often heard.
Famously, stray footballs were often kicked over this stand into the Severn, to be retrieved by a man in a [[coracle]] named Fred Davies, (not to be confused with the manager of the same name).

=== South ===
'''Wakeman (or Tech) End''' - So-called due to the [[Wakeman School]] (formerly a [[Institute of technology|technical college]]) being directly behind it. It was an open terrace, with the windows of the school overlooking the pitch. This side of the ground along with the Riverside Terrace formed one large standing area for home fans, with movement unrestricted between the two. This often resulted in home fans congregating behind the goal on the Wakeman End when Shrewsbury Town were attacking in that direction - leaving the north part of the Riverside Terrace practically empty. The combined capacity of the Riverside and Wakeman Terraces was between 3,000 and 3,500 - depending on the size of the away following.

=== East ===

The east side of the ground was a covered, all-seater section. Limited seating for away fans was also available. The stand also boasted executive seating for VIPs, sponsors and guests, a TV gantry and press offices. The east side of the ground was also adjacent to the club's offices, function rooms and official player's/supporter's bar. Although consisting of a single stand generally referred to as the 'Main' stand, it was split into four enclosures, as follows:

'''Wakeman Stand'''  - So-called due to its proximity to the Wakeman School. A covered, all seater stand for 1,000 home supporters.

'''Centre Stand''' - So-called due to forming the central part of the seated area. A covered, all seater stand for 1,000 home supporters. It also housed the directors' box.

'''Family enclosure''' - This was a designated area for families consisting of 700 seats, with admission via designated 'family' tickets.

'''Station Stand''' - A seated section for away fans, holding roughly 250 away fans

==The move to New Meadow==
Whilst Gay Meadow was well regarded by fans, and traditionalists within the English game, the ground was in a cramped location between the [[River Severn]] and a major railway junction. In addition, access to the ground was restricted to a narrow side street known locally as 'the Narrows. The poor access, and poor scope for evacuation in the case of emergency, meant that the capacity of the ground was cut to 8,000 by the early 1990s following stricter ground safety regulations that followed the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] of 1985 and the [[Taylor Report]] which followed the [[Hillsborough disaster]] of 1989.

In addition, the ground's proximity to the river meant the ground often flooded in the autumn and winter months, leading to matches being postponed. Flooding also caused damage to offices and changing rooms.

Shrewsbury had been considering relocation since 1986, when plans were drawn up for a new stadium to the north of the town and [[Sainsbury's]] lined up to build a supermarket on the site of the old stadium. However, with Shrewsbury relegated from the old Second Division in 1989 and Sainsbury's developing elsewhere in the town, the plans were abandoned. In the 1990s, plans were made to redevelop Gay Meadow; however, with the poor access, capacity could rise to no more than 10,000.

In 1999, recently elected chairman Roland Wycherley released plans for a new stadium, provisionally titled the [[New Meadow]], a 10,000 all-seater stadium on the southern outskirts of the town between the [[Meole Brace]] and Sutton Farm districts.

Amongst other things, opposition from residents delayed the planning and building process until 2006, with the ground not being completed until July 2007. The [[New Meadow]] has a 10,000 all-seated capacity, with the scope to expand to beyond 40,000. In addition, the ground has far better road links, more car parking, and, being well away from the river, is unlikely to suffer from flooding.

==End of Gay Meadow==

To fund the move, the Gay Meadow site was sold to property developers. The final season at Gay Meadow was 2006-07.

Gay Meadow's final [[FA Cup]] tie was a goalless draw against [[Hereford United]] on 11 November 2006 in the first round (Shrewsbury lost the replay at [[Edgar Street]]).

The last team to win a professional match at Gay Meadow were Shrewsbury's biggest rivals [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], who won 1-0 at the second-to-last league game at the ground on 24 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.11v11.com/teams/shrewsbury-town/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Wrexham&lt;/ref&gt;

The final League game played at Gay Meadow was against [[Grimsby Town]] on 5 May 2007, a 2-2 draw, with Grimsby equalising in the final minute. To commemorate the day, a parade of former Shrewsbury Town greats was organised, with commemorative T-shirts being handed out to fans free of charge with donations for local charities instead. Defender [[Kelvin Langmead]] took the honour of being the final Shrewsbury Town goalscorer at the ground, although Grimsby's [[Nick Fenton]] scored the ground's final professional goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/6602933.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The final senior competitive match held at Gay Meadow was against [[Milton Keynes Dons]] on 14 May 2007, the first leg of the League 2 Play-offs. The game finished 0-0.

Before demolition, fans were given the opportunity to play on the pitch, in specially arranged friendly matches, and an auction was staged at the ground on 17 June 2007, where over 200 items were auctioned. In addition, 500 unsold seats were purchased by [[League of Wales]] side [[Caernarfon Town]], to be used in the redevelopment of a stand at their ground, [[The Oval (Caernarfon)|the Oval]].

The final football match to be staged at Gay Meadow was the club's annual friendly fixture between Shrewsbury's 'Away Supporters' team and the Shrewsbury Town backroom staff on Friday 22 June. Alan Roberts, the club's police liaison officer, scored the only goal of the game, and thus the last goal at the ground.

In September 2007 demolition of the stadium began, and by October 2007 the ground was reduced to rubble. The site has been earmarked for residential building, with 150 flats scheduled to be built on the site. Initially, it was believed building work would commence in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shropshirestar.com/2007/09/gay-meadow-demolition-begins/]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, building started on a number of luxury flats and it was completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwh.co.uk/new-homes/shropshire/H431001-Riverside-Meadow/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the ground almost completely demolished, a charity [[zip-wire]] event was held on 14 October 2007. Over 100 townspeople 'flew' from the St.Mary's area of the town centre, over the River Severn to land on the Gay Meadow pitch, emulating Robert Cadman's heroic attempt in 1740. In addition, sections of the Gay Meadow turf was sold for a small fee for Severn Hospice, the organising charity. This was the final public event to ever take place at Gay Meadow before the re-development of the site.

The '''Hambly Arena''' was an indoor [[ice rink]] in [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], also known as the '''Oshawa Arena'''. It operated from 1930 to 1953, and was primarily used as an [[ice hockey]] venue for the [[Oshawa Generals]]. The Hambly Arena was built as a replacement to the wooden Bradley Arena, which burned down in 1928.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Babe|last2=Attersley|first2=Bobby|title=A History of the Oshawa Generals|place=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Chimo|volume=One|year=1978|pages=2,38|language=English|isbn=0-920344-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hambly Arena was located at the northeast corner of Bond Street West and Arena Street, beside the [[Oshawa Creek]] and south of [[Kinsmen Stadium]].

The construction of the Oshawa Arena was led by the Hambly brothers, Ernie and Harold, who teamed up with [[Samuel McLaughlin]], Paul Clark, and the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] to complete the arena.&lt;ref name="weymark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oshawaexpress.ca/memories-of-the-oshawa-arena/|title=Memories of the Oshawa Arena|last=Weymark|first=Jennifer|date=2016-01-29 |website=oshawaexpress.ca|publisher=The Oshawa Express|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cocacola"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Douglas|title=Coca Cola Company History|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|date=2017|location=Canada|pages=Chapter, 1937|language=English|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=URwlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1937&amp;lpg=PA1937&amp;dq=oshawa+hambly+arena&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zX_WLl9wN0&amp;sig=pN-o4Jt0zJJolIXjp5cyRMt1DL8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOoIHwjpPYAhUo5oMKHbOIDw4Q6AEwCnoECAIQAQ|isbn=978-0-7710-2393-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamblys were local businessmen, who ran the [[Coca-Cola]] bottler and distributor in Oshawa,&lt;ref name="cocacola" /&gt; and McLaughlin was the founder of the [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company]]. Construction began during the [[Great Depression]] in October 1929, and was finished in January 1930, with an estimated cost of $100,000.&lt;ref name="weymark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cocacola" /&gt; The arena was designed with steel roof trusses to provide an unobstructed view of an artificial ice surface that was 194 feet by 85 feet. The arena sat 3,750, and held 5,000 including standing room.&lt;ref name="weymark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cocacola" /&gt;

The Oshawa Majors began play in 1930, and the team was reborn as the Oshawa Generals in 1937. While playing at the Hambly Arena, the Generals won seven consecutive [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]] titles, and three [[Memorial Cup]] championships from 1937 to 1944. 

The Hambly Arena burned to the ground on the morning of September 15, 1953. When the fire was extinguished, the only remains were parts of the brick facade and twisted steel, in a pile of rubble.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt; The estimated loss was about $350,000, only partially covered by insurance.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weymark" /&gt; The Generals lost all of their equipment and uniforms in the fire. Due to the financial losses, and since the fire occurred only one week before the season was scheduled to begin, players were dispersed and team operations put on hiatus. 

The former site of the arena was occupied by a car dealership in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontariomotorsales.com/2016/08/15/brief-history-ontario-motor-sales/|title=A Brief History of Ontario Motor Sales|website=Ontario Motor Sales|access-date =2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oshawa Civic Auditorium]] opened as the city's new primary hockey venue in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/3457396-walking-down-memory-lane-at-the-oshawa-civic/|title=Walking down memory lane at the Oshawa Civic|last=Pfeiffer|first=Ryan|date=2010-06-22|website=DurhamRegion.com|publisher=Oshawa This Week|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Adams''' (born October 9, 1951) is a dedicated [[fan (person)|fan]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]], a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Adams has played his [[bass drum]] in the [[bleacher]] seats during nearly every Indians [[Home (sports)|home game]] since 1973, which has brought him notoriety and recognition from the Indians and other organizations. The Indians pay for two season tickets for Adams and his drum, he has been involved in two [[ceremonial first pitch]]es, and he is the only fan for whom the Indians have dedicated a [[bobblehead]] day.

==Drumming==
Adams first drummed at an Indians game on August 24, 1973, at [[Cleveland Stadium]], at a game in which the Indians beat the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], 11–5.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Caldwell |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Heart of Indians Baseball Beats From the Cheap Seats |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/sports/baseball/09drummer.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2007-09-09 |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, who was 21 years old at the time,&lt;ref name=bare/&gt; has stated that he brought his bass drum to that first game because he wanted to add to the noise of "seat banging", a tradition at Cleveland Stadium in which fans would bang the swivel seat of their [[Swivel chair|chairs]] against the chair's base during tense moments in the game.&lt;ref name=wews/&gt; But Adams preferred to sit in the [[bleacher]]s, where there were no seats to bang.&lt;ref name=wews&gt;{{cite news|last=Noleff |first=George |title=The beat goes on for the Cleveland Indians and legendary drummer John Adams on Opening Day |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/sports/baseball/indians/the-beat-goes-on-for-the-cleveland-indians-and-a-legendary-fan-on-opening-day |newspaper=[[WEWS-TV]] |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407012045/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/sports/baseball/indians/the-beat-goes-on-for-the-cleveland-indians-and-a-legendary-fan-on-opening-day |archivedate=2012-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the game, Bob Sudyk, a reporter for the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'', interviewed Adams and asked if he was going to drum again at the following game. Adams said no, but Sudyk wrote in his article that he would. According to Adams, "not to make a liar out of Bob, I showed up with my drum, and then I came to the next game and the next game and the next game."&lt;ref name=meisel/&gt; The Indians' promotions director at the time, Jackie York, also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game. Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum.&lt;ref name=garrett/&gt;

Ever since, Adams has sat in the highest bleacher seat in left-center field with his bass drum; {{as of|December 2016|lc=y}} he has missed only about 40 [[Home (sports)|home games]] in 43 seasons.&lt;ref name="pdWorldSeries"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIntyre|first1=Michael|title=Cleveland Indians drummer John Adams loses day job during World Series, but keeps the beat|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tipoff/index.ssf/2016/12/indians_drummer_john_adams_to.html#incart_m-rpt-2|accessdate=6 December 2016|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams played at Cleveland Stadium until October 1993, when the Indians played their last game there.&lt;ref name=crump/&gt; Next spring he moved with the team to its new ballpark, Jacobs Field (renamed [[Progressive Field]] in 2008).&lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{cite web |last=Starkey |first=Mike |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/sports/2008/01/cleveland_indians_formally_ann.html|title=Cleveland Indians formally announce naming rights sold to Progressive Insurance|publisher=''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams played the drum at his 3,000th game on April 27, 2011.&lt;ref name= meisel&gt;{{cite news |first=Zack |last=Meisel |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Indians march to beat of Adams' drum |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110427&amp;content_id=18304186&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb |work=[[MLB.com]] |publisher= |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2011-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, he has witnessed Indians [[pitcher]] [[Len Barker]] pitch a [[perfect game]] on May 15, 1981, and witnessed the Indians play in the [[1995 World Series|1995]], [[1997 World Series|1997]], and [[2016 World Series|2016]] [[World Series]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Adams still uses the same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought it as part of a [[drum kit|set]] for $25 at a [[garage sale]]. It has the same head on the side of the drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year.&lt;ref name= heaton/&gt; During games, Adams tends to drum at particular moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners in [[scoring position]], if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth [[inning]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer [[Herb Score]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Recognition===
Adams has been recognized by the Cleveland Indians and other organizations for his long commitment to the team. On October 4, 2007, he threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]] for the Indians' first game in the [[2007 American League Division Series]], against the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071004&amp;content_id=2249785&amp;vkey=ps2007news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Tribe superfan Adams throws first pitch|work=[[MLB.com]]|author=Briggs, Dave |date=2007-10-05|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Adams drummed at his 3,000th game on April 27, 2011, the Indians celebrated it the following Saturday, on April 30, 2011, by incorporating Adams in the ceremonial first pitch and putting on a pregame parade featuring Adams' fellow Indians fans carrying [[Bongo drums|bongos]], [[Snare drum|snares]] and plastic toy drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Adams drumline|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/ticketing/john_adams_drumline.jsp|work=''MLB.com''|accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=garrett/&gt;  For the ceremonial first pitch, Adams [[Batting (baseball)|swung at the ball]] with his drum from [[Baseball field#Home plate|home plate]] after it was thrown by former Indians player [[Joe Charboneau]].&lt;ref name=garrett&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Amanda|title=Drummer John Adams doesn't miss a beat with his chance at the plate|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/05/drummer_john_adams_doesnt_miss.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=2011-05-01|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the move to Jacobs Field, Cleveland began a record-breaking run of sellouts, which ended at 455 games in April 2001.{{efn|In Major League Baseball the record had been 203 sellout games in Denver, Colorado, which Cleveland surpassed on September 9, 1997.

'''Metolius Climbing''' is an American [[rock climbing]] gear manufacturer.  Named after the [[Metolius River]] in [[Oregon]], USA, it is headquartered in the city of [[Bend, Oregon]].

The company was started in 1983 by Doug Philips in his garage.&lt;ref name=pdf2010&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Metolius Climbing|url=http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pdf/Metolius_2010.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Metolius Announces Sales Category Wide Sales Increases - Outdoor Industry Association {{!}} Outdoor Industry Association|url=https://outdoorindustry.org/press-release/metolius-announces-sales-category-wide-sales-increases/|website=Outdoor Industry Association|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It got its impetus through a group of committed climbers who came together to push their limits at [[Smith Rock State Park|Smith Rock]] in Oregon's high desert.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/about_us.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Climbing gear available in the 1980s was limited, so they decided to design and build their own equipment, which quickly grew into a business. In 2010 Metolius is employing about 45 people in Bend,&lt;ref name=pdf2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=WeighMyRack/&gt; many of them climbers. Company mission statement is “by climbers for climbers”.&lt;ref name=OIA/&gt; In the last decade, some of the production like manufacturing of carabiners were moved overseas.&lt;ref name=WeighMyRack&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dennis|first1=Alison|title=11 Things I Learned From Touring the Metolius Headquarters {{!}} WeighMyRack Blog|url=http://blog.weighmyrack.com/11-things-i-learned-touring-metolius/|website=WeighMyRack Blog|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frye|first1=Karissa|title=Buy Responsibly: American Made Climbing Gear|date=August 24, 2016|url=http://www.climbing.com/gear/buy-responsibly-american-made-climbing-gear/|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National College Baseball Hall of Fame''' is an institution operated by the [[College Baseball Foundation]] serving as the central point for the study of the history of [[college baseball]] in the [[United States]].  In partnership with the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library located on the campus of [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]], the Hall of Fame inducts former collegiate players and coaches who have met selection criteria of distinction.

==History==
The [[College Baseball Foundation]] was formed in 2004 as a [[non-profit organization]], with the dual aims of continuing the [[Brooks Wallace Award]] and creating a national college baseball hall of fame. The inaugural Wallace Award was bestowed in 2004, but the inaugural Hall of Fame induction class was not chosen until 2006.

==Induction==

===Criteria===
Selection criteria and categorization has changed over time.

The original criteria, established in 2006, allow for recognition of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collegebaseballfoundation.org/halloffame/hof_criteria.htm |title=Criteria - Hall of Fame Enshrinement |website=collegebaseballfoundation.org |date=2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518155746/http://collegebaseballfoundation.org/halloffame/hof_criteria.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2006 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegebaseballfoundation.org:80/halloffame/files/pdf/hof_induction_criteria.pdf |title=Minimum Eligibility Requirements - College Baseball Hall of Fame |website=www.collegebaseballfoundation.org |date=2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518022559/http://www.collegebaseballfoundation.org:80/halloffame/files/pdf/hof_induction_criteria.pdf |archivedate=May 18, 2006 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Coaches — eligible after ending their active collegiate career (and not actively coaching a professional baseball team) who have achieved 300 career wins or won at least 65% of their games.
* Players — eligible five years after their final collegiate season (and not actively playing professional baseball) who competed for at least one year at a four-year institution, and made an All American (post-1947) or All League (pre-1947) team.
* Teams — of "great achievement" at a four-year institution.

The top ten voter-getters were selected for induction to the Hall of Fame. Veteran and Historical Committees could nominate individuals from the pre-1947 era, however there was no differentiation in how approved nominees were recognized.

In 2009, a small school category was added, "featuring players and coaches from [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], NCAA Divisions II and III, and two-year colleges."&lt;ref name=Feb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.collegebaseballhall.org/news/article.jsp?content_id=20429070 |title=Voting underway for sixth CHOF class |website=collegebaseballhall.org |date=February 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a Legends and Pioneers Committee was created, "...designed to provide recognition to black pioneers in college baseball and to honor outstanding players and coaches whose careers at [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities]] began prior to 1975."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.collegebaseballhall.org/news/article.jsp?content_id=20429072 |title=Legends and Pioneers Committee announced |website=collegebaseballhall.org |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, nominees would now be required to reach a threshold of votes, rather than automatically inducting the top ten vote-getters.&lt;ref name=Feb2011/&gt;

In 2012, voting was revised with five ballot categories: Vintage Era (pre-1964) players and coaches, small school players, small school coaches, 1964–2001 players, and NCAA Division I coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.collegebaseballhall.org/news/article.jsp?content_id=26729574 |title=Voting underway for seventh Hall of Fame class |website=collegebaseballhall.org |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremony===
The induction ceremony for the inaugural class occurred on July 4, 2006. The “Night of Champions” was usually held the day after the [[Brooks Wallace Award]] winner was announced; the most recent induction ceremony was held in 2016.

'''North East Stars Football Club''' is a [[Trinidad and Tobago]] [[professional]] [[association football|football]] club, based in [[Arima]], [[Trinidad]], that plays in the [[TT Pro League]]. The team plays its home games in [[Arima Velodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ttproleague.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The team joined the Professional Football League beginning in the 2002 season, having previously played in Trinidad's ECFU league.  The team joined the league with the explicit intention of representing the north-east of Trinidad, previously underrepresented in football circles.

The team was terrible in their first season, finishing last in the league with a dismal record of 4 wins, 2 ties, and 22 losses.  They improved dramatically in 2003, however, jumping from last to third, as they went 19–7–10.  They improved even further in 2004, surprising everyone by winning the league with a dominant 14–5–2 performance. They finished 5th in 2005.

The club's [[Jerren Nixon]] finished the 2004 season as the league's leading scorer with a staggering 31 goals, 17 in front of second place [[Randolph Jerome]]'s 14.

'''Occoneechee Speedway''' was one of the first two [[NASCAR]] tracks to open. It closed in 1968 and is the only dirt track remaining from the inaugural [[1949 NASCAR Strictly Stock Series|1949 season]].&lt;ref name="CarolinaCountry1"&gt;[http://www.carolinacountry.com/storypages/ourstories/speedway/speedway.html#intro Brief History, Page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located just outside the town of [[Hillsborough, North Carolina]].

==Site history==
[[Image:Hillsborough 1938 aerial.jpg|thumb|left|The horse racetrack on Occoneechee farm, 1938]]
The Occoneechee farm occupied the land in the late 19th century. The farm was named after the Occaneechi Indians that lived in the area in the late 17th century and late 18th century. The landowner, [[Julian S. Carr]], raced horses, and built a half mile horse racing track.&lt;ref name="CarolinaCountry2"&gt;[http://www.carolinacountry.com/storypages/ourstories/speedway/speedway2.html Brief History, Page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William France Sr.|Bill France]] noticed the horse racing track and expanse of open land while piloting his airplane.&lt;ref name="CarolinaCountry2" /&gt; On the site of the earlier horse track, he built a 0.9-mile dirt track in September 1947, two months before [[NASCAR]] was organized.  In its earliest days, [[Fonty Flock]] and his brothers [[Bob Flock|Bob]] and [[Tim Flock|Tim]] dominated the track.  [[Louise Smith]] became [[NASCAR]]'s first female driver at the track in the fall of 1949.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | author =Jennifer Martin and Sarah Woodard, and Virginia Freeze| title =Occoneechee Speedway | work = National Register of Historic Places&amp;nbsp;— Nomination and Inventory | date =August 2001| url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/OR1542.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occoneechee Speedway hosted stock car racing legends such as [[Fireball Roberts]], [[Richard Petty]], [[Ned Jarrett]] and [[Junior Johnson]].

The Sunday racing schedule prompted grassroots opposition in Hillsborough, and the final race was a [[Richard Petty]] victory on September 15, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Cruze, Sidney.  "[https://www.carolinacountry.com/carolina-stories/kickin-up-dust-again-at-the-orange-speedway Kickin' Up Dust Again at the Orange Speedway], North Carolina Electric Cooperatives, 2004-01.  Accessed 2017-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occoneechee Speedway site is now heavily forested with pines and sycamores.  The grandstands are still visible, as is much of the mile–long oval track.  It was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and now comprises {{convert|44|acre|m2}} with over {{convert|3|mi|km}} of trails.&lt;ref name="CarolinaCountry1" /&gt; A walking trail was built in 2003 that crisscrosses the clay track.

Occoneechee, along with [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]], is one of the inspirations for the Thomasville Speedway in the Pixar movie ''[[Cars 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoweek.com/article/nascar/cars-3-will-pay-tribute-abandoned-ghost-tracks |title='Cars 3' will pay tribute to abandoned 'ghost' tracks | author=Mark Vaughn |publisher=AutoWeek|date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is one of the founding members of the [[Barmy Army]] of supporters of the [[England cricket team]].

== Personal life ==
Burnham was educated at [[Hampton School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevortrophy.com/player-profile.html |title=Player Profile |publisher=The Trevor Trophy |date=1985-09-05 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnham has a sports and business degree and in 1984, he started working for [[British Airways]] in their cargo division.&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Carter |first=Ben |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/516748/ |title=Profile: Choir master - Paul Burnham, Chief organiser, Barmy Army - Marketing news |publisher=Marketing Magazine |date=2005-09-14 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is nicknamed "Leafy" which came from his time working at British Airways and was originally "[[tea leaf]]", the [[cockney rhyming slang]] for "thief".&lt;ref name=itn /&gt; He has played cricket for Old Hamptonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/97226.print/ |title=Old Hamps knock spots off Richmond|publisher=Harrow Times |date=2000-05-26|accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barmy Army ==
In 1994, Burnham travelled to [[Australia]] to watch [[The Ashes]]. There he met a number of other English supporters who were noted for singing songs, despite [[England cricket team|England]] losing. They received press attention which was positive in Australia but negative in the British press. Burnham then trademarked the name "Barmy Army"&lt;ref name=tm /&gt; in the United Kingdom and Australia&lt;ref name=itn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/not-barmy-just-lucky-$458673.htm |title=Not barmy, just lucky |publisher=In the News |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107193155/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/not-barmy-just-lucky-%24458673.htm |archivedate=2014-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a number of replica shirts with it on them which sold out.&lt;ref name=campaign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/516748/ |title=Profile: Choir master - Paul Burnham, Chief organiser, Barmy Army |publisher=Campaign |date=2005-09-14 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Ashes, Burnham started running the Barmy Army on a part-time basis while supplementing his income by working as a bookmaker and writing for various cricket magazines. In 1997, he negotiated the Barmy Army's first sponsorship deal with [[Vodafone]] to support the Barmy Army's tour of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. He started working for the Barmy Army full-time in 2002 as the organizer after creating a website and travel agency for them.&lt;ref name=mark /&gt; Burnham also set up the Barmy Army's operations office in [[Sunbury-on-Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10872577 |title=Special report: From fan club to Barmy Army Ltd |publisher=New Zealand Herald |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnham has also been involved in charity fundraisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/image/162283.html |title=Paul 'leafy' Burnham and members of the Barmy Army present a cheque |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also set rules for participants of the Barmy Army while with them, most notably banning Barmy Army members from using [[vuvuzelas]] in stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Day|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-1291812/Barmy-Army-ban-vuvuzuelas.html |title=Barmy Army ban vuvuzuelas |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2010-07-03 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series''', established in 2009 and created by [[Red Bull]], is an annual international series of [[Diving (sport)|cliff diving]] events in which a limited number of competitors determine the Cliff Diving World Series winner.

Divers jump from a platform at a height ranging from 26–28&amp;nbsp;m (85–92&amp;nbsp;ft). Competitions are held in a limited number of venues around the globe.

== Tour ranking ==
Every athlete scores a number of points in every competition as distributed here:

=== Points system from 2012 ===
In 2012 the Series introduced a new point system that was continued to be used also during the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.redbullcliffdiving.com/en_INT/article/about|website=Red Bull Cliff Diving|publisher=[[Red Bull GmbH]]|accessdate=September 9, 2015|date=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition rules ==
* Men perform 4 dives from a height ranging from 26–28m. There are a total of nine groups (front, back, reverse, inward, front twists, back twists, reverse twists, inward twists and all armstand dives).
* The two required dives must be performed from different take-off positions. There are 5 take-off positions (front, back, reverse, inward and armstand). The [[degree of difficulty]] for each required dive is 3.6. To clarify: front double half twist and front double 1½ twist are different groups, but the same take-off position. If a dive has less degree of difficulty, it will still be 3.6.
* The two optional dives must be from different groups from the 9 groups mentioned above. In addition, the optional dives must be done in alternating order every competition.
* A list of dives for each diver shall consist of two required dives of a fixed degree of difficulty for every athlete (3.6), and two optional dives assigned a degree of difficulty computed from the 2010 HDA table.
* The first required dive will be done after a short warm-up on the second training day. This is already part of the competition and will count 100 percent towards the total score. After this first round of dives, training can resume. The next day will have a short warm-up period followed by 2 dives (one required, one optional dive) in head-to-head format.
* The final dive will be done by the top 8 divers (winners head-to-head plus one lucky loser) in reverse order according to their cumulative score from the first 3 dives.
* Balks will receive a 2-point deduction from each judge for the first balk. Another 2-point deduction for the second balk and be considered a failed dive on the third balk. A balk is considered an interruption in movement after the diver does his press immediately before the dive. For armstand dives it is the point when both feet leave the platform (use FINA definitions).
* Running take-offs on forward dive groups (including twists) are allowed, given there is enough space for the approach.
* If the diver enters the water with his hands up on a feet-first entry, he can only get a maximum score of 5 points from each judge. The 5 points would mean a perfect execution of the entire dive with the exception of the arms. If arms are at or below shoulder height but not in alignment with the body (straight arms either in front or on the side of the body), judges can deduct between ½ to 2 points at their discretion according to the degree of the mistake.
* A break in position at or just before entry can have a deduction of ½ to 2 points at the judges' discretion. An intermediate break of position can receive no more than 4.5 points from each judge. If a dive is done in a completely different position than announced: for example back triple tuck instead of back triple pike, the dive can only receive a maximum of 2 points.
* All dives submitted in a list must consist of at least 180 degrees of rotation around a horizontal axis.

== Scoring ==
* Five judges score each dive based on a scale of 0 to 10 in half-point increments.
* Each judge scores the dives without assistance.
* The highest and the lowest judges’ scores will be discarded. The remaining three scores are added and multiplied by the degree of difficulty for that dive.
* This will produce the total score for each dive. The total score of all dives performed are added together to produce the overall total for the competition for each diver.
* Balks will constitute a deduction from each judge's score as directed by the Head Judge. The dive will be scored as usual and the announcer will deduct two points from each judge's score.

'''Redheugh Park''' (pronounced ''red-yuff''), a [[soccer|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Gateshead]], [[England]], was built in 1930 when [[South Shields F.C. (1889)|South Shields F.C.]] moved to Gateshead from [[Horsley Hill]] and became [[Gateshead A.F.C.|Gateshead AFC]]. It was their home for more than 40 years.

The stadium offered terracing all round. The Main Stand was a two-thirds pitch length seated stand (purchased from a greyhound stadium in Carlisle) with covered standing extensions added on either side. Opposite the Main Stand was a large covered terrace that ran the full length of the ground. The North end of the ground had a small covered terrace, whilst the opposite Ropery Road (South) End was a small uncovered terrace, which latterly included a large totalisator scoreboard introduced for greyhound racing.

==History==
In 1930 Gateshead Council set about finding a suitable site for Gateshead AFC to relocate to. Sites at Low Fell and Sheriff Hill were considered, but were deemed too far out of town. The chosen location was in the Teams area of Gateshead, a worked out clay pit (known as Johnsons Clay Hole) edged by Ropery Road and Derwentwater Road. The holes, tunnels and craters on the site were filled by lorries full of the town's refuse.

Redheugh Park was officially opened by Mr Sutcliffe, the Football League's then Vice-President on 30 August 1930 when Gateshead AFC played their first-ever Football League game winning 2-1 against Doncaster Rovers in front of 15,545 spectators. Greyhound racing at Redheugh Park commenced in 1937, which brought a boost to the football club's financial position and subsequently eased the burden for the upkeep of the stadium. However the inclusion of the Greyhound track reduced the size of the playing area, the terracing at either end of the ground and subsequently the capacity.

With the loss of Football League status in 1960 and the football club's subsequent continual slide down the leagues, a further heavy blow was dealt with the cessation of greyhound racing at the stadium in 1966. This put both Redheugh Park and Gateshead AFC in serious financial troubles. Other sources of income were investigated, which included allowing showmen to have a small fair on the car park, allowing advertising to be placed on the wall facing Askew Road (permission was refused) and even converting the refreshment bar into a transport café to catch passing trade. In 1967 Gateshead AFC made a vain attempt to fill the void the Greyhound racing had left by staging [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] racing at the stadium.

== Greyhound Racing==
In 1937 greyhound racing was introduced to Redheugh Park and the ground underwent renovation including the reduction in size of the playing pitch. Terracing was erected all around the stadium and the main stand had its back to the Redheugh Iron and Steel works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/423768/562014/13/101329|title=OS Plan 1952|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stand was purchased from the Carlisle track (presumed to be the one at Harraby) and almost extended the whole length of the pitch. The first nights racing took place on 23 November 1937 organised by the Redheugh Park Greyhound Racing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|pages =29–44|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track is opened by Major, Alderman W J Pickering in front of an attendance of 8,000 and the first race is won by Lovely Lucerne over 450 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-november-iii/|title=Greyhound Star (Remember When November)|publisher=Greyhound Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumference was 370 yards and the track was to race mainly under [[National Greyhound Racing Club]] rules despite short spells as an independent track.

A [[Tote board|totalisator]] board was erected on the south end terrace and tote turnover in 1947 was £686,782 a substantial amount for a capacity of 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Particulars of Licensed tracks, table 1 Licensed Dog Racecourses|year=1947|publisher=Licensing Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distances changed to 440 yards and 600 yards and handicaps were very popular. The track raced under the ‘combine’ tag in the mid-fifties which effectively meant that they were allowed to host C-Licence owner-trainer race nights.

The greyhound racing ended on 7 January 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =414|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==
By the early 1970s Redheugh Park had become run down. This, combined with a fire in the 1971–72 season, saw Gateshead AFC move to the Gateshead Youth Stadium (now known as the [[Gateshead International Stadium]]). However the new venue proved no easier on the finances of the club, bringing the liquidation of Gateshead AFC in late August 1973. By 1972 Redheugh Park was in a derelict condition. Weed infested with crumbling terraces and dilapidated stands, it was demolished.

==Present day==
For nearly twenty years the outlines of Redheugh Park could be made out with the terraces appearing as grass humps on the land. The area was completely leveled for the 1990 Gateshead Garden Festival and used as a car park. A few years later saw football return to the area in the shape of the Pitz 5-a-side soccer centre which was renamed Power League which is still in place today.

'''Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium''' was an outdoor [[college football]] stadium located in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], United States. It was the home field of the [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State Rams]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]] from 1968 through [[2016 Colorado State Rams football team|2016]]; the team moved to the new [[Colorado State Stadium|Canvas Stadium]] for the [[2017 Colorado State Rams football team|2017]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2017-08-26/college-football-colorado-state-opens-new-campus-stadium-season]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-demolition work began in March 2018 with hazardous material mitigation (mainly asbestos), with full-scale demolition beginning on April 10. Demolition continued into summer 2018, followed by filling in the stadium bowl with soil that had been originally used to create berms around the stadium. The project is expected to be completed in December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/csu/2018/04/10/demolition-csu-hughes-stadium-begins/504003002/ |title=Demolition of CSU's Hughes Stadium begins |first=Kelly |last=Lyell |newspaper=[[Fort Collins Coloradoan|Coloradoan]] |location=Fort Collins, CO |date=April 10, 2018 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes Stadium opened in [[1968 college football season|1968]] as the replacement for the old [[Colorado Field]], a 14,000-seat on-campus stadium that is now the site of "[[Jack Christiansen]] Track".&lt;ref name=csuonc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stadium.colostate.edu/about/on-campusstadiumsatcsu/ |work=Colorado State University Athletics |last=Hirn |first=John |title=On-campus stadiums at CSU |accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacCambridge, Michael, ed.

Hughes Stadium sat in a natural oval bowl, with seating on three sides and an open grass berm (not open for seating) behind the south end zone. The west (home side) stands were expanded out of the bowl and capped by a press box. The stadium was named for [[Harry W. Hughes]], the [[head coach]] for 31 seasons (1911&amp;ndash;41) at what was then known as Colorado Agricultural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/colorado_state/coaching_records.php College Football Data Warehouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327183758/http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/colorado_state/coaching_records.php |date=2008-03-27 }} - CSU coaching records - Retrieved September 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The playing surface itself was named in [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003]] in honor of then [[head coach]] [[Sonny Lubick]].  The winningest coach in school history, he led the Rams for fifteen seasons (1993-[[2007 Colorado State Rams football team|2007]]), winning six conference titles and nine bowl games. The field had a conventional north-south alignment.

The stadium had a [[seating capacity]] of 32,500 with club seats and 12 luxury suites, completed in 2005. The playing field, at an approximate [[elevation]] of {{convert|5190|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&amp;S=12&amp;Z=13&amp;X=610&amp;Y=5612&amp;W=2&amp;qs=%7cFort+Collins%7cCO%7c Topographic map &amp; aerial photo].

The first game at Hughes Stadium was played on September 28, 1968, a 17–12 loss to [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas State]], led by Mean [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]]. From October 1989 to August 1991, the Rams won eight consecutive games at the stadium, a school record. The last game at Hughes Stadium was played on November 19, 2016, with the [[2016 Colorado State Rams football team|Rams]] defeating [[2016 New Mexico Lobos football team|New Mexico]] by a score of 49–31.

[[File:29th Annual Great Reno Balloon Race.JPG|thumb|Balloons take flight in the 30th Annual Great Reno Balloon Race - 9 September 2011]]

'''The Great Reno Balloon Race''' is a [[hot-air balloon]] race held each September in [[Reno, Nevada]]. The event is held at the Rancho San Rafael Park, just west of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]]. The event is free to the public, and completed its 35th year in 2016. Part of the mission statement of the race is to celebrate the joy of flight.

The Coordination of the race is handled by two bodies:

The Great Reno Balloon Race is staffed by paid workers to handle the operations of the event.

The volunteer group, or Aeronauts, consists of about 100 people providing help in many areas of the race including field set-up, pilot crewing and up keep of the grounds. They also assist everyone involved in the race from the organizers and pilots to the sponsors and spectators. The volunteer group meets monthly and works in shifts during the actual event.

The Great Reno Balloon Race is the largest free hot air ballooning event in the country and is held the first weekend after Labor Day each September at Rancho San Rafael Regional Park in Reno, Nevada.{{citation needed|date=March 2016|reason=claim of largest requires an independent reliable source}} The GRBR draws in a crowd of 140,000 on average each year, making it the largest free event in Northern Nevada.{{citation needed|date=March 2016|reason=claim requires an independent reliable source}}  The race draws entrants from throughout the United States as well as numerous other countries. 

==History== 
                                                                     
The first Balloon Race was in 1982, when a mere 20 balloons graced the crisp Nevadan sky. Today, upwards of 100 balloons participate each year. An event that was first started to create a tourist attraction between the Nevada State Fair and the Reno Air Races has become the icon of the community. Bringing people from all over together who share a love for family, community and ballooning, The Great Reno Balloon Race has become a beloved tradition which is embraced by locals and tourists alike.

One of the most spectacular shows over the three-day event is the Great Reno Balloon Race is [https://web.archive.org/web/20080911004345/http://www.renoballoon.com/EventInfo/EventHighlights Dawn Patrol]. A term patented by the board of trustees when Federal Aviation officials approved predawn flying regulations in 1978. Safety precautions such as special navigation lights became the status quo and The Great Reno Balloon Race quickly became a national role model for pre-dawn events in 1990 when it began launching balloons before sunrise.

During Dawn Patrol, pilots face unstable, pre-dawn, air conditions as their balloons illuminate the early morning darkness. Adding warmth to the cool morning, Dawn Patrol marks the beginning of the Balloon Race.

After eight years of the Dawn Patrol, yet another attraction was added to thrill onlookers as they waited for the show to begin. Just before Dawn Patrol, pilots light their lanterns for the Glow Show. The balloons take on an almost fictional appearance, not unlike a paper lantern which marks the beginning of the Balloon Race.

==Competition and results==

'''''The Hare and Hound Competition''''' 
The three-day event begins with the Hare and Hound Competition, a ballooning event in which two balloons act as the “hares” while the 100 or so other balloons follow the leaders as the “hounds.” Modeled after the traditional English sport of freeing a rabbit, giving it a head-start, then releasing a pack of canines to hunt it down, the ballooning competition is less dire for the hare.

'''''The E.L. Cord Tissue Paper Hot Air Balloon Launch'''''
The Great Reno Balloon Race Tissue Paper Balloon Launch, a Washoe County School District and Balloon Race tradition since 1999, is a sight to see. On Thursday and Friday of the Balloon Race, over 1000 students release their colorful, hand-made, model hot air balloons off Bunsen burners.

'''''Balloon Blackjack'''''
Another popular event at The Great Reno Balloon Races is Balloon Blackjack. This event, implemented at the Balloon Race in 1999, gives the pilots a taste of the Reno gaming experience in an airborne blackjack tournament. The pilots compete for prizes such as complimentary weekends and meals at many of the area’s best casinos.

'''''The World’s Largest Pajama Party-Pajama Fest''''' 
The Balloon Race’s newest event and one of its most notable is The World’s Largest Pajama Party. Pajama Fest invites the entire community to participate by attending The Great Reno Balloon Race in pajamas. As well as wearing pajamas, participants are encouraged to show off their best ‘bed-head’ during the Bed Head competition.
Rolling out of bed is hardly a bad thing at the World’s Largest Pajama Party where spectators of all ages are encouraged to leave their PJs on for what is quite possibly the coziest party of the year.

==Volunteers==

Each year The Great Reno Balloon Race volunteers, or Aeronauts, come together to help make the event possible. The Aeronauts help with many areas of the race, from field set-up and break-down to pilot crewing. With tasks that begin before sun-up, these hard working volunteers are the glue that holds the races together.

The Angolan separatist [[guerrilla]] group [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (FLEC) has claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=REUTERS, 9 January 2010, 02.30am IST |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/Angola-rebels-FLEC-claim-Togo-football-team-attack/articleshow/5425965.cms |title=Angola rebels FLEC claim Togo football team attack |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=9 January 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113234658/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/Angola-rebels-FLEC-claim-Togo-football-team-attack/articleshow/5425965.cms |archivedate=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement signed by FLEC's secretary general Rodrigues Mingas said, "This operation is just the start of a series of planned actions that will continue to take place in the whole territory of Cabinda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE6075DB20100108|title=One dead, 9 hurt in gun attack on Togo soccer team|last=Almeida|first=Henrique|date=8 January 2010|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Ministry]] spokesperson, Bernard Valero said that "inciting violence is totally unacceptable" and Mingas could be prosecuted under French laws for making such statements.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

==Investigation==
In connection with the deadly attack on the Togolese national football team, the Angolan police arrested two suspects on 10 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kooora-live.com bedrane mohamed amine]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511161948/http://kooora-live.com/ |date=11 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the national radio reported, citing the prosecutor, the arrests were made in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda, located between the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in West Africa. A total of 9 suspects were arrested.

Angola arrested four men&amp;nbsp;– [[Monsignor]] Raul Tati, a Roman Catholic priest and later [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], Francisco Luemba, a lawyer, Belchior Tati, an economist and Jose Benjamin Fuca, a former police officer&amp;nbsp;– who had documents about Flec and had travelled to Paris for meetings with exiled leaders. In August, they were jailed for links to FLEC-PM. A court in Cabinda found the four guilty of crimes against state security; although the judge did not say whether the four had direct links to the attack. Their prison sentences ranged from three to five years.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} On 11 January, two [[FLEC]] operatives were arrested near the site of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2 separatists held in attack on Togo soccer team |first=Samuel |last=Petrequin |work=Associated Press |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2010 |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SOC_TOGO_BUS_ATTACKED?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2010-01-11-22-03-44}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial was criticised by [[human rights]] groups that accused the government of using the attacks to justify a crackdown on critics. Martinho Nombo, a lawyer taking part in the court hearings, said the judge convicted them only because they had spoken or written about independence for Cabinda. "This is unconstitutional. A judge cannot jail someone for nothing. This will only worsen Angola's poor record on human rights and the whole peace process with FLEC. The supposed link was implied rather than stated. They were convicted on the basis of those documents." [[Human Rights Watch]] also criticised the conviction calling the four "activists" and saying "This is clearly a lost opportunity to restore justice in Angola, and particularly in Cabinda."&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/20108315102504923.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Togolese team called for a boycott of the competition as a result of the attack.&lt;ref name="BBC boycott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8449611.stm|title=Attacked Togo stars want Africa Cup of Nations boycott|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 January 2010|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alaixys Romao]] and Thomas Dossevi spoke of their disgust and their lack of desire to compete following their experience.&lt;ref name="BBC boycott"/&gt; Togo's national football squad subsequently withdrew from the tournament. Togolese midfielder [[Alaixys Romao]] said the team was also trying to persuade the other teams in their group to pull out of the competition.&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph09Jan2010TogoPullOut/&gt; After seeing the aftermath of the attack, members of the [[Mozambique national football team|Mozambique national team]] flying into Luanda asked for assurances of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/01/201019133527904790.html |title=Africa – Togo withdraw from Africa Cup |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Togo was due to play its first game of the tournament against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], three days after the attack on 11 January 2010.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jason Burt  |author2=Paul Kelso |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/6953884/Togo-we-cannot-play-after-this-bloodshed.html|title=Togo: we cannot play after this bloodshed|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 January 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; STV Sport reported that Togo pulled out of the tournament a day later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.stv.tv/world-sport/149216-togo-withdraw-from-african-cup-of-nations/ |title=Togo withdraw from Africa Cup of Nations |publisher=Sport.stv.tv |date=9 January 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111225952/http://sport.stv.tv/world-sport/149216-togo-withdraw-from-african-cup-of-nations/ |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later there was something of a reversal as two of the Togolese players said they would play in the African Nations Cup in "memory of the dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/krone/S30/object_id__179458/hxcms/index.html |title=Togo tritt nach Anschlag nun doch bei Afrika-Cup an |publisher=Krone.at |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Dossevi]], one of the Togolese players, announced that Togo would compete "to show our national colours, our values and that we are men."&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph09Jan2010TogoPullOut/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/togo-in-dramatic-african-nations-cup-uturn-20100110-m0fu.html |title=Togo in dramatic African Nations Cup u-turn |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=10 January 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2010 |first=Nick |last=Reeves}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Togolese government, however, subsequently ordered the team to return home after all, on grounds of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8450529.stm|title=Emmanuel Adebayor says Togo team will return home |date=10 January 2009|work=BBC News (Sport)|accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6982742.ece|title=Togo team flying home after terrorist attack |author4=Jonathan Clayton |author5=Anne Barrowclough |author6=Ben Smith |date=10 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=10 January 2010 | location=London|first1=Roland|last1=Watson|first2=Miles|last2=Costello|first3=Sam|last3=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2010, Togo was officially disqualified from the Africa Cup upon their return to their homeland. The Togolese team had left on Sunday, two days after the attack on the team bus. "The team is disqualified, this group will consist of three teams", said a spokesman for the Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF). According to Togo Sports Minister, Christophe Padumhokou Tchao, Togo's official request to re-join the tournament was denied despite the reasoning to mourn the fallen members of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/news/togos_request_turned_down_news_293677.html|title=Togo's request to return to play at the Africa Cup of Nations has been turned down by the tournament organisers.|date=11 January 2010|accessdate=11 January 2010|publisher=World Soccer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114170553/http://www.worldsoccer.com/news/Togos_request_turned_down_news_293677.html|archivedate=14 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Triumph of the Spirit''''' is a 1989 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Robert M. Young (film director)|Robert M. Young]] and starring [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The screenplay was inspired by true events. The majority of the film is set in the death camp at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau#The extermination camp: Auschwitz II .28Birkenau.29|Auschwitz]] during the [[Holocaust]] and details how the [[Jewish Greeks|Jewish Greek]] [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Salamo Arouch]] was forced to fight other internees to the death for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards' entertainment. Prior to ''Triumph of the Spirit'', no major feature film had ever been shot on location at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

==Plot==
A [[stevedore]] in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], [[Salamo Arouch]]'s passion is boxing. Captured along with his family and fiance Allegra in 1943 and interned in Auschwitz, Arouch is used by his SS captors as entertainment, forced to box against fellow prisoners. He knows that if he refuses, his family will be punished; if he wins, he will be given extra rations which he can share with them; if he loses, he will be sent to the [[gas chamber]]. As his family and friends die around him, he has only his love of Allegra and his grim determination to keep him alive.

The film follows the early life story of Salamo Arouch, though it takes some artistic liberties including the early introduction of wife Allegra (a pseudonym for Marta Yechiel), whom Arouch did not actually meet until after the liberation of the camp.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite journal | title = Boxer Salamo Arouch's Death Camp Bouts End in a Triumph of the Spirit | journal = People Magazine | volume = 33 |issue = 7 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116862,00.html | last = Schindehette | first = Susan |author2=Jack Kelley |author3=Mira Avrech  | date = 1990-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Young was reluctant to make the film when he was first approached with the script, finding the topic too momentous to cover; he only agreed to direct when provided a script that focused only on one small element, "like a cork, bubbling on the surface of the sea."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The film, which positions Arouch as a witness to the horrors of the Holocaust, was shot on a budget of US $12 million.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Taliabue | first = John | title = Fighting for life itself in a Nazi boxing ring | work = New York Times | date = 1989-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DA1230F937A25756C0A96F948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming with permission at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], producers were able to utilize some existing structures but were also tasked with recreating a [[crematory]] given the condition of those that remain.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The film also shot briefly in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wAMPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P4QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4976,676370&amp;dq=salamo-arouch | author = UPI | title = Notes and news from Hollywood | date = 1989-03-17 | work = Deseret News | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | page = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme==
The title of the film is suggestive of human triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, 90&lt;/ref&gt; a view to which star Dafoe subscribed, but others, including actor Olmos perceived its impact differently: "[W]hat does...[the film] project? The moral decay needed to survive in the camp."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Lawrence Baron, the author of 2005's ''Projecting the Holocaust Into the Present'', agreed, stating that "the cumulative impression...undermines whatever uplifting impact its title and publicity imply.... A closer scrutiny of the movie reveals that it is not about the triumph of the spirit but rather about 'choiceless choices', to use Lawrence Langer's term for the dilemma faced by death camp inmates, who were never offered any moral alternatives to prolong their survival."&lt;ref&gt;Baron, 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Baron suggests that this message is crystallized in one scene where Arouch is set to fight his best friend Jacko, who has already been beaten by the guards, knowing that the loser will be consigned to the gas chamber; when he balks, his friend is executed on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
In its review, ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performances of Dafoe ("harrowingly good") and [[Robert Loggia]] ("a memorably physical performance"), but complained that the film overall is "thoroughly mundane", obvious and sentimental, also singling out for criticism the "outstandingly intrusive score".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = The Camps as not often seen | work = New York Times | date = 1989-12-08 | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DD1F39F93BA35751C1A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also taking note of the "intrusive score", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' found all of the cast [[melodrama]]tic with the exception of Dafoe's "disciplined performance" and dismissed the film as "earnest but woefully misguided".&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Travers | first = Peter | title = Triumph of the Spirit | journal = Rolling Stone | year = 1989 |accessdate=2008-11-22 | issue = 570 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949233/review/5949234/triumph_of_the_spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Magazine]]'' noted that the film "is too respectful of its subject to find more in it than noble cliches", highlighting Young's "bland direction" and concluding that "[t]he film's only and considerable virtue lies in its documentation of the desperate strategies people devised to stay alive in the death camps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Corliss | first = Richard | title = Hollywood On The Holocaust | journal = Time | date = 1990-01-08 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,969125-1,00.html | accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' felt that, by showcasing the fights and expecting viewers to root for Arouch, the filmmakers in effect force audiences to behave no differently from the Nazis in the story.&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Robert|title=Triumph of the Spirit|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900202/REVIEWS/2020306/1023|date=1990-02-02|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 book ''Projecting the Holocaust Into the Present'', though acknowledging the generally negative critical reviews, opines that "Young's depiction of the ethical vacuum that the Nazis devised at Auschwitz makes the movie disturbing and effective."&lt;ref&gt;Baron, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1108">'''ÖTILLÖ''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for "Island to island") is a one-day [[swimrun]] race in the archipelago of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. You compete in teams of two.
The aim of the race is to get from [[Sandhamn]] to [[Utö, Sweden|Utö]], via 24 islands, by running across them and swimming between them.  The total distance is 75 kilometres of which 10 km are open-water swimming and 65 km are trail-running. The first race was produced in 2006. The largest islands to run across are [[Runmarö]], [[Nämdö]] and [[Ornö]]. In 2012 ÖTILLÖ was ranked as one of the toughest endurance challenges of the world by CNN.com. ÖTILLÖ is the first race and the origin to the growing movement of Swimrun. ÖTILLÖ is considered to be the World Championship of Swimrun even though it is not part of a federation.

ÖTILLÖ is produced by Michael Lemmel &amp; Mats Skott (pre-marriage Andersson), former World Class Adventure Racers.
