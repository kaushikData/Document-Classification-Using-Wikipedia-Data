      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2860">In [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[set theory]], '''Baumgartner's axiom (BA)''' can be one of three different [[axiom]]s introduced by [[James Earl Baumgartner]].

An axiom introduced by {{harvtxt|Baumgartner|1973}} states that any two [[aleph-1|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]-[[dense set|dense]] subsets of the [[real line]] are [[order-isomorphic]]. [[Stevo Todorcevic|Todorcevic]] showed that this Baumgartner's Axiom is a consequence of the [[Proper Forcing Axiom]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.uci.edu/node/23629 Todorcevic's proof of Baumgartner Axiom by Garrett Ervin] &lt;/ref&gt;.

Another axiom introduced by {{harvtxt|Baumgartner|1975}} states that [[Martin's axiom]] for [[partially ordered set]]s MA&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;(''κ'') is true for all [[partially ordered set]]s ''P'' that are countable closed, well met and ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-linked and all [[Cardinal number|cardinals]] κ less than 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Baumgartner's '''axiom A''' is an axiom for partially ordered sets introduced in {{harv|Baumgartner|1983|loc=section 7}}. A partial order (''P'',&amp;nbsp;≤) is said to satisfy axiom A if there is a family ≤&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of partial orderings on ''P'' for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;... such that 
# ≤&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as&amp;nbsp;≤
#If ''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''q'' then ''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''
#If there is a sequence ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; then there is a ''q'' with ''q''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n''.
#If ''I'' is a pairwise incompatible subset of ''P'' then for all ''p'' and for all natural numbers ''n'' there is a ''q'' such that ''q''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''p'' and the number of elements of ''I'' compatible with ''q'' is countable.

In [[computer science]], a '''composite data type''' or '''compound data type''' is any [[data type]] which can be constructed in a program using the [[programming language]]'s [[primitive data types]] and other composite types.  It is sometimes called a '''structure''' or '''aggregate data type''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howe|first1=Denis|title=The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aggregate%20type|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter term may also refer to [[Array data type|arrays]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], etc.  The act of constructing a composite type is known as [[Object composition|composition]].

==C/C++ structures and classes==
{{Split section portions|struct (C programming language)|date=July 2014}}
{{details|C++ classes}}
A &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is [[C (programming language)|C]]'s and [[C++]]'s notion of a composite type, a datatype that composes a fixed set of labeled '''fields''' or '''members'''. It is so called because of the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword used in declaring them, which is short for ''structure'' or, more precisely, ''user-defined data structure''.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}}

In C++, the only difference between a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and a [[class (computer science)|class]] is the default [[access level]], which is ''private'' for classes and ''public'' for &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s.

Note that while classes and the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] were completely new in C++, the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] already had a crude type of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s. For all intents and purposes, C++ &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s form a [[superset]] of C &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s: virtually all valid C &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s are valid C++ &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s with the same semantics.

===Declaration===
A &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; declaration consists of a list of fields, each of which can have any type.  The total storage required for a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; object is the sum of the storage requirements of all the fields, plus any internal [[Data structure alignment#Data structure padding|padding]].

For example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Account {
   int account_number;
   char *first_name;
   char *last_name;
   float balance;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

defines a type, '''''referred''''' to as &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt;. To create a new variable of this type, we can write &lt;code&gt;struct Account myAccount;&lt;/code&gt;
which has an integer component, accessed by &lt;code&gt;myAccount.account_number&lt;/code&gt;, and a floating-point component, accessed by &lt;code&gt;myAccount.balance&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last_name&lt;/code&gt; components. The structure &lt;code&gt;myAccount&lt;/code&gt; contains all four values, and all four fields may be changed independently.

Since writing &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly in code becomes cumbersome, it is not unusual to see a &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; statement in C code to provide a more convenient synonym for the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;.

For example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct Account_ {
   int    account_number;
   char   *first_name;
   char   *last_name;
   float  balance;
} Account;
&lt;/source&gt;

In C++ code, the [[Typedef|&lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;]] is not needed because types defined using &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; are already part of the regular namespace, so the type can be referred to as either &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt; or simply &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt;.

As another example, a three-dimensional Vector composite type that uses the floating point data type could be created with:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Vector {
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

A variable named &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; composite type would be declared as &lt;code&gt;Vector velocity;&lt;/code&gt; Members of the &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; would be accessed using a dot notation.  For example, &lt;code&gt;velocity.x = 5;&lt;/code&gt; would set the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; component of &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; equal to 5.

Likewise, a color structure could be created using:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Color {
  unsigned int red;
  unsigned int green;
  unsigned int blue;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In 3D graphics, you usually must keep track of both the position and color of each vertex.  One way to do this would be to create a &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; composite type, using the previously created &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; composite types:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Vertex {
  Vector position;
  Color color;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

===Instantiation===
Create a variable of type &lt;code&gt;struct Vertex&lt;/code&gt; using the same format as before: &lt;code&gt;Vertex v;&lt;/code&gt;

===Member access===
Assign values to the components of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; like so:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
v.position.x = 0.0;
v.position.y = 1.5;
v.position.z = 0.0;
v.color.red = 128;
v.color.green = 0;
v.color.blue = 255;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Primitive subtype===
The primary use of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is for the construction of complex datatypes, but sometimes it is used to create primitive [[Structural type system|structural]] [[subtype|subtyping]]. For example, since [[Standard C]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} requires that if two structs have the same initial fields, those fields will be represented in the same way, the code

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct ifoo_old_stub {
   long x, y;
};
struct ifoo_version_42 {
   long x, y, z;
   char *name;
   long a, b, c;
};
void operate_on_ifoo(struct ifoo_old_stub *);
struct ifoo_version_42 s;
. . .
operate_on_ifoo(&amp;s);
&lt;/source&gt;

will work correctly.

==Type signature==
[[Type signature]]s (or [[Function type]]s) are constructed from primitive and composite types, and can serve as types themselves when constructing composite types:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

typedef double (*Metric) (Point p1, Point p2);

typedef struct {
    Point centre;
    double radius;
    Metric metric;
} Circle;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">In mathematics, the '''Conley–Zehnder theorem''', named after [[Charles C. Conley]] and [[Eduard Zehnder]], provides a lower bound for the number of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of [[Hamiltonian vector field|Hamiltonian diffeomorphism]]s of standard symplectic [[torus|tori]] in terms of the topology of the underlying tori. The lower bound is one plus the [[cup-length]] of the torus (thus 2n+1, where 2n is the dimension of the considered torus), and it can be strengthen to the rank of the homology of the torus (which is 2&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt;) provided all the fixed points are non-degenerate, this latter condition being generic in the C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-topology.

The theorem was conjectured by [[Vladimir Arnold]], and it was known as the [[Arnold conjecture]] on fixed points of [[symplectomorphism]]s. Its validity was later extended to more general closed symplectic manifolds by [[Andreas Floer]] and several others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2870">In [[von Neumann algebra]]s, the '''Connes embedding problem''' or [[conjecture]], due to [[Alain Connes]], asks whether every [[von Neumann algebra#Type II factors|type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor]] on a separable Hilbert space can be embedded into the ultrapower of the [[Hyperfinite type II factor|hyperfinite type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor]]  by a [[ultrafilter|free ultrafilter]]. The problem admits a number of equivalent formulations.&lt;ref name = cep&gt;{{cite journal |title= |jstor=2669132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be a [[ultrafilter|free ultrafilter]] on the natural numbers and let ''R'' be the [[Hyperfinite type II factor|hyperfinite type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor]] with trace &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. One can construct the ultrapower &lt;math&gt;R^\omega&lt;/math&gt; as follows: let &lt;math&gt;l^\infty(R)=\{(x_n)_n\subseteq R:sup_n||x_n||&lt;\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; be the von Neumann algebra of norm-bounded sequences and let &lt;math&gt;I_\omega=\{(x_n)\in l^\infty(R):lim_{n\rightarrow\omega}\tau(x_n^*x_n)^{\frac{1}{2}}=0\}&lt;/math&gt;. The quotient &lt;math&gt;l^\infty(R)/I_\omega&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor with trace &lt;math&gt;\tau_{R^\omega}(x)=lim_{n\rightarrow\omega}\tau(x_n+I_\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_n&lt;/math&gt; is any representative sequence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Connes' Embedding Conjecture''' asks whether every [[von Neumann algebra|type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor]] on a separable Hilbert space can be embedded into some &lt;math&gt;R^\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

The isomorphism class of &lt;math&gt;R^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the ultrafilter if and only if the [[continuum hypothesis]] is true (Ge-Hadwin and Farah-Hart-Sherman), but such an embedding property does not depend on the ultrafilter because von Neumann algebras acting on separable Hilbert spaces are, roughly speaking, very small.

{{Spacetime|cTopic=Relation to gravity}}
'''Curved space''' often refers to a spatial geometry which is not "flat" where a flat space is described by [[Euclidean geometry]]. Curved spaces can generally be described by [[Riemannian geometry]] though some simple cases can be described in other ways. Curved spaces play an essential role in [[general relativity]], where [[gravity]] is often visualized as curved space. The [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric]] is a curved metric which forms the current foundation for the description of the [[expansion of space]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|shape of the universe]].

==Simple two-dimensional example==
A very familiar example of a curved space is the surface of a sphere. While to our familiar outlook the sphere ''looks'' three-dimensional, if an object is constrained to lie on the surface, it only has two dimensions that it can move in. The surface of a sphere can be completely described by two dimensions since no matter how rough the surface may appear to be, it is still only a surface, which is the two-dimensional outside border of a volume. Even the surface of the Earth, which is fractal in complexity, is still only a two-dimensional boundary along the outside of a volume.

==Embedding==
[[Image:Pythagorean triangle.png|thumb|In a flat space, the sum of the squares of the side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This relationship does not hold for curved spaces.]]
One of the defining characteristics of a curved space is its departure with the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. In a curved space 
:&lt;math&gt;dx^2 + dy^2 \neq dl^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The Pythagorean relationship can often be restored by describing the space with an extra dimension.
Suppose we have a non-euclidean three-dimensional space with coordinates &lt;math&gt;\left(x',y',z'\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Because it is not flat 
:&lt;math&gt;dx'^2 + dy'^2 + dz'^2 \ne dl'^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

But if we now describe the three-dimensional space with ''four'' dimensions (&lt;math&gt;x,y,z,w&lt;/math&gt;) we can ''choose'' coordinates such that 
:&lt;math&gt;dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + dw^2 = dl^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the coordinate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is '''not''' the same as the coordinate &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.

For the choice of the 4D coordinates to be valid descriptors of the original 3D space it must have the same number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Since four coordinates have four degrees of freedom it must have a constraint placed on it. We can choose a constraint such that Pythagorean theorem holds in the new 4D space. That is 
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +w^2 = \textrm{constant} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

The constant can be positive or negative. For convenience we can choose the constant to be 
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{-1}R^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; now is positive and &lt;math&gt;\kappa \equiv \plusmn 1&lt;/math&gt;.

We can now use this constraint to eliminate the artificial fourth coordinate &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. The differential of the constraining equation is 
:&lt;math&gt;xdx + ydy + zdz + wdw = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; leading to &lt;math&gt;dw = -w^{-1}(xdx + ydy +zdz) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Plugging &lt;math&gt;dw&lt;/math&gt; into the original equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + \frac{(xdx+ydy+zdz)^2}{\kappa^{-1}R^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This form is usually not particularly appealing and so a coordinate transform is often applied: &lt;math&gt;x = r\sin\theta\cos\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = r\sin\theta\sin\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z = r\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;. With this coordinate transformation
:&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-\kappa\frac{r^2}{R^2}} + r^2d\theta^2 + r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Without embedding==
The geometry of a n-dimensional space can also be described with [[Riemannian geometry]]. An [[wiktionary:isotropic|isotropic]] and [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]] space can be described by the metric:
:&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = e^{-\lambda(r)}{dr^2} + r^2d\theta^2 + r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.
This reduces to [[Euclidean space]] when &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;. But a space can be said to be "[[Conformally flat|flat]]" when the [[Weyl tensor|Weyl Tensor]] has all zero components. In three dimensions this condition is met when the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci Tensor]] (&lt;math&gt;R_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the metric times the [[Scalar curvature|Ricci Scalar]] (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, not to be confused with the R of the previous section). That is &lt;math&gt;R_{ab} = g_{ab} R&lt;/math&gt;. Calculation of these components from the metric gives that 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = -\frac{1}{2}\ln \left( 1 - k r^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k \equiv \frac{R}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This gives the metric:
:&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-k{r^2}} + r^2d\theta^2 + r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; can be zero, positive, or negative and is not limited to ±1.

==Open, flat, closed==
An [[wiktionary:isotropic|isotropic]] and [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]] space can be described by the metric:
:&lt;math&gt;dl^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-\kappa\frac{r^2}{R^2}} + r^2d\theta^2 + r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;.

In the limit that the constant of curvature (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) becomes infinitely large, a flat, [[Euclidean space]] is returned. It is essentially the same as setting &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; to zero. If &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is not zero the space is not Euclidean. When &lt;math&gt;\kappa = +1&lt;/math&gt; the space is said to be ''closed'' or [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic]]. When &lt;math&gt;\kappa = -1&lt;/math&gt; the space is said to be ''open'' or [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]].

Triangles which lie on the surface of an open space will have a sum of angles which is less than 180°. Triangles which lie on the surface of a closed space will have a sum of angles which is greater than 180°. The volume, however, is '''not''' &lt;math&gt;(4/3)\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;.

'''D-Wave Two''' ([[project code name]] '''Vesuvius''') is the second commercially available [[quantum computer]], and the successor to the first commercially available quantum computer, [[D-Wave One]].

==Processor==
D-Wave Two boasts a [[central processing unit|CPU]] of about{{clarify|reason=Why is this approximate?|date=October 2018}} 512 [[qubit]]s—an improvement over the D-Wave One series' CPUs of about 128 qubits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/dwave-quantum-cloud/all/1 |last=Smalley |first=Eric |date=22 February 2012 |title=D-Wave Defies World of Critics with 'First Quantum Cloud' |journal=Wired |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of qubits can vary from chip to chip, due to variations in manufacturing.&lt;ref name="kingalgo"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=King |first=Andrew D. |last2=McGeoch |first2=Catherine C. |date=9 October 2014 |title=Algorithm engineering for a quantum annealing platform |eprint=1410.2628|class=cs.DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in qubit count for the D-Wave Two was accomplished by tiling qubit pattern of the D-Wave One. This pattern, named ''chimera'' by D-Wave Systems, has a limited connectivity such that a given qubit can only interact with at most six other qubits.&lt;ref name="howquantum" /&gt; As with the D-Wave One, this restricted connectivity greatly limits the optimization problems that can be approached with the hardware.&lt;ref name="kingalgo" /&gt;

==Quantum computing==
In March 2013, several groups of researchers at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing workshop at the [[Institute of Physics]] in London produced evidence of [[quantum entanglement]] in D-Wave CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Controversial quantum computer aces entanglement tests |first=Jacob |last=Aron |date=8 March 2013 |website=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23251-controversial-quantum-computer-aces-entanglement-tests.html |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, researchers from [[University College London]] and the [[University of Southern California]] corroborated their findings; in their tests, the D-Wave Two exhibited the quantum physics outcome that it should while not showing three different classical physics outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hardy |first=Quentin |date=24 March 2014 |title=Quantum Computing Research May Back Controversial Company |website=Bits |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/quantum-computing-research-may-back-controversial-company/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albash |first=Tameem |year=2015 |title=Distinguishing Classical and Quantum Models for the D-Wave Device |arxiv=1403.4228|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.91.042314 |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=042314 |journal=Physical Review A|bibcode=2015PhRvA..91d2314A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, [[Catherine McGeoch]] verified that D-Wave Two finds solutions to a synthetic benchmark set of [[Ising spin]] optimization problems.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Boixo et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15662">In [[mathematics]], one can often define a '''direct product''' of objects already known, giving a new one. This generalizes the [[Cartesian product]] of the underlying sets, together with a suitably defined structure on the product set. More abstractly, one talks about the [[Product (category theory)|product in category theory]], which formalizes these notions.

Examples are the product of sets (see [[Cartesian product]]), groups (described below), the [[product of rings]] and of other [[abstract algebra|algebraic structures]]. The [[product topology|product of topological spaces]] is another instance.

There is also the [[direct sum]] – in some areas this is used interchangeably, in others it is a different concept.

== Examples ==

* If we think of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of real numbers, then the direct product &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is precisely just the Cartesian product, &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) | x,y \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt;.
* If we think of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of real numbers under addition, then the direct product &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; still consists of &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) | x,y \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt;. The difference between this and the preceding example is that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is now a group.  We have to also say how to add their elements. This is done by letting &lt;math&gt;(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)&lt;/math&gt;.
* If we think of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of real numbers, then the direct product &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; again consists of &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) | x,y \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt;.  To make this a ring, we say how their elements are added, &lt;math&gt;(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)&lt;/math&gt;, and how they are multiplied &lt;math&gt;(a,b) (c,d) = (ac, bd)&lt;/math&gt;.
* However, if we think of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of real numbers, then the direct product &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist – naively defining &lt;math&gt;\{ (x,y) | x,y \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; in a similar manner to the above examples would not result in a field since the element &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; does not have a multiplicative inverse.

In a similar manner, we can talk about the product of more than two objects, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can even talk about product of infinitely many objects, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \dotsb&lt;/math&gt;.

== Group direct product ==
{{main|Direct product of groups}}
In [[group (mathematics)|group theory]] one can define the direct product of two groups (''G'', ∘) and (''H'', ∙), denoted by ''G'' × ''H''. For [[abelian group]]s which are written additively, it may also be called the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum of two groups]], denoted by &lt;math&gt;G \oplus H&lt;/math&gt;.

It is defined as follows:
* the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of the elements of the new group is the ''Cartesian product'' of the sets of elements of ''G'' and ''H'', that is {(''g'', ''h''): ''g'' ∈ ''G'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''};
* on these elements put an operation, defined element-wise:
*: (''g'', ''h'') × (''g{{'}}'', ''h' '') = (''g'' ∘ ''g{{'}}'', ''h'' ∙ ''h{{'}}'')
(Note (''G'', ∘) may be the same as (''H'', ∙).)

This construction gives a new group. It has a [[normal subgroup]] [[isomorphic]] to ''G'' (given by the elements of the form (''g'', 1)), and one isomorphic to ''H'' (comprising the elements (1, ''h'')).

The reverse also holds, there is the following recognition theorem: If a group ''K'' contains two normal subgroups ''G'' and ''H'', such that ''K''= ''GH'' and the intersection of ''G'' and ''H'' contains only the identity, then ''K'' is isomorphic to ''G'' × ''H''. A relaxation of these conditions, requiring only one subgroup to be normal, gives the [[semidirect product]].

As an example, take as ''G'' and ''H'' two copies of the unique (up to isomorphisms) group of order 2, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: say {1, ''a''} and {1, ''b''}. Then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {(1,1), (1,''b''), (''a'',1), (''a'',''b'')}, with the operation element by element. For instance, (1,''b'')*(''a'',1) = (1*''a'', ''b''*1) = (''a'',''b''), and (1,''b'')*(1,''b'') = (1,''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = (1,1).

With a direct product, we get some natural [[group homomorphism]]s for free: the projection maps 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \pi_1: G \times H \to G\quad \text{by} \quad \pi_1(g, h) &amp;= g \\
  \pi_2: G \times H \to H\quad \text{by} \quad \pi_2(g, h) &amp;= h
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
called the '''coordinate functions'''.

Also, every homomorphism ''f'' to the direct product is totally determined by its component functions 
&lt;math&gt;f_i = \pi_i \circ f&lt;/math&gt;.

For any group (''G'', ∘), and any integer ''n'' ≥ 0, multiple application of the direct product gives the group of all ''n''-[[tuple]]s  ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the trivial group). Examples:
*'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
*'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (with additional [[vector space]] structure this is called [[Euclidean space]], see below)

== Direct product of modules ==
The direct product for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (not to be confused with the [[Tensor product of modules|tensor product]]) is very similar to the one defined for groups above, using the Cartesian product with the operation of addition being componentwise, and the scalar multiplication just distributing over all the components. Starting from '''R''' we get [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the prototypical example of a real ''n''-dimensional vector space. The direct product of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Note that a direct product for a finite index &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^n X_i &lt;/math&gt; is identical to the [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] &lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{i=1}^n X_i &lt;/math&gt;. The direct sum and direct product differ only for infinite indices, where the elements of a direct sum are zero for all but for a finite number of entries. They are dual in the sense of [[category theory]]: the direct sum is the [[coproduct]], while the direct product is the product.

For example, consider &lt;math&gt;X=\prod_{i=1}^\infty \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y=\bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the infinite direct product and direct sum of the real numbers. Only sequences with a finite number of non-zero elements are in ''Y''. For example, (1,0,0,0,...) is in ''Y'' but (1,1,1,1,...) is not. Both of these sequences are in the direct product ''X''; in fact, ''Y'' is a proper subset of ''X'' (that is, ''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''X'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirectProduct.html|title=Direct Product|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupDirectProduct.html|title=Group Direct Product|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topological space direct product ==
The direct product for a collection of [[topological space]]s ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''i'' in ''I'', some index set, once again makes use of the Cartesian product

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Defining the [[topology]] is a little tricky. For finitely many factors, this is the obvious and natural thing to do: simply take as a [[basis (topology)|basis]] of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B = \{ U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n\ |\ U_i\ \mathrm{open\ in}\ X_i \}.&lt;/math&gt;

This topology is called the [[product topology]]. For example, directly defining the product topology on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by the open sets of '''R''' (disjoint unions of open intervals), the basis for this topology would consist of all disjoint unions of open rectangles in the plane (as it turns out, it coincides with the usual [[metric space|metric]] topology).

The product topology for infinite products has a twist, and this has to do with being able to make all the projection maps continuous and to make all functions into the product  continuous if and only if all its component functions are continuous (i.e. to satisfy the categorical definition of product: the morphisms here are continuous functions): we take as a basis of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor, as before, with the proviso that all but finitely many of the open subsets are the entire factor:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal B = \left\{ \prod_{i \in I} U_i\ \Big|\ (\exists j_1,\ldots,j_n)(U_{j_i}\ \mathrm{open\ in}\ X_{j_i})\ \mathrm{and}\ (\forall i \neq j_1,\ldots,j_n)(U_i = X_i) \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The more natural-sounding topology would be, in this case, to take products of infinitely many open subsets as before, and this does yield a somewhat interesting topology, the [[box topology]]. However it is not too difficult to find an example of bunch of continuous component functions whose product function is not continuous (see the separate entry box topology for an example and more). The problem which makes the twist necessary is ultimately rooted in the fact that the intersection of open sets is only guaranteed to be open for finitely many sets in the definition of topology.

Products (with the product topology) are nice with respect to preserving properties of their factors; for example, the product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff; the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of compact spaces is compact. That last one, called [[Tychonoff's theorem]], is yet another equivalence to the [[axiom of choice]].

For more properties and equivalent formulations, see the separate entry [[product topology]].

== Direct product of binary relations ==
On the Cartesian product of two sets with [[binary relation]]s ''R'' and ''S'', define (''a'', ''b'') T (''c'', ''d'') as ''a'' ''R'' ''c'' and ''b'' ''S'' ''d''. If ''R'' and ''S'' are both [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], or [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], relation ''T'' has the same property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cr.yp.to/2005-261/bender1/EO.pdf Equivalence and Order]&lt;/ref&gt; Combining properties it follows that this also applies for being a [[preorder]] and being an [[equivalence relation]]. However, if ''R'' and ''S'' are [[total relation]]s, ''T'' is in general not.

== Direct product in universal algebra ==
If Σ is a fixed [[Signature (logic)|signature]], ''I'' is an arbitrary (possibly infinite) index set, and ('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[indexed family]] of Σ algebras, the '''direct product''' '''A''' = ∏&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Σ algebra defined as follows:
* The universe set ''A'' of '''A''' is the Cartesian product of the universe sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, formally: ''A'' = ∏&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;;
* For each ''n'' and each ''n''-ary operation symbol {{nowrap|''f'' ∈ Σ}}, its interpretation ''f''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sup&gt; in '''A''' is defined componentwise, formally: for all {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''A''}} and each {{nowrap|''i'' ∈ ''I''}}, the ''i''th component of {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sup&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is defined as {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''i''), …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''i''))}}.
For each {{nowrap|''i'' ∈ ''I''}}, the ''i''th projection {{nowrap|π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A'' → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined by {{nowrap|1=π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') = ''a''(''i'')}}. It is a [[surjective homomorphism]] between the Σ algebras '''A''' and '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley N. Burris and H.P. Sankappanavar, 1981. ''[http://www.thoralf.uwaterloo.ca/htdocs/ualg.html A Course in Universal Algebra.]''  Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3-540-90578-2}}. Here: Def.7.8, p.53 (=p. 67 in pdf file)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a special case, if the index set {{nowrap|1=''I'' = { 1, 2 },}} the direct product of two Σ algebras '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained, written as {{nowrap|1='''A''' = '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If Σ just contains one binary operation ''f'', the [[#Group direct product|above]] definition of the direct product of groups is obtained, using the notation {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''G''}}, {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = ∘}}, {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = ∙}}, and {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sup&gt; = ×}}. Similarly, the definition of the direct product of modules is subsumed here.

== Categorical product ==
{{Main|Product (category theory)}}

The direct product can be abstracted to an arbitrary [[category theory|category]]. In a general category, given a collection of objects ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''and'' a collection of [[morphism]]s ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' from ''A'' to ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''{{clarify|Is A a single object from A_i, or all A_i?|date=February 2012}} with ''i'' ranging in some index set ''I'', an object ''A'' is said to be a '''categorical product''' in the category if, for any object ''B'' and any collection of morphisms ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' from ''B'' to ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', there exists a unique morphism ''f'' from ''B'' to ''A'' such that ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; f'' and this object ''A'' is unique. This not only works for two factors, but arbitrarily (even infinitely) many.

For groups we similarly define the direct product of a more general, arbitrary collection of groups ''G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''i'' in ''I'', ''I'' an index set. Denoting the Cartesian product of the groups by ''G'' we define multiplication on ''G''  with the operation of componentwise multiplication; and corresponding to the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the definition above are the projection maps

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_i \colon G \to G_i\quad \mathrm{by} \quad \pi_i(g) = g_i&lt;/math&gt;,

the functions that take &lt;math&gt;(g_j)_{j \in I}&lt;/math&gt; to its ''i''th component ''g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
&lt;!-- this is easier to visualize as a [[commutative diagram]]; eventually somebody should insert a relevant diagram for the categorical product here! --&gt;

== Internal and external direct product ==
&lt;!-- linked from [[Internal direct product]] and [[External direct product]] --&gt;
{{see also|Internal direct sum}}

Some authors draw a distinction between an '''internal direct product''' and an '''external direct product.''' If &lt;math&gt;A, B \subset X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \times B \cong X&lt;/math&gt;, then we say that ''X'' is an ''internal'' direct product (of ''A'' and ''B''); if ''A'' and ''B'' are not subobjects, then we say that this is an ''external'' direct product.

==Metric and norm==
A metric on a Cartesian product of metric spaces, and a norm on a direct product of normed vector spaces, can be defined in various ways, see for example [[Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]].

In the [[mathematics]] of the [[real number]]s, the [[logarithm]] log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' is a number ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}}, for given numbers ''a'' and ''b''. Analogously, in any [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'', powers ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; can be defined for all [[integer]]s ''k'', and the '''discrete logarithm''' log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' is an integer ''k'' such that {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}}.

Discrete logarithms are quickly computable in a few special cases. However, no efficient method is known for computing them in general. Several important algorithms in [[public-key cryptography]] base their security on the assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen groups has no efficient solution.

== Definition ==

Let ''G'' be any group. Denote its [[group operation]] by multiplication and its identity element by 1. Let ''b'' be any element of ''G''. For any positive integer ''k'', the expression ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the product of ''b'' with itself ''k'' times:
:&lt;math&gt;b^k = \underbrace{b \cdot b \cdot \ldots \cdot b}_{k \; \mathrm{times}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, let ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''-k''&lt;/sup&gt; denote the product of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with itself ''k'' times. For ''k'' = 0, the ''k''th power is the identity: {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.

Let ''a'' also be an element of ''G''. An integer ''k'' that solves the equation {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}} is termed a '''discrete logarithm''' (or simply '''logarithm''', in this context) of ''a'' to the base ''b''. One writes ''k'' = log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''.

==Examples==
=== Powers of 10 ===

The powers of 10 form an infinite subset ''G'' = {…, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, …} of the [[rational number]]s. This set ''G'' is a [[cyclic group]] under multiplication, and 10 is a generator. For any element ''a'' of the group, one can compute log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''. For example, log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 10000 = 4, and log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 0.001 = −3. These are instances of the discrete logarithm problem.

Other base-10 logarithms in the real numbers are not instances of the discrete logarithm problem, because they involve non-integer exponents. For example, the equation log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 53 = 1.724276… means that 10&lt;sup&gt;1.724276…&lt;/sup&gt; = 53. While integer exponents can be defined in any group using products and inverses, arbitrary real exponents in the real numbers require other concepts such as the [[exponential function]].

=== Powers of a fixed real number ===

A similar example holds for any non-zero real number ''b''. The powers form a multiplicative subgroup ''G'' = {…, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, …} of the non-zero real numbers. For any element ''a'' of ''G'', one can compute log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''.

=== Modular arithmetic ===

One of the simplest settings for discrete logarithms is the group [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;]]. This is the group of multiplication [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] the [[prime number|prime]] ''p''. Its elements are  [[congruence class]]es modulo ''p'', and the group product of two elements may be obtained by ordinary integer multiplication of the elements followed by reduction modulo&amp;nbsp;''p''.

The ''k''th [[exponentiation|power]] of one of the numbers in this group may be computed by finding its ''k''th power as an integer and then finding the remainder after division by ''p''. When the numbers involved are large, it is more efficient to reduce modulo ''p'' multiple times during the computation. Regardless of the specific algorithm used, this operation is called [[modular exponentiation]]. For example, consider ('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;. To compute 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; in this group, compute 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 81, and then divide 81 by 17, obtaining a remainder of 13. Thus 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 13 in the group ('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;.

The discrete logarithm is just the inverse operation. For example, consider the equation 3&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 13 (mod 17) for ''k''. From the example above, one solution is ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, but it is not the only solution. Since 3&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 17)—as follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]]—it also follows that if ''n'' is an integer then 3&lt;sup&gt;4+16''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; × (3&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 13 × 1&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 13 (mod 17). Hence the equation has infinitely many solutions of the form 4 + 16''n''. Moreover, because 16 is the smallest positive integer ''m'' satisfying 3&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 17), these are the only solutions. Equivalently, the set of all possible solutions can be expressed by the constraint that ''k'' ≡ 4 (mod 16).

=== Powers of the identity ===

In the special case where ''b'' is the identity element 1 of the group ''G'', the discrete logarithm log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' is undefined for ''a'' other than 1, and every integer ''k'' is a discrete logarithm for ''a'' = 1.

== Properties ==

Powers obey the usual algebraic identity ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + ''l''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the function
:&lt;math&gt;f : \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt;
defined by ''f''(''k'') = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[group homomorphism]] from the integers '''Z''' under addition [[Surjection|onto]] the [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G'' [[generating set of a group|generated]] by ''b''. For all ''a'' in ''H'', log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' exists. Conversely, log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' does not exist for ''a'' that are not in ''H''.

If ''H'' is infinite, then log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' is also unique, and the discrete logarithm amounts to a [[group isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;\log_b \colon H \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, if ''H'' is finite of size ''n'', then log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' is unique only up to congruence modulo ''n'', and the discrete logarithm amounts to a group isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\log_b\colon H \rightarrow \mathbf{Z}_n,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the additive group of integers modulo ''n''.

The familiar base change formula for ordinary logarithms remains valid: If ''c'' is another generator of ''H'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\log_c a = \log_c b \cdot \log_b a.&lt;/math&gt;

{{See also|Discrete logarithm records}}
{{unsolved|computer science|Can the discrete logarithm be computed in polynomial time on a classical computer?}}
The discrete logarithm problem is considered to be computationally intractable. That is, no efficient classical algorithm is known for computing discrete logarithms in general.

A general algorithm for computing log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' in finite groups ''G'' is to raise ''b'' to larger and larger powers ''k'' until the desired ''a'' is found. This algorithm is sometimes called ''trial multiplication''. It requires [[running time]] linear in the size of the group ''G'' and thus exponential in the number of digits in the size of the group. Therefore, it is an [[exponential time|exponential-time]] algorithm, practical only for small groups ''G''.

More sophisticated algorithms exist, usually inspired by similar algorithms for integer factorization. These algorithms run faster than the naïve algorithm, some of them linear in the square root of the size of the group, and thus exponential in half the number of digits in the size of the group. However none of them run in [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits in the size of the group).

* [[Function field sieve]]
* [[Index calculus algorithm]]
* [[Number field sieve]]
* [[Pohlig–Hellman algorithm]]
* [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms]]
* [[Pollard's kangaroo algorithm]] (aka Pollard's lambda algorithm)

There is an efficient [[Shor's algorithm|quantum algorithm]] due to [[Peter Shor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=quant-ph/9508027 |title=Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer |first=Peter |last=Shor |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |volume=26 |issue=5 |year=1997 |pages=1484–1509 |doi=10.1137/s0097539795293172 | mr=1471990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficient classical algorithms also exist in certain special cases. For example, in the group of the integers modulo ''p'' under addition, the power ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; becomes a product ''bk'', and equality means congruence modulo ''p'' in the integers. The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] finds ''k'' quickly.

== Comparison with integer factorization ==

While computing discrete logarithms and [[integer factorization|factoring integers]] are distinct problems, they share some properties:
*both are special cases of the [[hidden subgroup problem]] for finite [[Abelian group]]s,
*both problems seem to be difficult (no efficient [[algorithm]]s are known for non-[[quantum computer]]s),
*for both problems efficient algorithms on quantum computers are known,
*algorithms from one problem are often adapted to the other, and
*the difficulty of both problems has been used to construct various [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems.

== Cryptography ==
There exist groups for which computing discrete logarithms is apparently difficult.  In some cases (e.g. large prime order subgroups of  groups ('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;) there is not only no efficient algorithm known for the worst case, but the [[average-case complexity]] can be shown to be about as hard as the worst case using [[random self-reducibility]].

At the same time, the inverse problem of discrete exponentiation is not difficult (it can be computed efficiently using [[exponentiation by squaring]], for example).  This asymmetry is analogous to the one between integer factorization and integer [[multiplication]]. Both asymmetries (and other possibly [[one-way functions]]) have been exploited in the construction of cryptographic systems.

Popular choices for the group ''G'' in discrete logarithm [[cryptography]] are the cyclic groups ('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g. [[ElGamal encryption]], [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]], and the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]]) and cyclic subgroups of [[elliptic curve]]s over [[finite field]]s (''see'' [[elliptic curve cryptography]]).

While there is no publicly known algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem in general, the first three steps of the [[number field sieve]] algorithm only depend on the group ''G'', not on the specific elements of ''G'' whose finite log is desired. By [[precomputing]] these three steps for a specific group, one need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three, to obtain a specific logarithm in that group.&lt;ref name=imperfectfs/&gt;

It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024 bits or less, e.g. cyclic groups with order of the Oakley primes specified in RFC 2409. The [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called [[export of cryptography|export grade]].&lt;ref name=imperfectfs/&gt;

The authors of the [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack estimate that the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would be within the budget of a large national [[intelligence agency]] such as the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024 DH primes is behind claims in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|leaked NSA documents]] that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.&lt;ref name=imperfectfs&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adrian |first1=David |last2=Bhargavan |first2=Karthikeyan |last3=Durumeric |first3=Zakir |last4=Gaudry |first4=Pierrick |last5=Green |first5=Matthew |last6=Halderman |first6=J.

Periodic repetition of suitable high-order DD sequences may be employed to engineer a ‘stroboscopic saturation’ of qubit coherence, or coherence plateau, that can persist in the presence of realistic noise spectra and experimental control imperfections.

'''''Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete'''''/'''''A Series of Modern Surveys in Mathematics''''' is a series of [[Monographic series|scholarly monographs]] published by [[Springer Science+Business Media]]. The title literally means "Results in mathematics and related areas". Most of the books were published in German or English, but there were a few in French and Italian. There have been several sequences, or ''Folge'': the original series, neue Folge, and 3.Folge. Some of the most significant mathematical monographs of 20th century appeared in this series.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Original series==
The series started in 1932 with publication of ''Knotentheorie'' by  [[Kurt Reidemeister]] as "Band 1" (English: volume 1). There seems to have been double numeration in this sequence.

==Neue Folge==
This sequence started in 1950 with the publication of ''Transfinite Zahlen'' by [[Heinz Bachmann]]. The volumes are consecutively numbered, designated as either "Band" or "Heft". A total of 100 volumes was published, often in multiple editions, but preserving the original numbering within the series.

The [[ISSN]] for this sequence is 0071-1136. As of February 2008, [[Paul Halmos|P. R. Halmos]], [[Peter Hilton|P. J. Hilton]], R. Remmert, and B. Szökefalvi-Nagy are listed on the series' website as the editors of the defunct 2. Folge.

==3. Folge==
This sequence started in 1983 with the publication of ''Galois module structure of algebraic integers'' by [[Albrecht Fröhlich]].

As of February 2008, the  [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Remmert|R. Remmert]].

The apparatus is known for a dramatic visualization of energy exchanges in three different processes tightly coupled. As the disk gradually decreases the azimuthal rotation, there is also a decrease in amplitude and increase in the frequency of the disk's axial precession senoidal curve. 

The evolution of the axial precession senoidal curve is easily visualized in a slow motion video by looking at the side of the disk following a single point marked on the disc. The evolution of the rotation of the disk is easily visualized in slow motion by looking at the top of the disk following an arrow drawn on the disc representing its radius. 

As the disk releases the initial energy given by the user and approaches a stopped condition, the disk seems to "defy gravity" through these dynamic exchanges of energy. Joseph Bendik named the toy after [[Leonhard Euler]], who studied similar physics in the 18th century.

==Components and use==
The commercially available toy consists of a heavy, thick chrome-plated steel disk and a rigid, slightly [[concave mirror|concave]], mirrored base. Included [[hologram|holographic]] magnetic stickers can be attached to the disk, to enhance the visual effect of wobbling. These attachments are strictly decorative and may reduce the capacity to see and understand what processes are truly at work.   

The disk, when spun on a flat surface, exhibits a spinning/rolling motion, slowly progressing through different rates and types of motion before coming to rest—most notably, the [[precession]] rate of the disk's [[axis of symmetry]] accelerates as the disk spins down. The rigid mirror is used to provide a suitable low-friction surface, with a slight concavity which keeps the spinning disk from "wandering" off a support surface. 

An ordinary [[coin]] spun on a table, as with any disk spun on a relatively flat surface, exhibits essentially the same type of motion, but is normally more limited in the length of time before stopping. The commercially available Euler’s Disk toy provides a more effective demonstration of the phenomenon than more commonly found items, having an optimized [[aspect ratio]] and a precision polished, slightly rounded edge to maximize the spinning/rolling time.

==Physics==
A spinning/rolling disk ultimately comes to rest, and it does so quite abruptly, the final stage of motion being accompanied by a whirring sound of rapidly increasing frequency. As the disk rolls, the point of rolling contact describes a circle that oscillates with a constant angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.   If the motion is non-dissipative (frictionless),  &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and the motion persists forever; this is contrary to observation, since &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is not constant in real life situations. In fact, the precession rate of the axis of symmetry approaches a [[finite-time singularity]] modeled by a [[power law]] with exponent approximately &amp;minus;1/3 (depending on specific conditions).

There are two conspicuous dissipative effects: [[rolling friction]] when the coin slips along the surface, and [[air drag]] from the resistance of air. Experiments show that [[rolling friction]] is mainly responsible for the dissipation and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Easwar | first1 = K. | last2 = Rouyer | first2 = F. | last3 = Menon | first3 = N. | title = Speeding to a stop: The finite-time singularity of a spinning disk | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.66.045102 | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 045102 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12443243| pmc = |bibcode = 2002PhRvE..66d5102E }}&lt;/ref&gt;—experiments in a [[vacuum]] show that the absence of air affects behavior only slightly, while the behavior (precession rate) depends systematically on [[coefficient of friction]]. In the limit of small angle (i.e. immediately before the disk stops spinning), air drag (specifically, [[viscosity|viscous dissipation]]) is the dominant factor, but prior to this end stage, rolling friction is the dominant effect.

== History of research ==
=== Moffatt ===
In the early 2000s, research was sparked by an article in the April 20, 2000 edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moffatt | first=H. K. | title=Euler's disk and its finite-time singularity | journal=Nature | date=20 April 2000 | volume=404 | issue=6780 | pages=833–834 | doi=10.1038/35009017| pmid=10786779 | bibcode=2000Natur.404..833M }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Keith Moffatt]] showed that [[viscosity|viscous dissipation]] in the thin layer of [[air]] between the disk and the table would be sufficient to account for the observed abruptness of the settling process.  He also showed that the motion concluded in a [[finite-time singularity]]. His first theoretical hypothesis was contradicted by subsequent research, which showed that rolling friction is actually the dominant factor.

Moffatt showed that, as time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; approaches a particular time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; (which is mathematically a [[integral|constant of integration]]), the viscous dissipation approaches [[infinity]]. The [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] that this implies is not realized in practice, because the magnitude of the vertical acceleration cannot exceed the acceleration due to [[g-force|gravity]] (the disk loses contact with its support surface).  Moffatt goes on to show that the theory breaks down at a time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; before the final settling time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;, given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \simeq \left[\left(\frac{2a}{9g}\right)^3 \frac{2\pi\mu a}{M}\right]^\frac{1}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the disk, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration due to Earth's gravity, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the [[dynamic viscosity]] of [[air]], and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the disk.  For the commercially available Euler’s Disk toy (see link in "External links" below), &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is about &lt;math&gt;10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; seconds, at which time the angle between the coin and the surface, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is approximately 0.005 radians and the rolling angular velocity, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, is about 500 Hz.

Using the above notation, the total spinning/rolling time is:

:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{\alpha_0^3 M}{2\pi\mu a}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial inclination of the disk, measured in [[radian]]s.  Moffatt also showed that, if &lt;math&gt;t_0-t&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;,  the finite-time singularity in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega\sim(t_0-t)^{-\frac{1}{6}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Experimental results===
Moffatt's theoretical work inspired several other workers to experimentally investigate the dissipative mechanism of a spinning/rolling disk, with results that partially contradicted his explanation. These experiments used spinning objects and surfaces of various geometries (disks and rings), with varying coefficients of friction, both in air and in a vacuum, and used instrumentation such as [[high speed photography]] to quantify the phenomenon.

In the 30 November 2000 issue of ''Nature'', physicists Van den Engh, Nelson and Roach discuss experiments in which disks were spun in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Van den Engh | first=Ger |author2=Nelson, Peter |author3=Roach, Jared  | title=Analytical dynamics: Numismatic gyrations | journal=Nature | date=30 November 2000 | volume=408 | issue=6812 | page=540 | doi=10.1038/35046209| pmid=11117733 |bibcode = 2000Natur.408..540V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van den Engh used a [[rijksdaalder]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] coin, whose [[magnetic]] properties allowed it to be spun at a precisely determined rate. They found that slippage between the disk and the surface could account for observations, and the presence or absence of air only slightly affected the disk's behavior. They pointed out that Moffatt's theoretical analysis would predict a very long spin time for a disk in a vacuum, which was not observed.

Moffatt responded with a generalized theory that should allow experimental determination of which dissipation mechanism is dominant, and pointed out that the dominant dissipation mechanism would always be viscous dissipation in the limit of small &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., just before the disk settles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moffatt | first=H. K. | title=Reply: Numismatic gyrations | journal=Nature | date=30 November 2000 | volume=408 | issue=6812 | page=540 | doi=10.1038/35046211|bibcode = 2000Natur.408..540M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later work at the [[University of Guelph]] by Petrie, Hunt and Gray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrie|first=D.|author2=Hunt, J. L. |author3=Gray, C. G. |title=Does the Euler Disk slip during its motion?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=2002|volume=70|issue=10|pages=1025–1028|doi=10.1119/1.1501117|bibcode = 2002AmJPh..70.1025P }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that carrying out the experiments in a vacuum (pressure 0.1 [[pascal (unit)|pascal]]) did not significantly affect the energy dissipation rate.  Petrie ''et al.'' also showed that the rates were largely unaffected by replacing the disk with a [[torus|ring]] shape, and that the no-slip condition was satisfied for angles greater than 10°.

On several occasions during the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], talk show host [[Conan O'Brien]] would spin his [[wedding ring]] on his desk, trying to spin the ring for as long as possible.  The quest to achieve longer and longer spin times led him to invite [[MIT]] professor Peter Fisher onto the show to experiment with the problem.  Spinning the ring in a vacuum had no identifiable effect, while a [[Teflon]] spinning support surface gave a record time of 51 seconds, corroborating the claim that rolling friction is the primary mechanism for kinetic energy dissipation.{{cn|date=March 2014}}
Various kinds of rolling friction as primary mechanism for energy dissipation have been studied by Leine &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leine|first=R.I.|title=Experimental and theoretical investigation of the energy dissipation of a rolling disk during its final stage of motion|journal=Archive of Applied Mechanics|date=2009|volume=79|issue=11|pages=1063–1082|doi= 10.1007/s00419-008-0278-6|bibcode=2009AAM....79.1063L}}&lt;/ref&gt; who confirmed experimentally that the frictional resistance of the movement of the contact point over the rim of the disk is most likely the primary dissipation mechanism on a time-scale of seconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">In [[Riemannian geometry]], [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Gromov]]'s optimal stable 2-[[systolic geometry|systolic]] inequality is the inequality

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{stsys}_2{}^n \leq n!
\;\mathrm{vol}_{2n}(\mathbb{CP}^n)&lt;/math&gt;,

valid for an arbitrary Riemannian metric on the [[complex projective space]], where the optimal bound is attained
by the symmetric [[Fubini–Study metric]], providing a natural geometrisation of [[quantum mechanics]].  Here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{stsys_2}&lt;/math&gt; is the stable 2-systole, which in this case can be defined as the infimum of the areas of rational 2-cycles representing the class of the complex projective line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CP}^1 \subset \mathbb{CP}^n&lt;/math&gt; in 2-dimensional homology.

The inequality first appeared in {{harvtxt|Gromov|1981}} as Theorem 4.36.

The proof of Gromov's inequality relies on the [[Wirtinger inequality (2-forms)|Wirtinger inequality for exterior 2-forms]].

==Projective planes over division algebras &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R,C,H}&lt;/math&gt;==

In the special case n=2, Gromov's inequality becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{stsys}_2{}^2 \leq 2 \mathrm{vol}_4(\mathbb{CP}^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  This inequality can be thought of as an analog of [[Pu's inequality|Pu's inequality for the real projective plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RP}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  In both cases, the boundary case of equality is attained by the symmetric metric of the projective plane.  Meanwhile, in the quaternionic case, the symmetric metric on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^2&lt;/math&gt; is not its systolically optimal metric.  In other words, the manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^2&lt;/math&gt; admits Riemannian metrics with higher systolic ratio &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{stsys}_4{}^2/\mathrm{vol}_8&lt;/math&gt; than for its symmetric metric {{harv|Bangert|Katz|Shnider|Weinberger|2009}}.

In mathematics, the '''Heine–Stieltjes polynomials''' or '''Stieltjes polynomials''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=T. J. Stieltjes|first=T. J. |last=Stieltjes|year=1885}}, are polynomial solutions of a second-order [[Fuchsian equation]], a [[differential equation]] all of whose singularities are [[regular singularity|regular]].  The Fuchsian equation has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 S}{dz^2}+\left(\sum _{j=1}^N \frac{\gamma _j}{z - a_j} \right) \frac{dS}{dz} + \frac{V(z)}{\prod _{j=1}^N (z - a_j)}S = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for some polynomial ''V''(''z'') of degree at most ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, and if this has a polynomial solution ''S'' then ''V'' is called a Van Vleck polynomial (after [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]]) and ''S'' is called a Heine–Stieltjes polynomial.

[[Heun polynomial]]s are the special cases of Stieltjes polynomials when the differential equation has four singular points.

{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}

In mathematics, an '''image''' is the [[subset]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]'s [[codomain]] which is the output of the function from a subset of its [[Domain of a function|domain]].

Evaluating a function at each element of a subset ''X'' of the domain, produces a set called the ''image of X under or through'' the function. The '''inverse image''' or '''preimage''' of a particular subset ''S'' of the [[codomain]] of a function is the set of all elements of the domain that map to the members of ''S''.

Image and inverse image may also be defined for general [[binary relation#Operations on binary relations|binary relations]], not just functions.

==Definition==
The word "image" is used in three related ways. In these definitions, ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' to the set ''Y''.

===Image of an element===
If ''x'' is a member of ''X'', then ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' (the [[value (mathematics)|value]] of ''f'' when applied to ''x'') is the image of ''x'' under ''f''. ''y'' is alternatively known as the output of ''f'' for argument ''x''.

===Image of a subset===
The image of a subset ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' under ''f'' is the subset ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ⊆ ''Y'' defined by (in [[set-builder notation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;f[A] = \{ \, y \in Y \, | \, y = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in A \, \}&lt;/math&gt;

When there is no risk of confusion, ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is  simply written as ''f''(''A''). This convention is a common one; the intended meaning must be inferred from the context.  This makes ''f''[.] a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[power set]] of ''X'' (the set of all [[subset]]s of ''X''), and whose [[codomain]] is the power set of ''Y''. See [[#Notation|Notation]] below.

===Image of a function===
The image ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the entire [[domain of a function|domain]] ''X'' of ''f'' is called simply the image of ''f''.

===Generalization to binary relations===
If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[binary relation]] on ''X''[[cartesian product|×]]''Y'', the set { y∈''Y'' | ''xRy'' for some ''x''∈''X'' } is called the image, or the range, of ''R''. Dually, the set { ''x''∈''X'' | ''xRy'' for some y∈''Y'' } is called the domain of ''R''.

==Inverse image==
{{Redirect|Preimage|the cryptographic attack on hash functions|preimage attack}}
Let ''f'' be a function from ''X'' to ''Y''.  The '''preimage''' or inverse image of a set ''B'' ⊆ ''Y'' under ''f'' is the subset of ''X'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[ B ] = \{ \, x \in X \, | \, f(x) \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse image of a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], denoted by ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{''y''}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or by   ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is also called the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] over ''y'' or the [[level set]] of ''y''.  The set of all the fibers over the elements of ''Y'' is a family of sets indexed by ''Y''.

For example, for the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the inverse image of {4} would be {−2, 2}. Again, if there is no risk of confusion, we may denote ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''B''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; by ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''), and think of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as a function from the power set of ''Y'' to the power set of ''X''. The notation ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt; should not be confused with that for [[inverse function]]. The notation coincides with the usual one, though, for bijections, in the sense that the inverse image of ''B'' under ''f'' is the image of ''B'' under ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==&lt;span id="Notation"&gt;Notation&lt;/span&gt; for image and inverse image==
The traditional notations used in the previous section can be confusing. An alternative&lt;ref&gt;Blyth 2005, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; is to give explicit names for the image and preimage as functions between powersets:

===Arrow notation===
* &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow(A) = \{ f(a)\;|\; a \in A\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow(B) = \{ a \in X \;|\; f(a) \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Star notation===
* &lt;math&gt;f_\star:\mathcal{P}(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f^\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^\star:\mathcal{P}(Y)\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f^\leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;

===Other terminology===
* An alternative notation for ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; used in [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] is ''f''&amp;nbsp;"''A''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Set Theory for the Mathematician | author=Jean E. Rubin |authorlink= Jean E. Rubin |page=xix | year=1967 |publisher=Holden-Day |asin=B0006BQH7S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Randall Holmes: [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8d8/5cdd3eb2fd9406d13b5c04d55708068031ef.pdf Inhomogeneity of the urelements in the usual models of NFU], December 29, 2005, on: Semantic Scholar, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some texts refer to the image of ''f'' as the range of ''f'', but this usage should be avoided because the word "range" is also commonly used to mean the [[codomain]] of ''f''.

==Examples==
# ''f'': {1, 2, 3} → {''a, b, c, d''} defined by &lt;math&gt;
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix}
      a, &amp; \mbox{if }x=1 \\
      a, &amp; \mbox{if }x=2 \\
      c, &amp; \mbox{if }x=3.
    \end{matrix}\right.
  &lt;/math&gt;{{paragraph break}} The ''image'' of the set {2, 3} under ''f'' is ''f''({2, 3}) = {''a, c''}.  The ''image'' of the function ''f'' is {''a, c''}. The ''preimage'' of ''a'' is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''a''}) = {1, 2}. The ''preimage'' of {''a, b''} is also {1, 2}.  The preimage of {''b'', ''d''} is the [[empty set]] {}.
# ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{paragraph break}} The ''image'' of {−2, 3} under ''f'' is ''f''({−2, 3}) = {4, 9}, and the ''image'' of ''f'' is '''R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The ''preimage'' of {4, 9} under ''f'' is ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({4, 9}) = {−3, −2, 2, 3}. The preimage of set ''N'' = {''n'' ∈ '''R''' | ''n'' &lt; 0} under ''f'' is the empty set, because the negative numbers do not have square roots in the set of reals.
# ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' defined by ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{paragraph break}} The [[Fiber (mathematics)|''fibres'']] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;({''a''}) are [[concentric circles]] about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], the origin itself, and the [[empty set]], depending on whether ''a'' &gt; 0, ''a'' = 0, or ''a'' &lt; 0, respectively.
# If ''M'' is a [[manifold]] and ''π'': ''TM'' → ''M'' is the canonical [[projection (mathematics)|projection]] from the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' to ''M'', then the ''fibres'' of ''π'' are the [[tangent spaces]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') for ''x''∈''M''. This is also an example of a [[fiber bundle]].
# A quotient group is a homomorphic image.

Given a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'', for all subsets ''A'', ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' and all subsets ''B'', ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' we have:

* ''f''(''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''))&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;ref&gt;Equality holds if ''B'' is a subset of Im(''f'') or, in particular, if ''f'' is surjective. See Munkres, J.. Topology (2000), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⇒ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊆ ''f''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

* ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''))&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;
* (''f''&amp;nbsp;|&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') = ''A'' ∩ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'').

The results relating images and preimages to the ([[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]]) algebra of [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] work for any collection of subsets, not just for pairs of subsets:
* &lt;math&gt;f\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}A_s\right) = \bigcup_{s\in S} f(A_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}A_s\right) \subseteq \bigcap_{s\in S} f(A_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{s\in S}B_s\right) = \bigcup_{s\in S} f^{-1}(B_s)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{s\in S}B_s\right) = \bigcap_{s\in S} f^{-1}(B_s)&lt;/math&gt;
(Here, ''S'' can be infinite, even [[uncountably infinite]].)

With respect to the algebra of subsets, by the above we see that the inverse image function is a [[lattice homomorphism]] while the image function is only a [[semilattice]] homomorphism (it does not always preserve intersections).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12642">In [[financial mathematics]], the '''implied volatility''' of an [[option (finance)|option]] contract is that value of the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the  underlying instrument which, when input in an [[Valuation of options|option pricing model]] (such as [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes]]) will return a theoretical value equal to the current market price of the option.  A non-option [[financial instrument]] that has embedded optionality, such as an [[interest rate cap]], can also have an implied volatility.  Implied volatility, a forward-looking and subjective measure, differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a [[security (finance)|security]]. To understand where Implied Volatility stands in terms of the underlying, '''implied volatility rank''' is used to understand its implied volatility from a one year high and low IV. 

==Motivation==

An option pricing model, such as [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes]], uses a variety of inputs to derive a theoretical value for an option. Inputs to pricing models vary depending on the type of option being priced and the pricing model used. However, in general, the value of an option depends on an estimate of the future realized price volatility, σ, of the [[underlying]]. Or, mathematically:

:&lt;math&gt;C = f(\sigma, \cdot) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the theoretical value of an option, and ''f'' is a pricing model that depends on σ, along with other inputs.

The function ''f'' is [[monotonically increasing]] in σ, meaning that a higher value for volatility results in a higher theoretical value of the option. Conversely, by the [[inverse function theorem]], there can be at most one value for σ that, when applied as an input to &lt;math&gt;f(\sigma, \cdot) \,&lt;/math&gt;, will result in a particular value for ''C''.

Put in other terms, assume that there is some inverse function ''g'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\bar{C} = g(\bar{C}, \cdot) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bar{C} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the market price for an option. The value &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\bar{C} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the volatility '''implied''' by the market price &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bar{C} \,&lt;/math&gt;, or the '''implied volatility'''.

In general, it is not possible to give a closed form formula for implied volatility in terms of call price. However, in some cases (large strike, low strike, short expiry, large expiry) it is possible to give an [[asymptotic expansion]] of implied volatility in terms of call price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1965977 Asymptotic Expansions of the Lognormal Implied Volatility], Grunspan, C. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

A [[European call option]], &lt;math&gt;C_{XYZ}&lt;/math&gt;, on one share of non-dividend-paying XYZ Corp. The option is struck at $50 and expires in 32 days. The [[risk-free interest rate]] is 5%. XYZ stock is currently trading at $51.25 and the current market price of &lt;math&gt;C_{XYZ}&lt;/math&gt; is $2.00. Using a standard Black–Scholes pricing model, the volatility implied by the market price &lt;math&gt;C_{XYZ}&lt;/math&gt; is 18.7%, or:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\bar{C} = g(\bar{C}, \cdot) = 18.7\%&lt;/math&gt;

To verify, we apply the implied volatility back into the pricing model, ''f'' and we generate a theoretical value of $2.0004:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{theo} = f(\sigma_\bar{C}, \cdot) = \$2.0004&lt;/math&gt;

which confirms our computation of the market implied volatility.

==Solving the inverse pricing model function==

In general, a pricing model function, ''f'', does not have a closed-form solution for its inverse, ''g''. Instead, a [[root finding]] technique is used to solve the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\sigma_\bar{C}, \cdot) - \bar{C} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

While there are many techniques for finding roots, two of the most commonly used are [[Newton's method]] and [[Brent's method]]. Because options prices can move very quickly, it is often important to use the most efficient method when calculating implied volatilities.

Newton's method provides rapid convergence; however, it requires the first partial derivative of the option's theoretical value with respect to volatility; i.e., &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial C}{\partial \sigma} \,&lt;/math&gt;, which is also known as ''vega'' (see [[Greeks (finance)|The Greeks]]). If the pricing model function yields a closed-form solution for ''vega'', which is the case for [[Black–Scholes model]], then Newton's method can be more efficient. However, for most practical pricing models, such as a [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial model]], this is not the case and ''vega'' must be derived numerically. When forced to solve for ''vega'' numerically, one can use the Christopher and Salkin method or, for more accurate calculation of out-of-the-money implied volatilities, one can use the Corrado-Miller model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akke|first1=Ronald|title=Implied Volatility Numerical Methods|url=http://www.ronakke.com/BSIV-Numerical-Methods.html|website=RonAkke.com|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implied volatility Parametrisation==

With the arrival of [[Big Data|Big Data]] and [[Data Science|Data Science]] parametrising the implied volatility has taken central importance for the sake of coherent interpolation and extrapolation purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahdavi-Damghani|first1=Babak|title=Introducing the Implied Volatility Surface Parametrization (IVP)|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2686138|website=SSRN.com|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The classic models are the [[SABR volatility model|SABR]]{{dn|date=September 2018}} and [[SVI|SVI]]{{dn|date=September 2018}} model with their IVP extension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahdavi-Damghani|first1=Babak|title=Introducing the Implied Volatility Surface Parametrization (IVP)|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2686138|website=SSRN.com|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Implied volatility as measure of relative value==

As stated by Brian Byrne, the implied volatility of an option is a more useful measure of the option's relative value than its price. The reason is that the price of an option depends most directly on the price of its underlying asset. If an option is held as part of a [[delta neutral]] portfolio (that is, a portfolio that is hedged against small moves in the underlying's price), then the next most important factor in determining the value of the option will be its implied volatility.
Implied volatility is so important that options are often quoted in terms of volatility rather than price, particularly between professional traders.

===Example===
A call option is trading at $1.50 with the [[underlying]] trading at $42.05. The implied volatility of the option is determined to be 18.0%. A short time later, the option is trading at $2.10 with the underlying at $43.34, yielding an implied volatility of 17.2%. Even though the option's price is higher at the second measurement, it is still considered cheaper based on volatility. 
The reason is that the underlying needed to hedge the call option can be sold for a higher price.

==As a price==
Another way to look at implied volatility is to think of it as a price, not as a measure of future stock moves.
In this view, it simply is a more convenient way to communicate option prices than currency. Prices are different in nature from statistical quantities: one can estimate volatility of future underlying returns using any of a large number of estimation methods; however, the number one gets is not a price. A price requires two counterparties, a buyer, and a seller. Prices are determined by supply and demand. Statistical estimates depend on the time-series and the mathematical structure of the model used. 
It is a mistake to confuse a price, which implies a transaction, with the result of a statistical estimation, which is merely what comes out of a calculation. Implied volatilities are prices: they have been derived from actual transactions. Seen in this light, it should not be surprising that implied volatilities might not conform to what a particular statistical model would predict.

However, the above view ignores the fact that the values of implied volatilities depend on the model used to calculate them: different models applied to the same market option prices will produce different implied volatilities. Thus, if one adopts this view of implied volatility as a price, then one also has to concede that there is no unique implied-volatility-price and that a buyer and a seller in the same transaction might be trading at different "prices".

==Non-constant implied volatility==
In general, options based on the same underlying but with different strike values and expiration times will yield different implied volatilities. This is generally viewed as evidence that an underlying's volatility is not constant but instead depends on factors such as the price level of the underlying, the underlying's recent price variance, and the passage of time. There exist few known parametrisation of the volatility surface (Schonbusher, SVI, and gSVI) as well as their de-arbitraging methodologies.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2013|title= De-arbitraging With a Weak Smile: Application to Skew Risk |journal=[[Wilmott]] |volume=2013 |issue=1 |pages=40–49 |doi= 10.1002/wilm.10201}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[stochastic volatility]] and [[volatility smile]] for more information.

==Volatility instruments==
Volatility instruments are financial instruments that track the value of implied volatility of other derivative securities. For instance, the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange|CBOE]] Volatility Index ([[VIX]]) is calculated from a weighted average of implied volatilities of various options on the S&amp;P 500 Index. There are also other commonly referenced volatility indices such as the VXN index (Nasdaq 100 index futures volatility measure), the QQV (QQQ volatility measure), [[IVX]] - Implied Volatility Index (an expected stock volatility over a future period for any of US securities and exchange-traded instruments), as well as options and futures derivatives based directly on these volatility indices themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">In [[mathematics]], '''Kuratowski convergence''' is a notion of [[Limit of a sequence|convergence]] for [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] (or, more generally, [[Net (mathematics)|nets]]) of [[compact space|compact subsets]] of [[metric space]]s, named after [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].  Intuitively, the Kuratowski limit of a sequence of sets is where the sets "[[limit point|accumulate]]".

==Definitions==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a [[metric space]], where ''X'' is a set and ''d'' is the function of distance between points of ''X''.

For any point ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and any [[non-empty]] compact subset ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;''X'', define the distance between the point and the subset:

:&lt;math&gt;d(x, A) = \inf \{ d(x, a) | a \in A \}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any sequence of such subsets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;''X'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''N''', the '''Kuratowski [[limit inferior]]''' (or '''lower closed limit''') of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{Li}}_{n \to \infty} A_{n} = \left\{ x \in X \left| \limsup_{n \to \infty} d(x, A_{n}) = 0 \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \left\{ x \in X \left| \begin{matrix} \mbox{for all open neighbourhoods } U \mbox{ of } x, \\ U \cap A_{n} \neq \emptyset \mbox{ for large enough } n \end{matrix} \right. \right\};&lt;/math&gt;

the '''Kuratowski limit superior''' (or '''upper closed limit''') of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{Ls}}_{n \to \infty} A_{n} = \left\{ x \in X \left| \liminf_{n \to \infty} d(x, A_{n}) = 0 \right. \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \left\{ x \in X \left| \begin{matrix} \mbox{for all open neighbourhoods } U \mbox{ of } x, \\ U \cap A_{n} \neq \emptyset \mbox{ for infinitely many } n \end{matrix} \right. \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Kuratowski limits inferior and superior agree (i.e. are the same subset of ''X''), then their common value is called the '''Kuratowski limit''' of the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; and denoted Lt&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;rarr;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The definitions for a general net of compact subsets of ''X'' go through ''mutatis mutandis''.

==Properties==

* Although it may seem counter-intuitive that the Kuratowski limit inferior involves the limit superior of the distances, and ''vice versa'', the nomenclature becomes more obvious when one sees that, for any sequence of sets,

::&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{Li}}_{n \to \infty} A_{n} \subseteq \mathop{\mathrm{Ls}}_{n \to \infty} A_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

: I.e. the limit inferior is the smaller set and the limit superior the larger one.

* The terms upper and lower closed limit stem from the fact that Li&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;rarr;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and Ls&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;rarr;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are always [[closed set]]s in the metric topology on (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'').

==Related Concepts==

For metric spaces ''X'' we have the following:
* Kuratowski convergence coincides with convergence in [[Fell topology (subsets)|Fell topology]].
* Kuratowski convergence is weaker than convergence in [[Vietoris topology]].
* Kuratowski convergence is weaker than convergence in [[Hausdorff metric]].
* For compact metric spaces ''X'', Kuratowski convergence coincides with both convergence in Hausdorff metric and Vietoris topology.

==Examples==

* Let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the zero set of sin(''nx'') as a function of ''x'' from '''R''' to itself

::&lt;math&gt;A_{n} = \big\{ x \in \mathbf{R} \big| \sin (n x) = 0 \big\}.&lt;/math&gt;

: Then ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges in the Kuratowski sense to the whole real line '''R'''. Observe that in this case, the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; do not need to be compact.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1911">'''LU reduction''' is an [[algorithm]] related to [[LU decomposition]]. This term is usually used in the context of [[super computing]] and highly [[parallel computing]]. In this context it is used as a [[benchmarking]] algorithm, i.e. to provide a comparative measurement of speed for different computers. LU reduction is a special parallelized version of an LU decomposition algorithm, an example can be found in (Guitart 2001). The parallelized version usually distributes the work for a matrix row to a single processor and synchronizes the result with the whole matrix (Escribano 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6085">In mathematics, the '''Malgrange preparation theorem''' is an analogue of the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]] for [[smooth function]]s. It was conjectured by [[René Thom]] and proved by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=B. |last=Malgrange|authorlink=Bernard Malgrange|year1=1962–1963|year2=1964|year3=1967}}.

==Statement of Malgrange preparation theorem==
Suppose that ''f''(''t'',''x'') is a smooth  complex function of ''t''∈'''R''' and ''x''∈'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  near the origin, and let ''k'' be the smallest integer such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(0,0)=0, {\partial f\over \partial t}(0,0)=0, \dots, {\partial^{k-1} f\over \partial t^{k-1}}(0,0)=0, {\partial^{k} f\over \partial t^{k}}(0,0)\ne0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then one form of the preparation theorem states that near the origin ''f'' can be written as the product of a smooth function ''c'' that is nonzero at the origin and a smooth function that as a function of ''t'' is a polynomial of degree ''k''. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;f(t,x) = c(t,x)\left(t^k+a_{k-1}(x)t^{k-1}+\cdots+a_0(x) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where the functions ''c'' and ''a'' are smooth and ''c'' is nonzero at the origin.

A second form of the theorem, occasionally called the '''Mather division theorem''', is a sort of "division with remainder" theorem: it says that if ''f'' and ''k''  satisfy the conditions above and ''g'' is a smooth function near the origin, then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;g=qf+r&lt;/math&gt;
where ''q'' and ''r'' are smooth, and as a function of ''t'', ''r'' is a polynomial of degree less than ''k''. This means that
:&lt;math&gt;r(x)=\sum_{0\le j&lt;k}t^jr_j(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for some smooth functions ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').

The two forms of the theorem easily imply each other: the first form is the special case of the "division with remainder"  form where ''g'' is ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the division with remainder form follows from the first form of the theorem as we may assume that ''f'' as a function of ''t'' is a polynomial of degree ''k''.

If the functions ''f'' and ''g'' are real, then the functions ''c'', ''a'', ''q'', and ''r'' can also be taken to be real. In the case of the Weierstrass preparation theorem these functions are uniquely determined by ''f'' and ''g'', but uniqueness no longer holds for the Malgrange preparation theorem.

==Proof of Malgrange preparation theorem==
The Malgrange preparation theorem can be deduced from the Weierstrass preparation theorem. The obvious way of doing this does not work: although smooth functions have a formal power series expansion at the origin, and the Weierstrass preparation theorem applies to formal power series, the formal power series will not usually converge to smooth functions near the origin. Instead one can use the idea of decomposing a smooth function as a sum of analytic functions by applying a partition of unity to its Fourier transform.
For a proof along these lines see {{harv|Mather|1968}} or {{harv|Hörmander|1983a|loc=section 7.5}}

==Algebraic version of the Malgrange preparation theorem==
The Malgrange preparation theorem can be restated as a theorem about [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] of smooth, real-valued [[sheaf (mathematics)|germs]].  If ''X'' is a [[manifold]], with ''p''∈''X'', let ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') denote the ring of real-valued germs of smooth functions at ''p'' on ''X''.  Let ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') denote the unique [[maximal ideal]] of ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), consisting of germs which vanish at p.&amp;nbsp;Let ''A'' be a ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')-module, and let ''f'':''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' be a smooth function between manifolds.  Let ''q'' = ''f''(''p'').  ''f'' induces a ring homomorphism ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;:''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(Y)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') by composition on the right with ''f''.  Thus we can view ''A'' as a ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')-module.  Then the Malgrange preparation theorem says that if ''A'' is a finitely-generated ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')-module, then ''A'' is a finitely-generated ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')-module if and only if ''A''/''M''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')A is a finite-dimensional real vector space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7491">The '''Mason–Stothers theorem''', or simply '''Mason's theorem''', is a mathematical [[theorem]] about [[polynomials]], analogous to the [[abc conjecture|''abc'' conjecture]] for integers. It is named after {{Interlanguage link multi|W. Wilson Stothers|nl|3=Walter Wilson Stothers}}, who published it in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=W. W.|last=Stothers|title=Polynomial identities and hauptmoduln|journal=Quarterly J. Math. Oxford|series=2|volume=32|year=1981|pages=349–370 |doi=10.1093/qmath/32.3.349}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[R. C. Mason]], who rediscovered it shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mason|first=R. C.|title=Diophantine Equations over Function Fields|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series|volume=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem states:
:Let {{math|''a''(''t'')}}, {{math|''b''(''t'')}}, and {{math|''c''(''t'')}} be [[relatively prime polynomials]] over a field such that {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''}} and such that not all of them have vanishing derivative. Then
::&lt;math&gt;\max\{\deg(a),\deg(b),\deg(c)\} \le \deg(\operatorname{rad}(abc))-1.&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|rad(''f'')}} is the product of the distinct irreducible factors of {{mvar|f}}. For algebraically closed fields it is the polynomial of minimum degree that has the same [[Root of a function|root]]s as {{mvar|f}}; in this case {{math|deg(rad(''f''))}} gives the number of distinct roots of {{mvar|f}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lang, Serge | authorlink = Serge Lang | title = Algebra| publisher = Springer-Verlag | location =New York, Berlin, Heidelberg | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-387-95385-X|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

*Over fields of characteristic 0 the condition that {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} do not all have vanishing derivative is equivalent to the condition that they are not all constant. Over fields of characteristic {{math|''p'' &gt; 0}} it is not enough to assume that they are not all constant. For example, the identity {{math|1=''t''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = (''t'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} gives an example where the maximum degree of the three polynomials ({{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} as the summands on the left hand side, and {{mvar|c}} as the right hand side) is {{mvar|p}}, but the degree of the radical is only&amp;nbsp;{{math|2}}.
*Taking {{math|1=''a''(''t'') = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|1=''c''(''t'') = (''t''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} gives an example where equality holds in the Mason–Stothers theorem, showing that the inequality is in some sense the best possible.
*A corollary of the Mason–Stothers theorem is the analog of [[Fermat's last theorem]] for function fields: if {{math|1= ''a''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}} relatively prime polynomials over a field of characteristic not dividing {{mvar|n}}  and {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}} then either at least one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, or {{mvar|c}} is 0 or they are all constant.

==Proof==
{{harvtxt|Snyder|2000}} gave the following elementary proof of the Mason–Stothers theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mr=1781918 |doi=10.1007/s000170050074
|last=Snyder|first= Noah
|title=An alternate proof of Mason's theorem
|journal=Elemente der Mathematik |volume=55 |year=2000|issue=3|pages= 93–94|url=http://cr.yp.to/bib/2000/snyder.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Step 1. The condition {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' = 0}} implies that the [[Wronskian]]s {{math|1=''W''(''a'', ''b'') = ''ab''′ − ''a''′''b''}}, {{math|''W''(''b'', ''c'')}}, and {{math|''W''(''c'', ''a'')}} are all equal. Write {{mvar|W}} for their common value.

Step 2. The condition that at least one of the derivatives {{math|''a''′}}, {{math|''b''′}}, or {{math|''c''′}} is nonzero and that {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are coprime is used to show that {{mvar|W}} is nonzero.
For example, if {{math|1=''W'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''ab''′ = ''a''′''b''}} so {{mvar|a}} divides {{math|''a''′}} (as {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are coprime) so {{math|1=''a''′ = 0}} (as {{math|deg ''a'' &gt; deg ''a''′}} unless {{mvar|a}} is constant).

Step 3. {{mvar|W}} is divisible by each of the greatest common divisors {{math|(''a'', ''a''′)}}, {{math|(''b'', ''b''′)}}, and {{math|(''c'', ''c''′)}}. Since these are coprime it is divisible by their product, and since {{mvar|W}} is nonzero we get
:{{math|deg (''a'', ''a''′) + deg (''b'', ''b''′) + deg (''c'', ''c''′) ≤ deg ''W''.}}

Step 4. Substituting in the inequalities
:{{math|deg (''a'', ''a''′) ≥ deg ''a''}} − (number of distinct roots of {{mvar|a}})
:{{math|deg (''b'', ''b''′) ≥ deg ''b''}} − (number of distinct roots of {{mvar|b}})
:{{math|deg (''c'', ''c''′) ≥ deg ''c''}} − (number of distinct roots of {{mvar|c}})
(where the roots are taken in some algebraic closure) and
:{{math|deg ''W'' ≤ deg ''a'' + deg ''b'' − 1 }}
we find that
:{{math|deg ''c'' ≤ (number of distinct roots of ''abc'')  − 1}}
which is what we needed to prove.

==Generalizations==
There is a natural generalization in which the ring of polynomials is replaced by a one-dimensional [[Algebraic function field|function field]].
Let {{mvar|k}} be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, let {{math|''C/k''}} be a [[Projective variety|smooth projective curve]]
of [[Geometric genus|genus]] {{mvar|g}}, let
::&lt;math&gt; a,b\in k(C)&lt;/math&gt; be rational functions on {{mvar|C}} satisfying &lt;math&gt;a+b=1&lt;/math&gt;,
and let
{{mvar|S}} be a set of points in {{math|''C''(''k'')}} containing all of the zeros and poles of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}.
Then
::&lt;math&gt; \max\bigl\{ \deg(a),\deg(b) \bigr\} \le \max\bigl\{|S| + 2g - 2,0\bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the degree of a function in {{math|''k''(''C'')}} is the degree of
the map it induces from {{mvar|C}} to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
This was proved by Mason, with an alternative short proof published the same year by [[Joseph H. Silverman|J. H. Silverman]]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=J. H.|last=Silverman|title=The S-unit equation over function fields|journal=Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc.|volume=95|year=1984|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a further generalization, due independently to [[José Felipe Voloch|J. F. Voloch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=J. F.|last=Voloch|title=Diagonal equations over function fields|journal=Bol. Soc. Brasil. Mat.|volume=16|year=1985|pages=29–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to
[[W. Dale Brownawell|W. D. Brownawell]] and [[David Masser|D. W. Masser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=W. D.|last=Brownawell|first2=D. W.|last2=Masser|title=Vanishing sums in function fields|journal=Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc.|volume=100|year=1986|pages=427–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;
that gives an upper bound for  {{mvar|n}}-variable {{mvar|S}}-unit
equations {{math|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}} provided that
no subset of the {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{mvar|k}}-linearly dependent. Under this assumption, they prove that
::&lt;math&gt; \max\bigl\{ \deg(a_1),\ldots,\deg(a_n) \bigr\} \le \frac{1}{2}n(n-1)\max\bigl\{|S| + 2g - 2,0\bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the [[area]] of the region between the graph of the function and the {{mvar|x}}-axis, the '''double integral''' of a positive function of two variables represents the [[volume]] of the region between the surface defined by the function (on the three-dimensional [[Cartesian plane]] where {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}) and the plane which contains its [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]]. &lt;ref name = "Stewart" /&gt; If there are more variables, a multiple integral will yield [[hypervolume]]s of multidimensional functions.

Multiple integration of a function in {{mvar|n}} variables: {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} over a domain {{mvar|D}} is most commonly represented by nested integral signs in the reverse order of execution (the leftmost integral sign is computed last), followed by the function and integrand arguments in proper order (the integral with respect to the rightmost argument is computed last). The domain of integration is either represented symbolically for every argument over each integral sign, or is abbreviated by a variable at the rightmost integral sign:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson |last2=Edwards |date=2014 |title=Multivariable Calculus |edition=10th |publisher=Cengage Learning |ISBN= 978-1-285-08575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int \cdots \int_\mathbf{D}\, f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \,dx_1 \!\cdots dx_n &lt;/math&gt;

Since the concept of an [[antiderivative]] is only defined for functions of a single real variable, the usual definition of the [[indefinite integral]] does not immediately extend to the multiple integral.

==Mathematical definition==
For {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, consider a so-called "half-open" {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[Hyperrectangle|hyperrectangular]] domain {{mvar|T}}, defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;T= [ a_1, b_1) \times [ a_2, b_2) \times \cdots \times [ a_n, b_n) \subseteq \mathbf{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

[[partition (set theory)|Partition]] each interval {{math|[''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} into a finite family {{mvar|I&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} of non-overlapping subintervals {{mvar|i&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, with each subinterval closed at the left end, and open at the right end.

Then the finite family of subrectangles {{mvar|C}} given by

:&lt;math&gt;C=I_1\times I_2\times \cdots \times I_n&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[partition (set theory)|partition]] of {{mvar|T}}; that is, the subrectangles {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} are non-overlapping and their union is {{mvar|T}}.

Let {{math|''f'' : ''T'' → '''R'''}} be a function defined on {{mvar|T}}. Consider a partition {{mvar|C}} of {{mvar|T}} as defined above, such that {{mvar|C}} is a family of {{mvar|m}} subrectangles {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} and

:&lt;math&gt;T=C_1\cup C_2\cup \cdots \cup C_m&lt;/math&gt;

We can approximate the total {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}th-dimensional volume bounded below by the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional hyperrectangle {{mvar|T}} and above by the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional graph of {{mvar|f}} with the following [[Riemann sum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^m f(P_k)\, \operatorname{m}(C_k)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a point in {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|m(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the product of the lengths of the intervals whose Cartesian product is {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also known as the measure of {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The '''diameter''' of a subrectangle {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the largest of the lengths of the intervals whose [[Cartesian product]] is {{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The diameter of a given partition of {{mvar|T}} is defined as the largest of the diameters of the subrectangles in the partition. Intuitively, as the diameter of the partition {{mvar|C}} is restricted smaller and smaller, the number of subrectangles {{mvar|m}} gets larger, and the measure {{math|m(''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of each subrectangle grows smaller. The function {{mvar|f}} is said to be '''Riemann integrable''' if the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;S=\lim_{\delta \to 0} \sum_{k=1}^m f(P_k)\, \operatorname{m}\, (C_k)&lt;/math&gt;

exists, where the limit is taken over all possible partitions of {{mvar|T}} of diameter at most {{mvar|δ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudin |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Rudin |title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis |series=Walter Rudin Student Series in Advanced Mathematics |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw–Hill |isbn=978-0-07-054235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is Riemann integrable, {{mvar|S}} is called the '''Riemann integral''' of {{mvar|f}} over {{mvar|T}} and is denoted

:&lt;math&gt; \int \cdots \int_T\, f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \,dx_1 \!\cdots dx_n &lt;/math&gt;

Frequently this notation is abbreviated as

: &lt;math&gt;\int_T\!f(\mathbf{x})\,d^n\mathbf{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''x'''}} represents the {{mvar|n}}-tuple {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and {{math|''d''{{isup|''n''}}'''x'''}} is the {{math|n}}-dimensional volume [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]].

The Riemann integral of a function defined over an arbitrary bounded {{math|n}}-dimensional set can be defined by extending that function to a function defined over a half-open rectangle whose values are zero outside the domain of the original function. Then the integral of the original function over the original domain is defined to be the integral of the extended function over its rectangular domain, if it exists.

In what follows the Riemann integral in {{math|n}} dimensions will be called the '''multiple integral'''.

===Properties===
Multiple integrals have many properties common to those of integrals of functions of one variable (linearity, commutativity, monotonicity, and so on). One important property of multiple integrals is that the value of an integral is independent of the order of integrands under certain conditions. This property is popularly known as [[Fubini's theorem]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones |first=Frank |date=2001 |title=Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |pages=527–529 |ISBN=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particular cases===
In the case of {{math|''T'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the integral

:&lt;math&gt; l = \iint_T f(x,y)\, dx\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

is the '''double integral''' of {{mvar|f}} on {{mvar|T}}, and if {{math|''T'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} the integral

:&lt;math&gt; l = \iiint_T f(x,y,z)\, dx\, dy\, dz&lt;/math&gt;

is the '''triple integral''' of {{mvar|f}} on {{mvar|T}}.

Notice that, by convention, the double integral has two integral signs, and the triple integral has three; this is a notational convention which is convenient when computing a multiple integral as an iterated integral, as shown later in this article.

==Methods of integration==
The resolution of problems with multiple integrals consists, in most cases, of finding a way to reduce the multiple integral to an [[iterated integral]], a series of integrals of one variable, each being directly solvable. For continuous functions, this is justified by [[Fubini's theorem]]. Sometimes, it is possible to obtain the result of the integration by direct examination without any calculations.

The following are some simple methods of integration:&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt;

===Integrating constant functions===
When the integrand is a [[constant function]] {{mvar|c}}, the integral is equal to the product of {{mvar|c}} and the measure of the domain of integration. If {{math|''c'' {{=}} 1}} and the domain is a subregion of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the integral gives the area of the region, while if the domain is a subregion of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the integral gives the volume of the region.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example.''' Let {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 2}} and

:&lt;math&gt;D = \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbf{R}^2 \ : \ 2 \le x \le 4 \ ; \ 3 \le y \le 6 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\int_3^6 \int_2^4 \ 2 \ dx\, dy =2\int_3^6 \int_2^4 \ 1 \ dx\, dy= 2\cdot\mbox{area}(D) = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot 3) = 12&lt;/math&gt;,

since by definition we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_3^6 \int_2^4 \ 1 \ dx\, dy=\mbox{area}(D).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Use of symmetry===
When the domain of integration is symmetric about the origin with respect to at least one of the variables of integration and the integrand is [[even and odd functions|odd]] with respect to this variable, the integral is equal to zero, as the integrals over the two halves of the domain have the same absolute value but opposite signs. When the integrand is [[even and odd functions|even]] with respect to this variable, the integral is equal to twice the integral over one half of the domain, as the integrals over the two halves of the domain are equal.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 1.''' Consider the function {{math|''f''(''x'',''y'') {{=}} 2 sin(''x'') − 3''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 5}} integrated over the domain

:&lt;math&gt;T=\left \{ ( x,y) \in \mathbf{R}^2 \ : \ x^2+y^2\le 1 \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

a disc with [[radius]]&amp;nbsp;1 centered at the origin with the boundary included.

Using the linearity property, the integral can be decomposed into three pieces:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_T \left(2\sin x - 3y^3 + 5\right) \, dx \, dy = \iint_T 2 \sin x \, dx \, dy - \iint_T 3y^3 \, dx \, dy + \iint_T 5 \, dx \, dy&lt;/math&gt;

The function {{math|2 sin(''x'')}} is an odd function in the variable {{mvar|x}} and the disc {{mvar|T}} is symmetric with respect to the {{mvar|y}}-axis, so the value of the first integral is 0. Similarly, the function {{math|3''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an odd function of {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|T}} is symmetric with respect to the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and so the only contribution to the final result is that of the third integral. Therefore the original integral is equal to the area of the disk times 5, or 5{{pi}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 2.''' Consider the function {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} ''x'' exp(''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and as integration region the [[sphere]] with radius 2 centered at the origin,
:&lt;math&gt;T = \left \{ ( x,y, z) \in \mathbf{R}^3 \ : \ x^2+y^2+z^2 \le 4 \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;
The "ball" is symmetric about all three axes, but it is sufficient to integrate with respect to {{mvar|x}}-axis to show that the integral is 0, because the function is an odd function of that variable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Normal domains on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}===
{{See also|Order of integration (calculus)}}
This method is applicable to any domain {{mvar|D}} for which:
* the [[Orthographic projection|projection]] of {{mvar|D}} onto either the {{mvar|x}}-axis or the {{mvar|y}}-axis is bounded by the two values, {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}
* any line perpendicular to this axis that passes between these two values intersects the domain in an interval whose endpoints are given by the graphs of two functions, {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}}.
Such a domain will be here called a ''normal domain''.  Elsewhere in the literature, normal domains are sometimes called type I or type II domains, depending on which axis the domain is fibred over.  In all cases, the function to be integrated must be Riemann integrable on the domain, which is true (for instance) if the function is continuous.

===={{mvar|x}}-axis====
If the domain {{mvar|D}} is normal with respect to the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and {{math|''f'' : ''D'' → '''R'''}} is a [[continuous function]]; then {{math|''α''(''x'')}} and {{math|''β''(''x'')}} (both of which are defined on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}) are the two functions that determine {{mvar|D}}. Then, by Fubini's theorem:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Calculus, 8th Edition|last=Stewart|first=James|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=978-1285740621|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D f(x,y)\, dx\, dy = \int_a^b dx \int_{ \alpha (x)}^{ \beta (x)} f(x,y)\, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

===={{mvar|y}}-axis====
If {{mvar|D}} is normal with respect to the {{mvar|y}}-axis and {{math|''f'' : ''D'' → '''R'''}} is a continuous function; then {{math|''α''(''y'')}} and {{math|''β''(''y'')}} (both of which are defined on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}) are the two functions that determine {{mvar|D}}. Again, by Fubini's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D f(x,y)\, dx\, dy = \int_a^b dy \int_{\alpha (y)}^{ \beta (y)} f(x,y)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

====Normal domains on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}====
If {{mvar|T}} is a domain that is normal with respect to the {{mvar|xy}}-plane and determined by the functions {{math|''α''(''x'', ''y'')}} and {{math|''β''(''x'', ''y'')}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_T f(x,y,z) \, dx\, dy\, dz = \iint_D \int_{\alpha (x,y)}^{\beta (x,y)} f(x,y,z) \, dz\, dx\, dy&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is the same for the other five normality cases on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  It can be generalized in a straightforward way to domains in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Change of variables===
{{See also|Integration by substitution#Substitution for multiple variables}}

The limits of integration are often not easily interchangeable (without normality or with complex formulae to integrate). One makes a [[change of variables]] to rewrite the integral in a more "comfortable" region, which can be described in simpler formulae. To do so, the function must be adapted to the new coordinates.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 1a.''' The function is {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} (''x'' − 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{sqrt|''y''}}}}; if one adopts the substitution {{math|''x''′ {{=}} ''x'' − 1}}, {{math|''y''′ {{=}} ''y''}} therefore {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''′ + 1}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''y''′}} one obtains the new function {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} (''x''′)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{sqrt|''y''}}}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Similarly for the domain because it is delimited by the original variables that were transformed before ({{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in example).
* the differentials {{mvar|dx}} and {{mvar|dy}} transform via the absolute value of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|determinant of the Jacobian matrix]] containing the partial derivatives of the transformations regarding the new variable (consider, as an example, the differential transformation in polar coordinates).

There exist three main "kinds" of changes of variable (one in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, two in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}); however, more general substitutions can be made using the same principle.

====Polar coordinates====
{{See also|Polar coordinate system}}
[[File:Passaggio in coordinate polari.svg|thumb|270px|right|Transformation from cartesian to polar coordinates.]]
In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} if the domain has a circular symmetry and the function has some particular characteristics one can apply the ''transformation to polar coordinates'' (see the example in the picture) which means that the generic points {{math|''P''(''x'', ''y'')}} in Cartesian coordinates switch to their respective points in polar coordinates. That allows one to change the shape of the domain and simplify the operations.

The fundamental relation to make the transformation is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) \rightarrow f(\rho \cos \varphi,\rho \sin \varphi ).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 2a.''' The function is {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''x'' + ''y''}} and applying the transformation one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;f(\rho, \varphi) = \rho \cos \varphi + \rho \sin \varphi = \rho(\cos \varphi + \sin \varphi ).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 2b.''' The function is {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, in this case one has:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\rho, \varphi) = \rho^2 \left(\cos^2 \varphi + \sin^2 \varphi\right) = \rho^2&lt;/math&gt;
using the [[Pythagorean trigonometric identity]] (very useful to simplify this operation).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The transformation of the domain is made by defining the radius' crown length and the amplitude of the described angle to define the {{math|''ρ'', ''φ''}} intervals starting from {{math|''x'', ''y''}}.
[[File:Esempio trasformazione dominio da cartesiano polare.svg|thumb|230px|right|Example of a domain transformation from cartesian to polar.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 2c.''' The domain is {{math|''D'' {{=}} {''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 4&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, that is a circumference of radius 2; it's evident that the covered angle is the circle angle, so {{mvar|φ}} varies from 0 to 2{{pi}}, while the crown radius varies from 0 to 2 (the crown with the inside radius null is just a circle).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 2d.''' The domain is {{math|''D'' {{=}} {''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 9, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ 4, ''y'' ≥ 0&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, that is the circular crown in the positive {{mvar|y}} half-plane (please see the picture in the example); {{mvar|φ}} describes a plane angle while {{mvar|ρ}} varies from 2 to 3. Therefore the transformed domain will be the following [[rectangle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \{ 2 \le \rho \le 3, \ 0 \le \varphi \le \pi \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Jacobian determinant]] of that transformation is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (\rho, \varphi)} = \begin{vmatrix} \cos \varphi &amp; - \rho \sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi &amp; \rho \cos \varphi \end{vmatrix} = \rho&lt;/math&gt;

which has been obtained by inserting the partial derivatives of {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ρ'' cos(''φ'')}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''ρ'' sin(''φ'')}} in the first column respect to {{mvar|ρ}} and in the second respect to {{mvar|φ}}, so the {{mvar|dx dy}} differentials in this transformation become {{mvar|ρ dρ dφ}}.

Once the function is transformed and the domain evaluated, it is possible to define the formula for the change of variables in polar coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D f(x,y) \, dx\, dy = \iint_T f(\rho \cos \varphi, \rho \sin \varphi) \rho \, d \rho\, d \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

{{mvar|φ}} is valid in the {{math|[0, 2π]}} interval while {{mvar|ρ}}, which is a measure of a length, can only have positive values.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 2e.''' The function is {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''x''}} and the domain is the same as in Example 2d. From the previous analysis of {{mvar|D}} we know the intervals of {{mvar|ρ}} (from 2 to 3) and of {{mvar|φ}} (from 0 to {{pi}}). Now we change the function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x \longrightarrow f(\rho,\varphi) = \rho \cos \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

finally let's apply the integration formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D x \, dx\, dy = \iint_T \rho \cos \varphi \rho \, d\rho\, d\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Once the intervals are known, you have

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\pi \int_2^3 \rho^2 \cos \varphi \, d \rho \, d \varphi = \int_0^\pi \cos \varphi \ d \varphi \left[ \frac{\rho^3}{3} \right]_2^3 = \Big[ \sin \varphi \Big]_0^\pi \ \left(9 - \frac{8}{3} \right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Cylindrical coordinates====
[[File:Cylindrical Coordinates.svg|thumb|right|190px|Cylindrical coordinates.]]
In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} the integration on domains with a circular base can be made by the ''passage to [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]''; the transformation of the function is made by the following relation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) \rightarrow f(\rho \cos \varphi, \rho \sin \varphi, z)&lt;/math&gt;

The domain transformation can be graphically attained, because only the shape of the base varies, while the height follows the shape of the starting region.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 3a.''' The region is {{math|''D'' {{=}} {''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 9, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ 4, 0 ≤ ''z'' ≤ 5&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} (that is the "tube" whose base is the circular crown of Example 2d and whose height is 5); if the transformation is applied, this region is obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \{ 2 \le \rho \le 3, \ 0 \le \varphi \le 2 \pi, \ 0 \le z \le 5 \}&lt;/math&gt;
(that is, the parallelepiped whose base is similar to the rectangle in Example 2d and whose height is 5).

Because the {{mvar|z}} component is unvaried during the transformation, the {{mvar|dx dy dz}} differentials vary as in the passage to polar coordinates: therefore, they become {{mvar|ρ dρ dφ dz}}.

Finally, it is possible to apply the final formula to cylindrical coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_D f(x,y,z) \, dx\, dy\, dz = \iiint_T f(\rho \cos \varphi, \rho \sin \varphi, z) \rho \, d\rho\, d\varphi\, dz.&lt;/math&gt;

This method is convenient in case of cylindrical or conical domains or in regions where it is easy to individuate the ''z'' interval and even transform the circular base and the function.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 3b.''' The function is {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''}} and as integration domain this [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]: {{math|''D'' {{=}} {''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 9, −5 ≤ ''z'' ≤ 5 &lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. The transformation of {{mvar|D}} in cylindrical coordinates is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \{ 0 \le \rho \le 3, \ 0 \le \varphi \le 2 \pi, \ -5 \le z \le 5 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

while the function becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f(\rho \cos \varphi, \rho \sin \varphi, z) = \rho^2 + z&lt;/math&gt;

Finally one can apply the integration formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_D \left(x^2 + y^2 +z\right) \, dx\, dy\, dz = \iiint_T \left( \rho^2 + z\right) \rho \, d\rho\, d\varphi\, dz;&lt;/math&gt;

developing the formula you have

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-5}^5 dz \int_0^{2 \pi} d\varphi \int_0^3 \left( \rho^3 + \rho z \right)\, d\rho = 2 \pi \int_{-5}^5 \left[ \frac{\rho^4}{4} + \frac{\rho^2 z}{2} \right]_0^3 \, dz = 2 \pi \int_{-5}^5 \left( \frac{81}{4} + \frac{9}{2} z\right)\, dz = \cdots = 405 \pi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Spherical coordinates====
[[File:Spherical Coordinates (Colatitude, Longitude).svg|thumb|right|190px|Spherical coordinates.]]
In {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} some domains have a spherical symmetry, so it's possible to specify the coordinates of every point of the integration region by two angles and one distance. It's possible to use therefore the ''passage to [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]''; the function is transformed by this relation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) \longrightarrow f(\rho \cos \theta \sin \varphi, \rho \sin \theta \sin \varphi, \rho \cos \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

Points on the {{mvar|z}}-axis do not have a precise characterization in spherical coordinates, so {{mvar|θ}} can vary between 0 and 2{{pi}}.

The better integration domain for this passage is obviously the sphere.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 4a.''' The domain is {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 16}} (sphere with radius 4 and center at the origin); applying the transformation you get the region
:&lt;math&gt;T = \{ 0 \le \rho \le 4, \ 0 \le \varphi \le \pi, \ 0 \le \theta \le 2 \pi \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Jacobian determinant of this transformation is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial (x,y,z)}{\partial (\rho, \theta, \varphi)} = \begin{vmatrix}
\cos \theta \sin \varphi &amp; - \rho \sin \theta \sin \varphi &amp; \rho \cos \theta \cos \varphi \\
\sin \theta \sin \varphi &amp; \rho \cos \theta \sin \varphi &amp; \rho \sin \theta \cos \varphi \\
\cos \varphi &amp; 0 &amp; - \rho \sin \varphi \end{vmatrix} = \rho^2 \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

The {{mvar|dx dy dz}} differentials therefore are transformed to {{math|''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin(''φ'') ''dρ'' ''dθ'' ''dφ''}}.

This yields the final integration formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_D f(x,y,z) \, dx\, dy\, dz = \iiint_T f(\rho \sin \varphi \cos \theta, \rho \sin \varphi \sin \theta, \rho \cos \varphi) \rho^2 \sin \varphi \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is better to use this method in case of spherical domains '''and''' in case of functions that can be easily simplified by the first fundamental relation of trigonometry extended to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} (see Example 4b); in other cases it can be better to use cylindrical coordinates (see Example 4c).

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_T f(a,b,c) \rho^2 \sin \varphi \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

The extra {{math|''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|sin ''φ''}} come from the Jacobian.

In the following examples the roles of {{mvar|φ}} and {{mvar|θ}} have been reversed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 4b.''' {{mvar|D}} is the same region as in Example 4a and {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the function to integrate. Its transformation is very easy:

:&lt;math&gt;f(\rho \sin \varphi \cos \theta, \rho \sin \varphi \sin \theta, \rho \cos \varphi) = \rho^2,&lt;/math&gt;

while we know the intervals of the transformed region {{mvar|T}} from {{mvar|D}}:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\{0 \le \rho \le 4, \ 0 \le \varphi \le \pi, \ 0 \le \theta \le 2 \pi\}.&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore apply the integration formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_D \left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right) \, dx\, dy\, dz = \iiint_T \rho^2 \, \rho^2 \sin \theta \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

and, developing, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_T \rho^4 \sin \theta \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi = \int_0^{\pi} \sin \varphi \,d\varphi \int_0^4 \rho^4 d \rho \int_0^{2 \pi} d\theta = 2 \pi \int_0^{\pi} \sin \varphi \left[ \frac{\rho^5}{5} \right]_0^4 \, d \varphi = 2 \pi \left[ \frac{\rho^5}{5} \right]_0^4 \Big[- \cos \varphi \Big]_0^{\pi} = \frac{4096 \pi}{5}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Example 4c.''' The domain {{mvar|D}} is the ball with center at the origin and radius {{math|3''a''}},

:&lt;math&gt;D = \left \{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 9a^2 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the function to integrate.

Looking at the domain, it seems convenient to adopt the passage to spherical coordinates, in fact, the intervals of the variables that delimit the new {{mvar|T}} region are obviously:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\{0 \le \rho \le 3a, \ 0 \le \varphi \le 2 \pi, \ 0 \le \theta \le \pi\}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, applying the transformation, we get

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 \longrightarrow \rho^2 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \varphi + \rho^2 \sin^2 \theta \sin^2 \varphi = \rho^2 \sin^2 \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying the formula for integration we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_T \rho^2 \sin^2 \theta \rho^2 \sin \theta \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi = \iiint_T \rho^4 \sin^3 \theta \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

which is very hard to solve. This problem will be solved by using the passage to cylindrical coordinates. The new {{mvar|T}} intervals are

:&lt;math&gt;T=\left\{0 \le \rho \le 3a, \ 0 \le \varphi \le 2 \pi, \ - \sqrt{9a^2 - \rho^2} \le z \le \sqrt{9a^2 - \rho^2}\right\};&lt;/math&gt;

the {{mvar|z}} interval has been obtained by dividing the ball into two [[sphere|hemisphere]]s simply by solving the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] from the formula of {{mvar|D}} (and then directly transforming {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} into {{math|''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The new function is simply {{math|''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Applying the integration formula

:&lt;math&gt;\iiint_T \rho^2 \rho \ d \rho d \varphi dz&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \int_0^{2\pi} d\varphi \int_0^{3a} \rho^3 d\rho \int_{-\sqrt{9a^2 - \rho^2}}^{\sqrt{9 a^2 - \rho^2}}\, dz &amp;= 2 \pi \int_0^{3a} 2 \rho^3 \sqrt{9 a^2 - \rho^2} \, d\rho \\
&amp;= -2 \pi \int_{9 a^2}^0 (9 a^2 - t) \sqrt{t}\, dt &amp;&amp; t = 9 a^2 - \rho^2 \\
&amp;= 2 \pi \int_0^{9 a^2} \left ( 9 a^2 \sqrt{t} - t \sqrt{t} \right ) \, dt \\
&amp;= 2 \pi \left( \int_0^{9 a^2} 9 a^2 \sqrt{t} \, dt - \int_0^{9 a^2} t \sqrt{t} \, dt\right) \\
&amp;= 2 \pi \left[9 a^2 \frac23 t^{ \frac32 } - \frac{2}{5} t^{ \frac{5}{2}} \right]_0^{9 a^2} \\
&amp;= 2 \cdot 27 \pi a^5 \left ( 6 - \frac{18}{5} \right ) \\
&amp;= \frac{648 \pi}{5} a^5. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thanks to the passage to cylindrical coordinates it was possible to reduce the triple integral to an easier one-variable integral.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See also the differential volume entry in [[nabla in cylindrical and spherical coordinates]].

==Examples==

=== Double integral over a rectangle ===
Let us assume that we wish to integrate a multivariable function {{mvar|f}} over a region {{mvar|A}}:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \left \{ (x,y) \in \mathbf{R}^2 \ : \ 11 \le x \le 14 \ ; \ 7 \le y \le 10 \right \} \mbox{ and } f(x,y) = x^2 + 4y\,&lt;/math&gt;

From this we formulate the iterated integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_7^{10} \int_{11}^{14} (x^2 + 4y) \, dx\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

The inner integral is performed first, integrating with respect to {{mvar|x}} and taking {{mvar|y}} as a constant, as it is not the [[variable of integration]]. The result of this integral, which is a function depending only on {{mvar|y}}, is then integrated with respect to {{mvar|y}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{11}^{14} \left(x^2 + 4y\right) \, dx &amp; = \left [\frac13 x^3 + 4yx \right]_{x=11}^{x=14} \\
&amp;= \frac13(14)^3 + 4y(14) - \frac13(11)^3 - 4y(11) \\
&amp;= 471 + 12y \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We then integrate the result with respect to {{mvar|y}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_7^{10} (471 + 12y) \ dy &amp; = \Big[471y + 6y^2\Big]_{y=7}^{y=10} \\
&amp;= 471(10)+ 6(10)^2 - 471(7) - 6(7)^2 \\
&amp;= 1719 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, the order of integration is interchangeable, that is, integrating with respect to ''x'' first and integrating with respect to ''y'' first produce the same result.  For example, doing the previous calculation with order reversed gives the same result:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\int_{11}^{14} \int_{7}^{10} \, \left(x^2 + 4y\right) \, dy\, dx &amp; = \int_{11}^{14} \Big[x^2 y + 2y^2 \Big]_{y=7}^{y=10} \, dx \\
&amp;= \int_{11}^{14} \, (3x^2 + 102) \, dx \\
&amp;= \Big[x^3 + 102x \Big]_{x=11}^{x=14} \\
&amp;= 1719. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The instances where the order is interchangeable is determined by [[Fubini's theorem]].

=== Double integral over a normal domain ===
[[File:Esempio-formulediriduzione-r2.svg|thumb|160px|right|Example: double integral over the normal region ''D'']]

Consider the region (please see the graphic in the example):
:&lt;math&gt;D = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbf{R}^2 \ : \ x \ge 0, y \le 1, y \ge x^2 \}&lt;/math&gt; 
Calculate

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D (x+y) \, dx \, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

This domain is normal with respect to both the ''x''- and ''y''-axes. To apply the formulae it is required to find the functions that determine ''D'' and the intervals over which these functions are defined. In this case the two functions are:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha (x) = x^2\text{ and }\beta (x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

while the interval is given by the intersections of the functions with ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so the interval is [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] = [0,&amp;nbsp;1] (normality has been chosen with respect to the ''x''-axis for a better visual understanding).

It is now possible to apply the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D (x+y) \, dx \, dy = \int_0^1 dx \int_{x^2}^1 (x+y) \, dy = \int_0^1 dx \ \left[xy + \frac{y^2}{2} \right]^1_{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

(at first the second integral is calculated considering ''x'' as a constant). The remaining operations consist of applying the basic techniques of integration:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \left[xy + \frac{y^2}{2}\right]^1_{x^2} \, dx = \int_0^1 \left(x + \frac{1}{2} - x^3 - \frac{x^4}{2} \right) dx = \cdots = \frac{13}{20}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we choose normality with respect to the ''y''-axis we could calculate

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 dy \int_0^{\sqrt{y}} (x+y) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

and obtain the same value.
[[File:Dominio-normalità r3 esempio.svg|thumb|160px|right|Example of domain in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that is normal with respect to the ''xy''-plane.]]

=== Calculating volume ===
Using the methods previously described, it is possible to calculate the volumes of some common solids.
* '''[[Cylinder (geometry)|Cylinder]]''': The volume of a cylinder with height {{mvar|h}} and circular base of radius {{mvar|R}} can be calculated by integrating the constant function {{mvar|h}} over the circular base, using polar coordinates.
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Volume} = \int_0^{2 \pi } d \varphi\, \int_0^R h \rho \, d \rho = 2 \pi h \left[\frac{\rho^2}{2}\right]_0^R = \pi R^2 h&lt;/math&gt;

This is in agreement with the formula for the volume of a [[prism]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} &lt;/math&gt;.

* '''[[Sphere]]''': The volume of a sphere with radius {{mvar|R}} can be calculated by integrating the constant function 1 over the sphere, using spherical coordinates.

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{Volume} &amp;= \iiint_D f(x,y,z) \, dx\, dy\, dz \\
&amp;= \iiint_D 1 \, dV \\
&amp;= \iiint_S \rho^2 \sin \varphi \, d\rho\, d\theta\, d\varphi \\
&amp;= \int_0^{2 \pi }\, d \theta \int_0^{ \pi } \sin \varphi\, d \varphi \int_0^R \rho^2\, d \rho \\
&amp;= 2 \pi \int_0^{ \pi } \sin \varphi\, d \varphi \int_0^R \rho^2\, d \rho \\
&amp;= 2 \pi \int_0^{ \pi } \sin \varphi \frac{R^3}{3 }\, d \varphi \\
&amp;= \frac23 \pi R^3 \Big[-\cos \varphi\Big]_0^\pi = \frac43 \pi R^3.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''[[Tetrahedron]]''' (triangular [[pyramid]] or 3-[[simplex]]): The volume of a tetrahedron with its apex at the origin and edges of length {{mvar|l}} along the {{mvar|x}}-, {{mvar|y}}- and {{mvar|z}}-axes can be calculated by integrating the constant function 1 over the tetrahedron.

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \text{Volume} &amp;= \int_0^ l dx \int_0^{ l-x }\, dy \int_0^{ l-x-y }\, dz \\
&amp;= \int_0^ l dx \int_0^{ l-x } ( l - x - y)\, dy \\
&amp;= \int_0^ l \left( l^2 - 2 l x + x^2 - \frac{ ( l-x)^2 }{2 }\right)\, dx \\
&amp;= l^3 - l l^2 + \frac{ l^3}{3 } - \left[\frac{ l^2 x}{2 } - \frac{ l x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6 }\right]_0^ l \\
&amp;= \frac{ l^3}{3} - \frac{ l^3}{6 } = \frac{ l^3}{6}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:This is in agreement with the formula for the volume of a [[pyramid]]

::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Volume} = \frac13 \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = \frac13 \times \frac{ l^2}{2} \times l = \frac{ l^3}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Dominio improprio.svg|thumb|right|140px|Example of an improper domain.]]

==Multiple improper integral==
In case of unbounded domains or functions not bounded near the boundary of the domain, we have to introduce the '''double [[improper integral]]''' or the '''triple improper integral'''.

==Multiple integrals and iterated integrals==
{{See also|Order of integration (calculus)}}
[[Fubini's theorem]] states that if&lt;ref name ="a" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_{A\times B} \left|f(x,y)\right|\,d(x,y)&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;
that is, if the integral is absolutely convergent, then the multiple integral will give the same result as the iterated integral,
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_{A\times B} f(x,y)\,d(x,y)=\int_A\left(\int_B f(x,y)\,dy\right)\,dx=\int_B\left(\int_A f(x,y)\,dx\right)\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;
In particular this will occur if {{math|{{abs|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}}} is a [[bounded function]] and {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are [[bounded set]]s.

If the integral is not absolutely convergent, care is needed not to confuse the concepts of ''multiple integral'' and ''iterated integral'', especially since the same notation is often used for either concept. The notation

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1\int_0^1 f(x,y)\,dy\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

means, in some cases, an iterated integral rather than a true double integral. In an iterated integral, the outer integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \cdots \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

is the integral with respect to {{mvar|x}} of the following function of {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\int_0^1 f(x,y)\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

A double integral, on the other hand, is defined with respect to area in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane. If the double integral exists, then it is equal to each of the two iterated integrals (either "{{mvar|dy dx}}" or "{{mvar|dx dy}}") and one often computes it by computing either of the iterated integrals. But sometimes the two iterated integrals exist when the double integral does not, and in some such cases the two iterated integrals are different numbers, i.e., one has

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1\int_0^1 f(x,y)\,dy\,dx \neq \int_0^1\int_0^1 f(x,y)\,dx\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

This is an instance of rearrangement of a [[conditional convergence|conditionally convergent]] integral.

On the other hand, some conditions ensure that the two iterated integrals are equal even though the double integral need not exist. By the [[Grigorii Fichtenholz|Fichtenholz]]–[[Leon Lichtenstein|Lichtenstein]] theorem, if {{mvar|f}} is bounded on {{math|[0, 1] × [0, 1]}} and both iterated integrals exist, then they are equal. Moreover, existence of the inner integrals ensures existence of the outer integrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewin |first=Jonathan |title=An Interactive Introduction to Mathematical Analysis |publisher=Cambridge |year=2003 |at=Sect. 16.6|ISBN=978-1107694040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewin |first=Jonathan |title=Some applications of the bounded convergence theorem for an introductory course in analysis |date=1987 |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |publisher=AMS |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=988–993 |doi=10.2307/2322609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinclair |first=George Edward |title=A finitely additive generalization of the Fichtenholz–Lichtenstein theorem|date=1974 |journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society |publisher=AMS |volume=193 |pages=359–374 |doi=10.2307/1996919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double integral need not exist in this case even as [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]], according to [[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bogachev |first=Vladimir I. |title=Measure Theory |volume=1 |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |at=Item 3.10.49}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notation
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[0,1]\times[0,1]} f(x,y)\,dx\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

may be used if one wishes to be emphatic about intending a double integral rather than an iterated integral.

==Some practical applications==
Quite generally, just as in one variable, one can use the multiple integral to find the average of a function over a given set. Given a set {{math|''D'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and an integrable function {{mvar|f}} over {{mvar|D}}, the average value of {{mvar|f}} over its domain is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f} = \frac{1}{m(D)} \int_D f(x)\, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''(''D'')}} is the [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] of {{mvar|D}}.

Additionally, multiple integrals are used in many applications in [[physics]]. The examples below also show some variations in the notation.

In [[mechanics]], the [[moment of inertia]] is calculated as the volume integral (triple integral) of the [[density]] weighed with the square of the distance from the axis:

:&lt;math&gt;I_z = \iiint_V \rho r^2\, dV.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[gravitational potential]] associated with a [[mass distribution]] given by a mass [[Borel measure|measure]] {{mvar|dm}} on three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Classical Mechanics |title-link=Classical Mechanics (Kibble and Berkshire) |edition=5th |publisher=[[Imperial College Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-86094-424-6 |author1 = Kibble |first1 = Tom W. B. |last2 = Berkshire |first2=Frank H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = -\iiint_{\mathbf{R}^3} \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}|}\,dm(\mathbf{y}).&lt;/math&gt;

If there is a continuous function {{math|''ρ''('''x''')}} representing the density of the distribution at {{math|'''x'''}}, so that {{math|''dm''('''x''') {{=}} ''ρ''('''x''')''d''{{isup|3}}'''x'''}}, where {{math|''d''{{isup|3}}'''x'''}} is the Euclidean [[volume element]], then the gravitational potential is
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{x}) = -\iiint_{\mathbf{R}^3} \frac{G}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\,\rho(\mathbf{y})\,d^3\mathbf{y}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[electromagnetism]], [[Maxwell's equations]] can be written using multiple integrals to calculate the total magnetic and electric fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = John D. | title = Classical Electrodynamics |author-link=John David Jackson (physicist) |edition = 3rd | publisher = Wiley | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-471-30932-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following example, the [[electric field]] produced by a distribution of [[Electric charge|charges]] given by the volume [[charge density]] {{math|''ρ''( {{vec|''r''}} )}} is obtained by a ''triple integral'' of a vector function:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec E = \frac {1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \iiint \frac {\vec r - \vec r'}{\left \| \vec r - \vec r' \right \|^3} \rho (\vec r')\, d^3 r'.&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be written as an integral with respect to a [[signed measure]] representing the charge distribution.

As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a [[homogeneous space]] and is diffeomorphic to the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;N/H&lt;/math&gt;, the quotient of a nilpotent [[Lie group]] ''N'' modulo a [[closed (topology)|closed]] [[subgroup]] ''H''.  This notion was introduced by [[Anatoly Maltsev|A. Mal'cev]] in 1951.

In the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold.  A [[Riemannian manifold]] is called a '''homogeneous nilmanifold''' if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it.  The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson &lt;ref&gt;E. Wilson, "Isometry groups on homogeneous nilmanifolds", Geometriae Dedicata 12 (1982) 337–346&lt;/ref&gt;).

Nilmanifolds are important geometric objects and often arise as concrete examples with interesting properties; in Riemannian geometry these spaces always have mixed curvature,&lt;ref&gt;Milnor, John ''Curvatures of left invariant metrics on Lie groups.'' Advances in Math. 21 (1976), no. 3, 293–329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Almost flat manifold|almost flat spaces]] arise as quotients of nilmanifolds,&lt;ref&gt;Gromov, M. ''Almost flat manifolds.'' J. Differential Geom. 13 (1978), no. 2, 231–241.&lt;/ref&gt; and compact nilmanifolds have been used to construct elementary examples of collapse of Riemannian metrics under the Ricci flow.&lt;ref&gt;Chow, Bennett; Knopf, Dan, ''The Ricci flow: an introduction.'' Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 110. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004. xii+325 pp. {{isbn|0-8218-3515-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their role in geometry, nilmanifolds are increasingly being seen as having a role in [[arithmetic combinatorics]] (see Green–Tao &lt;ref&gt;Ben Green and Terence Tao, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math.NT/0606088 Linear equations in primes],  22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[ergodic theory]] (see, e.g., Host–Kra &lt;ref&gt;Bernard Host and [[Bryna Kra]], [http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~kra/papers/convnil.pdf Nonconventional ergodic averages and nilmanifolds], Ann. of Math. (2) 161 (2005), no. 1, 397–488.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Compact nilmanifolds ==
A compact nilmanifold is a nilmanifold which is compact.  One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group ''N'' and a [[discrete subgroup]] &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;.  If the subgroup &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on ''N'', then the quotient manifold &lt;math&gt;N/ \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; will be a compact nilmanifold.  As Mal'cev has shown, every compact
nilmanifold is obtained this way.&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Mal'cev, ''On a class of homogeneous spaces'', AMS Translation No. '''39''' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a subgroup &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; as above is called a [[lattice (group theory)|lattice]] in ''N''.  It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational [[structure constants]]: this is [[Malcev's criterion]].  Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also Raghunathan.&lt;ref&gt;Raghunathan, Chapter II, ''Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups'', M. S. Raghunathan&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compact Riemannian nilmanifold''' is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric.  These spaces are constructed as follows.  Let &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group ''N'', as above.  Endow ''N'' with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric.  Then the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; acts by isometries on ''N'' via left-multiplication.  Thus the quotient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \backslash N&lt;/math&gt; is a compact space locally isometric to ''N''.  Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;N / \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

Compact nilmanifolds also arise as [[principal bundles]].  For example, consider a 2-step [[nilpotent Lie group]] ''N'' which admits a lattice (see above).  Let &lt;math&gt;Z=[N,N]&lt;/math&gt; be the commutator subgroup of ''N''.  Denote by p the dimension of ''Z'' and by q the codimension of ''Z''; i.e. the dimension of ''N'' is p+q.  It is known (see Raghunathan) that &lt;math&gt;Z \cap \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice in ''Z''.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;G = Z/(Z \cap \Gamma )&lt;/math&gt; is a ''p''-dimensional compact torus.  Since ''Z'' is central in ''N'', the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold &lt;math&gt;P = N/ \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; with quotient space &lt;math&gt;M=P/G&lt;/math&gt;.  This base manifold ''M'' is a ''q''-dimensional compact torus.  It has been shown that ever principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see.&lt;ref&gt;Palais, R. S.; Stewart, T. E. ''Torus bundles over a torus.'' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 1961 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, a compact nilmanifold is torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus.

As mentioned above, [[almost flat manifold]]s are intimately compact nilmanifolds.  See that article for more information.

==Complex nilmanifolds==

Historically, a '''complex nilmanifold''' meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over
a [[cocompact lattice]]. An example of such a nilmanifold is an [[Iwasawa manifold]]. From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one.

An '''almost complex structure''' on a real Lie algebra ''g'' is an endomorphism &lt;math&gt;I:\; g \rightarrow g&lt;/math&gt; which squares to
&amp;minus;Id&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;. This operator is called '''a complex structure''' if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues
&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, are subalgebras in &lt;math&gt;g \otimes {\Bbb C}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, ''I'' defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold (''G'',''I'') is called '''a complex group manifold'''.
It is easy to see that every connected complex [[homogeneous space|homogeneous manifold]] equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way.

Let ''G'' be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A '''complex nilmanifold''' is a quotient of a complex group  manifold (''G'',''I''), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right.

Complex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties.

In complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a [[Kodaira surface]].&lt;ref&gt;Keizo Hasegawa  ''Complex and Kähler structures on Compact Solvmanifolds,'' J. Symplectic Geom. Volume 3, Number 4 (2005), 749–767.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

Compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never [[formal space|homotopy formal]].&lt;ref&gt;Keizo Hasegawa,  ''Minimal models of nilmanifolds,'' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 106 (1989), no. 1, 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot
admit a [[Kähler structure]] (see also &lt;ref&gt;C. Benson, C.S. Gordon, ''Kähler and symplectic structures on nilmanifolds'', Topology '''27'''(4) (1988) 513–518.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Topologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained
as iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by [[Upper central series|ascending central series]].&lt;ref&gt;Sönke Rollenske,  [https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3120 Geometry of nilmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure and deformations in the large], 40 pages, arXiv:0901.3120, Proc. London Math. Soc., 99, 425–460, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Nilpotent Lie groups ===
From the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold.  The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros.

For example, the [[Heisenberg group]] is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group.  This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient.  The group &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients.  The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional.  One possible [[fundamental domain]] is (isomorphic to) [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the faces identified in a suitable way.  This is because an element &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x &amp; z \\ &amp; 1 &amp; y \\ &amp; &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; \{x\} &amp; \{z-x \lfloor y \rfloor \} \\ &amp; 1 &amp; \{y\} \\ &amp; &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in the fundamental domain.  Here &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]] of ''x'', and &lt;math&gt;\{ x \}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Floor_function#Fractional_part|fractional part]].  The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher-order Fourier analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Green and Terence Tao, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/0606088 Linear equations in primes],  Ann. of Math.  Volume 171 (2010), Issue 3, 1753–1850&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abelian Lie groups ===
A simpler example would be any abelian Lie group.  This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group.  For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers.  The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.

== Generalizations ==
A parallel construction based on [[solvable group|solvable]] Lie groups produces a class of spaces called '''solvmanifolds'''. An important example of a solvmanifolds are [[Inoue surface]]s, known in [[complex geometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1775">In [[number theory]], '''Niven's constant''', named after [[Ivan Niven]], is the largest exponent appearing in the [[prime factorization]] of any natural number ''n'' "on average". More precisely, if we define ''H''(1) = 1 and ''H''(''n'') = the largest exponent appearing in the unique prime factorization of a natural number ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, then Niven's constant is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n H(j) = 1+\sum_{k=2}^\infty \left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta(k)}\right) 
= 1.705211\dots
&lt;/math&gt;

where ζ(''k'') is the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at the point ''k'' (Niven, 1969).

In the same paper [[Ivan M. Niven|Niven]] also proved that

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{j=1}^n h(j) = n + c\sqrt{n} + o (\sqrt{n})
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h''(1) = 1, ''h''(''n'') = the smallest exponent appearing in the unique prime factorization of each natural number ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, ''o'' is [[Big_O_notation#Little-o_notation|little o notation]], and the constant ''c'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
c = \frac{\zeta(\frac{3}{2})}{\zeta(3)},
&lt;/math&gt;

and consequently that

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n h(j) = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--==History and organization==
 NodeXL was founded in YYYY as a part of [[Microsoft Research]]. Smith moved the project to the [[Social Media Research Foundation]] in YYYY. The project is a distributed collaboration among members of several organizations in academia and industry. --&gt;
==Codebase==
NodeXL is a set of prebuilt class libraries using a custom [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] control.&lt;ref name="Graph Data Providers"&gt;{{citation|title=For Programmers: About NodeXL Graph Data Providers |url=http://nodexl.codeplex.com/discussions/71182 |publisher=Social Media Research Foundation |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional [[Assembly (CLI)|.NET assemblies]] can be developed as "plug-ins" to import data from outside data providers. Currently-implemented data providers for NodeXL include [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Wikipedia]] (the MediaWiki understructure), [[hyperlink|web hyperlinks]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server]].&lt;ref name="3rd Party"&gt;{{citation |title=Third-Party Graph Data Importers |url=http://nodexl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Third-Party%20NodeXL%20Graph%20Data%20Importers |publisher=Social Media Research Foundation |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
NodeXL is intended for users with little or no programming experience to allow them to collect, analyze, and visualize a variety of networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1109/CSE.2009.120|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/trs/2009-19/2009-19.pdf|title=First Steps to Netviz Nirvana: Evaluating Social Network Analysis with NodeXL |last1=Bonsignore |first1=E.M. |last2=Dunne |first2=Cody |last3=Rotman |first3=D. |last4=Smith |first4=M. |last5=Capone |first5=T. |last6=Hansen |first6=D.L. |last7=Shneiderman |first7=B. |journal=International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering |year=2009 |publisher=IEEE |pages=332–339}}&lt;/ref&gt; NodeXL integrates into Microsoft Excel 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 and opens as a workbook with a variety of worksheets containing the elements of a [[graph (data structure)|graph structure]] such as edges and nodes. NodeXL can also import a variety of graph formats such as edgelists, adjacency matrices, [[GraphML]], UCINet .dl, and Pajek .net.

===Data Import===
NodeXL imports UCINet and GraphML files, as well as Excel spreadsheets containing edge lists or adjacency matrices, into NodeXL workbooks. NodeXL also allows for quick collection of social media data via a set of import tools which can collect network data from e-mail, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. NodeXL requests the user's permission before collecting any personal data and focuses on the collection of publicly available data, such as Twitter statuses and follows relationships for users who have made their accounts public. These features allow NodeXL users to instantly get working on relevant social media data and integrate aspects of social media data collection and analysis into one tool.

===Data Representation===
NodeXL workbooks contain four worksheets: Edges, Vertices, Groups, and Overall Metrics. The relevant data about entities in the graph and relationships between them are located in the appropriate worksheet in row format. For example, the edges worksheet contains a minimum of two columns, and each row has a minimum of two elements corresponding to the two vertices that make up an edge in the graph. Graph metrics and edge and vertex visual properties appear as additional columns in the respective worksheets. This representation allows the user to leverage the Excel spreadsheet to quickly edit existing node properties and to generate new ones, for instance by applying Excel formulas to existing columns.

===Graph Analysis===
NodeXL contains a library of commonly used graph metrics: [[centrality]], [[clustering coefficient]], [[distance (graph theory)|diameter]]. NodeXL differentiates between directed and undirected networks. NodeXL implements a variety of [[community structure|community detection]] algorithms to allow the user to automatically discover clusters in their social networks.

===Graph Visualization===
NodeXL generates an interactive canvas for visualizing graphs. The project allows users to pick from several well-known [[Force-directed graph drawing]] layout algorithms such as Fruchterman-Reingold and Harel-Koren. NodeXL allows the user to multi-select, drag and drop nodes on the canvas and to manually edit their visual properties (size, color, and opacity). In addition, NodeXL allows users to map the visual properties of nodes and edges to metrics it calculates, and in general to any column in the edges and vertices worksheet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4469">{{Expand German|Irrationale Rotationsalgebra|date=January 2018|topic=sci}}

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in the theory of [[C*-algebra]]s, the '''noncommutative tori''' ''A''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as '''irrational rotation algebras''' for [[irrational number|irrational]] values of θ, form a family of noncommutative C*-algebras which generalize the [[C*-algebra#Commutative C.2A-algebras|algebra of continuous functions]] on the [[Torus|2-torus]]. Many topological and geometric properties of the classical 2-torus have algebraic analogues for the noncommutative tori, and as such they are fundamental examples of a [[Noncommutative geometry|noncommutative space]] in the sense of [[Alain Connes]].

== Definition ==
For any real number ''θ'', the noncommutative torus ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the C*-subalgebra of ''B''(''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)), the algebra of [[bounded linear operator]]s of [[square-integrable function]]s on the [[unit circle]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of '''C''', generated by the [[unitary operator|unitary]] elements ''U'' and ''V'', where ''U''(''f'')(''z'')=''zf''(''z'') and ''V''(''f'')(''z'')=''f''(''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2π ''i''θ&lt;/sup&gt;''z''). A quick calculation shows that ''VU'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2π''i''θ&lt;/sup&gt;''UV''.&lt;ref name="Davidson97"&gt;
{{cite book
|last=Davidson |first=Kenneth
|title=C*-Algebras by Example
|year=1997
|publisher=Fields Institute
|isbn=0-8218-0599-1
|pages=166, 218–219, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative characterizations ==
* '''Universal property:''' ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined (up to isomorphism) as the [[universal C*-algebra]] generated by two unitary elements ''U'' and ''V'' satisfying the relation ''VU''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;2π''i''θ&lt;/sup&gt;''UV''.&lt;ref name="Davidson97" /&gt; This definition extends to the case when ''θ'' is rational. In particular when ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to continuous functions on the [[torus|2-torus]] by the [[Gelfand representation#The C.2A-algebra case|Gelfand transform]].
* '''Irrational rotation algebra:''' Let the infinite cyclic group '''Z''' act on the circle '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[irrational rotation|rotation action]] by angle 2{{pi}}''iθ''. This induces an action of '''Z''' by automorphisms on the algebra of continuous functions ''C''('''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The resulting C*-[[crossed product]] ''C''('''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) ⋊ '''Z''' is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;. The generating unitaries are the generator of the group '''Z''' and the identity function on the circle ''z'' : '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C'''.&lt;ref name="Davidson97" /&gt;
* '''Twisted group algebra:''' The function σ : '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C'''; σ((''m'',''n''), (''p'',''q'')) = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2π''inpθ''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[group cohomology|group 2-cocycle]] on '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the corresponding twisted [[group algebra]] ''C*''('''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;&amp;nbsp;''σ'') is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Classification and K-theory ==
The [[Operator K-theory|K-theory]] of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in both even dimension and odd dimension, and so does not distinguish the irrational rotation algebras. But as an [[partially ordered group|ordered group]], ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≃ '''Z''' + ''θ'''''Z'''. Therefore, two noncommutative tori ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''η''&lt;/sub&gt; are isomorphic if and only if either ''θ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''η'' or ''θ''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''η'' is an integer.&lt;ref name=Davidson97 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rieffel81&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Marc Rieffel|Rieffel]]|first=Marc A.|title=C*-Algebras Associated with Irrational Rotations|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|year=1981|volume=93|issue=2|doi=10.2140/pjm.1981.93.415|pages=415–429 [416]|url=http://msp.org/pjm/1981/93-2/pjm-v93-n2-p12-s.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two irrational rotation algebras ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''η''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Morita equivalence#Further directions|strongly Morita equivalent]] if and only if ''θ'' and ''η'' are in the same orbit of the action of SL(2,&amp;nbsp;'''Z''') on '''R''' by [[fractional linear transformations]]. In particular, the noncommutative tori with θ rational are Morita equivalent to the classical torus. On the other hand, the noncommutative tori with θ irrational are simple C*-algebras.&lt;ref name=Rieffel81 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4881">'''Nuprl''' is a proof development system, providing computer-mediated analysis and proofs of formal mathematical statements, and tools for software verification and optimization.  Originally developed in the 1980s by [[Robert Lee Constable]] and others, the system is now maintained by the PRL Project at [[Cornell University]].  The currently supported version, Nuprl 5, is also known as FDL (Formal Digital Library).  Nuprl functions as an [[automated theorem proving]] system and can also be used to provide [[proof assistant|proof assistance]].

== Design ==

Nuprl uses a type system based on Martin-Löf [[intuitionistic type theory]] to model mathematical statements in a [[digital library]].  Mathematical theories can be constructed and analyzed with a variety of editors, including a [[graphical user interface]], a web-based editor, and an [[Emacs]] mode. A variety of evaluators and inference engines can operate on the statements in the library.  Translators also allow statements to be manipulated with [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[OCaml]] programs.&lt;ref name="nuprl5architecture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuprl 5 distributed open architecture|url=http://www.nuprl.org/images/FDL-diagram.png|website=PRL Project|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall system is controlled with a variant of [[ML (programming language)|ML]].

Nuprl 5's architecture is described as "distributed [[open architecture]]"&lt;ref name="nuprl5architecture"/&gt; and intended primarily to be used as a [[web service]] rather than as standalone software. Those interested in using the web service, or migrating theories from older versions of Nuprl, can contact the [[email address]] given on the Nuprl System web page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuprl System|url=http://www.nuprl.org/html/NuprlSystem.html|website=PRL Project|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Nuprl was first released in 1984, and was first described in detail in the book ''Implementing Mathematics with the Nuprl Proof Development System'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Constable|first1=Robert|title=Implementing Mathematics with The Nuprl Proof Development System|date=1986|publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=1468059106|url=http://nuprl.org/book/|accessdate=7 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1986.  Nuprl 2 was the first Unix version.  Nuprl 3 provided machine proof for mathematical problems related to [[Pure type system|Girard's Paradox]] and [[Higman's lemma]].  Nuprl 4, the first version developed for the [[World Wide Web]], was used to verify cache coherency protocols and other computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Stuart|last2=Constable|first2=Robert|last3=Eaton|first3=Richard|last4=Kreitz|first4=Christoph|last5=Lorigo|first5=Lori|title=The Nuprl Open Logical Environment (2000 slide presentation)|url=http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/ti/kreitz/Talks/00stp-nuprl-slides.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current system architecture, implemented in Nuprl 5, was first proposed in a 2000 [[conference paper]].  A reference manual for Nuprl 5 was published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kreitz|first1=Christoph|title=The Nuprl Proof Development System, Version 5: Reference Manual and User’s Guide|date=2002|url=http://www.nuprl.org/html/02cucs-NuprlManual.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuprl has been the subject of many [[computer science]] publications, some as recent as 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRL Project - Knowledge Base|url=http://www.nuprl.org/Publications/|website=PRL Project|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successors ==

Both the [http://www.jonprl.org/ JonPRL] and RedPRL systems are also based on computational type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=Robert|last2=Angiuli|first2=Carlo|date=May 10, 2017|title=Computational higher-dimensional type theory|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/angiuli-proposal.pdf|journal=43nd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RedPRL is explicitly "inspired by Nuprl".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redprl.org/|title=The People’s Refinement Logic|website=www.redprl.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olga Gil Medrano''' (born 1956) is a Spanish mathematician who was president of the Royal Spanish Mathematical Society from 2006 to 2009.{{r|20min}}
She is a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Valencia]], where she is also Vice-Rector for International Relations and Cooperation.{{r|vr}}
Her mathematical research concerns [[differential geometry]] and [[geometric analysis]]; since 2000, she has also been interested in the dissemination of mathematics to the general public.{{r|mm}}

==Education and career==
Gil was born in [[Burgos]] in 1956.{{r|eroski}}

As an undergraduate student at the University of Valencia, Gil was advised to study engineering, but she ignored the advice, preferring mathematics and physics.{{r|mm}}
She earned a Ph.D. at the University of Valencia in 1982, with a dissertation on ''Certain Geometric and Topological Properties of Some Classes of Almost-Product Manifolds'' supervised by Antonio Martínez Naveira. She then studied for a [[doctorat de troisième cycle]] in France, at [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]], which she completed in 1985. Her second dissertation, ''Sur le Problème de Yamabe concernat les variétés localement conformement plates'', was supervised by [[Thierry Aubin]].{{r|mgp}}

After completing her second doctorate, she returned to Valencia as a faculty member.{{r|mm}}
She has been a member of the governing board of the University of Valencia since 2000. When she became president of the Royal Spanish Mathematical Society in 2006, she was the first woman elected to that position.{{r|mct}}

==Recognition==
In September 2017, the University of Valencia hosted a workshop on geometric analysis in honor of Gil.{{r|gav}}

The language was first described in a paper published in July 2017,&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt; and source code was released as part of [[IBM]]'s Quantum Information Software Kit (QISKit) for use with their [[IBM Q Experience]] cloud quantum computing platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=qiskit-openqasm: OpenQASM specification|date=2017-07-04|url=https://github.com/IBM/qiskit-openqasm|publisher=International Business Machines|accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has similar qualities to traditional [[hardware description language]]s such as [[Verilog]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3255">In [[graph theory]], '''oriented graph coloring''' is a special type of [[graph coloring]]. Namely, it is
an assignment of colors to vertices of an [[oriented graph]] that
* is '''proper''': no two adjacent vertices get the same color, and
* '''respects the orientation''': if (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') and (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''v'') are arcs of the graph then it is not possible that colors of ''x'' and ''v'' and of ''y'' and ''u'' are the same.

An ''oriented chromatic number'' of a graph ''G'' is the least number of colors needed in an oriented coloring;
it is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\chi_o(G)&lt;/math&gt;. The same definition can be extended to undirected graphs, as well, by defining the oriented chromatic number of an undirected graph to be the largest oriented chromatic number of any of its [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientations]].&lt;ref name="ksz97"&gt;{{citation

== Examples ==
The oriented chromatic number of a directed 5-cycle is five. If the cycle is colored by four or fewer colors, then either two adjacent vertices have the same color, or two vertices two steps apart have the same color. In the latter case, the edges connecting these two vertices to the vertex between them are inconsistently oriented: both have the same pair of colors but with opposite orientations. Thus, no coloring with four or fewer colors is possible. However, giving each vertex its own unique color leads to a valid oriented coloring.

== Properties ==
An oriented coloring can exist only for a directed graph with no loops or directed 2-cycles. For, a loop cannot have different colors at its endpoints, and a 2-cycle cannot have both of its edges consistently oriented between the same two colors. If these conditions are satisfied, then there always exists an oriented coloring, for instance the coloring that assigns a different color to each vertex.

If an oriented coloring is [[Complete coloring|complete]], in the sense that no two colors can be merged to produce a coloring with fewer colors, then it corresponds uniquely to a [[graph homomorphism]] into a [[tournament (graph theory)|tournament]]. The tournament has one vertex for each color in the coloring. For each pair of colors, there is an edge in the colored graph with those two colors at its endpoints, which lends its orientation to the edge in the tournament between the vertices corresponding to the two colors. Incomplete colorings may also be represented by homomorphisms into tournaments but in this case the correspondence between colorings and homomorphisms is not one-to-one.

Undirected graphs of bounded [[Graph embedding|genus]], bounded [[degree (graph theory)|degree]], or bounded [[Acyclic coloring|acyclic chromatic number]] also have bounded oriented chromatic number.&lt;ref name="ksz97"/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and guide to [[category theory]], the area of study in [[mathematics]] that examines in an [[abstraction|abstract]] way the properties of particular mathematical concepts, by formalising them as collections of ''objects'' and ''arrows'' (also called [[morphism]]s, although this term also has a specific, non category-theoretical sense), where these collections satisfy certain basic conditions.  Many significant areas of mathematics can be formalised as categories, and the use of category theory allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields to be stated, and proved, in a much simpler way than without the use of categories.

[[File:Pizza proof without words.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Proof without words]] for 8 sectors by {{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994a}}.]]
In elementary [[geometry]], the '''pizza theorem''' states the equality of two areas that arise when one partitions a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] in a certain way.

Let ''p'' be an interior point of the disk, and let ''n'' be a number that is divisible by 4 and greater than or equal to 8. Form ''n'' sectors of the disk with equal angles by choosing an arbitrary line through ''p'', rotating the line {{nowrap|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} times by an angle of {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|''n''}} [[radian]]s, and slicing the disk on each of the resulting {{sfrac|''n''|2}} lines. Number the sectors consecutively in a clockwise or anti-clockwise fashion. Then the pizza theorem states that:

:'' The sum of the areas of the odd-numbered sectors equals the sum of the areas of the even-numbered sectors'' {{harv|Upton|1968}}.

The pizza theorem is so called because it mimics a traditional [[pizza]] slicing technique. It shows that, if two people share a pizza sliced in this way by taking alternating slices, then they each get an equal amount of pizza.

==History==
The pizza theorem was originally proposed as a challenge problem by {{harvtxt|Upton|1968}}. The published solution to this problem, by Michael Goldberg, involved direct manipulation of the algebraic expressions for the areas of the sectors.
{{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994a}} provide an alternative proof by [[Dissection puzzle|dissection]]. They show how to partition the sectors into smaller pieces so that each piece in an odd-numbered sector has a [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] piece in an even-numbered sector, and vice versa. {{harvtxt|Frederickson|2012}} gave a family of dissection proofs for all cases (in which the number of sectors {{nowrap|is 8, 12, 16, ...}}).

==Generalizations==
[[File:Pizza theorem2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|12 sectors: green area = orange area]]
The requirement that the number of sectors be a multiple of four is necessary: as [[Don Coppersmith]] showed, dividing a disk into four sectors, or a number of sectors that is not divisible by four, does not in general produce equal areas. {{harvtxt|Mabry|Deiermann|2009}} answered a problem of {{harvtxt|Carter|Wagon|1994b}} by providing a more precise version of the theorem that determines which of the two sets of sectors has greater area in the cases that the areas are unequal. Specifically, if the number of sectors is 2 (mod 8) and no slice passes through the center of the disk, then the subset of slices containing the center has smaller area than the other subset, while if the number of sectors is 6 (mod 8) and no slice passes through the center, then the subset of slices containing the center has larger area. An odd number of sectors is not possible with straight-line cuts, and a slice through the center causes the two subsets to be equal regardless of the number of sectors.

{{harvtxt|Mabry|Deiermann|2009}} also observe that, when the pizza is divided evenly, then so is its crust (the crust may be interpreted as either the perimeter of the disk or the area between the boundary of the disk and a smaller circle having the same center, with the cut-point lying in the latter's interior), and since the disks bounded by both circles are partitioned evenly so is their difference. However, when the pizza is divided unevenly, the diner who gets the most pizza area actually gets the least crust.

As {{harvtxt|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|1999}} note, an equal division of the pizza also leads to an equal division of its toppings, as long as each topping is distributed in a disk (not necessarily concentric with the whole pizza) that contains the central point ''p'' of the division into sectors.

==Related results==
{{harvtxt|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|Hirschhorn|1999}} show that a pizza sliced in the same way as the pizza theorem, into a number ''n'' of sectors with equal angles where ''n'' is divisible by four, can also be shared equally among ''n''/4 people. For instance, a pizza divided into 12 sectors can be shared equally by three people as well as by two; however, to accommodate all five of the Hirschhorns, a pizza would need to be divided into 20 sectors.

{{harvtxt|Cibulka|Kynčl|Mészáros|Stolař|2010}} and {{harvtxt|Knauer|Micek|Ueckerdt|2011}} study the [[game theory]] of choosing free slices of pizza in order to guarantee a large share, a problem posed by Dan Brown and [[Peter Winkler]]. In the version of the problem they study, a pizza is sliced radially (without the guarantee of equal-angled sectors) and two diners alternately choose pieces of pizza that are adjacent to an already-eaten sector. If the two diners both try to maximize the amount of pizza they eat, the diner who takes the first slice can guarantee a 4/9 share of the total pizza, and there exists a slicing of the pizza such that he cannot take more. The [[fair division]] or cake cutting problem considers similar games in which different players have different criteria for how they measure the size of their share; for instance, one diner may prefer to get the most pepperoni while another diner may prefer to get the most cheese.

==See also==
Other mathematical results related to pizza-slicing involve the [[lazy caterer's sequence]], a sequence of integers that counts the maximum number of pieces of pizza that one can obtain by a given number of straight slices, and the [[ham sandwich theorem]], a result about slicing three-dimensional objects whose two-dimensional version implies that any pizza, no matter how misshapen, can have its area and its crust length simultaneously bisected by a single carefully chosen straight-line cut, and whose three-dimensional version implies that a plane cut exists that equally shares base, tomato and cheese.

In the area of mathematics known as [[Ramsey theory]], a '''Ramsey class''' is one which satisfies a generalization of [[Ramsey's theorem]].

Suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are structures and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer. We denote by &lt;math&gt;\binom{B}{A}&lt;/math&gt; the set of all subobjects &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. We further denote by &lt;math&gt;C \rightarrow (B)^A_k&lt;/math&gt; the property that for all partitions &lt;math&gt;X_1 \cup X_2\cup \dots\cup X_k&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\binom{C}{A}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;B' \in \binom{C}{B}&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\binom{B'}{A} \subseteq X_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a class of structures closed under [[isomorphism]] and [[substructure (mathematics)|substructures]]. We say the class &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has the '''A-Ramsey property''' if for ever positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and for every &lt;math&gt;B\in K&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;C \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;C \rightarrow (B)^A_k&lt;/math&gt; holds. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has the &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-Ramsey property for all &lt;math&gt;A \in K&lt;/math&gt; then we say &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a '''Ramsey class'''.

Ramsey's theorem is equivalent to the statement that the class of all finite sets is a Ramsey class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The '''rate of return on a portfolio''' is the ratio of income generated (whether realized or not) by a portfolio to the size of the portfolio. It is measured over a period of time, commonly a year.

==Calculation==
The [[rate of return]] on a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] can be calculated either directly or indirectly, depending upon the particular type of data available.

===Direct historical measurement===
Direct historical measurement of the rate of return on a portfolio applies one of several alternative methods, such as for example the [[True time-weighted rate of return|time-weighted method]], or the [[modified Dietz method]].&lt;ref&gt;*Carl Bacon. Practical Portfolio Performance Measurement and Attribution. West Sussex: Wiley, 2003. {{ISBN|0-470-85679-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Bruce J. Feibel. ''Investment Performance Measurement''.  New York: Wiley, 2003. {{ISBN|0-471-26849-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires knowledge of the value of the portfolio at the start and end of the period of time under measurement, together with the [[True time-weighted rate of return|external flows]] of value into and out of the portfolio at various times within the time period. For the time-weighted method, it is also necessary to know the value of the portfolio when  these flows occur (i.e. either immediately after, or immediately before).

===Indirect calculation===
The rate of return on a portfolio can be calculated indirectly as the '''[[Weighted mean|weighted average]] [[rate of return]]''' on the various assets within the portfolio.&lt;ref name="Levy 2009"&gt;Levy, A 2009, ECON331 'Uncertainty, risky assets (activities) and portfolio choice', lecture notes accessed 22 May 2009 elearning.uow.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt; The weights are proportional to the value of the assets within the portfolio, to take into account what portion of the portfolio each individual return represents in calculating the '''contribution''' of that asset to the return on the portfolio.

This method is particularly useful for projecting into the future the rate of return on a portfolio, given projections of the rates of return on the constituents of the portfolio.

The indirect calculation of the rate of return on a portfolio can be expressed by the formula:

: &lt;math&gt;r=A_1r_1+A_2r_2+\cdots+A_nr_n&lt;/math&gt;

which is the sum of the contributions &lt;math&gt;A_1r_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_2r_2\cdots A_nr_n&lt;/math&gt; where:

:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; equals the rate of return on the portfolio,
:&lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; equals the weight of asset ''i'' in the portfolio, and
:&lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; equals the rate of return on asset ''i'' in the portfolio.

====Example====

*Rate of return ''r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' on a [[mining]] stock equals 10%
*Rate of return ''r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' on a [[Childcare|child care]] centre equals 8%
*Rate of return ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' on a [[fishing]] company equals 12%

Now suppose that 40% of the portfolio is in the mining stock (weighting for this stock ''A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 40%), 40% is in the child care centre (weighting for this stock ''A&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 40%) and the remaining 20% is in the fishing company (weighting for this stock ''A&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 20%). To determine the rate of return on this portfolio, first calculate the contribution of each asset to the return on the portfolio, by multiplying the weighting of each asset by its rate of return, and then add these contributions together:

*For the mining stock, its weighting is 40% and its rate of return is 10% so its contribution equals 40% x 10% = .04 = 4%
*For the child care centre, its weighting is 40% and its rate of return is 8% so its contribution equals 40% x 8% = .032 = 3.2%
*For the fishing company, its weighting is 20% and its rate of return is 12% so its contribution equals 20% x 12% = .024 = 2.4%

Adding together these percentage contributions gives 4% + 3.2% + 2.4% = 9.6%,
resulting in a rate of return on this portfolio of 9.6%.

===Discrepancies===
If there are any external flows or other transactions on the assets in the portfolio during the period of measurement, and also depending on the methodology used for calculating the returns and weights, discrepancies may arise between the direct measurement of the rate of return on a portfolio, and indirect measurement (described above).

Taylor received the 2014 [[Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics]]  "for numerous breakthrough results in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s, including the [[Taniyama–Weil conjecture]], the [[local Langlands conjecture]] for [[general linear group]]s, and the [[Sato–Tate conjecture]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/?controller=Page&amp;action=laureates&amp;p=3&amp;laureate_id=59 |title=Breakthrough Prize |publisher=Breakthrough Prize |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the 2007 [[Shaw Prize]] in Mathematical Sciences for his work on the [[Langlands program]] with [[Robert Langlands]].

==Career==
He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Clare College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref name="oxbgaz"&gt;SAVILIAN PROFESSORSHIP OF GEOMETRY in NOTICES, University Gazette 23.3.95 No. 4359 [http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/backissues/9495/230395/notc.txt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010125621/http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/backissues/9495/230395/notc.txt |date=10 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WW" /&gt;. During his time at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], he was president of [[The Archimedeans]] in 1981 and 1982, following the impeachment of his predecessor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archim.org.uk/committees/archimedeans/presidents.txt|title=List of Presidents of The Archimedeans|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He earned his PhD from [[Princeton University]] in 1988. From 1995 to 1996 he held the [[Savilian chair of geometry]]&lt;ref name="oxbgaz" /&gt; at [[Oxford University]] and Fellow of [[New College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name=WW&gt;'TAYLOR, Prof. Richard Lawrence', Who's Who 2008, A &amp; C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U37171, accessed 27 March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and later became the Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics at [[Harvard University]]. He currently holds Robert and Luisa Fernholz Professorship at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].

He received the [[Whitehead Prize]] in 1990, the [[Fermat Prize]], the [[Ostrowski Prize]] in 2001, the [[Cole Prize]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 2002, and the [[Shaw Prize]] for Mathematics in 2007. He was also elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1995. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society]. Retrieved 25 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he was inducted into the [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20035967.html National Academy of Sciences Member Directory]. Retrieved 30 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/election-new-members-2018-spring-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
One of the two papers containing the published proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is a joint work of Taylor and [[Andrew Wiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Taylor |first2=A. |last2=Wiles |doi=10.2307/2118560 |title=Ring theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics|Ann. of Math.]] |volume=141 |year=1995 |issue=3 |pages=553–572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent work, Taylor (along with [[Michael Harris (mathematician)|Michael Harris]]) proved the [[local Langlands conjectures]] for [[General linear group|GL(''n'')]] over a [[number field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Harris |first2=R. |last2=Taylor |title=The geometry and cohomology of some simple Shimura varieties |series=Annals of Mathematics Studies |volume=151 |location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-09090-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler proof was suggested almost at the same time by [[Guy Henniart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carayol|1999|loc=pp. 193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ten years later by [[Peter Scholze]].

Taylor, together with [[Christophe Breuil]], [[Brian Conrad]] and [[Fred Diamond]], completed the proof of the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]], by performing quite heavy technical computations in the case of additive reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Breuil |first2=B. |last2=Conrad |first3=F. |last3=Diamond |first4=R. |last4=Taylor |title=On the modularity of elliptic curves over '''''Q''''': wild 3-adic exercises |journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society|J. Amer. Math. Soc.]] |volume=14 |year=2001 |issue=4 |pages=843–939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Taylor, following the ideas of Michael Harris and building on his joint work with [[Laurent Clozel]], Michael Harris, and [[Nick Shepherd-Barron]], announced a proof of the [[Sato–Tate conjecture]], for [[elliptic curve]]s with non-integral [[j-invariant]]. This partial proof of the Sato–Tate conjecture uses Wiles's theorem about modularity of semistable elliptic curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Taylor |title=Automorphy for some ''l''-adic lifts of automorphic mod ''l'' representations.

'''Run-to-completion scheduling''' is a [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] model in which each task runs until it either finishes, or explicitly yields control back to the scheduler. Run to completion systems typically have an [[event queue]] which is serviced either in strict order of admission by an [[event loop]], or by an [[admission scheduler]] which is capable of scheduling events out of order, based on other constraints such as [[time limit|deadlines]].

Some [[preemptive multitasking]] scheduling systems behave as run-to-completion schedulers in regard to scheduling tasks at one particular [[process priority]] level, at the same time as those processes still preempt other lower priority tasks and are themselves preempted by higher priority tasks.

'''Stephen William Hawking''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CH|CBE|FRS|FRSA}} (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], [[cosmology|cosmologist]], and author, who was director of research at the [[Centre for Theoretical Cosmology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-3" /&gt; He was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.

His scientific works included a collaboration with [[Roger Penrose]] on [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems|gravitational singularity theorems]] in the framework of [[general relativity]] and the theoretical prediction that [[black hole]]s emit radiation, often called [[Hawking radiation]]. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the [[general theory of relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. He was a vigorous supporter of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner, Martin]] (September/October 2001). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/multiverses_and_blackberries "Multiverses and Blackberries"]. "Notes of a Fringe-Watcher". ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''. Volume 25, No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, Michael Clive (February 1995). [http://webarchiveproject.org/32699/ "THE EVERETT FAQ"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420235958/http://webarchiveproject.org/32699/ |date=20 April 2016 }}. Department of Physics, [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. Retrieved 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of [[popular science]] in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general. His book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' appeared on the British ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a [[fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS), a lifetime member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], and a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].
Hawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of [[motor neuron disease|motor neurone disease]] (also known as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] "ALS" or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mind over matter: How Stephen Hawking defied Motor Neurone Disease for 50 years|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mind-over-matter-how-stephen-hawking-defied-motor-neurone-disease-for-50-years-6286313.html|work=The Independent|date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Has Stephen Hawking Lived to 70 with ALS? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/ |access-date=23 December 2014 |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=7 January 2012 |quote=Q: How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS? A: I would say probably less than a few percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the loss of his speech, he was still able to communicate through a [[speech-generating device]], initially through use of a hand-held switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76.&lt;ref name="NYT=20180314" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IT-20180314"&gt;{{cite news |last=Henry |first=David |title=Stephen Hawking, physicist who reshaped cosmology, passes away at 76 |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/physicist-stephen-hawking-passes-away/articleshow/63294700.cms |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=14 March 2018 |accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
=== Family ===
Hawking was born on 8 January 1942&lt;ref name="whoswho" /&gt; in [[Oxford]] to Frank (1905–1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Frank-Hawking/5213819130880079421|title=Frank Hawking|publisher=Geni.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Isobel Eileen Hawking (née Walker; 1915–2013).{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiii, 2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Isobel-Hawking/5213817386800112081|title=Isobel Eileen Hawking|publisher=Geni.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12304843.Mind_over_matter_Stephen_Hawking/ |title=Mind over matter Stephen Hawking |website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-biography/|title=Stephen Hawking, "Equal to Anything!" [Excerpt]|author=Ferguson, Kitty|date=6 January 2012|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, had over-extended himself buying farm land and then going bankrupt in the [[Great Depression of British Agriculture|great agricultural depression]] during the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the [[University of Oxford]], where Frank read medicine and Isobel read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}} Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=6}} Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Edward-Hawking/5389264336990128284|title=Edward Frank David Hawking|publisher=Geni.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=2, 5}}

In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of [[parasitology]] at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]], the family moved to [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiii}} In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=12}} meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=11–12}} During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=13}} the rest of the family spent four months in [[Majorca]] visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet [[Robert Graves]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=3}}

=== Primary and secondary school years ===
Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in [[Highgate]], London. He later blamed its "[[progressive education|progressive methods]]" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-12-07/stephen-hawking-im-happy-if-i-have-added-something-to-our-understanding-of-the-universe|title=Stephen Hawking: "I'm happy if I have added something to our understanding of the universe"|first=Stephen|last=Hawking|date=7 December 2013|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended [[St Albans High School for Girls]] for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=3}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=24}}

Hawking attended two [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools]], first Radlett School{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=24}} and from September 1952, [[St Albans School, Hertfordshire|St Albans School]],&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt;{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=8}} after passing the [[eleven-plus]] a year early.&lt;ref&gt;My brief history – Stephen Hawking (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The family placed a high value on education.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded [[Westminster School]], but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=4}} A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=25–26}} and long discussions about Christianity and [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=14–16}} From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher [[Dikran Tahta]], they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=19–20}}

Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=25}} With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=27}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-5" /&gt; Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=41}} He also wanted his son to attend [[University College, Oxford]], his own ''[[alma mater]]''. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=42–43}}

=== Undergraduate years ===
Hawking began his university education at [[University College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt; in October 1959 at the age of 17.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely{{snd}}he found the academic work "ridiculously easy".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=46–47, 51}} His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=29}} A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the [[University College Boat Club (Oxford)|University College Boat Club]], where he [[coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] a rowing crew.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}} The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=50}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30–31}}

Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his [[final examination|finals]] a challenge, and he decided to answer only [[theoretical physics]] questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]] was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in [[cosmology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a ''[[oral exam|viva]]'' (oral examination) necessary.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=54}} Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral{{clarify|It is unclear to those unfamiliar with the UK educational system whether these are Oxford examiners, Cambridge, or 3rd parties|date=March 2018}} to describe his plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=54–55}} He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} After receiving a [[First Class Honours#First-class honours|first-class]] [[Honours degree|BA (Hons.) degree]] in physics and completing a trip to [[Iran]] with a friend, he began his graduate work at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], in October 1962.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt;{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=31–32}}

=== Graduate years ===
Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned [[Dennis William Sciama]], one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than noted Yorkshire astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=58}} and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in [[general relativity]] and cosmology.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=33–34}} After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression{{snd}}though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=61–63}} His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=36}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=69–70}} Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student [[Jayant Narlikar]] at a lecture in June 1964.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=42}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=68–69}}

When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] theories.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=34}} Inspired by [[Roger Penrose]]'s theorem of a [[spacetime]] singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/stephen-hawkings-phd-thesis-explained-simply|title=Stephen Hawking's PhD thesis, explained simply}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=71–72}} Hawking's thesis&lt;ref name=hawkingphd /&gt; was approved in 1966.&lt;ref name= "hawkingphd" /&gt; There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College]] at Cambridge;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43–44}} he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}} and his essay "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious [[Adams Prize]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}}

{{Cosmology|scientists}}

=== 1966–1975 ===
In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems|singularity theorem]] concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=101}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=61, 64}} In 1970 they published a proof that if the universe obeys [[general relativity|the general theory of relativity]] and fits any of the [[Friedmann equations|models]] of [[physical cosmology]] developed by [[Alexander Friedmann]], then it must have begun as a singularity.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=115–16}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-7" /&gt; In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=49}}

In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as [[Second law of black hole mechanics|the second law of black hole dynamics]], that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=65–67}} With [[James M. Bardeen]] and [[Brandon Carter]], he proposed the four [[laws of black hole mechanics]], drawing an analogy with [[thermodynamics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=38}} To Hawking's irritation, [[Jacob Bekenstein]], a graduate student of [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], went further—and ultimately correctly—to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=67–68}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=123–24}} In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's [[no-hair theorem]], one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of [[mass]], [[electrical charge]] and rotation.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=33}}&lt;ref name="HawkingIsrael1989" /&gt; His essay titled "Black Holes" won the [[Gravity Research Foundation]] Award in January 1971.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=35}} Hawking's first book, ''[[The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time]],'' written with [[George Francis Rayner Ellis|George Ellis]], was published in 1973.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}}

Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of [[quantum gravity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}} His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]], whose work showed that according to the [[uncertainty principle]], rotating black holes emit particles.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}} To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=70}} and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their [[Black hole entropy|entropy]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=41}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}} His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as [[Hawking radiation]], which may continue until they exhaust their energy and [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporate]].&lt;ref name="Auto2J-9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-10" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=69–73}} Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=150–51}} Hawking was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1974|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974]], a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation. At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=44}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=133}}

Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in 1970. He worked with a friend on the faculty, [[Kip Thorne]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82, 86}} and engaged him in a [[scientific wager]] about whether the [[Astrophysical X-ray source|X-ray source]] [[Cygnus X-1]] was a black hole. The wager was an "insurance policy" against the proposition that black holes did not exist.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=86–88}} Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, a bet that was the first of several he was to make with Thorne and others.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=150,189, 219}} Hawking had maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=95}}

=== 1975–1990 ===
Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in gravitational physics. The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=132–33}} He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}} In 1975, he was awarded both the [[Eddington Medal]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pius XI Gold Medal]], and in 1976 the [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics|Dannie Heineman Prize]], the [[Maxwell Prize]] and the [[Hughes Medal]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xv}} He was appointed a professor with a chair in [[gravitational physics]] in 1977.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}} The following year he received the [[Albert Einstein Medal]] and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}

In 1979, Hawking was elected [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}&lt;ref name=lucasian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3248858/Stephen-Hawking-to-retire-as-Cambridges-Professor-of-Mathematics.html|title=Stephen Hawking to retire as Cambridge's Professor of Mathematics|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: "Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?" and proposed [[N=8 Supergravity]] as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=93–94}} His promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=92–93}} At the same time, he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. "I would rather be right than rigorous", he told Kip Thorne.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=96}} In 1981, he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This [[Black hole information paradox|information paradox]] violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including "[[the Black Hole War]]" with [[Leonard Susskind]] and [[Gerard 't Hooft]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=96–101}}&lt;ref name="Susskind2008" /&gt;

[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmological inflation]]{{snd}}a theory proposing that following the Big Bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion{{snd}}was proposed by [[Alan Guth]] and also developed by [[Andrei Linde]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=108–11}} Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and [[Gary Gibbons]] organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on "The Very Early Universe" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=111–14}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-13" /&gt; Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary{{snd}}or beginning or ending{{snd}}to the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=102–103}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=180}} He subsequently developed the research in collaboration with [[James Hartle|Jim Hartle]], and in 1983 they published a model, known as the [[Hartle–Hawking state]]. It proposed that prior to the [[Planck epoch]], the [[universe]] had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-14" /&gt; The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there{{snd}}it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.{{sfn|Baird|2007|loc=p. 234}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=180–83}} Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a [[Shape of the universe|closed universe]], which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained, "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=129}}

Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' "Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=130}} In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In ''A Brief History of Time'' he wrote: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason{{snd}}for then we should know the mind of God."&lt;ref name="sample" /&gt; In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with [[Neil Turok]] led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.{{sfn|Yulsman|2003|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;174–176}}

Further work by Hawking in the area of [[Arrow of time|arrows of time]] led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=180–182}} A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by [[Raymond Laflamme]] led Hawking to withdraw this concept.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=182}} Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American [[Franklin Medal]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=274}} and in the [[1982 New Year Honours]] appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x–xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=114}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48837 |date=30 December 1981 |page=8 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=205, 220–21}} Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with [[Bantam Books]], a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=134}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=220–27}} A first draft of the book, called ''A Brief History of Time'', was completed in 1984.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=135}}

One of the first messages Hawking produced with his [[speech-generating device]] was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing ''A Brief History of Time''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=137}} Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required many revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140–42}} The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=143}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=243–45}}&lt;ref name="g2009" /&gt; The book was translated into many languages,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=143–44}} and ultimately sold an estimated 9{{nbsp}}million copies.&lt;ref name="g2009" /&gt; Media attention was intense,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=143–44}} and a ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine cover and a television special both described him as "Master of the Universe".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=146}} Success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=145–46}} Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=143–44}} A difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left him limited time for work and his students.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=149}} Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=147–48}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=230–31}} He received further academic recognition, including five more honorary degrees,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=146}} the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] (1985),{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xvi}} the [[Dirac Prize|Paul Dirac Medal]] (1987){{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=146}} and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious [[Wolf Prize]] (1988).{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=279}} In the [[1989 Birthday Honours]], he was appointed a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] (CH).{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48837 |date=16 June 1989 |page=18 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly declined a knighthood in the late 1990s in objection to the UK's science funding policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3344540/Stephen-Hawking-warns-Government-over-disastrous-science-funding-cuts.html|title=Stephen Hawking warns Government over 'disastrous' science funding cuts|author=Tom Peterkin|date=15 June 2008|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/science/why-professor-stephen-hawking-never-had-a-knighthood/|title=Why Professor Stephen Hawking never had a knighthood|author=Sally Guyoncourt|date=14 March 2018|work=I News|access-date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gross Witten Hawking TIFR 2001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Hawking outside, in his wheelchair, talking to David Gross and Edward Witten|Hawking with [[string theory|string theorists]] [[David Gross]] and [[Edward Witten]] at the 2001 Strings Conference, [[TIFR]], India]]

Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on [[Euclidean quantum gravity]] with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=180}} In 1994, at Cambridge's [[Newton Institute]], Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=188}} In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public [[scientific wager]] made with Kip Thorne and [[John Preskill]] of [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture"{{snd}}that there could be no "naked singularities" unclothed within a horizon{{snd}}was correct.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=189–90}} After discovering his concession might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. This one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=190}} The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the [[black hole information paradox]].&lt;ref name="Auto2J-18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concedbet" /&gt; Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be "new", and not from inside the black hole [[event horizon]]. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.&lt;ref name="presskill" /&gt;

Hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. A film version of ''A Brief History of Time'', directed by [[Errol Morris]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], premiered in 1992. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but he was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was not widely released.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=168–70}} A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled ''[[Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays]]'' was published in 1993,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=178}} and a six-part television series ''[[Stephen Hawking's Universe]]'' and a companion book appeared in 1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=189}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=97}}

[[File:Stephen Hawking 050506.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Stephen Hawking sitting in his wheelchair inside|upright|Hawking at the {{Lang|fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}} to inaugurate the Laboratory of Astronomy and Particles in Paris, and the French release of his work ''[[God Created the Integers]]'', 5 May 2006]]

Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' in 2001,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=199–200}} and ''[[A Briefer History of Time (Hawking and Mlodinow book)|A Briefer History of Time]]'', which he wrote in 2005 with [[Leonard Mlodinow]] to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and ''[[God Created the Integers]]'', which appeared in 2006.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=222–23}} Along with [[:nl:Thomas Hertog|Thomas Hertog]] at [[CERN]] and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of {{anchor|Top-down cosmology}}"top-down cosmology", which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-23" /&gt; Top-down cosmology posits that the present "selects" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning question]].&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-24" /&gt;

Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, [[Easter Island]], South Africa, Spain (to receive the [[Fonseca Prize]] in 2008),{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=233}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-29" /&gt; Canada,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=239}} and numerous trips to the United States.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=269}} For practical reasons related to his disability, Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=197,269}}

By 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=216–17}} In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one [[topology]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=217–20}}&lt;ref name=presskill /&gt; In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.&lt;ref name="concedbet" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=223–24}} In January 2014, he called the alleged loss of information in black holes his "biggest blunder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kwong |first=Matt |date=28 January 2014 |title=Stephen Hawking's black holes 'blunder' stirs debate |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stephen-hawking-s-black-holes-blunder-stirs-debate-1.2514299 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the [[Higgs boson]] would never be found.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=95, 236}} The particle was proposed to exist as part of the [[Higgs field]] theory by [[Peter Higgs]] in 1964. Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=94–95, 236}} The particle was discovered in July 2012 at [[CERN]] following construction of the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet&lt;ref name="Auto2J-42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-43" /&gt; and said that Higgs should win the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]],&lt;ref name="Auto2J-44" /&gt; which he did in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=8 October 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24445325 |title=Higgs: Five decades of noble endeavour |work=BBC News |access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hawking and his daughter [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]] published ''[[George's Secret Key to the Universe]]'', a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=230–231}} The book was followed by [[George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt|sequels]] in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref name="books" /&gt;

In 2002, following a UK-wide vote, the [[BBC]] included Hawking in their list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 August 2002 |title=100 great British heroes |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm |website=BBC News |access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] (2006),&lt;ref name="Auto2J-45" /&gt; the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], which is America's highest civilian honour (2009),&lt;ref name="presidential" /&gt; and the Russian [[Fundamental Physics Prize|Special Fundamental Physics Prize]] (2013).&lt;ref name="FPP-Dec2012" /&gt;

During his career, Hawking supervised 39 successful PhD students.&lt;ref name="mathgene"/&gt; One doctoral student did not successfully complete the PhD.&lt;ref name="mathgene"/&gt;{{better source|date=August 2018}} As required by Cambridge University regulations, Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009.&lt;ref name=lucasian/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Auto2J-11"/&gt; Despite suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=238–39}} Hawking worked as director of research at the Cambridge University Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.&lt;ref name="tel2012" /&gt;

On 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Billings|first1=Lee|title=Time Travel Simulation Resolves 'Grandfather Paradox'|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-travel-simulation-resolves-grandfather-paradox/|access-date=2 September 2016|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
When Hawking was a graduate student at Cambridge, his relationship with [[Jane Hawking|Jane Wilde]], a friend of his sister whom he had met shortly before his late 1963 diagnosis with motor neurone disease, continued to develop. The couple became engaged in October 1964{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37–40}}{{snd}}Hawking later said that the engagement gave him "something to live for"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=40}}{{snd}}and the two were married on 14 July 1965.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43–44}}

During their first years of marriage, Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree, and they travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. The couple had difficulty finding housing that was within Hawking's walking distance to the [[Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] (DAMTP). Jane began a PhD programme, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=45–47}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=92–98}} A daughter, [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], was born in 1970.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}} A third child, Timothy, was born in April 1979.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}

Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even{{snd}}in a precedent set during their courtship{{snd}}with Jane.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37–39, 77}} His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=78}} Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]], Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and [[Bernard Carr]] travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82–83}}&lt;ref name="black" /&gt; The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=83–88}}

Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]]. [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her thesis and her new interest in singing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 89–90}}

By December 1977, Jane had met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiv, 79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|pp=279–80}} According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating "he would not object so long as I continued to love him".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|p=285}} Jane and Hellyer Jones determined not to break up the family, and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=91–92}}

By the 1980s, Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 164–65}} The impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 185}}&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt; Hawking's views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension.&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 80–81}}&lt;ref name="obs2004" /&gt; In the late 1980s, Hawking had grown close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 145}} Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 165}} and departed the family home in February 1990.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp = x–xix}} After his divorce from Jane in 1995, Hawking married Mason in September,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp = 186–87}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp = x–xix}} declaring, "It's wonderful{{snd}}I have married the woman I love."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 187}}

In 1999, Jane Hawking published a memoir, ''Music to Move the Stars'', describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=187, 192}} After his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life.&lt;ref name=obs2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name= sundaytimes /&gt; For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused.&lt;ref name= sundaytimes /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=197, 225}} Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint.&lt;ref name= sundaytimes /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-22" /&gt;

In 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced,&lt;ref name="Auto2J-25" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children, and his grandchildren.&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} Reflecting this happier period, a revised version of Jane's book called ''Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen'' appeared in 2007,&lt;ref name="sundaytimes" /&gt; and was made into a film, ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|The Theory of Everything]]'', in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eddie Redmayne wins first Oscar for 'Theory of Everything'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-oscars-actor/eddie-redmayne-wins-first-oscar-for-theory-of-everything-idUSKBN0LR0AF20150223|access-date=7 March 2015|agency=Reuters|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disability ===
Hawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of [[motor neurone disease]] (also known as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], "[[ALS]]", or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease), that gradually paralysed him over the decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=32}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-6" /&gt; The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly [[dysarthria|slurred]] and his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=59}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=34–35}} The diagnosis of motor neurone disease came when Hawking was 21, in 1963. At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=59–61}}

In the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined: he began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=48–49}} As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=76–77}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=124–25}} The physicist [[Werner Israel]] later compared the achievements to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] composing an entire symphony in his head.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-8" /&gt;{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=124}} Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be regarded as "a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=viii}} His wife, [[Jane Hawking]], later noted: "Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=48}} He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s,{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=117}} but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=162}} Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from some.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=48}}

Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=81–82}} Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,{{sfn|Mialet|2003|pp=450–51}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=79, 149}} including adapted student housing at the university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=273–74}} In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a [[disability rights]] champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=193–94}} His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=194}}

During a visit to [[CERN]] on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted [[pneumonia]], which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a [[tracheotomy]], which required round-the-clock nursing care and the removal of what remained of his speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=135–36}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=232–36}} The [[National Health Service]] was ready to pay for a [[nursing home]], but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=235–36}} Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=139}}

For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose [[Partner-assisted scanning|letters on a spelling card]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=136}} but in 1986 he received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also suffered from ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.&lt;ref name="Medeiros" /&gt; In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500–3,000 that were [[Switch access scanning|scanned]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=137–38}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=236–37}} The program was originally run on a desktop computer. Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=140}} Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that "I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140–41}} The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-15" /&gt; Despite the later availability of other voices, Hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-16" /&gt; Originally, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to [[Typing#Alphanumeric entry|15 words a minute]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=137}} Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] in short sections to be delivered.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}

Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=224}}&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hacked" /&gt; with a rate of about one word per minute.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt; With this decline there was a risk of his developing [[locked-in syndrome]], so Hawking collaborated with [[Intel]] researchers on systems that could translate his [[Neural oscillation|brain patterns]] or facial expressions into switch activations. After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup [[SwiftKey]], which used a system similar to his original technology. Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.&lt;ref name="hacked" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medeiros"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/|title=How Intel Gave Stephen Hawking a Voice|first=Joao|last=Medeiros|date=13 January 2015|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="start" /&gt; By 2009 he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin. This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy.&lt;ref name="Medeiros" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=240}} Near the end of his life, Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a [[ventilator]], and being regularly hospitalised.&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt;

=== Disability outreach ===
Starting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=164, 178}} At the turn of the century, he and eleven other luminaries signed the ''Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability'', which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of the disabled.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-19" /&gt;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=196}} In 1999, Hawking was awarded the [[Lilienfeld Prize|Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize]] of the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref name="Auto2J-20" /&gt;

In August 2012, Hawking narrated the "Enlightenment" segment of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony]] in London.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-54" /&gt; In 2013, the biographical documentary film ''[[Hawking (2013 film)|Hawking]]'', in which Hawking himself is featured, was released.&lt;ref name="NYT-20130913" /&gt; In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalisation of [[assisted suicide]] for the terminally ill.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-55" /&gt; In August 2014, Hawking accepted the [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research. As he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-57" /&gt;

=== Plans for a trip to space ===
[[File:Physicist Stephen Hawking in Zero Gravity NASA.jpg|alt=Hawking, without his wheelchair, floating weightless in the air inside a plane|thumb|upright=1.15|Hawking taking a zero-gravity flight in a [[reduced-gravity aircraft]], 2007]]
In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-32" /&gt; on hearing this, [[Richard Branson]] offered a free flight into space with [[Virgin Galactic]], which Hawking immediately accepted. Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=nyt2007 /&gt; On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a [[reduced-gravity aircraft|specially-modified]] Boeing 727–200 jet operated by [[Zero Gravity Corporation|Zero-G Corp]] off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=232–33}} Fears the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved groundless, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-32" /&gt; It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight.&lt;ref name = "Leonard2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549898/Branson-to-help-Hawking-live-space-dream.html | title =Branson to help Hawking live space dream | last1= Leonard | first1 =T. | last2= Osborne | first2 =A. | date =27 April 2007 | website = The Telegraph | access-date = 15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death.&lt;ref name = "Dean2018"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2018/03/14/stephen-hawking-experienced-freedom-weightlessness-during-kennedy-space-center-visit/424663002/ | title = Stephen Hawking felt freedom of weightlessness during KSC visit | last = Dean | first = James | date = 14 March 2018 | website = USA Today | access-date = 15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[Black hole thermodynamics|black hole temperature]], &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] [[Reduced Planck Constant|divided by &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is Einstein's [[speed of light]], &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is Newton's [[gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] of the black hole, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]. This relationship between concepts from the disparate fields of [[general relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]] implies the existence of deep connections between them and may presage their [[Theory of everything|unification]]. It is inscribed on Hawking's memorial stone.&lt;ref name = "Bever2018"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/06/15/stephen-hawkings-farewell-as-his-ashes-were-buried-his-voice-was-beamed-into-space/ | title= Stephen Hawking's farewell: As his ashes were buried, his voice was beamed into space | last= Bever | first= Lindsey | date= 15 June 2018 | website= Washington Post | accessdate= 2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation's most fundamental implication can be obtained as follows. According to thermodynamics, this temperature is associated with an [[entropy]], &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;T = M c^2/2 S,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M c^2&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a (nonspinning) black hole as expressed with [[Mass–energy equivalence|Einstein's formula]].&lt;ref name="Walecka2007"&gt;{{cite book|last= Walecka|first=John Dirk|title=Introduction to General Relativity|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2V-ulG8RMtoC&amp;pg=PA305|year= 2007|publisher= World Scientific|isbn=978-981-270-584-6|page= 305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining equations then gives:

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{4 \pi G M^2 k}{\hbar c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the [[Schwarzschild radius|radius of a nonspinning black hole]] is given by &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{2 G M}{c^2},&lt;/math&gt; and since its [[Surface area of a sphere|surface area]] is just &lt;math&gt;A = 4 \pi r^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of surface area as:

&lt;ref name = "Highfield2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Griffin2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Griffin |first1=Andrew |title= Stephen Hawking death: The equation the professor asked to be put on his tombstone |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-death-dies-equation-discovery-tombstone-radiation-nobel-a8254966.html |access-date=17 March 2018 |work=[[The Independent (UK)|The Independent]] |date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_\text{BH} = \frac{k c^3}{4 \hbar G} A,&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript BH stands for either "black hole" or "Bekenstein–Hawking". This can be expressed more simply as a proportionality between two [[dimensionless]] ratios:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S_\text{BH}}{k} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{A}{A_\text{P}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_\text{P} = \hbar G / c^3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck units#Derived units|Planck area]] (the unit of area in quantum mechanics). Use of [[Planck units]] (in which &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_\text{P}&lt;/math&gt; are set to unity) reduces it further to:

:&lt;math&gt;S_\text{BH} = \frac{A}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Jacob Bekenstein]] had conjectured the proportionality; Hawking confirmed it and established the constant of proportionality at &lt;math&gt;1/4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Guardian.Death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-10" /&gt; Calculations based on [[string theory]], first carried out in 1995, have been found to yield the same result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Strominger | first1 = A.| last2 = Vafa | first2 = C.| title = Microscopic origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy| journal = Physics Letters B| volume = 379| pages = 99–104| year = 1996| doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(96)00345-0|arxiv = hep-th/9601029 |bibcode = 1996PhLB..379...99S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This relationship is conjectured to be valid not just for black holes, but also (since [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy is proportional to information]]) as an [[Bekenstein bound|upper bound]] on the amount of information that can be contained in any volume of space, which has in turn spawned deeper reflections on the possible [[Holographic principle|nature of reality]].}} in June 2018, it was announced that Hawking's words, set to music by Greek composer [[Vangelis]], are to be beamed into space from a European space agency satellite dish in Spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole, [[A0620-00|1A 0620-00]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking's words will be beamed into space |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-44481914 |accessdate=20 October 2018 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: "In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?", later clarifying: "I don't know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |date=2 August 2006 |title=The great man's answer to the question of human survival: Er, I don't know |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/aug/03/scientists.spaceexploration |work=The Guardian |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawking was concerned about the future emergence of a race of “superhumans” that would be able to design their own evolution&lt;ref name="WP-20181015" /&gt; and, as well, argued that [[computer virus]]es in today's world should be considered a new form of life, stating that "maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own image."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=179}}

=== Science vs. philosophy ===
At Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Hawking said that "philosophy is dead". He believed that philosophers "have not kept up with modern developments in science" and that scientists "have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge". He said that [[List of unsolved problems in philosophy|philosophical problems]] can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which "lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it".&lt;ref name="Auto2J-53" /&gt;

=== Religion and atheism ===
Hawking was an [[Atheism|atheist]]&lt;ref name="atheist"/&gt; and believed that "the universe is governed by the laws of science". He stated: "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."&lt;ref name=Hollowverse&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hollowverse.com/stephen-hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking's Religion and Political Views|publisher=Hollowverse}}{{self-published inline|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Hawking regarded "the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail", and the concept of an [[afterlife]] as a "fairy story for people afraid of the dark".&lt;ref name="NYT=20180314" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sample" /&gt; In 2011, narrating the first episode of the American television series ''[[Curiosity (TV series)|Curiosity]]'' on the [[Discovery Channel]], Hawking declared:

{{quote|We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto2J-51" /&gt;}}

In September 2014, he joined the [[Starmus Festival]] as keynote speaker and declared himself an atheist.&lt;ref name="Auto2J-52" /&gt; In an interview with ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', he said:

{{quote|Before we understand science, it is natural to believe that God created the universe. But now science offers a more convincing explanation. What I meant by 'we would know the mind of God' is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist.&lt;ref name="atheist"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyle|first1=Alan|title='I'm an Atheist': Stephen Hawking on God and Space Travel|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/im-atheist-stephen-hawking-god-space-travel-n210076|access-date=12 January 2017|publisher=NBC News|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, Hawking has stated:
{{quote|If you like, you can call the laws of science ‘God,’ but it wouldn’t be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to.&lt;ref name="WP-20181015" /&gt;}}

=== Politics ===
Hawking was a longstanding [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=195}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}} He recorded a tribute for the 2000 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Al Gore]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=195}} called the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] a "[[war crime]]",{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-34" /&gt; supported the [[academic boycott of Israel]],&lt;ref name="Auto2J-35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130508" /&gt; campaigned for [[nuclear disarmament]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=195}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}} and supported [[stem cell]] research,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=223}}&lt;ref name="Auto2J-37" /&gt; [[universal health care]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=242}} and action to prevent [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=ind2007 /&gt; In August 2014, Hawking was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref name="Auto2J-56" /&gt; Hawking believed a [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union]] (Brexit) would damage the UK's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Radford |first=Tim |date=31 May 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/31/stephen-hawking-donald-trump-popularity-inexplicable-and-brexit-spells-disaster |title=Trump's popularity inexplicable and Brexit spells disaster, says Stephen Hawking |work=The Guardian |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking was disappointed by Brexit and warned against envy and isolationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43399019|title=Stephen Hawking's political views|author=|date=14 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawking was greatly concerned over health care, and maintained that without the UK [[National Health Service]], he could not have survived into his 70s.&lt;ref name="bbc20/8/2017" /&gt; He stated, "I have received excellent medical attention in Britain, and I felt it was important to set the record straight. I believe in [[universal health care]]. And I am not afraid to say so."&lt;ref name=Hollowverse /&gt;

Hawking feared privatisation. He stated, "The more profit is extracted from the system, the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes. The NHS must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Triggle |first=Nick |date=19 August 2017 |title=Stephen Hawking: I'm worried about the future of the NHS |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40967309 |work=BBC News |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking alleged ministers damaged the NHS, he blamed the Conservatives for cutting funding, weakening the NHS by privatisation, lowering staff morale through holding pay back and reducing social care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Denis |date=18 August 2017 |title=Stephen Hawking blames Tory politicians for damaging NHS |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/18/stephen-hawking-blames-tory-politicians-for-damaging-nhs |work=The Guardian |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking accused [[Jeremy Hunt]] of [[cherry picking]] evidence which Hawking maintained debased science.&lt;ref name="bbc20/8/2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=20 August 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-40990288/stephen-hawking-i-wouldn-t-be-here-without-the-nhs |title=Hawking v Hunt: What happened? |work=BBC News |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking also stated, "There is overwhelming evidence that NHS funding and the numbers of doctors and nurses are inadequate, and it is getting worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |date=27 August 2017 |title=Jeremy Hunt continues war of words with Stephen Hawking over NHS |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/27/jeremy-hunt-continues-war-of-words-with-stephen-hawking-over-nhs |work=The Guardian |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Hawking endorsed the Labour Party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]], citing the Conservatives' proposed cuts to the NHS. But he was also critical of Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], expressing scepticism over whether the party could win a general election under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking announces he is voting Labour: 'The Tories would be a disaster' |author=Griffin, Andrew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-jeremy-corbyn-labour-theresa-may-conservatives-endorsement-general-election-a7774016.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=6 June 2017 |access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawking feared [[Donald Trump]]'s policies on global warming could endanger the planet and make global warming irreversible. He said, "Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it's one we can prevent if we act now. By denying the evidence for climate change, and pulling out of the [[Paris Agreement]], Donald Trump will cause avoidable environmental damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |date=2 July 2017 |title=Hawking says Trump's climate stance could damage Earth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-40461726 |work=BBC News |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking further stated that this could lead Earth "to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eleftheriou-Smith |first=Loulla-Mae |date=3 July 2017 |title=Stephen Hawking says Donald Trump could turn Earth into Venus-like planet with 250C and sulphuric acid rain |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-donald-trump-paris-climate-change-agreement-earth-brink-global-warming-us-fossil-a7820336.html |work=The Independent |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Stephen Hawking, [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Carl Sagan]] were interviewed in ''[[God, the Universe and Everything Else]]''. They discussed the [[Big Bang theory]], God and the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]].

At the release party for the home video version of the ''A Brief History of Time'', [[Leonard Nimoy]], who had played [[Spock]] on ''[[Star Trek]]'', learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1993.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=177–78}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=93–94}}{{sfn|Okuda|Okuda|1999|p=380}} The same year, his synthesizer voice was recorded for the [[Pink Floyd]] song "[[Keep Talking]]",{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiii, 94}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=178}} and in 1999 for an appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=192}} Hawking appeared in documentaries titled ''The Real Stephen Hawking'' (2001),{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=196}} ''Stephen Hawking: Profile'' (2002){{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=221}} and ''[[Hawking (2013 film)|Hawking]]'' (2013), and the documentary series ''Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Auto2J-26" /&gt; Hawking also guest-starred in ''[[Futurama]]''&lt;ref name="dt70" /&gt; and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc-bbt" /&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
[[File:Stephen hawking and lucy hawking nasa 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Photograph of Hawking and his daughter Lucy on-stage at a presentation|Stephen Hawking being presented by his daughter [[Lucy Hawking]] at the lecture he gave for [[NASA]]'s 50th anniversary]]
Hawking received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (FRS). At that time, his nomination read:

{{quote|Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on "Space-time in the Large".}}

The citation continues, "Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors."&lt;ref name="royal" /&gt;

Hawking received the 2015 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in Basic Sciences shared with [[Viatcheslav Mukhanov]] for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the early Universe. At the 2016 [[Pride of Britain Awards]], Hawking received the lifetime achievement award "for his contribution to science and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]". After receiving the award from Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], Hawking humorously requested that she not seek his help with [[Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corkery |first=Claire |date=1 November 2016 |title=Pride of Britain 2016: Stephen Hawking makes Brexit joke at PM Theresa May's expense |url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/727766/Pride-of-Britain-awards-2016-Stephen-Hawking-Brexit-Theresa-May-Carol-Vorderman |work=Express |access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication ===
{{Main|Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication}}
Hawking was a member of the Advisory Board of the [[Starmus Festival]], and had a major role in acknowledging and promoting science communication. The [[Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication]] is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starmus.com/stephen-hawking-medals-for-science-communication/|title=Stephen Hawking Medals For Science Communication|publisher=STARMUS|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients receive a medal bearing a portrait of Stephen Hawking by [[Alexei Leonov]], and the other side represents an image of Leonov himself performing his famous space walk and the iconic "[[Red Special]]", [[Brian May]]'s guitar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[Starmus Festival#2016 Starmus Festival, "Starmus III"|Starmus III Festival]] in 2016 was a tribute to Stephen Hawking and the book of all Starmus III lectures, "Beyond the Horizon", was also dedicated to him.  The first recipients of the medals, which were awarded at the festival, were chosen by Hawking himself.  They were composer [[Hans Zimmer]], physicist [[Jim Al-Khalili]], and the science documentary ''[[Particle Fever]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Black Hole discovery dedication ===
In March 2018, it was announced that two Russian astronomers who discovered GRB180316A, a newborn black hole in the [[Ophiuchus]] constellation on 16 March 2018, had dedicated their find to Stephen Hawking, having discovered it two days after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/421874-astronomers-devote-black-hole-hawking/|title=Russian astronomers devote newly-discovered black hole to Stephen Hawking|publisher=Russia Today|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Smale''' (born July 15, 1930) is an American [[mathematician]] from [[Flint, Michigan]]. His research concerns [[topology]], [[dynamical system]]s and [[mathematical economics]]. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/opinion/sunday/how-math-got-its-nobel-.html?_r=0|title=How Math Got Its ‘Nobel’|date=8 August 2014|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent more than three decades on the mathematics faculty of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1960–1961 and 1964–1995).

==Education and career==
Smale entered the [[University of Michigan]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcmcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA225|title=The Britannica Guide to Geometry|date=2010|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|isbn=9781615302178|editor=William L. Hosch|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1cLnAm7gcwC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Steven Smale: The Mathematician Who Broke the Dimension Barrier|last=Batterson|first=Steve|date=2000|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821826966|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was a good student, placing into an honors [[calculus]] sequence taught by Bob Thrall and earning himself A's.  However, his [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] and junior years were marred with mediocre grades, mostly Bs, Cs and even an F in [[nuclear physics]].  However, with some luck, Smale was accepted as a graduate student at the University of Michigan's mathematics department.  Yet again, Smale performed poorly in his first years, earning a C average as a graduate student.  It was only when the department chair, [[Theophil Henry Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]], threatened to kick Smale out that he began to work hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|LmpPUjOeMGI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smale finally earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1957, under [[Raoul Bott]].

Smale began his career as an instructor at the college at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1958, he astounded the mathematical world with a proof of a [[sphere eversion]]. He then cemented his reputation with a proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] for all dimensions greater than or equal to 5, published in 1961; in 1962 he generalized the ideas in a 107-page paper that established the [[h-cobordism theorem]].

After having made great strides in [[topology]], he then turned to the study of [[dynamical systems]], where he made significant advances as well.  His first contribution is the [[Horseshoe map|Smale horseshoe]] that started significant research in dynamical systems.  He also outlined a research program carried out by many others. Smale is also known for injecting [[Morse theory]] into mathematical [[economics]], as well as recent explorations of various theories of [[computation]].

In 1998 he compiled a list of 18 problems in [[mathematics]] to be solved in the 21st century, known as [[Smale's problems]]. This list was compiled in the spirit of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s famous list of problems produced in 1900. In fact, Smale's list contains some of the original Hilbert problems, including the [[Riemann hypothesis]] and the second half of [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]], both of which are still unsolved.  Other famous problems on his list include the [[Poincaré conjecture]] (now a theorem, proved by [[Grigori Perelman]]), the [[P = NP problem]], and the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness|Navier–Stokes equations]], all of which have been designated [[Millennium Prize Problems]] by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].

Earlier in his career, Smale was involved in controversy over remarks he made regarding his work habits while proving the higher-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. He said that his best work had been done "on the beaches of Rio".&lt;ref&gt;He discovered the famous [[Smale horseshoe map]] on a beach in [[Leme (Rio de Janeiro)|Leme]], [[Rio de Janeiro]].  See: S.&amp;nbsp;Smale (1996), [http://math.berkeley.edu/~smale/biblio/chaos.ps Chaos: Finding a Horseshoe on the Beaches of Rio].&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the withholding of his grant money from the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]].  He has been politically active in various movements in the past, such as the [[Free Speech movement]] and the movement against the Vietnam War.  At one time he was [[subpoena]]ed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].

In 1960 Smale was appointed an associate professor of mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], moving to a professorship at [[Columbia University]] the following year. In 1964 he returned to a professorship at UC Berkeley where he has spent the main part of his career. He retired from UC Berkeley in 1995 and took up a post as professor at the [[City University of Hong Kong]]. He also amassed over the years one of the finest private mineral collections in existence. Many of Smale's mineral specimens can be seen in the book—''The Smale Collection: Beauty in Natural Crystals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lithographie.org/bookshop/the_smale_collection.htm|title=Lithographie LTD|author=|date=|website=www.lithographie.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002 Smale is a Professor at the [[Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago]]; starting August 1, 2009, he is also a Distinguished University Professor at the [[City University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smale/vita.html Stephen Smale Vita.]  Accessed November 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Smale was awarded the [[Wolf Prize]] in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huji.ac.il/cgi-bin/dovrut/dovrut_search_eng_dev.pl?mesge116895485932688760|title=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Division of Marketing &amp; Communication|author=|date=|website=www.huji.ac.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[Samuel Eilenberg]]'s [[X-machine]], an extended [[finite state machine]] for processing data of the type ''X'',&lt;ref  name="Eil74"&gt;Samuel Eilenberg (1974)
  ''Automata, Languages and Machines, Vol. A''.
  London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Stream X-Machine is a kind of [[X-machine]] for processing a memory data type ''Mem'' with associated input and output streams ''In''* and ''Out''*, that is, where ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*.  The transitions of a Stream X-Machine are labelled by functions of the form φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', that is, which compute an output value and update the memory, from the current memory and an input value.

Although the general [[X-machine]] had been identified in the 1980s as a potentially useful formal model for specifying software systems,&lt;ref name="Hol88"&gt;
M. Holcombe (1988) 'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification'. ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3''' ''(2)'', pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until the emergence of the Stream X-Machine that this idea could be fully exploited.  Florentin Ipate and Mike Holcombe went on to develop a theory of ''complete'' [[functional testing]],&lt;ref
  name="HolIp98"&gt;Mike Holcombe and Florentin Ipate (1998)
  ''Correct systems - building a business process solution''.
  Applied Computing Series.
  Berlin: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; in which complex software systems with hundreds of thousands of states and millions of transitions could be decomposed into separate SXMs that could be tested exhaustively, with a guaranteed proof of correct integration.&lt;ref name="IpHol97"&gt;F. Ipate and W. M. L. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method which is proved to find all faults'. ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'', '''63''', pp. 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the intuitive interpretation of Stream X-Machines as "processing agents with inputs and outputs", they have attracted increasing interest, because of their utility in modelling real-world phenomena.  The SXM model has important applications in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]], [[software testing]] and [[Computational economics|agent-based computational economics]].

== The Stream X-Machine ==

A Stream X-Machine (SXM) is an extended [[finite state machine]] with auxiliary memory, inputs and outputs.  It is a variant of the general [[X-machine]], in which the fundamental data type ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, that is, a tuple consisting of an output stream,  the memory and an input stream. A SXM separates the ''control flow'' of a system from the ''processing'' carried out by the system.  The control is modelled by a [[finite state machine]] (known as the ''associated automaton'') whose transitions are labelled with processing functions chosen from a set Φ (known as the ''type'' of the machine), which act upon the fundamental data type.

Each processing function in Φ is a partial function, and can be considered to have the type φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', where ''Mem'' is the memory type, and ''In'' and ''Out'' are respectively the input and output types.  In any given state, a transition is ''enabled'' if the domain of the associated function φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; includes the next input value and the current memory state.  If (at most) one transition is enabled in a given state, the machine is ''deterministic''.  Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the associated function φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, which consumes one input, possibly modifies the memory and produces one output.  Each recognised path through the machine therefore generates a list φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of functions, and the SXM composes these functions together to generate a relation on the fundamental data type |φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;|: ''X'' → ''X''.

=== Relationship to X-machines ===

The Stream X-Machine is a variant of [[X-machine]] in which the fundamental data type ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*.  In the original [[X-machine]], the φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are general ''relations'' on ''X''.  In the Stream X-Machine, these are usually restricted to ''functions''; however the SXM is still only deterministic if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state.

A general [[X-machine]] handles input and output using a prior encoding function α: ''Y'' → ''X'' for input, and a posterior decoding function β: ''X'' → ''Z'' for output, where ''Y'' and ''Z'' are respectively the input and output types.  In a Stream X-Machine, these types are streams:

  ''Y'' = ''In''*
  ''Z'' = ''Out''*

and the encoding and decoding functions are defined as:

  α(''ins'') = (&lt;&gt;, ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ins'')
  β(''outs'', ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;&gt;) = ''outs''

where ''ins: In''*, ''outs: Out''* and ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: ''Mem''.  In other words, the machine is initialized with the whole of the input stream; and the decoded result is the whole of the output stream, provided the input stream is eventually consumed (otherwise the result is undefined).

Each processing function in a SXM is given the abbreviated type φ&lt;sub&gt;SXM&lt;/sub&gt;: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem''.  This can be mapped onto a general [[X-machine]] relation of the type φ: X → X if we treat this as computing:

  φ(''outs'', ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''in'' :: ''ins'') = (''outs'' :: ''out'', ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ins'')

where &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; denotes concatenation of an element and a sequence.  In other words, the relation extracts the head of the input stream, modifies memory and appends a value to the tail of the output stream.

=== Processing and Testable Properties ===

Because of the above equivalence, attention may focus on the way a Stream X-Machine processes inputs into outputs, using an auxiliary memory.  Given an initial memory state ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and an input stream ''ins'', the machine executes in a step-wise fashion, consuming one input at a time, and generating one output at a time.  Provided that (at least) one recognised path ''path'' = φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; exists leading to a state in which the input has been consumed, the machine yields a final memory state ''mem''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and an output stream ''outs''.  In general, we can think of this as the relation computed by all recognised paths:  | ''path'' | : ''In''* → ''Out''*. This is often called the ''behaviour'' of the Stream X-Machine.

The behaviour is deterministic, if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state.  This property, and the ability to control how the machine behaves in a step-wise fashion in response to inputs and memory, makes it an ideal model for the specification of software systems.  If the specification and implementation are both assumed to be Stream X-Machines, then the implementation may be tested for conformance to the specification machine, by observing the inputs and outputs at each step.  Laycock first highlighted the utility of single-step processing with observations for testing purposes.&lt;ref name="Lay93" /&gt;

Holcombe and Ipate developed this into a practical theory of software testing&lt;ref name="HolIp98" /&gt; which was fully compositional, scaling up to very large systems.&lt;ref name="IpHol98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'. ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  A proof of correct integration&lt;ref name="IpHol97" /&gt; guarantees that  testing each component and each integration layer separately corresponds to testing the whole system.  This divide-and-conquer approach makes ''exhaustive'' testing feasible for large systems.

The testing method is described in a separate article on the [[X-Machine Testing|Stream X-Machine testing methodology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5867">Heisenberg's [[uncertainty relation]] is one of the fundamental results in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;W. Heisenberg, Z. Phys. '''43''', 172 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; Later Robertson proved the uncertainty relation for two general non-commuting [[observables]],&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Robertson, Phys. Rev. '''34''', 163 (1929). &lt;/ref&gt; which was strengthened by [[Schrödinger]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Schrödinger, "Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften", Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse '''14''', 296 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; However,  the conventional uncertainty relation like the Roberstson-Schrödinger relation cannot give a non-trivial bound for the product of variances of two incompatible observables  because the lower bound in the uncertainty  inequalities can be null and hence trivial even for observables that are incompatible on the state of the system. The Heisenberg–Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation  was proved at the dawn of quantum formalism and is ever-present in the teaching and research on quantum mechanics.  After about 85 years of existence of the uncertainty relation this problem was solved recently by Lorenzo Maccone and [[Arun K. Pati]].
The standard uncertainty relations are expressed in terms of the product of variances of the measurement results of the observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and the product can be null even when one of the two variances is different from zero. However, the stronger uncertainty relations due to Maccone and Pati provide different uncertainty relations, based on the sum of variances that are guaranteed to be nontrivial whenever the observables are incompatible on the state of the quantum system.&lt;ref&gt; L. Maccone and A. K. Pati, "Stronger uncertainty relations for all incompatible observables", Phys. Rev. Lett. '''113''', 260401 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations==
The Heisenberg–Robertson or Schrödinger uncertainty relations do not fully capture the incompatibility of observables in a given quantum state. The stronger uncertainty relations give non-trivial bounds on the sum of the variances for two incompatible observables. For two non-commuting observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the first stronger uncertainty relation is given by 

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta A^2 + \Delta B^2 \ge \pm i \langle \Psi|[A, B]|\Psi \rangle  + | \langle \Psi|(A \pm i B)|{\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \Delta A^2 = \langle \Psi |A^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi |A |\Psi \rangle^2   &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \Delta B^2 = \langle \Psi |B^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi |B |\Psi \rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|{\bar \Psi} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a vector that is orthogonal to the state of the system, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\langle \Psi| {\bar \Psi} \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; and 
one should chose the sign of  &lt;math&gt;\pm i \langle \Psi|[A, B]|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; so that this  is a positive number.

The other non-trivial stronger uncertainty  relation is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta A^2 + \Delta B^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}| \langle {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} |(A + B)| \Psi \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is a unit vector orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
The form of &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; implies that the right-hand side of the new uncertainty relation 
is nonzero unless &lt;math&gt;| \Psi\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;.

One can prove an improved version of the Heisenberg–Robertson uncertainty relation which reads as

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta A \Delta B \ge  \frac{ \pm  \frac{i}{2} \langle \Psi|[A, B]|\Psi \rangle }{1- \frac{1}{2} | \langle \Psi|( \frac{A}{\Delta A}  \pm i  \frac{B}{\Delta B} )| {\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2 }. &lt;/math&gt;

The Heisenberg–Robertson uncertainty relation follows from the above uncertainty relation.
 
==Remarks==
In quantum theory one should distinguish between the uncertainty relation and the uncertainty principle. The former refers solely to the preparation of the system which induces a spread in the measurement outcomes, and does not refer to the disturbance induced by the measurement. The uncertainty principle captures the measurement disturbance by the apparatus and the impossibility of joint measurements of incompatible observables. The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations refer to preparation uncertainty relations. These relations set strong limitations for the nonexistence of common eigenstates for incompatible observables. The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations have been experimentally tested for qutrit systems.&lt;ref&gt; K. Wang, X. Zhan, Z. Bian, J. Li, Y. Zhang, and P. Xue, "Experimental investigation of the stronger uncertainty relations for all incompatible observables", Phys. Rev. A '''93''', 052108 (2016). &lt;/ref&gt;
It is a curious fact that a basic result such as the Heisenberg–Robertson uncertainty relation within quantum mechanics has an important problem which, although probably being for long noticed by several teachers and researchers in the area, was solved so much time after its conception.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Maziero, "The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relation", Rev. Bras. Ens. Fis. '''39''', e4306 (2017) ; arXiv:1705.09139.&lt;/ref&gt;
The new uncertainty relations may be far ranging because they not only capture the incompatibility of observables but also of quantities that are physically measurable (as variances can be measured in the experiment). Since the uncertainty relations have fundamental significance in quantum physics, this result may find a wide range of applications including quantum cryptography, quantum entanglement, quantum computation and physics in general.

'''Thomas Starkie''' (2 January 1782 – 15 April 1849) was an [[England|English]] [[lawyer]] and [[jurist]]. A talented [[mathematician]] in his youth, he especially contributed to the unsuccessful attempts to codify the English [[criminal law]] in the nineteenth century.

==Early life==
Born in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]], Thomas was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Starkie, [[vicar]] of Blackburn, and his wife, Ann ''née'' Yatman. He was educated at [[Clitheroe Royal Grammar School]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], from where he [[graduation|graduated]] in 1803 as [[senior wrangler]] and first [[Smith's prize]]man. In the same year, he became a [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]] of [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=STRY799T|name=Starkie, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 he married Lucy, eldest daughter of Rev. [[Thomas Dunham Whitaker]] which entailed that he resign his fellowship. The couple went on to parent five children.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Lobban (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal practice==
Starkie entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] as a [[pupillage|pupil]] of [[Joseph Chitty (the elder)|Joseph Chitty]] and was [[called to the bar]] in 1810, proceeding to practise as a [[special pleader]] as well as on the northern circuit, and becoming a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In 1823 he became [[Downing Professor of the Laws of England|Downing Professor]] of law at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] though he had little success in attracting pupils with his poor presentations, a fate shared with his contemporary [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]]. He repeated his failure at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1833. However, in 1833, Starkie was appointed to the [[royal commission]] on a proposed [[English Criminal Code]] and spent the rest of his life on various commissions on reform and codification of the criminal law. He was not always popular with his colleagues, [[Charles Henry Bellenden Ker|Henry Bellenden Ker]] calling him "childish" and "desultory and wayward".&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

He was also a sometime [[law report]]er and author of the influential texts: ''A Practical Treatise on the Law of Slander, Libel, and Incidentally of Malicious Prosecutions'' (1812) and ''A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence'' (1824). In 1847, Starkie became a [[judge]] in the [[Clerkenwell]] [[small-debts court]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

He died in his rooms in [[Downing College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Politics==
Starkie's instincts were [[Tory]] and he opposed the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]]. However, in 1840 he unsuccessfully stood as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] candidate in [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

[[Image:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|right|250px|A diagram depicting the poloidal (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) direction, represented by the red arrow, and the toroidal (&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) direction, represented by the blue arrow.]]The earliest use of these terms cited by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is by [[Walter M. Elsasser]] (1946) in the context of the generation of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] by currents in the core, with "toroidal" being parallel to lines of latitude and "poloidal" being in the direction of the magnetic field (i.e. towards the poles).

The OED also records the later usage of these terms in the context of toroidally confined plasmas, as encountered in [[magnetic confinement fusion]]. In the plasma context, the toroidal direction is the long way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by ''z'' in the slab approximation or &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic coordinates; the poloidal direction is the short way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by ''y'' in the slab approximation or &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic coordinates. (The third direction, normal to the magnetic surfaces, is often called the "radial direction", denoted by ''x'' in the slab approximation and variously &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, ''r'', &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, or ''s'' in magnetic coordinates.)

==Toroidal and poloidal coordinates==
As a simple example from the physics of magnetically confined plasmas, consider an axisymmetric system with circular, concentric magnetic flux surfaces of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (a crude approximation to the magnetic field geometry in an early [Tokamak] but topologically equivalent to any toroidal magnetic confinement system with nested flux surfaces) and denote the toroidal angle by &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; and the poloidal angle by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the Toroidal/Poloidal coordinate system relates to standard [[Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_three_dimensions|Cartesian Coordinates]] by these transformation rules:

:&lt;math&gt; x  = (R_0 +r \cos \theta) \cos\zeta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y  = s_\zeta (R_0 + r \cos \theta) \sin\zeta  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z  = s_\theta r \sin \theta. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = \pm 1, s_\zeta = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The natural choice [[Torus#Geometry|geometrically]] is to take &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, giving the toroidal and poloidal directions shown by the arrows in the figure above, but this makes &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\zeta&lt;/math&gt; a left-handed curvilinear coordinate system. As it is usually assumed in setting up [http://www-fusion.ciemat.es/fusionwiki/index.php/Flux_coordinates#Flux_coordinates|''flux coordinates''] for describing magnetically confined plasmas that  the set &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\zeta&lt;/math&gt; forms a ''right''-handed coordinate system, &lt;math&gt; \nabla r\cdot\nabla\theta\times\nabla\zeta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must either reverse the poloidal direction by taking &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = -1, s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, or reverse the toroidal direction by taking &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = +1, s_\zeta = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Both choices are used in the literature.

==Kinematics in toroidal and poloidal coordinates==

To study single particle motion in toroidally confined plasma devices, velocity and acceleration vectors must be known. Considering the natural choice &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, the unit vectors of toroidal and poloidal coordinates system &lt;math&gt;\left(r,\theta,\zeta\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta \cos\zeta \\
    \cos\theta \sin\zeta \\
    \sin\theta
\end{pmatrix} \quad
\mathbf{e}_\theta = \begin{pmatrix}
    -\sin\theta \cos\zeta \\
    -\sin\theta \sin\zeta \\
    \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix} \quad
\mathbf{e}_\zeta = \begin{pmatrix}
    -\sin\zeta \\
    \cos\zeta \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

according to Cartesian coordinates. The position vector is expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = \left( r + R_0 \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_r - R_0 \sin\theta \mathbf{e}_\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The velocity vector is then given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\dot{r}} = \dot{r} \mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta} \mathbf{e}_\theta + \dot{\zeta} \left( R_0 + r \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_\zeta &lt;/math&gt;

and the acceleration vector is:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\ddot{r}} = \left( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 - r \dot{\zeta}^2 \cos^2\theta - R_0 \dot{\zeta}^2 \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_r &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; + \left( 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} + r\dot{\zeta}^2\cos\theta\sin\theta + R_0 \dot{\zeta}^2 \sin\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_\theta &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; + \left( 2 \dot{r}\dot{\zeta}\cos\theta - 2 r \dot{\theta}\dot{\zeta} \sin\theta + \ddot{\zeta} \left( R_0 + r\cos\theta \right) \right) \mathbf{e}_\zeta &lt;/math&gt;

{{Type systems}}
In [[programming language]]s, a '''type system''' is a set of rules that assigns a property called [[type (computer science)|type]] to the various constructs of a [[computer program]], such as [[variable (computer science)|variables]], [[expression (computer science)|expressions]], [[function (computer science)|functions]] or [[modular programming|modules]].{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=1|ps=: "A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute."}}  These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for [[algebraic data type]]s, data structures, or other components (e.g. "string", "array of float", "function returning boolean"). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for [[bug (computer programming)|bugs]] in computer programs{{sfn|Cardelli|2004|p=1|ps=: "The fundamental purpose of a type system is to prevent the occurrence of execution errors during the running of a program."}} by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at [[compile time]]), dynamically (at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for [[multiple dispatch]], providing a form of documentation, etc.

A type system associates a type with each computed value and, by examining the flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no [[type error]]s can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense ([[logic error]]s). Type systems are often specified as part of [[programming language]]s, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by [[extended static checking|optional tools]] that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.

== Usage overview ==
An example of a simple type system is that of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]. The portions of a C program are the [[Subroutine|function]] definitions.  One function is invoked by another function.  The interface of a function states the name of the function and a list of values that are passed to the function's code.  The code of an invoking function states the name of the invoked, along with the names of variables that hold values to pass to it.  During execution, the values are placed into temporary storage, then execution jumps to the code of the invoked function.  The invoked function's code accesses the values and makes use of them.  If the instructions inside the function are written with the assumption of receiving an integer value, but the calling code passed a floating-point value, then the wrong result will be computed by the invoked function.  The C compiler checks the type declared for each variable sent, against the type declared for each variable in the interface of the invoked function.  If the types do not match, the compiler throws a compile-time error.

A [[compiler]] may also use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value. In many [[C (programming language)|C]] compilers the ''float'' [[data type]], for example, is represented in 32 [[bit]]s, in accord with the [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE specification for single-precision floating point numbers]]. They will thus use floating-point-specific [[instruction set|microprocessor operations]] on those values (floating-point addition, multiplication, etc.).

The depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the ''typing'' of the language. A [[programming language]] may further associate an operation with various resolutions for each type, in the case of [[type polymorphism]]. [[Type theory]] is the study of type systems. The concrete types of some programming languages, such as integers and strings, depend on practical issues of computer architecture, compiler implementation, and language design.

== Fundamentals ==
Formally, [[type theory]] studies type systems. A programming language must have occurrence to type check using the ''type system'' whether at compile time or runtime, manually annotated or automatically inferred.  As [[Mark Manasse]] concisely put it:{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=208}}
{{quote|The fundamental problem addressed by a type theory is to ensure that programs have meaning. The fundamental problem caused by a type theory is that meaningful programs may not have meanings ascribed to them. The quest for richer type systems results from this tension.}}

Assigning a data type, termed ''typing'', gives meaning to a sequence of [[bit]]s such as a value in [[computer memory|memory]] or some [[object (computer science)|object]] such as a [[variable (computer science)|variable]]. The hardware of a [[general purpose computer]] is unable to discriminate between for example a [[memory address]] and an [[instruction code (programming)|instruction code]], or between a [[character (computing)|character]], an [[integer]], or a [[floating-point number]], because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might ''mean''.&lt;ref group=note name=Burroughs/&gt; Associating a sequence of bits with a type conveys that [[wikt:meaning|meaning]] to the programmable hardware to form a ''[[symbolic system]]'' composed of that hardware and some program.

A program associates each value with at least one specific type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many [[subtype]]s.  Other entities, such as [[object (computer science)|objects]], [[module (programming)|modules]], communication channels, and [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] can become associated with a type.  Even a type can become associated with a type.  An implementation of a ''type system'' could in theory associate identifications called ''[[data type]]'' (a type of a value), ''[[class (computer science)|class]]'' (a type of an object), and ''[[kind (type theory)|kind]]'' (a ''type of a type'', or metatype). These are the abstractions that typing can go through, on a hierarchy of levels contained in a system.

When a programming language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this comes at a price when the type inferences (and other properties) become [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a [[type safe]] manner.

The more type restrictions that are imposed by the compiler, the more ''strongly typed'' a programming language is.  Strongly typed languages often require the programmer to make explicit conversions in contexts where an implicit conversion would cause no harm.  Pascal's type system has been described as "too strong" because, for example, the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7i8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 Infoworld 25 April 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs655/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html |title=[[Brian Kernighan |access-date=2011-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094058/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cs655/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html |archive-date=2012-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] is also strongly typed but its types are automatically inferred so that explicit conversions are often (but not always) unnecessary.

A programming language compiler can also implement a ''[[dependent type]]'' or an ''[[effect system]]'', which enables even more program specifications to be verified by a type checker. Beyond simple value-type pairs, a virtual "region" of code is associated with an "effect" component describing ''what'' is being done ''with what'', and enabling for example to "throw" an error report.  Thus the symbolic system may be a ''type and effect system'', which endows it with more safety checking than type checking alone.

&lt;!--===Advantages sustain===--&gt;
Whether automated by the compiler or specified by a programmer, a type system makes program behavior illegal if outside the type-system rules. Advantages provided by programmer-specified type systems include:
* ''Abstraction'' (or ''modularity'') – Types enable programmers to think at a higher level than the bit or byte, not bothering with low-level implementation. For example, programmers can begin to think of a string as a set of character values instead of as a mere array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express [[interface (computer science)|interface]]s between two of ''any''-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.
* ''Documentation'' – In more expressive type systems, types can serve as a form of [[documentation]] clarifying the intent of the programmer. For example, if a programmer declares a function as returning a timestamp type, this documents the function when the timestamp type can be explicitly declared deeper in the code to be an integer type.

Advantages provided by compiler-specified type systems include:
* ''Optimization'' – Static type-checking may provide useful compile-time information. For example, if a type requires that a value must align in memory at a multiple of four bytes, the compiler may be able to use more efficient machine instructions.
* ''Safety'' – A type system enables the [[compiler]] to detect meaningless or probably invalid code. For example, we can identify an expression &lt;code&gt;3 / "Hello, World"&lt;/code&gt; as invalid, when the rules do not specify how to divide an [[integer]] by a [[string (computer science)|string]]. Strong typing offers more safety, but cannot guarantee complete ''[[type safety]]''.

===Type errors===
A type error is an unintended condition which might manifest in multiple stages of a program's development. Thus a facility for detection of the error is needed in the type system. In some languages, such as Haskell, for which [[type inference]] is automated, [[lint (software)|lint]] might be available to its compiler to aid in the detection of error.

Type safety contributes to [[program correctness]], but might only guarantee correctness at the cost of making the type checking itself an [[undecidable problem]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  In a ''type system'' with automated type checking a program may prove to run incorrectly yet be safely typed, and produce no compiler errors. [[Division by zero]] is an unsafe and incorrect operation, but a type checker running at [[compile time]] only does not scan for division by zero in most languages, and then it is left as a [[runtime error]]. To prove the absence of these more-general-than-types defects, other kinds of [[formal method]]s, collectively known as [[program analysis (computer science)|program analyses]], are in common use. Alternatively, a sufficiently expressive type system, such as in dependently typed languages, can prevent these kinds of errors (for example, expressing ''the type of non-zero numbers'').  In addition [[software testing]] is an [[empirical]] method for finding errors that the type checker cannot detect.

== Type checking ==
The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types—''type checking''—may occur either at [[compile-time]] (a static check) or at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]. If a language specification requires its typing rules strongly (i.e., more or less allowing only those automatic type conversions that do not lose information), one can refer to the process as ''strongly typed'', if not, as ''weakly typed''. The terms are not usually used in a strict sense.

{{Anchor|STATIC|Static typing}}

=== Static type checking ===
Static type checking is the process of verifying the [[type safety]] of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.

Static type checking can be considered a limited form of [[program verification]] (see [[type safety]]), and in a type-safe language, can be considered also an optimization. If a compiler can prove that a program is well-typed, then it does not need to emit dynamic safety checks, allowing the resulting compiled binary to run faster and to be smaller.

Static type checking for Turing-complete languages is inherently conservative. That is, if a type system is both ''sound'' (meaning that it rejects all incorrect programs) and ''decidable'' (meaning that it is possible to write an algorithm that determines whether a program is well-typed), then it must be ''incomplete'' (meaning there are correct programs, which are also rejected, even though they do not encounter runtime errors).&lt;ref&gt;"... any
sound, decidable type system must be incomplete" —D. Remy (2017). p. 29, {{cite web|last=Remy|first=Didier|title=Type systems for programming languages|url=http://gallium.inria.fr/~remy/mpri/cours1.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a program containing the code:

&lt;code&gt;if &lt;complex test&gt; then &lt;do something&gt; else &lt;signal that there is a type error&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Even if the expression &lt;code&gt;&lt;complex test&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; at run-time, most type checkers will reject the program as ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; branch will not be taken.{{sfn|Pierce|2002}} Conversely, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even [[code coverage]] tests with 100% coverage may be unable to find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account.

A number of useful and common programming language features cannot be checked statically, such as [[downcasting]]. Thus, many languages will have both static and dynamic type checking; the static type checker verifies what it can, and dynamic checks verify the rest.

Many languages with static type checking provide a way to bypass the type checker. Some languages allow programmers to choose between static and dynamic type safety. For example, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] distinguishes between ''statically-typed'' and ''dynamically-typed'' variables. Uses of the former are checked statically, whereas uses of the latter are checked dynamically. Other languages allow writing code that is not type-safe; for example, in [[C (programming language)|C]], programmers can freely cast a value between any two types that have the same size, effectively subverting the type concept.

For a list of languages with static type checking, see [[:Category:Statically typed programming languages|the category for statically typed languages]].

{{Anchor|DYNAMIC}}

=== Dynamic type checking and runtime type information ===
{{see also|Dynamic programming language|Interpreted language}}
Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a ''type tag'' (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information. This runtime type information (RTTI) can also be used to implement [[dynamic dispatch]], [[late binding]], [[downcasting]], [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]], and similar features.

Most type-safe languages include some form of dynamic type checking, even if they also have a static type checker.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The reason for this is that many useful features or properties are difficult or impossible to verify statically. For example, suppose that a program defines two types, A and B, where B is a subtype of A. If the program tries to convert a value of type A to type B, which is known as [[downcasting]], then the operation is legal only if the value being converted is actually a value of type B. Thus, a dynamic check is needed to verify that the operation is safe. This requirement is one of the criticisms of downcasting.

By definition, dynamic type checking may cause a program to fail at runtime. In some programming languages, it is possible to anticipate and recover from these failures. In others, type-checking errors are considered fatal.

Programming languages that include dynamic type checking but not static type checking are often called "dynamically typed programming languages". For a list of such languages, see [[:Category:Dynamically typed programming languages|the category for dynamically typed programming languages]].

{{Anchor|COMBINED}}

===Combining static and dynamic type checking ===
Some languages allow both static and dynamic typing (type checking), sometimes called ''soft'' typing. For example, Java and some other ostensibly statically typed languages support [[downcasting]] types to their [[subtypes]], querying an object to discover its dynamic type, and other type operations that depend on runtime type information. More generally, most programming languages include mechanisms for dispatching over different 'kinds' of data, such as [[disjoint union]]s, [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|subtype polymorphism]], and [[variant type]]s. Even when not interacting with type annotations or type checking, such mechanisms are materially similar to dynamic typing implementations. See [[programming language]] for more discussion of the interactions between static and dynamic typing.

Objects in object-oriented languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) is equal to either the object's run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the [[Liskov substitution principle]], which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept is also known as subsumption. In some languages subtypes may also possess [[Covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariant or contravariant]] return types and argument types respectively.

Certain languages, for example [[Clojure]], [[Common Lisp]], or [[Cython]] are dynamically type-checked by default, but allow programs to opt into static type checking by providing optional annotations. One reason to use such hints would be to optimize the performance of critical sections of a program. This is formalized by [[#Gradual typing|gradual typing]]. The programming environment ''[[DrRacket]]'', a  pedagogic environment based on Lisp, and a precursor of the language [[Racket (programming language)#Development|Racket]] was also soft-typed.

Conversely, as of version 4.0, the C# language provides a way to indicate that a variable should not be statically type-checked. A variable whose type is &lt;code&gt;dynamic&lt;/code&gt; will not be subject to static type checking. Instead, the program relies on runtime type information to determine how the variable may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741.aspx|title=dynamic (C# Reference)|work=[[MSDN Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Static and dynamic type checking in practice ===
The choice between static and dynamic typing requires certain [[trade-off]]s.

Static typing can find type errors reliably at compile time, which should increase the reliability of the delivered program. However, programmers disagree over how commonly type errors occur, resulting in further disagreements over the proportion of those bugs that are coded that would be caught by appropriately representing the designed types in code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advocates of [[dependent type|dependent typing]],{{who|date=July 2017}} implemented in languages such as [[Dependent ML]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], have suggested that almost all bugs can be considered type errors, if the types used in a program are properly declared by the programmer or correctly inferred by the compiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Static typing usually results in compiled code that executes faster. When the compiler knows the exact data types that are in use (which is necessary for static verification, either through declaration or inference) it can produce optimized machine code. Some dynamically typed languages such as [[Common Lisp]] allow optional type declarations for optimization for this reason.

By contrast, dynamic typing may allow compilers to run faster and [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] to dynamically load new code, because changes to source code in dynamically typed languages may result in less checking to perform and less code to revisit.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} This too may reduce the edit-compile-test-debug cycle.

Statically typed languages that lack [[type inference]] (such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] prior to [[Java version history#Java SE 10|version 10]]) require that programmers declare the types that a method or function must use. This can serve as added program documentation, that is active and dynamic, instead of static. This allows a compiler to prevent it from drifting out of synchrony, and from being ignored by programmers. However, a language can be statically typed without requiring type declarations (examples include [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[OCaml]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], and to a lesser extent [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[C++]]), so explicit type declaration is not a necessary requirement for static typing in all languages.

Dynamic typing allows constructs that some static type checking would reject as illegal. For example, ''[[eval]]'' functions, which execute arbitrary data as code, become possible. An ''eval'' function is possible with static typing, but requires advanced uses of [[GADT|algebraic data types]]. Further, dynamic typing better accommodates transitional code and prototyping, such as allowing a placeholder data structure ([[mock object]]) to be transparently used in place of a full data structure (usually for the purposes of experimentation and testing).

Dynamic typing typically allows [[duck typing]] (which enables [[duck typing#Comparison with other type systems|easier code reuse]]). Many{{specify|date=July 2017}} languages with static typing also feature [[duck typing#In statically typed languages|duck typing]] or other mechanisms like [[generic programming]] that also enable easier code reuse.

Dynamic typing typically makes [[metaprogramming]] easier to use. For example, [[C++]] [[template (programming)|templates]] are typically more cumbersome to write than the equivalent [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code since [[C++]] has stronger rules regarding type definitions (for both functions and variables). This forces a developer to write more [[boilerplate code]] for a template than a Python developer would need to. More advanced run-time constructs such as [[metaclass]]es and [[introspection (computer science)|introspection]] are often harder to use in statically typed languages. In some languages, such features may also be used e.g. to generate new types and behaviors on the fly, based on run-time data. Such advanced constructs are often provided by [[dynamic programming language]]s; many of these are dynamically typed, although ''dynamic typing'' need not be related to ''dynamic programming languages''.

=== Strong and weak type systems ===
{{Main|Strong and weak typing}}

Languages are often colloquially referred to as ''strongly typed'' or ''weakly typed''. In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean. In general, there are more precise terms to represent the differences between type systems that lead people to call them "strong" or "weak".

=== Type safety and memory safety ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Java (programming language)]] --&gt;
{{Main|Type safety}}

A third way of categorizing the type system of a programming language uses the safety of typed operations and conversions. Computer scientists consider a language "type-safe" if it does not allow operations or conversions that violate the rules of the type system.

Some observers use the term ''memory-safe language'' (or just ''safe language'') to describe languages that do not allow programs to access memory that has not been assigned for their use. For example, a memory-safe language will [[bounds checking|check array bounds]], or else statically guarantee (i.e., at compile time before execution) that array accesses out of the array boundaries will cause compile-time and perhaps runtime errors.

Consider the following program of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe:&lt;ref&gt;[[Visual Basic]] is an example of a language that is both type-safe and memory-safe.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=text line&gt;
var x := 5;     
var y := "37";  
var z := x + y; 
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the variable {{code|z}} will have the value 42. Although this may not be what the programmer anticipated, it is a well-defined result. If {{code|y}} were a different string, one that could not be converted to a number (e.g. "Hello World"), the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation; in fact, if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.

Now consider a similar example in C:

&lt;source lang=C line&gt;
int x = 5;
char y[] = "37";
char* z = x + y;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example {{C-lang|z}} will point to a memory address five characters beyond {{C-lang|y}}, equivalent to three characters after the terminating zero character of the string pointed to by {{C-lang|y}}. This is memory that the program is not expected to access. It may contain garbage data, and it certainly doesn't contain anything useful. As this example shows, C is neither a memory-safe nor a type-safe language.

In general, type-safety and memory-safety go hand in hand. For example, a language that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions (like C) is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed as if it were valid memory of any type.

For more information, see [[memory safety]].

=== Variable levels of type checking ===
Some languages allow different levels of checking to apply to different regions of code. Examples include:
* The &lt;code&gt;use strict&lt;/code&gt; directive in [[JavaScript]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm Standard ECMA-262]. Ecma-international.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode Strict mode - JavaScript | MDN]. Developer.mozilla.org (2013-07-03). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/br230269(v=vs.94).aspx Strict Mode (JavaScript)]. Msdn.microsoft.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perl]] applies stronger checking.
* The &lt;code&gt;declare(strict_types=1)&lt;/code&gt; in [[PHP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration.strict Strict typing]&lt;/ref&gt; on a per-file basis allows only a variable of exact type of the type declaration will be accepted, or a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt; will be thrown.
* The &lt;code lang="vb"&gt;Option Strict On&lt;/code&gt; in [[VB.NET]] allows the compiler to require a conversion between objects.

Additional tools such as [[lint (software)|lint]] and [[IBM Rational Purify]] can also be used to achieve a higher level of strictness.

=== Optional type systems ===
It has been proposed, chiefly by [[Gilad Bracha]], that the choice of type system be made independent of choice of language; that a type system should be a module that can be ''plugged'' into a language as needed. He believes this is advantageous, because what he calls mandatory type systems make languages less expressive and code more fragile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bracha.org/pluggableTypesPosition.pdf Bracha, G.: ''Pluggable Types'']&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that types do not affect the semantics of the language is difficult to fulfill.

Optional typing is related to [[gradual typing]], but still distinct from it.&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/13414347/975097&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2014}}

== Polymorphism and types ==
{{Main|Polymorphism (computer science)}}

The term ''polymorphism'' refers to the ability of code (especially, functions or classes) to act on values of multiple types, or to the ability of different instances of the same data structure to contain elements of different types. Type systems that allow polymorphism generally do so in order to improve the potential for code re-use: in a language with polymorphism, programmers need only implement a data structure such as a list or an [[associative array]] once, rather than once for each type of element with which they plan to use it. For this reason computer scientists sometimes call the use of certain forms of polymorphism ''[[generic programming]]''. The type-theoretic foundations of polymorphism are closely related to those of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[module (programming)|modularity]] and (in some cases) [[subtype|subtyping]].

=== Duck typing ===
{{Main|Duck typing}}

In ''duck typing'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Rozsnyai |first1= S. |last2= Schiefer |first2= J. |last3= Schatten |first3= A. |chapter= Concepts and models for typing events for event-based systems |title= Proceedings of the 2007 inaugural international conference on Distributed event-based systems – DEBS '07 |pages= 62 |year= 2007 |isbn= 9781595936653 |doi= 10.1145/1266894.1266904}}&lt;/ref&gt; a statement calling a [[method (computer science)|method]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; on an object does not rely on the declared type of the object; only that the object, of whatever type, must supply an implementation of the method called, when called, at run-time.

Duck typing differs from [[structural type system|structural typing]] in that, if the ''part'' (of the whole module structure) needed for a given local computation is present ''at runtime'', the duck type system is satisfied in its type identity analysis. On the other hand, a structural type system would require the analysis of the whole module structure at compile time to determine type identity or type dependence.

Duck typing differs from a [[nominative type system]] in a number of aspects. The most prominent ones are that for duck typing, type information is determined at runtime (as contrasted to compile time), and the name of the type is irrelevant to determine type identity or type dependence; only partial structure information is required for that for a given point in the program execution.

Duck typing uses the premise that (referring to a value) "if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck" (this is a reference to the [[duck test]] that is attributed to [[James Whitcomb Riley]]). The term may have been coined {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} by [[Alex Martelli]] in a 2000 message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

== Specialized type systems ==
Many type systems have been created that are specialized for use in certain environments with certain types of data, or for out-of-band [[static program analysis]]. Frequently, these are based on ideas from formal [[type theory]] and are only available as part of prototype research systems.

=== Dependent types ===
{{Main|Dependent type}}

[[Dependent type]]s are based on the idea of using scalars or values to more precisely describe the type of some other value. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{matrix}(3, 3)&lt;/math&gt; might be the type of a &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrix. We can then define typing rules such as the following rule for matrix multiplication:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{matrix}_{\mathrm{multiply}} : \mathrm{matrix}(k, m) \times \mathrm{matrix}(m, n) \to \mathrm{matrix}(k, n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary positive integer values. A variant of [[ML (programming language)|ML]] called [[Dependent ML]] has been created based on this type system, but because type checking for conventional dependent types is [[decidable set|undecidable]], not all programs using them can be type-checked without some kind of limits. Dependent ML limits the sort of equality it can decide to [[Presburger arithmetic]].

Other languages such as [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]] make the value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general [[Halting Problem|proof of decidability is undecidable]], so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an easy way out in the form of an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an [[infinite loop]] when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.

=== Linear types ===
{{Main|Linear type}}

[[Linear type]]s, based on the theory of [[linear logic]], and closely related to [[uniqueness type]]s, are types assigned to values having the property that they have one and only one reference to them at all times. These are valuable for describing large [[immutable value]]s such as files, strings, and so on, because any operation that simultaneously destroys a linear object and creates a similar object (such as '&lt;code&gt;str= str + "a"&lt;/code&gt;') can be optimized "under the hood" into an in-place mutation. Normally this is not possible, as such mutations could cause side effects on parts of the program holding other references to the object, violating [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]. They are also used in the prototype operating system [[Singularity (operating system)|Singularity]] for interprocess communication, statically ensuring that processes cannot share objects in shared memory in order to prevent race conditions. The [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]] language (a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-like language) uses this type system in order to gain a lot of speed (compared to performing a deep copy) while remaining safe.

=== Intersection types ===
{{Main|Intersection type}}

[[Intersection type]]s are types describing values that belong to ''both'' of two other given types with overlapping value sets. For example, in most implementations of C the signed char has range -128 to 127 and the unsigned char has range 0 to 255, so the intersection type of these two types would have range 0 to 127. Such an intersection type could be safely passed into functions expecting ''either'' signed or unsigned chars, because it is compatible with both types.

Intersection types are useful for describing overloaded function types: For example, if "{{C-lang|int}} → {{C-lang|int}}" is the type of functions taking an integer argument and returning an integer, and "{{C-lang|float}} → {{C-lang|float}}" is the type of functions taking a float argument and returning a float, then the intersection of these two types can be used to describe functions that do one or the other, based on what type of input they are given. Such a function could be passed into another function expecting an "{{C-lang|int}} → {{C-lang|int}}" function safely; it simply would not use the "{{C-lang|float}} → {{C-lang|float}}" functionality.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the intersection of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the most derived type. The intersection of sibling types is empty.

The Forsythe language includes a general implementation of intersection types. A restricted form is [[refinement type]]s.

=== Union types ===
{{Main|Union type}}

[[Union type]]s are types describing values that belong to ''either'' of two types. For example, in C, the signed char has a -128 to 127 range, and the unsigned char has a 0 to 255 range, so the union of these two types would have an overall "virtual" range of -128 to 255 that may be used partially depending on which union member is accessed. Any function handling this union type would have to deal with integers in this complete range. More generally, the only valid operations on a union type are operations that are valid on ''both'' types being unioned. C's "union" concept is similar to union types, but is not typesafe, as it permits operations that are valid on ''either'' type, rather than ''both''. Union types are important in program analysis, where they are used to represent symbolic values whose exact nature (e.g., value or type) is not known.

In a subclassing hierarchy, the union of a type and an ancestor type (such as its parent) is the ancestor type. The union of sibling types is a subtype of their common ancestor (that is, all operations permitted on their common ancestor are permitted on the union type, but they may also have other valid operations in common).

=== Existential types ===
{{Main|Existential quantifier}}

[[Existential quantifier|Existential]] types are frequently used in connection with [[Record (computer science)|record type]]s to represent [[module (programming)|module]]s and [[abstract data type]]s, due to their ability to separate implementation from interface. For example, the type "T = ∃X { a: X; f: (X &amp;rarr; int); }" describes a module interface that has a data member named ''a'' of type ''X'' and a function named ''f'' that takes a parameter of the ''same'' type ''X'' and returns an integer. This could be implemented in different ways; for example:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); }
* floatT = { a: float; f: (float → int); }

These types are both subtypes of the more general existential type T and correspond to concrete implementation types, so any value of one of these types is a value of type T. Given a value "t" of type "T", we know that "t.f(t.a)" is well-typed, regardless of what the abstract type ''X'' is. This gives flexibility for choosing types suited to a particular implementation while clients that use only values of the interface type&amp;mdash;the existential type&amp;mdash;are isolated from these choices.

In general it's impossible for the typechecker to infer which existential type a given module belongs to. In the above example intT { a: int; f: (int → int); } could also have the type ∃X { a: X; f: (int → int); }. The simplest solution is to annotate every module with its intended type, e.g.:

* intT = { a: int; f: (int → int); } '''as''' ∃X { a: X; f: (X → int); }

Although abstract data types and modules had been implemented in programming languages for quite some time, it wasn't until 1988 that [[John C. Mitchell]] and [[Gordon Plotkin]] established the formal theory under the slogan: "Abstract [data] types have existential type".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John C.; Plotkin, Gordon D.; [http://theory.stanford.edu/~jcm/papers/mitch-plotkin-88.pdf ''Abstract Types Have Existential Type''], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 10, No. 3, July 1988, pp. 470–502&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is a second-order [[typed lambda calculus]] similar to [[System F]], but with existential instead of universal quantification.

=== Gradual typing ===
{{Main|Gradual typing}}

[[Gradual typing]] is a type system in which variables may be typed either at [[compile-time]] (which is static typing) or at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] (which is dynamic typing), allowing software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/ |title=What is gradual typing? |author=Siek, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, gradual typing uses a special type named ''dynamic'' to represent statically-unknown types, and gradual typing replaces the notion of type equality with a new relation called ''consistency'' that relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1= Siek|first1=Jeremy|last2=Taha|first2=Walid|title= Gradual Typing for Functional Languages|url=http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/13-siek.pdf|journal= Scheme and Functional Programming 2006|date= September 2006| pages= 81&amp;ndash;92|publisher= [[University of Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explicit or implicit declaration and inference ==
{{details|Type inference}}

Many static type systems, such as those of C and Java, require ''type declarations'': The programmer must explicitly associate each variable with a specific type. Others, such as Haskell's, perform ''[[type inference]]'': The compiler draws conclusions about the types of variables based on how programmers use those variables. For example, given a function {{Java|f(x, y)}} that adds {{Java|x}} and {{Java|y}} together, the compiler can infer that {{Java|x}} and {{Java|y}} must be numbers&amp;nbsp;– since addition is only defined for numbers. Thus, any call to {{Java|f}} elsewhere in the program that specifies a non-numeric type (such as a string or list) as an argument would signal an error.

Numerical and string constants and expressions in code can and often do imply type in a particular context. For example, an expression {{Java|3.14}} might imply a type of [[floating-point]], while {{Java|[1, 2, 3]}} might imply a list of integers&amp;nbsp;– typically an [[array data structure|array]].

Type inference is in general possible, if it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] in the type theory in question. Moreover, even if inference is undecidable in general for a given type theory, inference is often possible for a large subset of real-world programs. Haskell's type system, a version of [[Type inference#Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm|Hindley–Milner]], is a restriction of [[System F-omega|System Fω]] to so-called rank-1 polymorphic types, in which type inference is decidable. Most Haskell compilers allow arbitrary-rank polymorphism as an extension, but this makes type inference undecidable. (Type checking is decidable, however, and rank-1 programs still have type inference; higher rank polymorphic programs are rejected unless given explicit type annotations.)

== Unified type system ==
Some languages like [[Perl 6]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have a unified type system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm Standard ECMA-334], 8.2.4 Type system unification.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that all [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] types including primitive types inherit from a single root object. Every type in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] inherits from the Object class. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] has several primitive types that are not objects. Java provides wrapper object types that exist together with the primitive types so developers can use either the wrapper object types or the simpler non-object primitive types.

== Compatibility: equivalence and subtyping ==
A type-checker for a statically typed language must verify that the type of any [[expression (programming)|expression]] is consistent with the type expected by the context in which that expression appears. For example, in an [[assignment statement]] of the form &lt;code&gt;x := ''e''&lt;/code&gt;,
the inferred type of the expression ''&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;'' must be consistent with the declared or inferred type of the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This notion of consistency, called ''compatibility'', is specific to each programming language.

If the type of ''&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;'' and the type of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; are the same, and assignment is allowed for that type, then this is a valid expression. Thus, in the simplest type systems, the question of whether two types are compatible reduces to that of whether they are ''equal'' (or ''equivalent''). Different languages, however, have different criteria for when two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. These different ''equational theories'' of types vary widely, two extreme cases being ''[[structural type system]]s'', in which any two types that describe values with the same structure are equivalent, and ''[[nominative type system]]s'', in which no two syntactically distinct type expressions denote the same type (''i.e.'', types must have the same "name" in order to be equal).

In languages with [[subtype|subtyping]], the compatibility relation is more complex. In particular, if &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, then a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; can be used in a context where one of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is expected, even if the reverse is not true. Like equivalence, the subtype relation is defined differently for each programming language, with many variations possible. The presence of parametric or ad hoc [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in a language may also have implications for type compatibility.

[[File:Projection and rejection 2.png|thumb|248px|When 90° &lt; ''θ'' ≤ 180°, '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has an opposite direction with respect to '''b'''.]]
The '''vector projection''' of a vector '''a''' on (or onto) a nonzero vector '''b''' (also known as the '''vector component''' or '''vector resolution''' of '''a''' in the direction of '''b''') is the [[orthogonal projection]] of '''a''' onto a [[straight line]] parallel to '''b'''. It is a vector parallel to '''b''', defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_1 =  a_1\mathbf{\hat b}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, called the [[scalar projection]] of '''a''' onto '''b''', and '''b̂''' is the [[unit vector]] in the direction of '''b'''.
In turn, the scalar projection is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = |\mathbf{a}|\cos\theta = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{\hat b} = \mathbf{a}\cdot\frac{\mathbf{b}}{|\mathbf{b}|}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the operator '''·''' denotes a [[dot product]], |'''a'''| is the [[Euclidean norm|length]] of '''a''', and ''θ'' is the [[angle]] between '''a''' and '''b'''. The scalar projection is equal to the length of the vector projection, with a minus sign if the direction of the projection is opposite to the direction of '''b'''.

The vector component or vector resolute of '''a''' perpendicular to '''b''', sometimes also called the '''vector rejection''' of '''a''' ''from'' '''b''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G. |last=Perwass |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IOypFqEkPMC&amp;pg=PA83 |title=Geometric Algebra With Applications in Engineering |location= |publisher= |page=83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the orthogonal projection of '''a''' onto the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] (or, in general, [[hyperplane]]) orthogonal to '''b'''. Both the projection '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and rejection '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a vector '''a''' are vectors, and their sum is equal to '''a''', which implies that the rejection is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2 = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a}_1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation==
Typically, a vector projection is denoted in a bold font (e.g. '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and the corresponding scalar projection with normal font (e.g. ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). In some cases, especially in handwriting, the vector projection is also denoted using a [[diacritic]] above or below the letter (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;u&gt;''a''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; see [[Euclidean vector#Representations|Euclidean vector representations]] for more details).

The vector projection of '''a''' on '''b''' and the corresponding rejection are sometimes denoted by '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;∥'''b'''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥'''b'''&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

==Definitions based on angle ''θ''==

===Scalar projection===
{{Main|Scalar projection}}
The scalar projection of '''a''' on '''b''' is a scalar equal to

:&lt;math&gt; a_1 = |\mathbf{a}| \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the angle between '''a''' and '''b'''.

A scalar projection can be used as a [[scale factor]] to compute the corresponding vector projection.

===Vector projection===
The vector projection of '''a''' on '''b''' is a vector whose magnitude is the scalar projection of '''a''' on '''b''' with the same direction as '''b'''.
Namely, it is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1 \mathbf{\hat b} = (|\mathbf{a}| \cos \theta) \mathbf{\hat b}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding scalar projection, as defined above, and '''b̂''' is the [[unit vector]] with the same direction as '''b''':
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat b} = \frac {\mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{b}|}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector rejection===

By definition, the vector rejection of '''a''' on '''b''' is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2 = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a}_1 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2 = \mathbf{a} - (|\mathbf{a}| \cos \theta) \mathbf{\hat b}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Definitions in terms of a and b==

When ''θ'' is not known, the cosine of ''θ'' can be computed in terms of '''a''' and '''b''', by the following property of the [[dot product]] '''a · b''':
: &lt;math&gt; \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{a}| \, |\mathbf{b}|} = \cos \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar projection===

By the above-mentioned property of the dot product, the definition of the scalar projection becomes
: &lt;math&gt;a_1 = |\mathbf{a}| \cos \theta = |\mathbf{a}| \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{a}| \, |\mathbf{b}|} = \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{b}| }\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector projection===
Similarly, the definition of the vector projection of '''a''' onto '''b''' becomes
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1 = a_1 \mathbf{\hat b} = \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{b}| } \frac {\mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{b}|},&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to either

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1 = (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{\hat b}) \mathbf{\hat b},&lt;/math&gt;

or&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.math.oregonstate.edu/home/programs/undergrad/CalculusQuestStudyGuides/vcalc/dotprod/dotprod.html|title=Dot Products and Projections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1 = \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {|\mathbf{b}|^2}{\mathbf{b}} = \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector rejection===
By definition,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2 = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a}_1 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2 = \mathbf{a} - \frac {\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}} {\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
[[Image:Dot Product.svg|thumb|200px|right|If 0° ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 90°, as in this case, the [[scalar projection]] of '''a''' on '''b''' coincides with the [[Euclidean norm|length]] of the vector projection.]]

===Scalar projection===
{{Main|Scalar projection}}
The scalar projection '''a''' on '''b''' is a scalar which has a negative sign if 90 &lt; ''θ'' ≤ 180 degrees. It coincides with the [[Euclidean norm|length]] |'''c'''| of the vector projection if the angle is smaller than 90°. More exactly:

* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  |'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| if 0 ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 90 degrees,
* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −|'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| if 90 &lt; ''θ'' ≤ 180 degrees.

===Vector projection===
The vector projection of '''a''' on '''b''' is a vector '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which is either null or parallel to '''b'''. More exactly:

* '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''0''' if ''θ'' = 90°,
* '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b''' have the same direction if 0 ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 90 degrees,
* '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b''' have opposite directions if 90 &lt; ''θ'' ≤ 180 degrees.

===Vector rejection===
The vector rejection of '''a''' on '''b''' is a vector '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is either null or orthogonal to '''b'''. More exactly:

* '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''0''' if ''θ''  = 0 degrees or ''θ''  = 180 degrees,
* '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is orthogonal to '''b''' if 0 &lt; ''θ'' &lt; 180 degrees,

==Matrix representation==
The orthogonal projection can be represented by a projection matrix.  To project a vector onto the unit vector ''a'' = (''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''), it would need to be multiplied with this projection matrix:
:&lt;math&gt; P_a = a a^\mathrm{T} = 
\begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \\ a_z \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} a_x &amp; a_y &amp; a_z \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_x^2 &amp; a_x a_y &amp; a_x a_z  \\
a_x a_y &amp; a_y^2 &amp; a_y a_z  \\
a_x a_z &amp; a_y a_z &amp; a_z^2  \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses==
The vector projection is an important operation in the [[Gram–Schmidt process|Gram–Schmidt]] [[orthonormality|orthonormalization]] of [[vector space]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]]. It is also used in the [[Separating axis theorem]] to detect whether two convex shapes intersect.

==Generalizations==

Since the notions of vector [[length]] and [[angle]] between vectors can be generalized to any ''n''-dimensional [[inner product space]], this is also true for the notions of orthogonal projection of a vector, projection of a vector onto another, and rejection of a vector from another. In some cases, the inner product coincides with the dot product. Whenever they don't coincide, the inner product is used instead of the dot product in the formal definitions of projection and rejection.

For a three-dimensional [[inner product space]], the notions of projection of a vector onto another and rejection of a vector from another can be generalized to the notions of projection of a vector onto a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], and rejection of a vector from a plane.&lt;ref&gt;
M.J. Baker, 2012.
[http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/elements/plane/lineOnPlane/index.htm Projection of a vector onto a plane.] Published on www.euclideanspace.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
The projection of a vector on a plane is its [[orthogonal projection]] on that plane. The rejection of a vector from a plane is its orthogonal projection on a straight line which is orthogonal to that plane. Both are vectors. The first is parallel to the plane, the second is orthogonal. For a given vector and plane, the sum of projection and rejection is equal to the original vector.

Similarly, for inner product spaces with more than three dimensions, the notions of projection onto a vector and rejection from a vector can be generalized to the notions of projection onto a [[hyperplane]], and rejection from a [[hyperplane]].

In [[geometric algebra]], they can be further generalized to the notions of [[geometric algebra#Projection and rejection|projection and rejection]] of a general multivector onto/from any invertible ''k''-blade.

A '''vector space''' (also called a '''linear space''') is a collection of objects called '''vectors''', which may be [[Vector addition|added]] together and [[Scalar multiplication|multiplied]] ("scaled") by numbers, called ''[[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]''. Scalars are often taken to be [[real number]]s, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by [[complex number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or generally any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called ''[[axiom]]s'', listed [[#Definition|below]].

[[Euclidean vector]]s are an example of a vector space.  They represent [[physics|physical]] quantities such as [[force]]s: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a [[force vector]] by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more [[geometry|geometric]] sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in [[three-dimensional space]] also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.

Vector spaces are the subject of [[linear algebra]] and are well characterized by their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in [[mathematical analysis]], as [[function space]]s, whose vectors are [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a [[topology]], allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and [[continuous function|continuity]]. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[inner product]] are more commonly used, as having a notion of [[metric (mathematics)|distance]] between two vectors. This is particularly the case of [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.

Historically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's [[analytic geometry]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], systems of [[linear equation]]s, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888, encompasses more general objects than [[Euclidean space]], but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s and their higher-dimensional analogs.

Today, vector spaces are applied throughout [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]]. They offer a framework for [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]], which is employed in [[image compression]] routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for [[partial differential equation]]s. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, [[coordinate-free]] way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as [[tensor]]s. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and [[abstract algebra]].

{{Algebraic structures |Module}}

== Introduction and definition ==
The concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:

===First example: arrows in the plane===
The first example of a vector space consists of [[arrow]]s in a fixed [[plane (geometry)|plane]], starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe [[force]]s or [[velocity|velocities]]. Given any two such arrows, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}}, the [[parallelogram]] spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the ''sum'' of the two arrows and is denoted {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive [[real number]] {{math|''a''}}, the arrow that has the same direction as {{math|'''v'''}}, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by {{math|''a''}}, is called ''multiplication'' of {{math|'''v'''}} by {{math|''a''}}. It is denoted {{math|''a'''''v'''}}. When {{math|''a''}} is negative, {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.

The following shows a few examples: if {{math|1=''a'' = 2}}, the resulting vector {{math|''a'''''w'''}} has the same direction as {{math|'''w'''}}, but is stretched to the double length of {{math|'''w'''}} (right image below). Equivalently, {{math|2'''w'''}} is the sum {{math|'''w''' + '''w'''}}. Moreover, {{math|1=(−1)'''v''' = −'''v'''}} has the opposite direction and the same length as {{math|'''v'''}} (blue vector pointing down in the right image).

|width=50%|[[File:Scalar multiplication.svg|230px|Scalar multiplication: the multiples {{math|−'''v'''}} and {{math|2'''w'''}} are shown.]]
|}

===Second example: ordered pairs of numbers===
A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. (The order of the components {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is significant, so such a pair is also called an [[ordered pair]].) Such a pair is written as {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}. The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} + {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} {{math|1== (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}
and 
:{{math|1=''a''&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'', ''ay'')}}.

The first example above reduces to this one if the arrows are represented by the pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] of their end points.

===Definition===
In this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: {{math|{{vec|''v''}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}} is a [[set (mathematics)|set]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.

* The first operation, called '''vector addition''' or simply '''addition''' {{math| + : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}, takes any two vectors&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} and assigns to them a third vector which is commonly written as {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}, and called the sum of these two vectors. (Note that the resultant vector is also an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ). 
* The second operation, called '''[[scalar multiplication]]''' {{math| · : ''F'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}， takes any scalar&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} and any vector&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and gives another vector&amp;nbsp;{{math|''a'''''v'''}}. (Similarly, the vector {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ).

Elements of {{mvar|V}} are commonly called ''vectors''. Elements of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|F}} are commonly called ''scalars''.

In the two examples above, the field is the field of the real numbers and the set of the vectors consists of the planar arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.

To qualify as a vector space, the set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the list below, let {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} be arbitrary vectors in {{mvar|V}}, and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} scalars in {{mvar|F}}.

They do not assert the associativity of either operation. More formally, scalar multiplication is a [[monoid action]] of the multiplicative monoid of the field {{mvar|F}} on the vector space {{mvar|V}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:
:{{math|1=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.
Likewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows, {{math|1='''v''' + '''w''' = '''w''' + '''v'''}} since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.

Subtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as
:{{math|1='''v''' − '''w''' = '''v''' + (−'''w''')}},
:{{math|1='''v'''/''a'' = (1/''a'')'''v'''}}.

When the scalar field {{mvar|F}} is the [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, the vector space is called a ''real vector space''. When the scalar field is the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, the vector space is called a ''complex vector space''. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}}. The notion is then known as an {{mvar|F}}-''vector spaces'' or a ''vector space over {{mvar|F}}''. A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] operations.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Brown|year = 1991|nb=yes}}) restrict attention to the fields {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, but most of the theory is unchanged for an arbitrary field.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[rational number]]s form a field.

In contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]], [[angle]]s or [[distance]]s. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see [[#Vector spaces with additional structure|below]].

===Alternative formulations and elementary consequences===
Vector addition and scalar multiplication are operations, satisfying the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] property:  {{math|'''u''' + '''v'''}} and {{math|''a'''''v'''}} are in {{math|''V''}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = van der Waerden|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Ch. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parlance of [[abstract algebra]], the first four axioms are equivalent to requiring the set of vectors to be an [[abelian group]] under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an {{math|''F''}}-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] structure. In other words, there is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{math|''f''}} from the field {{math|''F''}} into the [[endomorphism ring]] of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as {{math|(''f''(''a''))('''v''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Bourbaki|year=1998|nb=yes|loc=§II.1.1}}. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms {{math|''f''(''a'')}} ''homotheties''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from [[elementary group theory]], applied to the additive group of vectors: for example, the zero vector {{math|'''0'''}} of {{math|''V''}} and the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} of any vector {{math|'''v'''}} are unique. Further properties follow by employing also the distributive law for the scalar multiplication, for example {{math|''a'''''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}} if and only if {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|0}} or {{math|'''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}}.

==History==
Vector spaces stem from [[affine geometry]] via the introduction of [[coordinate]]s in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] founded [[analytic geometry]] by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane [[curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1969|nb = yes|loc = ch. "Algèbre linéaire et algèbre multilinéaire", pp. 78–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bolzano|year = 1804|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was then used in the conception of [[Barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Möbius|year = 1827|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828 [[C. V. Mourey]] suggested the existence of an algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System |last1=Crowe |first1=Michel J. |year=1994 |publisher=Dover |isbn= 0-486-67910-1 |page=11 and 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of vectors was founded on [[Giusto Bellavitis|Bellavitis]]' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment of which one end is the origin and the other a target, then further elaborated with the presentation of [[complex number]]s by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] and [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] and the introduction of [[quaternion]]s and [[biquaternion]]s by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Hamilton|year = 1853|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are elements in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}; their treatment as [[linear combination]]s can be traced back to [[Edmond Laguerre|Laguerre]] in 1867, who also defined [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]].

In 1857, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] introduced [[matrix notation]], which allows for a harmonization and simplification of [[linear map]]s. Around the same time, [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Grassmann|year = 1844|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, the concepts of [[linear independence]] and [[dimension]], as well as [[scalar product]]s, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of ''n'' dimensions to one of 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors &lt;math&gt;u \wedge v&lt;/math&gt; and 3-vectors &lt;math&gt;u \wedge v \wedge w&lt;/math&gt; called [[multivector]]s. This extension, called [[multilinear algebra]], is governed by the rules of [[exterior algebra]]. [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Peano|year = 1888|nb = yes |loc = ch. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of [[function space]]s by [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]]. This was later formalized by [[Stefan Banach|Banach]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Banach|year = 1922|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[algebra]] and the new field of [[functional analysis]] began to interact, notably with key concepts such as [[Lp space|spaces of ''p''-integrable functions]] and [[Hilbert space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Dorier|year = 1995|nb = yes}}, {{Harvard citations|last = Moore|year = 1995|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.

== Examples ==
{{main|Examples of vector spaces}}

===Coordinate spaces===
{{Main|Coordinate space}}
The simplest example of a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, a vector space can be composed of
[[tuple|''n''-tuples]] (sequences of length {{math|''n''}}) of elements of {{math|''F''}}, such as
:{{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where each {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an element of {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. I.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A vector space composed of all the {{math|''n''}}-tuples of a field {{math|''F''}} is known as a ''[[coordinate space]]'', usually denoted {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The case {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field {{math|''F''}} is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case {{math|1=''F'' = '''R'''}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} was discussed in the introduction above.

===Complex numbers and other field extensions===
The set of [[complex numbers]] {{math|'''C'''}}, i.e., numbers that can be written in the form {{math|1=''x'' + ''iy''}} for [[real numbers]] {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: {{math|1=(''x'' + ''iy'') + (''a'' + ''ib'') = (''x'' + ''a'') + ''i''(''y'' + ''b'')}} and {{math|1=''c'' ⋅ (''x'' + ''iy'') = (''c'' ⋅ ''x'') + ''i''(''c'' ⋅ ''y'')}} for real numbers {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.  The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic.

In fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is ''isomorphic'') to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number {{math|''x'' + ''i'' ''y''}} as representing the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the [[complex plane]] then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.

More generally, [[field extension]]s provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and [[algebraic number theory]]: a field {{math|''F''}} containing a [[Field extension|smaller field]] {{math|''E''}} is an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =2002|loc = ch. V.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}, and the field extension &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}(i\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}}.  &lt;!--A particularly interesting type of field extension in [[number theory]] is {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}}, the extension of the rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} by a fixed complex number {{math|''α''}}. {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}} is the smallest field containing the rationals and a fixed complex number ''α''. Its dimension as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on the choice of {{math|''α''}}.--&gt;

===Function spaces===
{{Main|Function space}}
Functions from any fixed set {{math|Ω}} to a field {{math|''F''}} also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} is the function {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')}} given by
:{{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''w'') = ''f''(''w'') + ''g''(''w'')}},
and similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when {{math|Ω}} is the [[real line]] or an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], or other [[subset]]s of {{math|'''R'''}}. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[integral|integrability]] or [[differentiability]] are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = ch. XII.3., p. 335|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of [[functional analysis]], see [[#labelFunctionalAnalysis|below]]. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the &lt;cite id=labelPolynomialRing&gt;[[polynomial ring|vector space {{math|''F''[x]}}]]&lt;/cite&gt; is given by [[polynomial function]]s:
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ... + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the [[coefficient]]s {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. IX.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear equations===
{{Main|Linear equation|Linear differential equation|Systems of linear equations}}
Systems of [[homogeneous linear equation]]s are closely tied to vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. VI.3.|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solutions of 
:{|
|-
| style="text-align:right;"|{{math|''a''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|3''b''}}
|{{math|+}}
| style="text-align:right;"|{{math|''c''}}
|{{math|{{=}} 0}}
|-
|{{math|4''a''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|2''b''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|2''c''}}
|{{math|{{=}} 0}}
|}
are given by triples with arbitrary {{math|''a''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''a''/2}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = −5''a''/2}}. They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely
:&lt;cite id=equation3&gt;{{math|1=''A'''''x''' = '''0'''}}&lt;/cite&gt;,
where {{math|1=''A'' =}} &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, {{math|'''x'''}} is the vector {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}, {{math|''A'''''x'''}} denotes the [[matrix product]], and {{math|1='''0''' = (0, 0)}} is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous ''linear differential equations'' form vector spaces. For example,
:&lt;cite id=equation1&gt;{{math|1=''f''′′(''x'') + 2''f''′(''x'') + ''f''(''x'') = 0}}&lt;/cite&gt;
yields {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''a&amp;thinsp;e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx&amp;thinsp;e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary constants, and {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[natural exponential function]].

== Basis and dimension ==
{{Main|basis (linear algebra)|l1=Basis|dimension (linear algebra)|l2=Dimension}}
[[File:Vector components and base change.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the [[standard basis]] of {{math|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''v''' = ''x'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (black), and using a different, non-[[orthogonal vector|orthogonal]] basis: {{math|1='''v''' = '''f'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''f'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (red).|thumb|200px]]
&lt;cite id=label1&gt;''Bases''&lt;/cite&gt; allow one to represent vectors by a [[sequence]] of scalars called ''coordinates'' or ''components''. A basis is a (finite or infinite) set {{math|1=''B'' = {'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of vectors {{math|'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for convenience often indexed by some [[index set]] {{math|''I''}}, that spans the whole space and is [[linearly independent]]. "Spanning the whole space" means that any vector {{math|'''v'''}} can be expressed as a finite sum (called a ''[[linear combination]]'') of the basis elements:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = a_1 \mathbf{b}_{i_1} + a_2 \mathbf{b}_{i_2} + \cdots + a_n \mathbf{b}_{i_n},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|1}}}}
where the {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are scalars, called the coordinates (or the components) of the vector {{math|'''v'''}} with respect to the basis {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{math|1=(''k'' = 1, ..., ''n'')}} elements of {{math|''B''}}. Linear independence means that the coordinates {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.

For example, the [[coordinate vector]]s {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 0, ..., 0)}}, {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)}}, to {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)}}, form a basis of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called the [[standard basis]], since any vector {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:
:{{math|1=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1, 0, ..., 0) + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0, 1, 0, ..., 0) + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0, ..., 0, 1) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
The corresponding coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|...}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are just the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vector.

Every vector space has a basis. This follows from [[Zorn's lemma]], an equivalent formulation of the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 1.9, p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the other axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Blass|year = 1984|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ultrafilter lemma]], which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or [[cardinality]] (cf. ''[[Dimension theorem for vector spaces]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Halpern|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=pp. 670–673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''dimension'' of the vector space, denoted by dim ''V''. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 3.3.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension of the coordinate space {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|''n''}}, by the basis exhibited above. The dimension of the polynomial ring ''F''[''x''] introduced [[#labelPolynomialRing|above]] is [[countably infinite]], a basis is given by {{math|1}}, {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|...}} [[A fortiori]], the dimension of more general function spaces, such as the space of functions on some (bounded or unbounded) interval, is infinite.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The [[indicator function]]s of intervals (of which there are infinitely many) are linearly independent, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients involved, the dimension of the solution space of a homogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]] equals the degree of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Braun|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Th. 3.4.5, p. 291}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solution space for the [[#equation1|above equation]] is generated by {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''xe''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These two functions are linearly independent over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the dimension of this space is two, as is the degree of the equation.

A field extension over the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} can be thought of as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} (by defining vector addition as field addition, defining scalar multiplication as field multiplication by elements of {{math|'''Q'''}}, and otherwise ignoring the field multiplication). The dimension (or [[degree of a field extension|degree]]) of the field extension {{math|'''Q'''(α)}} over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on {{math|α}}. If {{math|α}} satisfies some polynomial equation
&lt;math display=block&gt; q_n \alpha^n + q_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1} + \ldots + q_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
with rational coefficients {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (in other words, if α is [[algebraic number|algebraic]]), the dimension is finite. More precisely, it equals the degree of the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] having α as a [[root of a function|root]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Proposition 4.3, p. 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the complex numbers '''C''' are a two-dimensional real vector space, generated by 1 and the [[imaginary unit]] ''i''. The latter satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0, an equation of degree two. Thus, '''C''' is a two-dimensional '''R'''-vector space (and, as any field, one-dimensional as a vector space over itself, '''C'''). If α is not algebraic, the dimension of '''Q'''(α) over '''Q''' is infinite. For instance, for α = [[pi|π]] there is no such equation, in other words π is [[transcendental number|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 6.5, p. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linear maps and matrices==
{{Main|Linear map}}
The relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by ''linear map'' or ''linear transformation''. They are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that reflect the vector space structure—i.e., they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:
:''f''('''x''' + '''y''') = ''f''('''x''') + ''f''('''y''') and ''f''(''a'' &amp;middot; '''x''') = ''a'' &amp;middot; ''f''('''x''') for all '''x''' and '''y''' in ''V'', all ''a'' in ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[isomorphism]]'' is a linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} such that there exists an [[inverse map]] {{math|''g'' : ''W'' → ''V''}}, which is a map such that the two possible [[function composition|compositions]] {{math|''f'' ∘ ''g'' : ''W'' → ''W''}} and {{math|''g'' ∘ ''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} are [[Identity function|identity maps]]. Equivalently, ''f'' is both one-to-one ([[injective]]) and onto ([[surjective]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.4, Corollary, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If there exists an isomorphism between ''V'' and ''W'', the two spaces are said to be ''isomorphic''; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in ''V'' are, via ''f'', transported to similar ones in ''W'', and vice versa via ''g''.

[[File:Vector components.svg|180px|right|thumb|Describing an arrow vector '''v''' by its coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' yields an isomorphism of vector spaces.]]
For example, the "arrows in the plane" and "ordered pairs of numbers" vector spaces in the introduction are isomorphic: a planar arrow '''v''' departing at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of some (fixed) [[coordinate system]] can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the ''x''- and ''y''-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (''x'', ''y''), the arrow going by ''x'' to the right (or to the left, if ''x'' is negative), and ''y'' up (down, if ''y'' is negative) turns back the arrow '''v'''.

Linear maps ''V'' → ''W'' between two vector spaces form a vector space Hom&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'', ''W''), also denoted L(''V'', ''W'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Example IV.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of linear maps from ''V'' to ''F'' is called the ''[[dual vector space]]'', denoted ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. VI.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Via the injective [[natural (category theory)|natural]] map {{math|''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, any vector space can be embedded into its ''bidual''; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Halmos|year =1974|nb = yes|loc=p. 28, Ex. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a basis of {{math|''V''}} is chosen, linear maps {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of ''V'' is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem IV.2.1, p. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|1=dim ''V'' = dim ''W''}}, a [[bijection|1-to-1 correspondence]] between fixed bases of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of {{math|''V''}} to the corresponding basis element of {{math|''W''}}. It is an isomorphism, by its very definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 2.5 and 2.6, p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, two vector spaces are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space is ''completely classified'' ([[up to]] isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any ''n''-dimensional {{math|''F''}}-vector space {{math|''V''}} is isomorphic to {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. There is, however, no "canonical" or preferred isomorphism; actually an isomorphism {{math|''φ'' : ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''V''}} is equivalent to the choice of a basis of {{math|''V''}}, by mapping the standard basis of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|''V''}}, via {{math|''φ''}}. The freedom of choosing a convenient basis is particularly useful in the infinite-dimensional context; see [[#basis in inf dim context|below]].

===Matrices===
{{Main|Matrix (mathematics)|l1=Matrix|Determinant}}
[[Image:Matrix.svg|right|thumb|200px|A typical matrix]]
''Matrices'' are a useful notion to encode linear maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' gives rise to a linear map from ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, by the following
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \mapsto \left(\sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j}x_j, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{2j}x_j, \cdots, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{mj}x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[summation]],
or, using the [[matrix multiplication]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}} with the coordinate vector {{math|'''x'''}}:
:&lt;cite id=equation2&gt;{{math|'''x''' ↦ ''A'''''x'''}}&lt;/cite&gt;.
Moreover, after choosing bases of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}}, ''any'' linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.3., Corollary, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Determinant parallelepiped.svg|200px|right|thumb|The volume of this [[parallelepiped]] is the absolute value of the determinant of the 3-by-3 matrix formed by the vectors {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]
The [[determinant]] {{math|det (''A'')}} of a [[square matrix]] {{math|''A''}} is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem VII.9.8, p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear transformation of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} corresponding to a real ''n''-by-''n'' matrix is [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] if and only if its determinant is positive.

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===
{{Main|Eigenvalues and eigenvectors}}
[[Endomorphism]]s, linear maps {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}}, are particularly important since in this case vectors {{math|'''v'''}} can be compared with their image under {{math|''f''}}, {{math|''f''('''v''')}}. Any nonzero vector {{math|'''v'''}} satisfying {{math|1=''λ'''''v''' = ''f''('''v''')}}, where {{math|''λ''}} is a scalar, is called an ''eigenvector'' of {{math|''f''}} with ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''λ''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The nomenclature derives from [[German language|German]] "[[wikt:eigen|eigen]]", which means own or proper.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 135–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, {{math|'''v'''}} is an element of the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of the difference {{math|''f'' − ''λ'' · Id}} (where Id is the [[identity function|identity map]] {{math|''V'' → ''V'')}}. If {{math|''V''}} is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: {{math|''f''}} having eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}} is equivalent to
:{{math|1=det(''f'' − ''λ'' · Id) = 0}}.
By spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in {{math|''λ''}}, called the [[characteristic polynomial]] of {{math|''f''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IX.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the field {{math|''F''}} is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for {{math|''F''}} [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], such as {{math|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space {{math|''V''}} may or may not possess an [[eigenbasis]], a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the [[Jordan canonical form]] of the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt; See also [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]].&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of {{math|''f''}} forms a vector space known as the ''eigenspace'' corresponding to the eigenvalue (and {{math|''f''}}) in question. To achieve the [[spectral theorem]], the corresponding statement in the infinite-dimensional case, the machinery of functional analysis is needed, see [[#labelSpectralTheorem|below]].

==Basic constructions==
In addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. In addition to the definitions given below, they are also characterized by [[universal property|universal properties]], which determine an object {{math|''X''}} by specifying the linear maps from {{math|''X''}} to any other vector space.

===Subspaces and quotient spaces===
{{Main|Linear subspace|Quotient vector space}}
[[File:Linear subspaces with shading.svg|thumb|250px|right|A line passing through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (blue, thick) in [[Euclidean space|{{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] is a linear subspace. It is the intersection of two [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] (green and yellow).]]

A nonempty [[subset]] ''W'' of a vector space ''V'' that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the '''0'''-vector of ''V'') is called a ''linear subspace'' of ''V'', or simply a ''subspace'' of ''V'', when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is typically the case when a vector space is also considered as an [[affine space]]. In this case, a linear subspace contains the [[zero vector]], while an affine subspace does not necessarily contain it.&lt;/ref&gt; Subspaces of ''V'' are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set ''S'' of vectors is called its [[linear span|span]], and it is the smallest subspace of ''V'' containing the set ''S''. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the [[linear combination]]s of elements of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|vector line|vector plane|vector hyperplane}}A linear subspace of dimension 1 is a '''vector line'''.  A linear subspace of dimension 2 is a '''vector plane'''. A linear subspace that contains all elements but one of a basis of the ambient space is a '''vector hyperplane'''. In a vector space of finite dimension {{math|''n''}}, a vector hyperplane is thus a subspace of dimension {{math|''n'' – 1}}.

The counterpart to subspaces are ''quotient vector spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 3, p. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given any subspace {{math|''W'' ⊂ ''V''}}, the quotient space ''V''/''W'' ("''V'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''W''") is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of {{math|1='''v''' + ''W'' = {'''v''' + '''w''' : '''w''' ∈ ''W''},}} where '''v''' is an arbitrary vector in ''V''. The sum of two such elements {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} is {{math|('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''W'',}} and scalar multiplication is given by {{math|1=''a'' · ('''v''' + ''W'') = (''a'' · '''v''') + ''W''}}. The key point in this definition is that {{math|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W'' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} [[if and only if]] the difference of '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lies in ''W''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes}}) choose to start with this [[equivalence relation]] and derive the concrete shape of ''V''/''W'' from this.&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the quotient space "forgets" information that is contained in the subspace ''W''.

The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] ker(''f'') of a linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} consists of vectors '''v''' that are mapped to '''0''' in ''W''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both kernel and [[image (mathematics)|image]] {{math|1=im(''f'') = {''f''('''v''') : '''v''' ∈ ''V''} }} are subspaces of ''V'' and ''W'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the [[category of vector spaces]] (over a fixed field ''F'') is an [[abelian category]], i.e. a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a [[category (mathematics)|category]]) that behaves much like the [[category of abelian groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many statements such as the [[first isomorphism theorem]] (also called [[rank–nullity theorem]] in matrix-related terms)
:''V'' / ker(''f'') ≡ im(''f'').
and the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

An important example is the kernel of a linear map {{math|'''x''' ↦ ''A'''''x'''}} for some fixed matrix ''A'', as [[#equation2|above]]. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors '''x''' such that {{math|1=''A'''''x''' = 0}}, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to ''A''. This concept also extends to linear differential equations
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 f + a_1 \frac{d f}{d x} + a_2 \frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} + \cdots + a_n \frac{d^n f}{d x^n} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are functions in ''x'', too.
In the corresponding map
:&lt;math&gt;f \mapsto D(f) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i \frac{d^i f}{d x^i}&lt;/math&gt;,
the [[derivative]]s of the function ''f'' appear linearly (as opposed to ''f''′′(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (i.e., {{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')′ = ''f''′ + ''g''&amp;thinsp;′}} and {{math|1=(''c''·''f'')′ = ''c''·''f''′}} for a constant {{math|''c''}}) this assignment is linear, called a [[linear differential operator]]. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation {{math|1=''D''(''f'') = 0}} form a vector space (over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}).

===Direct product and direct sum===
{{Main|Direct product|Direct sum of modules}}
The ''direct product'' of vector spaces and the ''direct sum'' of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.

The ''direct product''&lt;!--explain direct--&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\prod_{i \in I} V_i}&lt;/math&gt; of a family of vector spaces ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the set of all tuples ({{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which specify for each index ''i'' in some [[index set]] ''I'' an element '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, pp. 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the ''direct sum'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{i \in I} V_i&lt;/math&gt; (also called [[coproduct]] and denoted &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\coprod_{i \in I}V_i}&lt;/math&gt;), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set ''I'' is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.

===Tensor product===
{{Main|Tensor product of vector spaces}}
The ''tensor product'' {{math|''V'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''}}, or simply {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}, of two vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' is one of the central notions of [[multilinear algebra]] which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map {{math|''g'' : [[Cartesian product|''V'' × ''W'']] → ''X''}} is called [[bilinear map|bilinear]] if ''g'' is linear in both variables '''v''' and '''w'''.  That is to say, for fixed '''w''' the map {{math|'''v''' ↦ ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}} is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed '''v'''.

The tensor product is a particular vector space that is a ''universal'' recipient of bilinear maps ''g'', as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called [[tensor]]s
:'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,
subject to the rules 
: ''a'' &amp;middot; ('''v''' ⊗ '''w''') = (''a'' &amp;middot; '''v''') ⊗ '''w''' = '''v''' ⊗ (''a'' &amp;middot; '''w'''), where ''a'' is a scalar,
:('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ '''w''' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w''' + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w''', and
:'''v''' ⊗ ('''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''v''' ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v''' ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = ch. XVI.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Universal tensor prod.svg|right|thumb|200px|[[Commutative diagram]] depicting the universal property of the tensor product.]]
These rules ensure that the map ''f'' from the {{math|''V'' × ''W''}} to {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} that maps a [[tuple]] {{math|('''v''', '''w''')}} to {{math|'''v''' ⊗ '''w'''}} is bilinear. The universality states that given ''any'' vector space ''X'' and ''any'' bilinear map {{math|''g'' : ''V'' × ''W'' → ''X''}}, there exists a unique map ''u'', shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose [[function composition|composition]] with ''f'' equals ''g'': {{math|1=''u''('''v''' ⊗ '''w''') = ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 14.3}}. See also [[Yoneda lemma]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the [[universal property]] of the tensor product, an instance of the method—much used in advanced abstract algebra—to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.

==Vector spaces with additional structure==
From the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces ''per se'' do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with [[infinite series]], since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. &lt;cite id=labelFunctionalAnalysis&gt;Therefore, the needs of [[functional analysis]] require considering additional structures.&lt;/cite&gt;

A vector space may be given a [[partial order]] ≤, under which some vectors can be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Schaefer|last2=Wolff|year = 1999|loc = pp. 204–205|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''n''-dimensional real space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. [[Ordered vector space]]s, for example [[Riesz space]]s, are fundamental to [[Lebesgue integration]], which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions
:''f'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; − ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;,
where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the positive part of ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; the negative part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 2004|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces===
{{Main|Normed vector space|Inner product space}}
"Measuring" vectors is done by specifying a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an [[inner product]], which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf v|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf v , \mathbf w \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf v| := \sqrt {\langle \mathbf v , \mathbf v \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;. Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as ''normed vector spaces'' and ''inner product spaces'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordinate space ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be equipped with the standard [[dot product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x , \mathbf y \rang = \mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_n y_n.&lt;/math&gt;
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors '''x''' and '''y''', by the [[law of cosines]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = \cos\left(\angle (\mathbf x, \mathbf y)\right) \cdot |\mathbf x| \cdot |\mathbf y|.&lt;/math&gt;
Because of this, two vectors satisfying &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x , \mathbf y \rang = 0&lt;/math&gt; are called [[orthogonal]]. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in [[Minkowski space]]: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; endowed with the Lorentz product
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x | \mathbf y \rang = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 - x_4 y_4.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Naber|year = 2003|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to the standard dot product, it is not [[positive definite bilinear form|positive definite]]: &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x | \mathbf x \rang&lt;/math&gt; also takes negative values, for example for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (0, 0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Singling out the fourth coordinate—[[timelike|corresponding to time]], as opposed to three space-dimensions—makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of [[special relativity]].

===Topological vector spaces===
{{Main|Topological vector space}}
Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces ''V'' carrying a compatible [[topological space|topology]], a structure that allows one to talk about elements being [[neighborhood (topology)|close to each other]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1987|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be [[continuous map]]s.  Roughly, if '''x''' and '''y''' in ''V'', and ''a'' in ''F'' vary by a bounded amount, then so do {{math|'''x''' + '''y'''}} and {{math|''a'''''x'''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This requirement implies that the topology gives rise to a [[uniform structure]], {{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1989|loc = ch. II|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field ''F'' also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.

In such ''topological vector spaces'' one can consider [[series (mathematics)|series]] of vectors.  The [[infinite sum]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f_i&lt;/math&gt;
denotes the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; of elements of ''V''. For example, the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some [[function space]] ''V'', in which case the series is a [[function series]]. The [[modes of convergence|mode of convergence]] of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, [[pointwise convergence]] and [[uniform convergence]] are two prominent examples.

[[Image:Vector norms2.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Unit ball|Unit "spheres"]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consist of plane vectors of norm 1.  Depicted are the unit spheres in different [[Lp norm|''p''-norm]]s, for ''p'' = 1, 2, and ∞. The bigger diamond depicts points of 1-norm equal to 2.]]
A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any [[Cauchy sequence]] has a limit; such a vector space is called [[Completeness (topology)|complete]]. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval [0,1], equipped with the [[topology of uniform convergence]] is not complete because any continuous function on [0,1] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§4.11-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the space of ''all'' continuous functions on [0,1] with the same topology is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§1.5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to '''v''' if and only if

Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of [[functional analysis]]—focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Choquet|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=Proposition III.7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: as the unit "balls" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.

From a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s) {{math|''V'' → ''W''}}, maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=p. 34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the &lt;cite id=label2&gt;(topological) dual space {{math|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/cite&gt; consists of continuous functionals {{math|''V'' → '''R'''}} (or to {{math|'''C'''}}). The fundamental [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =1983|nb = yes|loc=Cor. 4.1.2, p. 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banach spaces====
{{Main|Banach space}}
''Banach spaces'', introduced by [[Stefan Banach]], are complete normed vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A first example is [[Lp space|the vector space &lt;math&gt;\ell^{p}&lt;/math&gt;]] 
consisting of infinite vectors with real entries 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n},\ldots\right)&lt;/math&gt;
whose [[p-norm|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] 
&lt;math&gt;(1\leq{p}\leq\infty)&lt;/math&gt;
given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}\right\Vert_{p} := \left(\sum_{i} \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert^{p} \right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf x\right\Vert_{\infty} := \text{sup}_{i} \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!---- "is finite." - ?!  ----&gt; 
The topologies on the infinite-dimensional space 
&lt;math&gt;\ell^{p}&lt;/math&gt; 
are inequivalent for different &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. 
E.g. the sequence of vectors 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{n}=\left(2^{-n}, 2^{-n}, \ldots, 2^{-n},0,0,\ldots\right)&lt;/math&gt;, 
i.e. the first &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; components are &lt;math&gt;2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;, 
the following ones are &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, converges to the [[zero vector]] for 
&lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 
but does not for 
&lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\Vert_{_\infty} = \sup (2^{-n}, 0) 
= 2^{-n} \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\Vert_{1} 
= \sum_{i=1}^{2^n} 2^{-n} = 2^n \cdot 2^{-n} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally than sequences of real numbers, functions 
&lt;math&gt;f\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
are endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the [[Lebesgue integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p} 
:= \left(\int_{\Omega} \left\vert{f}\left(x\right)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
\right)^{1/p}.&lt;/math&gt;
The space of [[integrable function]]s on a given [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] 
&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; 
(for example an interval) satisfying 
&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;,
and equipped with this norm are called [[Lp space|Lebesgue spaces]], 
denoted &lt;math&gt;L^{\;\!p}\left(\Omega\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The [[Triangle inequality|triangle inequality]] for 
&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f+g}\right\Vert_{p}
\leq\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p}+\left\Vert{g}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;/math&gt;
is provided by the [[Minkowski inequality]]. For technical reasons, in the context of functions one has to identify functions that agree [[almost everywhere]] to get a norm, and not only a [[seminorm]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

These spaces are complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 11.2, p. 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; (If one uses the [[Riemann integral]] instead, the space is ''not'' complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"Many functions in 
&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt; 
of Lebesgue measure, being unbounded, cannot be integrated with the classical Riemann integral. 
So spaces of Riemann integrable functions would not be complete in the 
&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
norm, and the orthogonal decomposition would not apply to them. 
This shows one of the advantages of Lebesgue integration.", {{Harvard citations|last = Dudley|year = 1989|nb = yes|loc=§5.3, p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 
Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;math&gt;f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{n},\ldots&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
with &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}_{n}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 
satisfying the condition
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{k,\ n \to \infty}\int_{\Omega} 
\left\vert{f}_{k}(x)-{f}_{n}(x)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
= 0&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a function &lt;math&gt;{f}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; belonging to the vector space &lt;math&gt;L^{\;\!p}\left(\Omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}\int_{\Omega} 
\left\vert{f}\left(x\right)-{f}_{k}\left(x\right)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Imposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its [[derivative]]s leads to [[Sobolev space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Evans|year = 1998|loc = ch. 5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hilbert spaces====
{{Main|Hilbert space}}
[[Image:Periodic identity function.gif|right|thumb|400px|The succeeding snapshots show summation of 1 to 5 terms in approximating a periodic function (blue) by finite sum of sine functions (red).]]
Complete inner product spaces are known as ''Hilbert spaces'', in honor of [[David Hilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hilbert space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω), with inner product given by
:&lt;math&gt; \langle f\ , \ g \rangle = \int_\Omega f(x) \overline{g(x)} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of ''g''(''x''),&lt;ref name=Dennery&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Dennery|year = 1996|loc = p.190|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For ''p'' ≠2, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is not a Hilbert space.&lt;/ref&gt; is a key case.

By definition, in a Hilbert space any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with desirable properties that approximates a given limit function, is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the [[Taylor approximation]], established an approximation of [[differentiable function]]s ''f'' by polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = Th. XIII.6, p. 349|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the &lt;cite id=labelStoneWeierstrass&gt;[[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]]&lt;/cite&gt;, every continuous function on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = Th. III.1.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approximation technique by [[trigonometric function]]s is commonly called [[Fourier expansion]], and is much applied in engineering, see [[#labelFourier|below]]. &lt;cite id=basis_in_inf_dim_context&gt;More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what "basic functions", or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space ''H'', in the sense that the ''[[closure (topology)|closure]]'' of their span (i.e., finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space.&lt;/cite&gt; Such a set of functions is called a ''basis'' of ''H'', its cardinality is known as the [[Hilbert space dimension]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A basis of a Hilbert space is not the same thing as a basis in the sense of linear algebra [[#label1|above]].  For distinction, the latter is then called a [[Hamel basis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but together with the [[Gram–Schmidt process]], it enables one to construct a [[orthogonal basis|basis of orthogonal vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Choquet|year = 1966|loc = Lemma III.16.11|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

The solutions to various [[differential equation]]s can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Kreyszig|year=1999|loc=Chapter 11|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example from physics, the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] in [[quantum mechanics]] describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a [[partial differential equation]], whose solutions are called [[wavefunction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Griffiths|year=1995|loc=Chapter 1|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to [[eigenvalue]]s of a certain (linear) [[differential operator]] and the associated wavefunctions are called [[eigenstate]]s. The &lt;cite id=labelSpectralTheorem&gt;[[spectral theorem]] decomposes a linear [[compact operator]] acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc =ch. XVII.3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algebras over fields===
{{Main|Algebra over a field|Lie algebra}}
[[Image:Rectangular hyperbola.svg|right|thumb|250px|A [[hyperbola]], given by the equation {{math|1=''x'' ⋅ ''y'' = 1}}. The [[coordinate ring]] of functions on this hyperbola is given by {{math|'''R'''[''x'', ''y''] / (''x'' &amp;middot; ''y'' − 1)}}, an infinite-dimensional vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}.]]
General vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional [[bilinear operator]] defining the multiplication of two vectors is an ''algebra over a field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. III.1, p. 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned [[#labelStoneWeierstrass|above]], for example, relies on [[Banach algebra]]s which are both Banach spaces and algebras.

[[Commutative algebra]] makes great use of [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]] in one or several variables, introduced [[#labelPolynomialRing|above]]. Their multiplication is both [[commutative]] and [[associative]]. These rings and their [[quotient ring|quotients]] form the basis of [[algebraic geometry]], because they are [[coordinate ring|rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Eisenbud|year = 1995|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another crucial example are ''Lie algebras'', which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints ({{math|[''x'', ''y'']}} denotes the product of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}):
*{{math|1=[''x'', ''y''] = −[''y'', ''x'']}} ([[anticommutativity]]), and
*{{math|1=[''x'', [''y'', ''z'']] + [''y'', [''z'', ''x'']] + [''z'', [''x'', ''y'']] = 0}} ([[Jacobi identity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Varadarajan|year = 1974|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples include the vector space of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, with {{math|1=[''x'', ''y''] = ''xy'' − ''yx''}}, the [[commutator]] of two matrices, and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, endowed with the [[cross product]].

The [[tensor algebra]] T(''V'') is a formal way of adding products to any vector space ''V'' to obtain an algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. XVI.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple [[tensor]]s
:{{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ... ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where the [[rank of a tensor|degree]] {{math|''n''}} varies.
The multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the [[distributive law]] under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product ⊗, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced [[#Tensor product|above]]. In general, there are no relations between {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the [[symmetric algebra]], whereas forcing {{math|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = − '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} yields the [[exterior algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. XVI.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a field, {{math|''F''}} is explicitly stated, a common term used is {{math|''F''}}-algebra.

==Applications==
Vector spaces have many applications as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They provide a framework to deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or are used in the Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. The [[minimax theorem]] of [[game theory]] stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Luenberger|year = 1997|nb = yes|loc=§7.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representation theory]] fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[representation theory]] and [[group representation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===
{{Main|Distribution (mathematics)|l1=Distribution}}
A ''distribution'' (or ''generalized function'') is a linear map assigning a number to each [[test function|"test" function]], typically a [[smooth function]] with [[compact support]], in a continuous way: in the [[#label2|above]] terminology the space of distributions is the (continuous) dual of the test function space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc =Ch. XI.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter space is endowed with a topology that takes into account not only ''f'' itself, but also all its higher derivatives. A standard example is the result of integrating a test function ''f'' over some domain Ω:
:&lt;math&gt;I(f) = \int_\Omega f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
When {{math|1=Ω = {''p''},}} the set consisting of a single point, this reduces to the [[Dirac distribution]], denoted by δ, which associates to a test function ''f'' its value at the {{math|1=''p'': δ(''f'') = ''f''(''p'')}}. Distributions are a powerful instrument to solve differential equations. Since all standard analytic notions such as derivatives are linear, they extend naturally to the space of distributions. Therefore, the equation in question can be transferred to a distribution space, which is bigger than the underlying function space, so that more flexible methods are available for solving the equation. For example, [[Green's function]]s and [[fundamental solution]]s are usually distributions rather than proper functions, and can then be used to find solutions of the equation with prescribed boundary conditions. The found solution can then in some cases be proven to be actually a true function, and a solution to the original equation (e.g., using the [[Lax–Milgram theorem]], a consequence of the [[Riesz representation theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Evans|year = 1998|loc =Th. 6.2.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier analysis===

[[Image:Heat eqn.gif|thumb|right|200px|The heat equation describes the dissipation of physical properties over time, such as the decline of the temperature of a hot body placed in a colder environment (yellow depicts colder regions than red).]]

Resolving a [[periodic function]] into a sum of [[trigonometric functions]] forms a &lt;cite id=labelFourier&gt;''[[Fourier series]]''&lt;/cite&gt;, a technique much used in physics and engineering.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Although the Fourier series is periodic, the technique can be applied to any ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function on an interval by considering the function to be continued periodically outside the interval. See {{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1988|loc=p. 601|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Folland|year = 1992|loc = p. 349 ''ff''|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying vector space is usually the [[Hilbert space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0, 2π), for which the functions sin ''mx'' and cos ''mx'' (''m'' an integer) form an orthogonal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 150|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fourier expansion]] of an ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f'' is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\left[a_m\cos\left(mx\right)+b_m\sin\left(mx\right)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are called [[Fourier coefficient]]s of ''f'', and are calculated by the formulas&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§4.5|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(t) \cos (mt) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(t) \sin (mt) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In physical terms the function is represented as a [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of [[sine waves]] and the coefficients give information about the function's [[frequency spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 57|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general [[duality (mathematics)|mathematical duality]] called [[Pontryagin duality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Loomis  | year=1953|loc=Ch. VII|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''R''', it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are [[reciprocal lattice]]s, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] encoding positions of [[atom]]s in [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Ashcroft | last2=Mermin | year=1976|loc=Ch. 5|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier series are used to solve [[boundary value problem]]s in [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1988|loc=p. 667|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] first used this technique to solve the [[heat equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Fourier|year = 1822|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discrete version of the Fourier series can be used in [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 67|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of coefficients is known as the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT is one of the key tools of [[digital signal processing]], a field whose applications include [[radar]], [[speech encoding]], [[image compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=pp. 3–4, 11|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[JPEG]] image format is an application of the closely related [[discrete cosine transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wallace|year = Feb 1992|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] is an algorithm for rapidly computing the discrete Fourier transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=p. 132|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used not only for calculating the Fourier coefficients but, using the [[convolution theorem]], also for computing the [[convolution]] of two finite sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§10.2|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn are applied in [[digital filter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=pp. 307–310|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a rapid [[multiplication algorithm]] for polynomials and large integers ([[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§10.3|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Schönhage|last2=Strassen|year=1971|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential geometry===
{{Main|Tangent space}}
[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|right|thumb|200px|The tangent space to the [[2-sphere]] at some point is the infinite plane touching the sphere in this point.]]
The [[tangent plane]] to a surface at a point is naturally a vector space whose origin is identified with the point of contact.  The tangent plane is the best [[linear approximation]], or [[linearization]], of a surface at a point.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;That is to say {{harv|BSE-3|2001}}, the plane passing through the point of contact ''P'' such that the distance from a point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the surface to the plane is [[little o|infinitesimally small]] compared to the distance from ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P'' in the limit as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ''P'' along the surface.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, there is typically no natural way to prescribe a basis of the tangent plane, and so it is conceived of as an abstract vector space rather than a real coordinate space. The ''tangent space'' is the generalization to higher-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Spivak|year = 1999|loc = ch. 3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riemannian manifold]]s are manifolds whose tangent spaces are endowed with a [[Riemannian metric|suitable inner product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jost|year = 2005|nb = yes}}. See also [[Lorentzian manifold]].&lt;/ref&gt; Derived therefrom, the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] encodes all [[curvature (mathematics)|curvatures]] of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in [[general relativity]], for example, where the [[Einstein curvature tensor]] describes the matter and energy content of [[space-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Misner|last2=Thorne|last3=Wheeler|year = 1973|loc = ch. 1.8.7, p. 222 and ch. 2.13.5, p. 325|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jost|year = 2005|loc = ch. 3.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally the structure of a Lie algebra and can be used to classify [[compact Lie group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Varadarajan|year = 1974|loc = ch. 4.3, Theorem 4.3.27|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vector bundles===
{{Main|Vector bundle|Tangent bundle}}
[[Image:Mobius strip illus.svg|thumb|249px|right|A Möbius strip. Locally, it [[homeomorphism|looks like]] {{math|''U'' × '''R'''}}.]]
A ''vector bundle'' is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a [[topological space]] ''X''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; More precisely, a vector bundle over ''X'' is a topological space ''E'' equipped with a continuous map 
:π&amp;thinsp;: ''E'' → ''X''
such that for every ''x'' in ''X'', the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a vector space. The case dim {{math|1=''V'' = 1}} is called a [[line bundle]]. For any vector space ''V'', the projection {{math|''X'' × ''V'' → ''X''}} makes the product {{math|''X'' × ''V''}} into a [[trivial bundle|"trivial" vector bundle]]. Vector bundles over ''X'' are required to be [[locally]] a product of ''X'' and some (fixed) vector space ''V'': for every ''x'' in ''X'', there is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''U'' of ''x'' such that the restriction of π to π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is isomorphic&lt;ref group=nb&gt;That is, there is a [[homeomorphism]] from π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') to {{math|''V'' × ''U''}} which restricts to linear isomorphisms between fibers.&lt;/ref&gt; to the trivial bundle {{math|''U'' × ''V'' → ''U''}}. Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space ''X'') be "twisted" in the large (i.e., the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle {{math|''X'' × ''V''}}). For example, the [[Möbius strip]] can be seen as a line bundle over the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (by [[homeomorphism#Examples|identifying open intervals with the real line]]). It is, however, different from the [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''}}, because the latter is [[orientable manifold|orientable]] whereas the former is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=§34, p. 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the [[tangent bundle]] consists of the collection of [[tangent space]]s parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is globally isomorphic to {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''}}, since there is a global nonzero [[vector field]] on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A line bundle, such as the tangent bundle of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is trivial if and only if there is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] that vanishes nowhere, see {{Harvard citations|last = Husemoller|year = 1994|nb = yes|loc=Corollary 8.3}}. The sections of the tangent bundle are just [[vector field]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, by the [[hairy ball theorem]], there is no (tangent) vector field on the [[2-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is everywhere nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|last1=Eisenberg|last2=Guy|year=1979|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K-theory]] studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Atiyah|year = 1989|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real [[division algebra]]s: '''R''', '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.

The [[cotangent bundle]] of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the [[cotangent space]]. [[Section (fiber bundle)|Sections]] of that bundle are known as [[differential form|differential one-form]]s.

===Modules===
{{Main|Module (mathematics)|l1=Module}}
''Modules'' are to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring ''R'' instead of a field ''F'', yield modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have [[multiplicative inverse]]s. For example, modules need not have bases, as the '''Z'''-module (i.e., [[abelian group]]) [[Modular arithmetic|'''Z'''/2'''Z''']] shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as [[free module]]s. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] with the elements being called vectors.  Some authors use the term ''vector space'' to mean modules over a [[division ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Grillet, Pierre Antoine. Abstract algebra. Vol. 242. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] allows the development of concepts such as [[locally free module]]s, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.

===Affine and projective spaces===
{{Main|Affine space|Projective space}}
[[Image:Affine subspace.svg|thumb|right|200px|An [[affine space|affine plane]] (light blue) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a two-dimensional subspace shifted by a vector '''x''' (red).]] 
Roughly, ''affine spaces'' are vector spaces whose origins are not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Meyer|year = 2000|nb = yes|loc=Example 5.13.5, p. 436}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, an affine space is a set with a [[transitive group action|free transitive]] vector space [[group action|action]]. In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map
:{{math|''V'' × ''V'' → ''V'', ('''v''', '''a''') ↦ '''a''' + '''v'''}}.
If ''W'' is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of ''W'' obtained by translating a linear subspace ''V'' by a fixed vector {{math|'''x''' ∈ ''W''}}; this space is denoted by {{math|'''x''' + ''V''}} (it is a [[coset]] of ''V'' in ''W'') and consists of all vectors of the form {{math|'''x''' + '''v'''}} for {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''.}} An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations
:''A'''''x''' = '''b'''
generalizing the homogeneous case {{math|1='''b''' = 0}} [[#equation3|above]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Meyer|year = 2000|nb = yes|loc=Exercise 5.13.15–17, p. 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of solutions is the affine subspace {{math|'''x''' + ''V''}} where '''x''' is a particular solution of the equation, and ''V'' is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the [[nullspace]] of ''A'').

The set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' is known as ''projective space''; it may be used to formalize the idea of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines intersecting at infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Coxeter|year = 1987|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grassmannian manifold|Grassmannians]] and [[flag manifold]]s generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension ''k'' and [[flag (linear algebra)|flags]] of subspaces, respectively.
