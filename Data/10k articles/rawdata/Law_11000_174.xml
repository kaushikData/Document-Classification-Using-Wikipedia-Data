'''California Proposition 90''' was a 2006 [[ballot initiative]] in the state of [[California]], [[United States]].  Passing of the initiative would have made two changes to California law:
* [[Eminent domain]] could not be used by government except to provide facilities for public use, to abate specific public nuisances, and to act in a declared state of emergency.  (This was a reaction to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]''.)
* Government would be required to reimburse property owners whose property value is decreased as a result of ''any'' government regulation or action.

The measure was defeated by a vote of 47.6% in favor and 52.4% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;California Secretary of State [http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/contents.htm 2006 Election returns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220203742/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/contents.htm# |date=2007-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[California state elections, June 2008|June 2008 election]] the more narrowly defined [[California Propositions 98 and 99 (2008)|Proposition 99]] was passed.

The initiative was similar to the controversial [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)]].

The building was under construction and did not have an [[Certificate of occupancy|occupancy certificate]] for its 100 to 150 low- to middle-income residents.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;
Living in the building were the site construction workers and families. It was reported that the building was [[illegal housing in India|illegally constructed]] because standard practices were not followed for safe, lawful construction; land acquisition and resident occupancy.

By 11 April, a total of 15 suspects were arrested including [[Construction worker|builders]], engineers, municipal officials and other responsible parties. Governmental records indicate that there were two orders to manage the number of [[illegal building]]s in the area: a 2005 [[Maharashtra]] state order to use [[remote sensing]] and a 2010 [[Bombay High Court]] order. There were also complaints made to state and municipal officials.

On 9 April, a campaign began by the [[Thane Municipal Corporation]] to demolish area illegal buildings, focusing first on "dangerous" buildings. The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|forest department]] said that it will address encroachment of forest land in the Thane district. A [[call centre]] was established by the Thane Municipal Corporation to accept and track resolution of caller complaints about illegal buildings.

Retrieved 5 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The building collapsed quickly. First, a section of the building collapsed, it tilted, and then the entire building was brought down. A witness described the event, "The building collapsed like a pack of cards within three to four seconds."&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

According to Hasina Shaikh, a school girl who lived on the fifth floor with her family: "I had just returned from school and was changing when the building started shaking and came down on us... When I regained [[consciousness]] later, I was in the hospital." She says she considers herself lucky to be alive.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; One survivor is a 10-month-old girl whose parents had not been found as of 6 April 2013.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; [[Reuters]] reported the last survivor was rescued on 5 April, a woman who was "found after workers heard her voice and used camera equipment to pinpoint her location under the rubble."&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;

Dubbed the "miracle survivor", a four-year-old girl, Sandhya Thakur, was pulled from the wreckage. She was unable to open her eyes, but awoke on 7 April 2013 to the awareness that she had suffered a disaster. Her father and six brothers and sisters are missing; Her mother died when the building collapsed. She is physically unharmed, but having a hard time adjusting psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/thane-fouryearold-girl-recovered-from-debris-opens-her-eyes/383691-3-237.html "Thane: Four-year-old girl recovered from debris opens her eyes."] ''The Times of India''. 7 April 2013. Retrieved 7 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]] [[Prithviraj Chavan]], payments of {{INR}}50,000 will be made to the injured, and a {{INR}}200,000 payment will be made to the [[next of kin]] of the deceased.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

===Building occupied while under construction===
The building containing offices and apartments was under construction for six weeks prior to the disaster, but there are varying reports on the extent of the construction completion. ''[[The Times of India]]'' reported that "Twenty-five tenements on five storeys were complete and the sixth and seventh floors were under construction." Although there was no occupancy certificate, the first four storeys of the building were illegally inhabited by site construction workers and families. In addition to families of construction workers, there were also families headed by [[rickshaw]] drivers and/or those whose children attended [[tuition center|tuition classes]] in the building. It is believed that the builder wanted the building to be inhabited to prevent it being demolished.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

The developers, who intended to build up to 8 such illegal buildings, intended to sell the apartments for {{INR}}1,100 to {{INR}}1,400 per square foot. On average, the apartments were 175 square feet.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

===Land ownership===
The building had come to the attention of the [[Municipal Commissioner (India)|Municipal Commissioner]] RA Rajeevsaid because the building was said to be built illegally on forest land.&lt;ref name=IBN/&gt;{{#tag:ref|He said, "We had repeatedly asked the forest department to take action. We had asked [[Maharashtra State Electricity Board|MSEB]] to cut electricity to the building. We have issued notices to about 250 [[illegal housing in India|illegal buildings]] in this belt. We try [[eviction|forcible removal]]. It is not easy. Also it's a congested area; our equipment is unusable here."&lt;ref name=IBN/&gt;|group="nb"}} Research into the collapsed building's land ownership has determined that it was owned by a [[tribe|tribal]] family, and the adjoining lot was owned by the forest department.&lt;ref name="TOI Two top engineers" /&gt;

Although this property was not located on forest land, R.K. Pol, [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (India)|Chief Conservator of Forests]], has said that the forest department will address [[Structural encroachment|encroachment]] issues in the Thane district from [[Jawhar|Jawahar]]-[[Mokhada]] to [[Alibaug]].&lt;ref name="TOI Two top engineers" /&gt;

===Rescue===
The rescue efforts were supervised by [[District Collector]] P. Velarasu and [[Municipal Commissioner (India)|Municipal Commissioner]] R.A. Rajeev, and the rescue was conducted by incident medical teams and [[fire tender]]s. A number of local hospitals treated the injured. The most critically injured people were sent to [[Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital|Sion]] and [[Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Group of Hospitals|JJ Hospitals]]. Moderate injuries were treated at [[Thane]] Civil Hospital and [[Kalwa, Thane|Kalwa]]'s Kalsekar and CSM Civic hospitals.&lt;ref name=IBN/&gt; As of 6 April 2013, 36 injured people were still receiving treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/mumbai/Over-60-dead-70-injured-in-Thane-building-collapse/Article1-1038292.aspx "72 dead in Thane building collapse; 2 builders arrested."] ''Hindustan Times''. 6 April 2013. Retrieved 7 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers, including the [[National Disaster Response Force]] (NDRF), used [[bulldozer]]s, [[hydraulic jack]]s, [[power saw]]s and [[sledgehammer]]s to break through the "mound of steel and concrete" and dug an additional {{convert|8|ft|m}} below ground.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI Thane building collapse toll" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; The rescue effort was complicated by the way in which the floors were "sandwiched" in the collapse, making it difficult to find individuals in the rubble.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=176303382|title=Death Toll Hits 72 in India Building Collapse|publisher=[[NPR]]|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rescue effort ended on 6 April. According to NDRF spokesperson R.S. Rajesh: "We have dug beyond the basement level, and everything is now cleared; there's nothing left."&lt;ref name="TOI Thane building collapse toll" /&gt;

==Investigation==

===The builders===
The building collapse appeared to be the result of poor-quality building material and having been "weakly built", according to [[Police inspector]] Digamber Jangale and [[Police commissioner]] K.P. Raghuvanshi.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;{{#tag:ref|An unidentified local witness stated that: "They made an eight-story building of what was supposed to be a four-story building. People from the municipality used to visit the building but the builder still continued to add floors."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;|group="nb"}} Lawful building construction in Thane district requires blueprints to be filed and approved by municipal agencies and permits obtained to connect electricity, water and sewage services.

==Background==
The prevalence of [[illegal housing in India]]&lt;!----&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;----&gt; is due to a lack of housing coupled with high population growth,&lt;!----&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;----&gt; and illegal buildings are attractive to lower-income people because of the low housing costs.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Many people moved to the greater Mumbai area in search of jobs, and without affordable housing, thousands sleep in slums or on the streets. The [[Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (India)|Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation]] reports that there are approximately 19 million families with inadequate housing.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt; To meet the demands, there are many buildings constructed illegally.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Further, some builders do not follow proper building practices and laws, or execute proper safety measures. Poor construction materials are also to blame in these circumstances.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Within the Mumbai region there are estimated to be hundreds of illegal structures. Sameer Hashmi, a BBC reporter, says that activists "allege that unscrupulous builders often pay hefty bribes to authorities who turn a blind eye to these illegal structures and do not take any action against the builders."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

RT reports that: "...incidents of this kind are not rare in India, where builders often care more for cutting construction expenses than for the security and quality of the work being done."&lt;ref name="Orig RT citation"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/india-mumbai-buildings-collapses-367/ "38 killed as building collapses in India (PHOTOS)"] ''[[RT News]]'' 5 April 2013.

In 2010, the government of [[Maharashtra]] reported that there were about 500,000 illegal buildings within the [[Thane]] district.&lt;ref name="TOI Govt knew Thane district" /&gt;

In February 2013, [[Sunil Kumar Lahoria]], a [[Navi Mumbai]] developer, was killed after having lodged complaints about 600 area illegal buildings.

===2012 illegal building information===
In December 2012 Legislator [[Pratap Sarnaik]] obtained information, in accordance with the [[Right to Information Act]], about the scope of the construction of illegal buildings in the Thane district.&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt; The following was reported in ''[[The Hindu]]'' for Thane's divisions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the nine divisions under the corporation last year, 505 illegal buildings were demolished, there was action against 829 (which does not mean they were demolished), and in December, 2012 alone, 104 illegal constructions were detected. The year round 146 buildings were given notices, and 53 cases of violations were filed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act and 83 cases registered under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Act.&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Hindu'' reported: "while the [[Thane Municipal Corporation|TMC]] says illegal buildings were demolished or given stop work notices, in reality nothing happens. The buildings were rarely brought down and people continued to live there."&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt;

===2010 Bombay High Court order===
The total number of illegal structures are estimated to be about 490,000 in the [[Thane district]] according to information in the [[Bombay High Court|Bombay (Mumbai) High Court]]. The structures include [[slum]]s, shops, [[chawl]]s and other buildings. Although the court ordered demolition of all such buildings in 2010, the government's response was that no illegal structures built before 2001 would be demolished and no action was taken in response to this judgement.&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt;

===2005 remote sensing order===
According to Raju Phanse, Right to Information (RTI) activist and General Secretary of the Dharmarajya Paksha political party, Thane Municipal Corporation did not act upon the 2005 [[Maharashtra]] state resolution to identify illegal buildings. The order called for municipalities to use [[remote sensing]] technology to identify illegal buildings by 28 February 2005 and monitor [[Satellite imagery|satellite images]] every six months.&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt; R.A. Rajeev, Thane Municipal Commissioner, said that "we are doing what we can"; he admitted that 90% of Mumbra's buildings are illegal.&lt;ref name="Illegal structures abound" /&gt;

==Arrests==
As of 9 April 13 people were arrested.&lt;ref name=PTI /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITN /&gt; Information from interrogation of the two builders, and documents found in one of the builder's homes, led to the arrest of the others in this case.&lt;ref name="TOI Two top engineers" /&gt; Except for the engineers charged with [[duty of care|dereliction of duty]],&lt;ref name="TOI Two top engineers" /&gt; the suspects are charged with [[culpable homicide]] not amounting to murder and [[criminal conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=PTI /&gt; They could be sentenced up to life if convicted.&lt;ref name=Timesonline /&gt;

==Actions to manage illegal buildings==

===Demolition drive===
A formal campaign to demolish area illegal buildings began on 9 April 2013 and is expected to be conducted before the [[monsoon]] season. It will be led by Anil Patil, Senior Engineer. The first phase of a "demolition drive" begins as 57 illegal buildings in the district (including Mumbra-Kausa area) are vacated, taken over by the Thane Municipal Council (TMC) and demolished. To support the effort, 15 additional officials will be added to the demolition cell and 9 legal advisors will be added to address legal matters. The police are engaged to facilitate evictions.&lt;ref name="DNA" /&gt;

The demolition effort will focus first on the most dangerous buildings.&lt;ref name="DNA Thane civic body"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/1820741/report-thane-civic-body-goes-hammer-and-tongs-against-illegal-buildings | title=Thane civic body goes hammer and tongs against illegal buildings | date=10 April 2013 | agency=DNA | accessdate=10 April 2013 | author=Varsha Dugar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other buildings at the Lucky compound have been razed as part of this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/thane-building-collapse-two-more-arrested/article4598319.ece | title=Thane building collapse: Two more arrested (with photo) | date=9 April 2013 | work=[[The Hindu]] | accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cut off utilities to all illegal buildings===
Further, the TMC intends to have sewer, water, and electricity service disconnected at all illegal buildings in the district. Water and sewer should be able to be turned off immediately; TMC is requesting that electricity is turned off by the electric service.&lt;ref name="DNA Thane civic body" /&gt;

===Call centre established===
The Thane Municipal Corporation established a [[call centre]] to receive complaints about illegal buildings on 10 April 2013. Its responsibilities include: notifying municipal officials of the complaints, tabulating information about actions taken and preparing reports of complaints and activities for the Municipal Commissioner. It is a 24 hours a day operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/states/building-collapse-thane-municipal-corporation-sets-up-call-centre-for-plaints/article4602809.ece | title=Building collapse: Thane municipal corporation sets up call centre for plaints | location=Thane | work=Business Line | date=10 April 2013 | accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United States patent law}}
The '''Bayh–Dole Act''' or '''Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act''' ([[Public law|Pub. L.]] 96-517, December 12, 1980) is  [[United States]] legislation dealing with intellectual property arising from [[Research funding#Government-funded research|federal government-funded research]]. Sponsored by two [[United States Senate|senators]], [[Birch Bayh]] of [[Indiana]] and [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], the Act was adopted in 1980, is codified at 94 [[United States Statutes at Large|Stat.]] 3015, and in 35 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] § 200–212,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/part-II/chapter-18|title=35 U.S. Code Chapter 18 - PATENT RIGHTS IN INVENTIONS MADE WITH FEDERAL ASSISTANCE|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is implemented by 37 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R.]] 401.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/401|title=37 CFR Part 401 - RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS UNDER GOVERNMENT GRANTS, CONTRACTS, AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key change made by Bayh–Dole was in ownership of inventions made with federal funding.  Before the Bayh–Dole Act, federal research funding contracts and grants obligated inventors (wherever they worked) to assign inventions they made using federal funding to the federal government.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Ashley Stevens (2004) [http://www.bu.edu/otd/files/2011/02/The-Enactment-of-Bayh-Dole.pdf The Enactment of Bayh–Dole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526065514/http://www.bu.edu/otd/files/2011/02/The-Enactment-of-Bayh-Dole.pdf |date=2012-05-26 }} Journal of Technology Transfer 29:93–99&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayh–Dole permits a university, small business, or non-profit institution to elect to pursue ownership of an invention in preference to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emerging Energy and Intellectual Property – The Often Unappreciated Risks and Hurdles of Government Regulations and Standard Setting Organizations|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/emerging-energy-and-intellectual-property-often-unappreciated-risks-and-hurdles-gove |publisher=[[Husch Blackwell]]|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-05-22|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Bayh–Dole Act grew out of the Congress's efforts to respond to the [[1970s recession|economic malaise of the 1970s]].&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;  One of Congress's efforts was focused on how best to manage inventions that were created with the more than $75 billion a year invested in government sponsored R&amp;D.  Three philosophies were debated: "a Hamiltonian belief that the solution lay with a strong central government, which should take charge and actively manage these resources";  "a Jeffersonian belief that the solution lay with the individual and that the best thing government could do to provide incentives for success was to get out of the way of these individuals"; and a belief that "held that government could only hurt and that it should make sure that everyone benefited financially from government's efforts".&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;

Prior to the enactment of Bayh-Dole, the U.S. government had accumulated 28,000 patents, but fewer than 5% of those patents were commercially licensed.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Accounting Office (GAO) Report to Congressional Committees. May 7, 1978.  [http://www.gao.gov/archive/1998/rc98126.pdf "Technology Transfer, Administration of the Bayh-Dole Act by Research Universities"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

These patents had accumulated because after [[World War II]], the government under [[President Harry S. Truman]] decided to continue and even ramp up its spending on research and development, on the basis of [[Vannevar Bush]]'s famous report entitled, "Science The Endless Frontier", which stated: "Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress."&lt;ref&gt;Vannevar Bush. [https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Science The Endless Frontier: A Report to the President by Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development] United States Government Printing Office, Washington: 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/scienceendlessfr00unit |title=Science, the endless frontier; A Report to the President on a Program for Postwar Scientific Research |last=Bush |first=Vannevar |date=July 1945 |website=Internet.org: Biodiversity Heritage Library |publisher=Washington D.C., National Science Foundation |page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government did not have a unified patent policy governing all the agencies that funded research, and the general policy was that government would retain title to inventions and would license them only nonexclusively.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff, BayhDole25, Inc. April 17, 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110516070925/http://bayhdolecentral.com/BayhDole25_WhitePaper.pdf The Bayh-Dole Act at 25]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10–14}}  "Those seeking to use government-owned technology found a maze of rules and regulations set out by the agencies in question because there was no uniform federal policy on patents for government-sponsored inventions or on the transfer of technology from the government to the private sector."&lt;ref&gt;United States General Accounting Office. May 1998 [https://archive.is/20121211203650/http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-536 Technology Transfer, Agencies' Rights to Federally Sponsored Biomedical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) introduced a uniform "Institutional Patent Agreement" to allow grantee nonprofit institutions to obtain assignment of patentable inventions made with federal funding for which the institution had decided to seek patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bayhdolecentral.com/bremmerPDF/Institutional_Patent_Agreement,_12-1-1968.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003102756/http://bayhdolecentral.com/bremmerPDF/Institutional_Patent_Agreement,_12-1-1968.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, over seventy universities and research organizations had negotiated an IPA with HEW or with the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bayhdolecentral.com/bremmerPDF/List_of_IPA_Holders.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003060839/http://bayhdolecentral.com/bremmerPDF/List_of_IPA_Holders.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, faculty at [[Purdue University]] in Indiana had made important discoveries under grants from the Department of Energy, which did not issue Institutional Patent Agreements.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt; Officials at the university complained to their Senator, Birch Bayh, whose staff investigated.  At the same time, Senator Robert Dole was made aware of similar issues, and the two senators agreed to collaborate on a bill, along the lines of the "Jeffersonian belief" described above.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;

Accordingly, as described below, the legislation decentralized control of federally funded inventions, vesting the responsibility and authority to commercialize inventions with the institution or company receiving a grant, with certain responsibilities to the government, the inventor, and the public, as described below.

==Recipient requirements==
The Bayh–Dole Act authorizes the Department of Commerce to create standard patent rights clauses to be included in federal funding agreements with nonprofits, including universities, and small businesses.&lt;ref name=Nouvelles&gt;Vicki Loise, CAE, and Ashley J. Stevens, CLP [http://www.bu.edu/otd/files/2011/02/The_Bayh-Dole_Act_Turns_30.pdf The Bayh-Dole Act Turns 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526064734/http://www.bu.edu/otd/files/2011/02/The_Bayh-Dole_Act_Turns_30.pdf |date=2012-05-26 }} Les Nouvelles December 2010: 185-94&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard patent rights clause is set forth at 37 CFR 401.14(a).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=b1b3f0363cc8f316c1f41b2628e8e005&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=37:1.0.4.13.1.0.218.14&amp;idno=37|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|work=ecfr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clause is incorporated into federal funding agreements through a number of contracting instruments, including grants made to universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=1984c69b3e51c31b0770f6466db539b6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=2:1.1.2.10.2.3.11.17&amp;idno=2|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|work=ecfr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contracts made with for-profit companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/52_227.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the standard patent rights clause, small businesses and [[non-profit organization]]s, if they obtain title by assignment to "subject inventions," can retain that title by complying with certain formalities. No small business or nonprofit organization, however, is required to obtain ownership of such inventions.  All organizations agree to do the following:&lt;ref name=Nouvelles/&gt;

*Include the patent rights clause in any subcontracts;
*Report subject inventions to the sponsoring agency;
*Elect in writing whether or not to retain title; 
*Conduct a program of education for employees regarding the importance of timely disclosure; and
*Require certain employees to make a written agreement to protect the government's interest in subject inventions.

If an organization does not elect to retain title, then control of the invention passes to the Federal agency. The agency may waive its right to take title to the invention, and allow the inventors to retain title to their inventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/pdf/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap18-sec202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2002-title37-vol1/pdf/CFR-2002-title37-vol1-sec401-9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage =  | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaV5y8VXheY Katharine Ku-The Bayh-Dole Act]}}
If an organization elects to retain title to a subject invention for which it has obtained assignment,  the organization is obligated to do the following:&lt;ref name=Nouvelles/&gt;
*Grant to the government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world;
*File its initial patent application within one year after its election to retain title;
*Notify the government if it will not continue prosecution of an application or will let a patent lapse;&lt;ref&gt;37 CFR 401.14(f)(3) https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/401.14&lt;/ref&gt;
*Convey to the Federal agency, upon written request, title to any subject invention if the organization fails to file, does not continue a prosecution, or will allow a patent to lapse;
*In each patent include a statement that identifies the contract under which the invention was made and notice of the government's rights in the invention;
*Report on the utilization of subject inventions;
*Require in exclusive licenses to use or sell in the United States that products will be manufactured substantially in the United States; and
*Agree to allow the government to "march in" and require licenses to be granted, or to grant licenses, in certain circumstances, such as if the organization has not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention.

Certain additional requirements apply to nonprofit organizations only.  Nonprofits must also:&lt;ref name=Nouvelles/&gt;
*Assign rights to a subject invention only to an organization having as a primary function the management of inventions, unless approved by the Federal agency
*Share royalties with the inventor
*Use the balance of royalties after expenses for scientific research or education
*Make efforts to attract, and give preference to, small business licensees

===Subject inventions===
A subject invention is defined as "any invention of the contractor that is conceived or first actually [[reduction to practice|reduced to practice]] in the performance of work under a funding agreement."&lt;ref name=MPEP&gt;{{cite web |last=USPTO |title=Bayh-Dole Act |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_201.htm |work=Manual of Patent Examining Procedure |accessdate=2011-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920231215/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_201.htm |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFR addresses the relationship between federal funding and other funding that may supplement the federally supported research. If an invention is made outside the research activities of the federally funded research "without interference with or cost to the government-funded project," then the invention is not a subject invention. Similarly, an invention is not a subject invention if it arises in closely related research outside the "planned and committed activities" of the federally funded project, and the closely related research does not "diminish or distract from the performance" of the federally funded project.&lt;ref name=iEdison&gt;{{cite web|last=iEdison.gov|title=Sec. 401.1 Scope|url=https://s-edison.info.nih.gov/iEdison/37CFR401.jsp#401-1|work=37 CFR 401.1-16|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal proceedings and case law ==

There is a growing body of case law on Bayh-Dole.

===Ownership of inventions===
{{Main|Stanford v. Roche}}

'''''Stanford v. Roche''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford University v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.|563 U.S. 776]] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that held that title in a patented invention vests first in the inventor, even if the inventor is a researcher at a federally funded lab subject to the Bayh–Dole Act.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1159.pdf ''Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.''], 131 S.Ct. 2188 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The judges affirmed the common understanding of US Constitutional law that inventors automatically own their inventions, and contractual obligations to assign those rights to third parties are secondary.&lt;ref name=Baer&gt;Baer MF, et al [http://www.velaw.com/uploadedFiles/VEsite/Resources/TheBasicPatentLawPrinciple.pdf Stanford v. Roche: Confirming The Basic Patent Law Principle That Inventors Ultimately Have Rights In Their Inventions]  les Nouvelles March 2012:19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The case arose because a Stanford employee, who was under obligation to assign inventions to Stanford, spent time at a biotech company to learn a technique, and signed an agreement with that company agreeing to assign inventions to it.  The company was later purchased by Roche.  Stanford filed patents on work the employee did after returning to Stanford, and the company (and later Roche) introduced products based on the work the Stanford employee did at the company.   When Stanford sued Roche for infringing its patents, Roche countered that it had an ownership interest in the patents due to the agreement that the Stanford employee had signed.   Among the arguments Stanford made at the District, Federal Circuit, and Supreme Court levels, was one that stated that the Bayh–Dole Act gave grant recipients a "right of second refusal" subject to the Government's right of first refusal, based on the following language of the statute: "If a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention in cases subject to this section, the Federal agency may consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations promulgated hereunder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/202|title=35 U.S. Code § 202 - Disposition of rights|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the District court accepted that argument,&lt;ref name=McGuire&gt;George R. McGuire October 28, 2009 [http://www.bsk.com/media-center/1742-intellectual-property-bd-trs-leland-stanford-junior-univ-v-roche Intellectual Property: Bd. Of Trs. Of The Leland Stanford Junior Univ. V. Roche Molecular Sys., Inc.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305030458/http://www.bsk.com/media-center/1742-intellectual-property-bd-trs-leland-stanford-junior-univ-v-roche |date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court denied it, leaving the basic law of inventorship unchanged.&lt;ref name=Baer /&gt;

===Disclosure of subject inventions===
Only one case has discussed the implications of disclosing subject inventions. In ''Campbell Plastics Engineering &amp; Mfg., Inc. v. Les Brownlee'', 389 F.3d 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/03opinions/03-1512.pdf|title=Library Home Page — Georgetown Law|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that since the [[appellant]] failed to comply with the invention disclosure provisions of a contract, the court upheld the transfer of title to an invention to the [[U.S. Army]]. Specifically, the contract required, per Bayh-Dole, that an invention be disclosed to the U.S. Army through a specific form, DD Form 882s. Campbell Plastics never disclosed its subject invention through this form. Campbell Plastics argued instead that it disclosed all parts of its invention over the course of the contract, but simply never used the form.  The court did not specifically address the legitimacy of the particular form, but assumed that it was sufficient.  Nevertheless, the court found that the "piecemeal submissions [did] not adequately disclose the subject invention under the contract."  The result was a forfeiture of the subject invention.

===Extent of the government's license===
In a footnote in a famous [[experimental use]] case, ''[[Madey v. Duke University]]'', 307 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the court briefly mentions Bayh-Dole in suggesting that experimental uses by researchers are supported under the law. Specifically, the ''Madey'' court quoted the district court as holding that where a subject invention exists and the defendant is a recipient of government funding, "in light of the Bayh-Dole Act ... use of the patents that has been authorized by the government does not constitute [[patent infringement]]."

===Bayh-Dole and patentability===
In ''[[University of Rochester]] v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.'', 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court rejected a claim that Bayh-Dole altered the grounds for [[patentability]].  The court, quoting an [[amicus brief|Amicus curiæ]], stated

&lt;blockquote&gt;no connection exists between the Bayh-Dole Act and the legal standards that courts employ to assess patentability. Furthermore, none of the eight policy objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act encourages or condones less stringent application of the patent laws to universities than to other entities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Petitions for march-in rights===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage =  | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpo5sOQV9HY Francis Collins and Senator Durbin on NIH march-in rights, April 7, 2016 Senate Hearing]}}

The government's march-in right is one of the most contentious provisions in Bayh-Dole. It allows the funding agency, on its own initiative or at the request of a third party, to effectively ignore the exclusivity of a patent awarded under the act and grant additional licenses to other "reasonable applicants." This right is strictly limited and can only be exercised if the agency determines, following an investigation, that one of four criteria is met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/203-|title=35 U.S. Code § 203 - March-in rights|work=cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important of these is a failure by the contractor to take "effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention" or a failure to satisfy "health and safety needs" of consumers.

Though this right is, in theory, quite powerful, it has not proven so in terms of its practical application —as of January, 2015, no federal agency has exercised its march-in rights.  Five march-in petitions have been made to the [[National Institutes of Health]].

In ''In Re Petition of CellPro, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060127092258/http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/foia/cellpro/pdfs/foia_cellpro1.pdf Original petition from CellPro] (archive.org copy)&lt;/ref&gt; CellPro petitioned the NIH in March 1997 after five years of patent litigation with [[The Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Baxter Healthcare]].  CellPro had a patented, FDA-approved device for purifying stem cells for use in [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] procedures; Johns Hopkins had patents on a different method to purify stem cells and had licensed them to Becton Dickinson, which had sublicensed them to Baxter, which was developing products but had none on the market.  CellPro argued that the march-in provisions were created for this situation, especially because (in its view) availability of essential medical technology was at stake.  The NIH denied this claim&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070102183356/http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/foia/cellpro/pdfs/foia_cellpro39.pdf Determination In the Case of Petition of CellPro, Inc.] (archive.org copy)&lt;/ref&gt; citing:
* Johns Hopkins's licensing of the subject invention
* Baxter's use, manufacturing, and practice of the subject invention
* Baxter's application to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to market the invention
* The actual clinical benefit of purifying stem cells for use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was unknown
* Government intervention into markets has adverse effects and there is insufficient cause to do so in this case.

In ''In the Case of NORVIR'', the NIH received requests&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essentialinventions.org/legal/norvir/norvir-29jan04petition.pdf Petition to use authority under Bayh-Dole Act to promote access to Ritonavir]&lt;/ref&gt; from Essential Inventions in January 2004, and other members of the public and members of the [[United States Congress]],&lt;ref name=Norvir_Response&gt;[http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/March-in-norvir.pdf In the Case of NORVIR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930020159/http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/March-in-norvir.pdf |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to exercise march-in rights for patents owned by [[Abbott Labs]] covering the drug ritonavir, sold under the trade name [[Norvir]], a [[prescription drug]] used in the treatment of [[AIDS]]. In 2003 Abbott raised the price of Norvir 400% for U.S. customers (but not for consumers in any other country), and had refused to license ritonavir to another company for purposes for providing protease inhibitors coformulated with ritonavir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40430-2004Aug4.html| title=NIH Declines to Enter AIDS Drug Price Battle| accessdate=2006-01-16| author=Ceci Connolly| publisher=Washington Post| date=2004-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIH denied the petition finding no grounds to exercise its march-in rights.&lt;ref name=Norvir_Response /&gt; The NIH cited:
* The availability of Norvir to patients with AIDS
* That there was no evidence that health and safety needs were not adequately met by Abbott, and
* That the NIH should not address the issue of drug pricing, only Congress.

In ''In the Case of Xalatan'' the NIH received a request&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essentialinventions.org/legal/xalatan/xalatan-29jan04petition.pdf Petition to use authority under Bayh-Dole Act to promote access to Latanoprost]&lt;/ref&gt; from Essential Inventions in January 2004 to adopt a policy of granting march-in licenses to patents when the patent owner charged significantly higher prices in the United States than they did in other high income countries, on the basis of Pfizer's glaucoma drug being sold in the United States at two to five times the prices in other high income countries.  The NIH held that "the extraordinary remedy of march-in was not an appropriate means for controlling prices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ott.od.nih.gov/policy/March-in-xalatan.pdf In the Case of Xalatan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930022410/http://ott.od.nih.gov/policy/March-in-xalatan.pdf |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''In the Case of Fabrazyme''&lt;ref&gt;[http://patentlawyersite.com/files/Download/Fabrazyme_Petition_5_0.doc Petition to Use Authority under the Bayh-Dole Act to Promote Access to Fabryzyme (Agalsidase Beta), an Invention Supported by and Licensed by The National Institutes of Health under Grant NO. DK-34045] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409183115/http://patentlawyersite.com/files/Download/Fabrazyme_Petition_5_0.doc |date=April 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; patients with [[Fabry disease]] petitioned on August 2, 2010, for march-in rights in response to [[Genzyme]]'s inability to manufacture enough Fabrazyme to treat all Fabry patients.  In 2009, Genzyme rationed the drug to less than a third of the recommended dose as a result of manufacturing problems and FDA sanctions, but did not anticipate being able to meet the market needs until late 2011.  The patients had a return of their symptoms and were put at greater risk of morbidity and mortality at the reduced dosage.  The petitioners contended that where a licensee of a public invention has created a drug shortage, the public health requirements of the Bayh–Dole Act are not met and other manufacturers should be allowed to enter the market.

On November 3, 2010, the NIH denied the petition for march-in, stating that under the then-current FDA drug approval process, it would take years of clinical testing to bring a [[biosimilar]] of Fabrazyme to market and therefore march-in would not address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/March-in-Fabrazyme.pdf Determination in the Case of Fabrazyme Manufactured by Genzyme Corporation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721055535/http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/March-in-Fabrazyme.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NIH also stated that it would continue to monitor the situation and if Genzyme could not meet its production deadlines, or if a third party licensee requested a license, the march-in request would be revisited.  The NIH additionally required regular updates from [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]], the patent holder, which agreed to not seek injunctions for potentially infringing products being sold during the shortage. On February 13, 2013, NIH's Office of Technology Transfer issued a "close out" letter stating that: "The December 2012 report from Genzyme stated that: (1) U.S. Fabry patients remain on full dose regimens, (2) Genzyme continues to accommodate new patients with full dosing and without placing them on a waiting list; and (3) Genzyme is able to provide full doses of Fabrazyme to patients transitioning to Fabrazyme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/Fabrazyme-CABlack.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2012 the NIH received a petition on behalf of a coalition of public interest groups to exercise its march-in rights against [[AbbVie]] over its antiretroviral drug [[ritonavir]] (sold under the name Norvir).  On October 25, 2013 NIH denied the petition&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ott.nih.gov/sites/default/files/documents/policy/March-In-Norvir2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; stating that, as in 2004 when similar pricing and availability issues regarding the same drug were raised and discussed at public hearings, the NIH'S role in the case was limited to compliance with the Bayh-Dole Act and that "... the extraordinary remedy of march-in is not an appropriate means of controlling prices of drugs broadly available ...".

===No Third Party Rights are Created===
Despite an ambiguity noted by commentators as to the effects on the public of a contractor's failure to comply with the requirements of Bayh-Dole,&lt;ref&gt;Scott D. Locke, Patent Litigation over Federally Funded Inventions and the Consequences of Failing to Comply with Bayh Dole, 8 Va. J. L. &amp; Tech. 3 (2003) http://vjolt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/Articles/vol8/issue1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; the courts have clarified that any such failure does not in and of itself divest an owner of title or render a patent invalid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9033">The People's Democratic Republic of [[Algeria]] prohibits [[blasphemy]] against [[Islam]] by using legislation rather than by using [[Sharia]]. The penalty for blasphemy may be years of imprisonment as well as a fine. Every Algerian child has an opportunity to learn what blasphemy is because Islam is a compulsory subject in public schools, which are regulated jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Religious Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Constitution and laws ==
More than ninety-nine percent of Algeria's population is [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]. The [[Constitution of Algeria]] declares that Islam is the [[state religion]] but Article 36 of the Constitution provides for [[freedom of belief]]. The Constitution does not provide for Sharia courts in Algeria's court system. Article 35 guarantees freedom of conscience and of opinion. Article 41 says all citizens are entitled to the [[freedom of expression]]. Algeria has signed and ratified the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).&lt;ref name = "USgov"&gt;{{cite web

Despite the provisions of the Constitution, Algeria severely restricts what anyone can say or what anyone can do as a religious practice. The penal code forbids anyone from insulting, or inciting hatred against, anyone who belongs to an ethnic or philosophical group or to a religion.&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt; Freedom of speech must be exercised with respect for "individual dignity, the imperatives of foreign policy, and the national defense."&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;

Algeria uses a 1990 law to protect Islam from defamation, to control access to information from outside the country, and to outlaw writing that threatens national unity. In 2001, the government amended some laws to criminalize writing, cartoons, and speech that insult or offend the president, the parliament, the judiciary, the armed forces, or "any other authority of public order." Those convicted of giving offense face prison sentences that range from three to twenty-four months and fines of 50,000 to 500,000 dinars.&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MRA) operates to ban publications and broadcasting that might be blasphemous. At the October 2008 Algiers Book Fair, the MRA banned the sale of 1,471 religious titles. Shortly before the book fair, the government banned the printing of author and vocal government critic [[Mohamed Benchicou]]'s latest book, ''The Diary of a Free Man''. During the 2007 book fair, government officials confiscated and banned a previous book by Benchicou, ''The Jailhouses of Algiers''. Algeria banned the Arab news network ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;

The government monitors e-mail and the Internet for material that is offensive to the authorities. Internet service providers can face criminal penalties for the material and the websites they host. Providers are not permitted to give access to material "incompatible with morality or public opinion."&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;

== Recent history ==
In 1991, a [[Algerian Civil War|war]] began between the Algerian government and several Islamist groups. Fighters on both sides conducted campaigns of torture and murder that were sometimes indiscriminate and sometimes aimed at the intellectual and educated community. The victims included many teachers, students, journalists, writers, artists, musicians, the defenders of human rights, lawyers, civil servants, and foreigners.&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt; Hostilities abated after 2006 but a state of emergency remains in effect.&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Selected cases ==

In February 2008, authorities arrested Christian converts Yousef Ourahmane, Rachid Seghir (or Esseghir), and Hamid Ramdani for blasphemy and for uttering threats against a man who allegedly converted from Islam to Christianity to Islam. At the trial, which began on 21 October 2008, the prosecutor asked the court for three years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 dinars for each man. The court acquitted the men on 29 October because the prosecution did not prove that the men had committed a crime.&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "compass"&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, authorities arrested six residents of the town of Biskra for eating and playing cards during the daylight hours of Ramadan. On 5 October 2008, a judge found all six guilty and fined them 120,000 dinars each ($1,770 US). Six days later an appeals court judge overruled the decision on the ground that the original sentence violated the Constitution. In a separate incident, the Algiers appeals court on 18 November reduced the sentence of three years' imprisonment to two months of time served for three men convicted of smoking during Ramadan. Authorities arrested the men on 21 September and detained them for the duration of their trial.&lt;ref name = "USgov"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "compass"/&gt;

In 2007, a court dropped charges of blasphemy against Lotfi Chriet and Houria Khatir and six journalists. Chriet and Khatir were the managers of two television channels. The alleged blasphemy was the broadcast of cartoons which were published originally in 2005 in the Danish magazine [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'']]. The court ruled that the broadcast's purpose was not to ridicule [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2007, a court in the city of Biskra sentenced 26-year-old Samia Smets to ten years imprisonment for violating the Quran. Article 160(4) of the Algerian Criminal Code states that “any damage or desecration of the Holy Book is punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison."&lt;ref name = "Samia_one"/&gt; On 28 October 2008, a judge of the Criminal Division of the court in Biskra acquitted Smets. The judge found that Smets, while in jail because of a civil matter, had accidentally dropped a copy of the [[Quran]] into water during an argument with other prisoners. Those prisoners had accused Smets of tearing up a Quran but the prosecution did not produce a torn Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Backlit_keyboard.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Backlit_keyboard.jpg|thumb|303x303px|Computer Trespassing is very similar to [[Hacking (computer security)|hacking]].]]
'''Computer trespass''' is a [[computer crime]] in the [[United States]] involving unlawful access to computers. It is defined under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|Computer Fraud and Abuse act]]. ([[USC Title 18, Section 2257|U.S.C 18]] § 1030)

== Definition ==
A computer trespass is defined as accessing a computer without proper authorization and gaining financial information, information from a department or agency of the United States and/or information from any protected computer. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030|title=18 U.S. Code § 1030 - Fraud and related activity in connection with computers|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each state has their own laws regarding computer trespassing but they all echo the federal act in some manner

== Examples of State Legislation ==

== Criticism of the Computer Fraud And Abuse Act ==
Years after the CFAA was put into law, many have become uncomfortable with the law's language because of the drastic difference between today's technology and the technology of the 1980s. Legal scholars such as [[Orin Kerr]] and [[Tiffany Curtis]] have expressed such concerns. In one of Curtis's essays, "COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT ENFORCEMENT: CRUEL, UNUSUAL, AND DUE FOR REFORM." She expresses how, with the passage of time, the CFAA becomes a more cruel law with the current language used in the act. She then suggests that the [[United States Congress]] should take the act into review and refer it to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] to update the language to better fit modern law and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.uw.edu/wlr/print-edition/print-edition/vol-91/4/computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-enforcement-cruel-unusual-and-due-for-reform|title=Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Enforcement: Cruel, Unusual, and Due for Reform {{!}} UW School of Law|website=UW School of Law|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr wrote in his essay, "Trespass, Not Fraud: The Need for New Sentencing Guidelines in CFAA Cases," that since the language is so vague in the act, you could be punished in a way that doesn't reflect the crime you committed. He stresses how the language stresses the financial fraud language more than any other part in the law, leaving the rest vague in meaning. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Index?collection=journals&amp;index=journals/gwlr|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15001">{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
The '''Confrontation Clause''' of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides that "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right…to be confronted with the [[witness]]es against him."  Generally, the right is to have a face-to-face confrontation with witnesses who are offering testimonial evidence against the accused in the form of cross-examination during a trial.  The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] makes the right to confrontation applicable to the states and not just the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Pointer v. Texas, https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=evidence&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr&lt;/ref&gt;  The right only applies to criminal prosecutions, not civil cases or other proceedings.

The Confrontation Clause has its roots in both [[English law|English]] [[common law]], protecting the right of [[cross-examination]], and [[Roman law]], which guaranteed persons accused of a crime the right to look their accusers in the eye.  In noting the right's long history, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has cited [[Acts of the Apostles]] 25:16, which reports the [[Roman governor]] [[Porcius Festus]], discussing the proper treatment of his prisoner [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]: "It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man up to die before the accused has met his accusers face-to-face, and has been given a chance to defend himself against the charges." It is also cited in Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s treatises, and statutes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://federalevidence.com/pdf/1999/Lilly_v._Virginia.pdf ''Lilly v. Virginia'', 527 U.S. 116 (1999) (Breyer, J. concurring)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testimonial hearsay ==
In 2004, in ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] significantly redefined the application of the right to confrontation.  In ''Crawford'', the Supreme Court changed the inquiry from whether the evidence offered had an "indicia of reliability"&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18130169725366408619&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Ohio v. Roberts'']&lt;/ref&gt; to whether the [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is [[testimony|testimonial]] [[hearsay]].  The shift was from a substantive and  subjective inquiry into the reliability of the evidence, to a procedural question of whether the defendant had been afforded the right to confront her or his accuser.  The Court implicitly noted the shift, "Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because the defendant is obviously guilty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2007/13-SCt/Crawford_v._Washington.pdf ''Crawford v. Washington'', 541 U.S. 36 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Crawford'' Court decided the key was whether the evidence was testimonial because of the Sixth Amendment's use of the word "witness."  Quoting the dictionary, the Court explained that a witness is one who "bear[s] testimony" and that "testimony" refers to a "solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing some fact."

Nonetheless, in ''Crawford,'' the Supreme Court explicitly declined to provide a "comprehensive" definition of "testimonial" evidence (and, thus evidence subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause).  In ''[[Davis v. Washington]]'' and its companion case, ''Hammon v. Indiana'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2008/07-July/Davis_v._Washington.pdf ''Davis v. Washington'', 547 U.S. 813 (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Court undertook exactly this task.  The Court explained what constitutes testimonial hearsay:
:Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  They are testimonial when the circumstances indicate that there is no ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.

The ''Davis'' Court noted several factors that, objectively considered, help determine whether a statement is testimonial: 1) whether the statement describes past events or events as they are happening, 2) whether the purpose of the statement is to assist in investigation of a crime or, on the other hand, provide information relevant to some other purpose, 3) the level of formality of the exchange in which the statement is made.  The court noted that a single conversation with, for example, a 911 operator may contain both statements that are intended to address an ongoing emergency and statements that are for the purpose of assisting police investigation of a crime.  The latter are testimonial statements because they are the sort of statements that an objectively reasonable person, listening to the statements, would expect to be used in an investigation or prosecution.

The ''Crawford'' decision left the other basic components of the Confrontation Clause's applicability—the witness's availability and the scope of the cross examination—unchanged.

== Availability ==
If a statement is testimonial, the person making the statement must generally be available for cross examination.  An exception to this rule is if the witness is unavailable.  But even where the witness is unavailable, the defendant must have had a prior opportunity to confront the witness through cross examination.  The latter requirement, cross examination, is discussed below.

A witness may be unavailable for a variety of reasons.  A common reason for a witness to be unavailable is that the witness is claiming a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.  Other privileges are also a source of unavailability.  Witnesses may also be unavailable because they have died, had memory loss, or simply decided not to cooperate as a witness against the defendant. 

The obvious may also occur, a witness may be intimidated, seriously injured, or murdered, and his prior statements then are usually not admissible even if it appears the defendant caused the nonappearance. The federal witness protection program was developed because of the difficulty of prosecuting cases where witnesses would disappear shortly before trial.  &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Marshals Service, Witness Security Program&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; California Witness Relocation and Protection Program &lt;/ref&gt;  These programs frequently require the witness to leave his residence or even family so that he can be protected before the trial occurs.

== Cross-examination ==
Even where the witness is unavailable, the defendant usually has a right to cross-examine the witness.  An exception to this rule, forfeiture by wrongdoing, is discussed below.

The more obvious violations of the right to cross-examine witnesses are those where the defendant has never had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at all, in any setting, or on any subject.  The closer cases are those where some cross-examination has occurred, either at trial or prior to trial.

Generally, having the opportunity to cross-examine a witness at trial will satisfy the Confrontation Clause's guarantee.  And trial courts are given "broad discretion . . . to preclude repetitive and unduly harassing interrogation."&lt;ref name=davis-alaska&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10881744166851417695&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000000002&amp;as_vis=1 ''Davis v. Alaska'', 415 U.S. 308, 316 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court has emphasized that the "Confrontation Clause guarantees an ''opportunity'' for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defendant might wish.&lt;ref&gt;''Delaware v. Fensterer'', 474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985) (per curiam)&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, a trial court cannot preclude cross-examination on some subjects.  Besides the subject matter of the case, the crime for which a defendant is charged, a defendant has the right to attack the credibility or impeach the testimony of the witness.  Despite trial courts' "broad discretion", it is an error to limit defendants from cross-examining witnesses on an area that would expose a "prototypical form of bias" that would be relevant to the jury's assessment of that witness's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7503274425707437064&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Delaware v. Van Arsdall'', 475 U.S. 673, 680 (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of such biases include being on probation as a juvenile delinquent, even where the state normally considers such a status to be protected confidential information;&lt;ref name=davis-alaska/&gt; having charges dropped in exchange for testimony, despite a specific denial that dropping the charges had any effect on the testimony;&lt;ref&gt;''Van Arsdall'', 475 U.S. at 676-77&lt;/ref&gt; and shared allegiances of the victim and witness, including gang membership.&lt;ref&gt;''Cousins v. Commonwealth'', 693 S.E.2d 283 (Va. Ct. App. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions to the right of confrontation ==
In ''Crawford'', the Supreme Court noted that two exceptions to the common law right of confrontation were acknowledged at the time the constitution was written: forfeiture by wrongdoing and dying declarations.  Only the former has been explicitly adopted by the Court.

=== Forfeiture by wrongdoing ===
Where the defendant makes the witness unavailable for the purpose of preventing the witness from testifying, the defendant forfeits the right to confront the witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2008/06-June/Giles_v._Ca_6-25-08.pdf ''Giles v. California'', 554 U.S. 353, 128 S.Ct. 2678 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This exception only applies to circumstances where the defendant acts with the purpose of preventing the testimony, but not to other circumstances where the defendant may nonetheless be blameworthy.  For example, the testimonial statements of an uncross-examined murder victim are not admissible against the person who committed the murder unless the murder was committed for the purpose of preventing the victim from testifying.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4876568856193042363&amp;q=zanders+v+united+states+confrontation+clause&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20004 ''Zanders v. United States'', 999 A.2d 149 (D.C. 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603192937/http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4876568856193042363&amp;q=zanders+v+united+states+confrontation+clause&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20004 |date=2015-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the prosecution's burden to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the defendant secured the witness's unavailability for the purpose of preventing the witness to testify.

=== Dying declarations ===
[[Dying declaration]]s, although noted by the ''Crawford'' Court as a historic exception to the common law right of confrontation, have not yet been explicitly acknowledged by the Court as an exception to the Confrontation Clause right.  Lower courts have recognized the exception, but during oral argument in ''Michigan v. Bryant'', the Court discussed the exception at length and frequently implied that the exception might apply,&lt;ref&gt;[http://federalevidence.com/pdf/Michigan_v._Bryant%20/Michigan_v._Bryant_SCTranscript.10-5-10.pdf Transcript of Oral Argument, ''Michigan v. Bryant'']&lt;/ref&gt; as it had done in ''Crawford'' and ''Giles''.

== Harmless error and standards of review ==
Confrontation Clause violations are usually subject to harmless error review {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.  This means that even if evidence has been admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause, a defendant is not entitled to a new trial if the reviewing court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not contribute to the verdict.  Harmless error is not a standard of review, and is an analysis for whether the error might have affected the jury's decision.

Where a defendant fails to object to the inadmissible evidence at the time of trial or fails to specify that she or he is objecting on Confrontation Clause grounds, the reviewing court will sometimes only review for more substantial errors such as "plain error" or an error that results in a manifest injustice {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}.  Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal review unobjected to Confrontation Clause errors for plain error {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. State courts vary widely in their requirements for reviewing Confrontation Clause errors, but many review for either plain error, manifest injustice, or another similar standard.  In many instances, courts reverse on Confrontation Clause grounds without analyzing whether an error is harmless.  The most common reason for omitting such an analysis is the government's failure to raise harmlessness as an issue.  Generally, defendants do not raise harmlessness unless the government does so.

== Interaction with other laws ==
The [[U.S. state|states]] are free to interpret similar clauses in [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] more strictly than the Supreme Court's interpretation of the federal Confrontation Clause.&lt;ref&gt;''The Decline of the Confrontation Clause in New York,'' 28 Touro L. Rev. 929 (2012), ''available at'' http://digitalcommons.tourolaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&amp;context=lawreview&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many jurisdictions, including the federal courts and a number of states, practice constitutional abstention many cases that include Confrontation Clause violations are decided on other grounds.  Constitutional abstention is a judicial preference to resolve dispositive non-constitutional issues first, and only turning to constitutional issues if they are necessary to resolve the case.  In Confrontation Clause cases, constitutional abstention most typically occurs where the court resolves a hearsay issue based on the relevant evidence code before turning to the Confrontation Clause analysis.  Thus, a preference for interpreting other closely related laws first often leaves Confrontation Clause issues unaddressed.

== Other sources of a right to confront witnesses ==
The [[Due process|Due Process Clauses]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] also require confrontation as an element of [[due process]].  State statutes and constitutions are another source of the right to confront witnesses.

{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''Constitutional Court of Ukraine''' ({{lang-ua|Конституційний Суд України}}) is the sole body of constitutional jurisdiction in [[Ukraine]]. The Constitutional Court of Ukraine interprets the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] in terms of laws and other legal acts.

The Court initiated its activity on October 18, 1996. The first Court ruling was made on May 13, 1997.

On urgent matters the Constitutional Court rules within weeks, but on matters deemed less urgent it can take months.&lt;ref name=YanonewE&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/62597/ Yanukovych to call vote if coalition ruled illegal], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and authority ==
In 2016 access to the Constitutional Court was significantly broadened.&lt;ref name="Lexology09062016CAU"&gt;[http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=212fa5f8-4f4b-4b4d-9d5a-693579e0c95e Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine passed: Ukraine takes a major step towards a European System of Justice], [[Lexology]] (9 June, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then all individuals and companies where there are grounds to claim that a final court judgment contradicts the Constitution can file a complaint at the court.&lt;ref name="Lexology09062016CAU"/&gt; (Prior only the [[President of Ukraine|President]] and a [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|member of parliament]] had the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-12/15/c_136829258.htm Ukraine launches new Supreme Court to deepen judicial reform], [[Xinhuanet]] (15 December 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;) A complaint may only be filed after all other remedies have been exhausted in the [[Judiciary of Ukraine|regular Ukrainian courts]].&lt;ref name="Lexology09062016CAU"/&gt;

The amended Constitution of Ukraine now provides for access to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to all individuals and companies where there are grounds to claim that a final court judgment contradicts the Constitution. A complaint may only be filed after all other remedies have been exhausted in the regular Ukrainian courts. 

The authority of the Constitutional Court is derived from [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 147|Ukraine's Constitution - Chapter XII]]

The Court: 
* on the appeal of the President, no less than 45 members of the [[Verkhovna Rada|parliament]], the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]], the [[Ombudsman]], or the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean parliament]], assesses the constitutionality of:
** laws and other legal acts of the parliament
** acts of the President
** acts of the Cabinet
** legal acts of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Verkhovna Rada]] of the [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] (Crimean parliament)
* officially interprets the Constitution and laws of Ukraine
* on the appeal of the President or the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet]], provides opinions on the conformity with the Constitution of international treaties
* on the appeal of the parliament, provides an opinion on the observance of the procedure of impeachment of the President
* provides an opinion on the compliance of a bill on introducing amendments to the Constitution with the restrictions imposed by the Constitution.

The Court's rulings are mandatory for execution in Ukraine, are final and cannot be appealed. Laws and other legal acts, or their separate provisions, that are deemed unconstitutional, lose legal force.

== Structure ==
The Court is composed of 18 [[judge]]s, appointed in equal shares by the President, the parliament, and the Congress of Judges.

A judge must be a citizen of Ukraine and must have:
* attained the age of forty;
* a higher legal education and professional experience of no less than 10 years;
* resided in Ukraine for the last twenty years;
* command of the state language

Judges are appointed for 9 years without the right of reappointment; moreover each judge is obligated to retire at the age of 65 if this age comes before the end of the 9-year period. The President and parliament are required to fill a vacant position within one month and the Congress of judges has three months to do so. But the appointment comes into effect only after oath of the new judge in the parliament; therefore sometimes it is a problem to become a judge of the Constitutional Court if many members of parliament do not want this (for example, they can physically disturb to hold a meeting of the parliament, that is usual in Ukraine).

The Chairman of the Court is elected by secret ballot for a single three-year term from and by the members of the Court. The current Chairman, Anatoliy Holovin.

==Europe Council Parliamentary Assembly==

===Ukrainian Parliamentary Election, 2007===
{{main article|Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007}}
On April 19 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe passed a resolution in consideration of a report titled Functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine. &lt;sup&gt;(Items 13 and 14)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name="PACE_1549"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta07/ERES1549.htm |title=Functioning of democratic institutions in Ukraine |author=PACE |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] |date=2007-04-19 |authorlink=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116103456/http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta07%2FERES1549.htm |archivedate=2007-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated:
{{Cquote|The Assembly deplores the fact that the judicial system of Ukraine has been systematically misused by other branches of power and that top officials do not execute the courts’ decisions, which is a sign of erosion of this crucial democratic institution. An independent and impartial judiciary is a precondition for the existence of a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Hence the urgent necessity to carry out comprehensive judicial reform, including through amendments to the constitution.

The Assembly reiterates that the authority of the sole body responsible for constitutional justice – the Constitutional Court of Ukraine – should be guaranteed and respected. Any form of pressure on the judges is intolerable and should be investigated and criminally prosecuted. On the other hand, it is regrettable that in the eight months of its new full composition, the Constitutional Court has failed to produce judgments, thus failing to fulfil its constitutional role and to contribute to resolving the crisis in its earlier stages, which undermines the credibility of the court. There is an urgent need for all pending judgments, and in particular the judgment concerning the constitutionality of the Presidential Decree of 2 April 2007, to be delivered. If delivered, the latter should be accepted as binding by all sides.}}
The associated explanatory report under the sub-heading of '''''[[2007 Ukrainian political crisis#Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Pressure on the courts]]''''' expressed concern that {{Cquote|''"Several local courts have made decisions to suspend the Presidential Decree only to then withdraw them, allegedly under pressure from the presidential secretariat."'' &lt;sup&gt;(item 67)&lt;/sup&gt;}}

In emphasis the report &lt;sup&gt;(item 68)&lt;/sup&gt; stated {{Cquote|'''''This is a worrying tendency of legal nihilism that should not be tolerated. It is as clear as day that in a state governed by the rule of law judicial mistakes should be corrected through appeal procedures and not through threats or disciplinary sanctions'''''}}

On April 30, on the eve of the Constitutional Court's ruling on the legality of the president's decree dismissing Ukraine's parliament,  President Yushchenko, in defiance of the PACE resolution of April 19 intervened in the operation of Ukraine's Constitutional Court by summarily dismissing two Constitutional Court Judges, Syuzanna Stanik and [[Valeriy Pshenychnyy]], for allegations of "oath treason."&lt;ref name="Yushchenko dismissed CCU judges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.for-ua.com/news/2007/05/03/103007.html |title=Yushchenko dismissed CCU judges |accessdate=2006-05-17 |work=for-ua |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103211/http://www.eng.for-ua.com/news/2007/05/03/103007.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His move was later overturned by the Constitutional Court and the judges were returned by a [[Injunction|temporary restraining order]] issued by the court.&lt;ref name="korrespondent"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.korrespondent.net/main/190075|title=Stanik and Pshenychnyy returned to CC|date=2007-05-17|publisher=[[Korrespondent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16,Viktor Yushchenko, for a second time, issued another decree dismissing the two Constitutional Court Judges Syuzanna Stanik and [[Valeriy Pshenychnyy]].&lt;ref name="korrespondent2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pravda.com.ua/news/2007/5/16/58814.htm|title=Stanik and Pshenychnyy again became ex-judges of Constitutional Court|accessdate=2006-05-17|date=May 16, 2007|work=[[Korrespondent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, the Constitutional Court Chairman [[Ivan Dombrovskyy]] resigns and is replaced by [[Valeriy Pshenychnyy]].

On May 23, The Constitutional Court of Ukraine acted to prevent the president's undue influence on the court system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=45930 |title=Constitutional Court of Ukraine restricts president's influence on courts |publisher=Ukrainian National Radio |date=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014407/http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=45930 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's ruling was made after Viktor Yushchenko unduly sought to influence the court by illegally firing two Constitutional Court judges [[Valeriy Pshenychnyy]] and Syuzanna Stanik for allegations of "oath treason.".&lt;ref name="Yushchenko dismissed CCU judges"/&gt;

On July 20 Susanna Stanik won an appeal against the President in the Shevchenko district court of Kiev.  The Court ruled the President's actions illegal and reinstated Ms Stanik's entitlement as a member of Ukraine's Constitutional Court. According to the ruling, the President is obliged to cancel his decree on discharge of Mrs. Stanik.."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/7/20/8377.htm |title=Stanik Back Into the CC |accessdate=2006-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222936/http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/7/20/8377.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two judges who were also illegally dismissed had previously tendered their resignations and as such were not subject to the courts order.

Following the president's intervention the Constitutional Court still has not ruled on the question of legality of the president's actions.

Stepan Havrsh, the President's appointee to the Constitutional Court, in prejudgment of the courts decision and without authorization from the Court itself, commented in an interview published on July 24 {{Cquote|I cannot imagine myself as the Constitutional Court in condition in which three political leaders signed a political/legal agreement on holding early elections, which also stipulates the constitutional basis for holding the elections... How the court can agree to consider such a petition under such conditions.

Olexander Lavrynovych, Ukrainian Minister for Justice, in an interview published on August 3 is quoted as saying {{Cquote|According to the standards of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine, these elections should have been recognized invalid already today. But we understand that we speak about the State and about what will happen further in this country. As we've understood, political agreements substitute for the law, ... The situation has been led to the limit, where there are no possibilities to follow all legal norms.&lt;ref name="Lavrynovych"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2007/08/03/161518.html|title=Lavrynovych: Early elections should have been already recognized invalid today|publisher=Inter-Media, ForUm|date=2007-08-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102952/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2007/08/03/161518.html|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* On March 25, 2008 Ukraine's Supreme Administrative Court ruled the President's dismissal of Suzanna Stanik as a Constitutional Court judge illegal. Ms Stanik's position has been reinstated.

'''''Contra principia negantem non est disputandum''''' ([[Latin]], alternatively '''''Contra principia negantem disputari non potest''''' and '''''Contra principia negantem disputari nequit'''''; literally, "Against one who denies the principles, there can be no debate") is a principle of [[logic]] and [[law]]: in order to debate reasonably about a disagreement, there must be agreement about the principles or facts by which to judge the arguments.

The maxim cannot be found in [[Aristotle]], though scholars have pointed to some Aristotelian passages that approach it in spirit.&lt;ref name="Agassi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zekl"/&gt; It is sometimes said to have been used in Medieval [[scholastic philosophy]] to refer to the authority of the Aristotelian system.  [[Duns Scotus]] concludes one passage of his commentary on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'' with the statement, "If this argument is not convincing, many principles supposed by the philosophers are called into doubt; and against one who denies commonly accepted principles, discussion is impossible (''contra autem negantem principia communiter recepta, non est disputandum'').&lt;ref name="Duns Scotus"/&gt;

The maxim is sometimes cited from the seventeenth-century English legal treatise ''[[Edward Coke|Coke]] on Littleton'' (Co. Litt. 343), where it explains the notion of a "[[legal maxim|maxime in law]]."&lt;ref name="Coke"/&gt; 

[[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]] has a character (a physician) quote the maxim in the [http://www.letrs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/eprosed/eprosed-idx?coll=eprosed;type=HTML;rgn=DIV1;id=;byte=158056588 fifth act] of ''The Dumb Lady'' (1672).

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] refers to it in his "The Art of Controversy,"&lt;ref name="Schopenhauer"/&gt; and [[Lenin]] objected to [[Peter Berngardovich Struve]]'s assertion of the principle, retorting, "That depends on how these principia are formulated—as general propositions and notes, or as a ''different understanding'' of the ''facts'' of Russian history and present-day reality."&lt;ref name="Lenin"/&gt;  [[Karl Popper]] thought the maxim expressed the [[relativist]]'s irrationalist "doctrine of the impossibility of mutual understanding between different cultures, generations, or historical periods – even within science, even within physics": "The myth of the framework is clearly the same as the doctrine that one cannot rationally discuss anything that is ''fundamental'', or that a rational discussion of ''principles'' is impossible."&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;

{{Orphan|date=June 2014}}

The '''Law on Salaried Employees''' ({{lang-da|'''Funktionærloven'''}}), properly ''Lov om retsforholdet mellem arbejdsgivere og funktionærer'' (law on the legal relationship between employers and salaried employees), is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[law]] which gives [[salaried employee]]s certain rights with regard to termination, vacation, illness, non-solicitation and [[Non-compete clause|non-competition clause]]s, etc.

The first version of the law was adopted in 1938; it was last revised in 2013.

The Act is not a general employment law, because it applies only to certain occupational groups&amp;mdash;those defined under Danish law as salaried. The core group consists of employees engaged in clerical work, trade (for example, shop assistants), inventory processing, technical or clinical work (for example, engineers, nurses and doctors), management, etc. However, executives who are not subject to supervision, for example, [[CEO]]s, are not covered by the law.

In principle, the Act is not applicable to employees engaged in craft or factory work, agriculture, fishery, waiting tables, kitchen work, etc. However, although many sectors of employment are not immediately subject to the law, the law nonetheless applies to a portion of such sectors through employment contracts or agreements which provide that the law is to apply (for example, [[auxiliary nurse]]s, educators, social and health care assistants, and [[Danish Folkeskole Education|Folkeskole]] teachers). In Denmark, these are sometimes referred to as ''aftalefunktionærer'' (contract salaried employees) as opposed to ''lovfunktionærer'' (legal salaried employees), to whom the law automatically applies. Finally, some occupational groups in principle covered by the Act, by virtue of agreements [[Derogation|derogating]] from the law have a legal status which is better or worse than is provided for under the Act.

There is a requirement for the law to be applicable that the employee works at least 8 hours a week on average, and also a requirement that the employee is not a [[civil servant]].

The regulations concerning termination of employment under the Act establish a system of notices of termination based on the employee's length of service, which cannot be derogated from to the detriment of the employee. There is also the possibility of compensation in certain cases.

The regulations concerning non-solicitation and non-competition clauses under the Act entitle the employee to compensation amounting to half pay during the period after leaving the job during which the employee is covered by such clauses.

In the [[Genesis creation narrative]] ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:17), God tells [[Adam]] "But of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge of good and evil]] you shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8166/jewish/Chapter-2.htm Chabad, Genesis 2]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], this verse is a death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_55.html#PARTb Babylon Talmud, Sanhedrin 55b] An objection is raised: The ministering angels asked the Holy One, blessed be He: 'Sovereign of the Universe! Why didst Thou impose the penalty of death upon Adam?' Said He to them, I gave him an easy command, yet he violated it.' 'But Moses and Aaron fulfilled the whole Torah,' they pursued — 'yet they died'. 'There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath,'  He replied, showing that death may come without sin — He maintains as the following Tanna. For it was taught: R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Moses and Aaron too died through their sin, for it is said, Because ye believed not in me[...therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them]:  hence, had ye believed in Me, your time had not yet come to depart from the world. On the view that they died sinless, this deduction is made: but had ye believed, you would have led the assembly into the land, etc. The punishment therefore was that they would not lead, not that they should die, which would have been disproportionate to their fault (Maharsha).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Genesis 9:6, as part of the [[Noahide covenant]], God tells [[Noah]] "Whoever sheds the blood of man through man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God He made man."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8173/jewish/Chapter-9.htm Chabad Genesis 9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rashi]] says that there must be two witnesses of a murder for a murderer to receive the death penalty, because murder destroys the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.9.6 Sefaria: Rashi on Genesis 9:6] "'through man shall his blood be shed': If there are witnesses you kill him. Why? Because in the image of God [made He man] and he has destroyed the Divine image (Genesis Rabbah 34:14)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital sins===

Certain sins are punishable by death in the [[Torah]], including idolatry,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9977/jewish/Chapter-13.htm Chabad Deuteronomy 13:6] And that prophet, or that dreamer of a dream shall be put to death; because he spoke falsehood about the Lord, your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and Who redeemed you from the house of bondage, to lead you astray from the way in which the Lord, your God, commanded you to go; so shall you clear away the evil from your midst.&lt;/ref&gt; taking God's name in vain,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9925/jewish/Chapter-24.htm Chabad Leviticus 24:16] And one who blasphemously pronounces the Name of the Lord, shall be put to death; the entire community shall stone him; convert and resident alike if he pronounces the [Divine] Name, he shall be put to death.&lt;/ref&gt; violation of the Sabbath,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943/jewish/Chapter-15.htm Chabad Numbers 15:32–36] When the children of Israel were in the desert, they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day. Those who found him gathering wood presented him before Moses and Aaron and before the entire congregation. They put him under guard, since it was not specified what was to be done to him. The Lord said to Moses, The man shall be put to death; the entire congregation shall pelt him with stones outside the camp. So the entire congregation took him outside the camp, and they pelted him to death with stones, as the Lord had commanded Moses.&lt;/ref&gt; rebellion against parents,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9985/jewish/Chapter-21.htm Chabad Deuteronomy 21:18-21] If a man has a wayward and rebellious son, who does not obey his father or his mother, and they chasten him, and [he still] does not listen to them, his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place. And they shall say to the elders of his city, "This son of ours is wayward and rebellious; he does not obey us; [he is] a glutton and a guzzler." And all the men of his city shall pelt him to death with stones, and he shall die. So shall you clear out the evil from among you, and all Israel will listen and fear.&lt;/ref&gt; murder,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15804/jewish/Chapter-20.htm Chabad Joshua 20:2-3] "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Prepare for you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses. To which a slayer that kills any person unawares, unwittingly, shall flee and they shall be for you as a refuge from the avenger of blood."&lt;/ref&gt; and adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9921/jewish/Chapter-20.htm Chabad Leviticus 20:10] And a man who commits adultery with [another] man's wife, committing adultery with the wife of his fellow the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elijah and the prophets of Baal===

In 1 Kings 18:40, [[Elijah]] kills the prophets of Baal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15902/jewish/Chapter-18.htm Chabad, 1 Kings] Then Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of the Baal; let no one of them escape." They seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon and there he slaughtered them.&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud explains that, while Elijah himself deserved death for offering sacrifice on a mountain,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976/jewish/Chapter-12.htm Chabad Deuteronomy 12:13-14] Beware, lest you offer up your burnt offerings any place you see. But only in the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes; there you shall offer up your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[mitzvot]] Elijah had contravened was abrogated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/636-abrogation-of-laws Jewish Encyclopedia: Abrogation of Laws] According to I Kings, xviii. 31, the prophet Elijah offered a sacrifice upon the altar erected on Mount Carmel. This was in contravention of the law in Deut. xii. 13, which forbade the offering of sacrifices outside of the central sanctuary. The rabbis defend the act of the prophet on the ground that it was a temporary measure necessitated by the circumstances (Yeb. 90b).&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==

===Woman caught in adultery===

John 8:3-11 records a woman caught in adultery being brought to [[Jesus]] for judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/john/8 USCCB Bible John 8:3-11] Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle. They said to him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.* So what do you say?" They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger. But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." Again he bent down and wrote on the ground. And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him. Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" She replied, "No one, sir." Then Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go, [and] from now on do not sin any more."&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus does not condemn her, but says "Go and from now on do not sin any more."

Michael Barber says that the Jewish leaders had set a trap for Jesus: Yes to stoning means he'll break Roman law and No to stoning means he'll break Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesacredpage.com/2013/03/go-and-do-not-sin-anymore-readings-for.html The Sacred Page: The readings for the Fifth Sunday of Lent] If Jesus says not to stone her he will be accused of not keeping the law, which requires adulterers to be punished with death (cf. Lev. 20:10; Deut. 22:22). Since Jesus had just accused the Pharisees of not keeping the Law themselves (cf. John 7:19), to not carry out the Law here would discredit him--i.e., he would be exposed as a hypocrite!  Yet if Jesus commands the woman to be stoned, he will be guilty of treason and executed, for only the Romans could carry out an execution (cf. John 18:31).&lt;/ref&gt; He also says Jesus turns the trap on the leaders by saying "Whoever is without sin, cast the first stone": Yes to stoning means they'll break Roman law and No to stoning means they'll break Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesacredpage.com/2013/03/go-and-do-not-sin-anymore-readings-for.html The Sacred Page: The readings for the Fifth Sunday of Lent] With these words Jesus turns the tables and places his opponents in the same precarious position they had intended for him: If they stone her they will be guilty of treason. They can't say Jesus authorized them to do so because he condemns them as sinners! If they don't stone her they admit their guilt (i.e., they not "without sin"). Implicitly, they affirm Jesus' words about them! &lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Jesus===

Jesus is sentenced to death and dies on a cross in all four Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 27:26, 35, 50. Mark 15:15, 24, 37. Luke 23:25, 33, 46. John 19:16, 18, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Encyclopedia explains that crucifixion was an illegal form of Jewish punishment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4782-crucifixion Jewish Encyclopedia: Crucifixion] A Jewish court could not have passed a sentence of death by crucifixion without violating the Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Jesus did not receive a Jewish trial before death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8616-jesus-of-nazareth#anchor13 Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus of Nazareth] Nothing corresponding to a Jewish trial took place, though it was by the action of the priests that Jesus was sent before Pontius Pilate&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ananias and Sapphira===

In Acts 5:1-11, [[Saint Peter]] spoke words of judgment upon [[Ananias and Sapphira]] for lying to God (Ananias) and testing the Spirit  (Sapphira), after which each of them fell dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/acts/acts5.htm USCCB Bible Acts 5] A man named Ananias, however, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;He retained for himself, with his wife's knowledge, some of the purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the feet of the apostles. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the price of the land? &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;While it remained unsold, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you contrive this deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God." &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;The young men came and wrapped him up, then carried him out and buried him. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, unaware of what had happened. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Peter said to her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?" She answered, "Yes, for that amount." &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Then Peter said to her, "Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out." &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 6:16 forbids testing the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970/jewish/Chapter-6.htm#showrashi=true Chabad, Deuteronomy 6] You shall not try the Lord, your God, as you tried Him in [[Massah]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Chrysostom]], in Homily 12 on Acts, says that no one was forced to give anything to the apostles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm New Advent: John Chrysostom's Homily 12] We neither obliged you to sell, the Apostle says, nor to give your money when you had sold; of your own free choice you did it; why have you then stolen from the sacred treasury? ...But wherefore, upon what purpose have you done this? Did you wish to keep it? You ought to have kept it all along, and never to have professed to give it. The sacrilege, beloved, is a grievous one. For another, it may be, coveted what was not his own: but it was at your discretion to keep what was your own. Why then did you first make it sacred, and then take it? Out of excessive contempt have you done this.&lt;/ref&gt; that Ananias and Sapphira had committed sacrilege by keeping the money they had promised to give&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm New Advent: John Chrysostom's Homily 12] He that has chosen to sell his goods and distribute them, and then withdraws them, is guilty of sacrilege...Do you see that this is the charge brought against Ananias, that having made the money sacred, he afterwards secreted it?&lt;/ref&gt;, that Peter did not correct Ananias because he would not have accepted correction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm New Advent: John Chrysostom's Homily 12] You will say, they ought to have corrected him. But he would not have received correction&lt;/ref&gt; that Peter had questioned Sapphira to give her the chance to repent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm New Advent: John Chrysostom's Homily 12] The woman he would fain save, for the man had been the author of the sin: therefore he gives her time to clear herself, and opportunity for repentance&lt;/ref&gt; and that Ananias and Sapphire were justly punished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210112.htm New Advent: John Chrysostom's Homily 12] First he makes her learn the sin, and then shows that she will justly suffer the same punishment with her husband, since she has committed the same wickedness&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romans 13===

In Romans 13:3-4, [[Saint Paul]] says "...But if you do evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword without purpose; it is the servant of God to inflict wrath on the evildoer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/bible/romans/13 USCCB Bible Romans 13]&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor Steven Cornell cites this verse as an instance of civil justice and support for the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersvillebiblechurch.org/_files/live/Does%20Scripture%20Support%20the%20Death%20Penalty.pdf Millersville Bible Church] Biblical evidence supports the continued use of capital punishment in cases of premeditated murder (Genesis 9:6; Romans 13:1-4)...Jesus is not teaching about how government should respond to lawbreakers. If his teaching was meant to be applied to criminal justice, it would rule out all punishment, produce chaos and contradict clear biblical teaching about government being established by God to punish evildoers (Romans 13:4; Peter 2:14).   Jesus is teaching against personal revenge, not civil justice...God forgave us not because he was big-hearted enough to overlook our sin, but because Jesus was willing to bear the capital punishment for our sin. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

Walter Harrelson in ''The Ten Commandments and Human Rights'' says "[t]here can be no question... of our sixth commandment's having the initial meaning that human life is never, under any circumstances, to be taken by another human being or by the appointed authorities in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Harrelson, The Ten Commandments and Human Rights.

Some Christian groups, such as the Southern Baptist Convention, cite [[s:Bible (World English)/Genesis#Chapter 9|Genesis 9:5–6]], [[s:Bible (World English)/Romans#Chapter 13|Romans 13:3–4]], and
[[s:Bible (World English)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:1–27]] as the basis for permitting the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm |last=Christian Research Institute |title=Statement: CP1303: Capital Punishment |location=Charlotte, North Carolina |accessdate=27 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207020406/http://www.equip.org/free/CP1303.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299 |last=Southern Baptist Convention |title=SBC Resolutions: On Capital Punishment |date=June 2000 |accessdate=27 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165331/http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=299 |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some atheists believe the death penalty in the Bible is extremist&lt;ref&gt;[http://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2016/02/16/9-basic-bible-facts-that-atheists-should-know/ Friendly Atheist: 9 Basic Bible Facts] In the Hebrew (Old) Testament, the most serious violation is that of worshiping heathen gods or idols, which is reiterated a total of 332 times. This unforgivable misbehavior requires the death penalty, which is repeated more than eighty times though explicit decree, murderous action, or threatened elimination. Because god's severe punishments are inflicted tirelessly on his incorrigible children, it can be concluded that Hebrew history developed to a great extent around the first of the Ten Commandments: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." In other words, God conducted universal jihad against infidels in a manner no different from that of the Islamic State. Deuteronomy 13 is a concise statement: family members who recommend worshiping other gods must be executed, and all residents of a town where leaders encourage worship of other gods must be killed and everything burned. This will satisfy god's fierce anger, and he will have mercy and compassion for those adherents who undertook the murderous action in his name.&lt;/ref&gt; and proof that [[Maltheism|God is evil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evilbible.com/do-not-ignore-the-old-testament/why-i-am-not-a-christian/ Evil Bible: Why I am not a Christian] Instead of harping on me about something so unapparent, they should go tell it to the Midianites. (Please open your Bibles to Numbers 31)  The following verses are a classic example of wholesale slaughter and rape under the direction of the same God they claim to be so merciful...I have had some Christians proclaim that these Midianite girls were not taken for raping but marriage.  How ridiculous!  If you continue further in the scripture you will find that marriage to a Midianite was a crime against God.  A man named Zimri, broke the law and married a Midianite woman this angered God so he sent a plague among the Hebrews.  Fortunately, a zealous son of Israel speared Zimri right through the genitals, and the plague went away.  So now I ask you, if you could not marry a Midianite, just what were these "virgin woman who were to help multiply" good for?&lt;/ref&gt; Some atheists believe Christians are hypocritical for not killing people that commit capital sins, such as gay people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/doesnt-the-bible-tell-christians-to-put-homosexuals-to-death Desiring God: Doesn't the Bible tell Christians to put Homosexuals to death?] "Dear Pastor John, I want to first thank you for the Ask Pastor John podcast and for your obedience and love for the Lord. One thing I have always struggled to communicate is the difference between the Old Testament Law and the fulfilled Law after Christ. I have many atheist friends who press me here, specifically when it comes to homosexuality. Why do we as Christians not believe practicing homosexuals should be killed for their sin if that is exactly the prescription in our Bibles in Leviticus 20:13? How would you answer this objection?"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
'''Documentary evidence''' is any [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is, or can be, introduced at a trial in the form of [[documents]], as distinguished from oral [[testimony]]. Documentary evidence is most widely understood to refer to writings on paper (such as an [[invoice]], a [[contract]] or a [[will (law)|will]]), but the term can also apply to any media by which information can be preserved, such as photographs; a medium that needs a mechanical device to be viewed, such as a tape recording or film; and a printed form of [[digital evidence]], such as emails, spreadsheets, etc.

Normally, before documentary evidence is admissible as evidence, it must be proved by other evidence from a witness that the document is genuine, called "laying a foundation".

==Documentary v. physical evidence==
A piece of evidence is ''not'' documentary evidence if it is presented for some purpose other than the examination of the contents of the document. For example, if a blood-spattered letter is introduced solely to show that the defendant stabbed the author of the letter from behind as it was being written, then the evidence is [[physical evidence]], not documentary evidence. However, a film of the murder taking place ''would'' be documentary evidence (just as a written description of the event from an eyewitness). If the content of that same letter is then introduced to show the motive for the murder, then the evidence would be both physical and documentary .

==Authentication==
Documentary evidence is subject to specific forms of [[authentication]], usually through the [[testimony]] of an [[Witness|eyewitness]] to the execution of the document, or to the testimony of a witness able to identify the [[e handwriting]] of the purported author. Documentary evidence is also subject to the [[best evidence rule]], which requires that the original document be produced unless there is a good reason not to do so.

{{See also | Regulatory compliance}}

'''Environmental Compliance''' means conforming to [[environmental law]]s, regulations, standards and other requirements such as site permits to operate. In recent years, [[environmental concerns]] have led to a significant increase in the number and scope of compliance imperatives across all global regulatory environments.  Being closely related, environmental concerns and compliance activities are increasingly being aligned with corporate performance goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/environmental-compliance-corporate-performance-can-you-have-it-all/|title=Environmental Regulatory Compliance &amp; Corporate Performance - Can You Have It All?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.emisoft.com|publisher=Emisoft|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being integrated to some extent to avoid conflicts, wasteful overlaps, and gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aUyqPxYw10C |title=Governance, Risk, and Compliance Handbook |author=Anthony Tarantino|isbn=9780470245552 |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Vi35vE6c1IC&amp;pg=PA9 |title=SAP GRC For Dummies |author=Denise Vu Broady, Holly A. Roland |chapter=The ABCs of GRC|isbn=9781118052594 |date=2011-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliance with the above requirements and obligations, requires meeting certain conditions.  Typically, these include:
* Managing monitoring programmes or schedules, ensuring that the monitoring required in the permit has been done, at the correct locations, for the correct parameters, and at the correct frequency
* Pre-processing, performing calculations and validating the data for compliance with any alert or reporting levels
* Generating routine compliance reports for authorities.

The management of the above can be complex and time-consuming, leading to an increasing uptake of software systems designed to manage environmental compliance.  These are often referred to as 'Environmental Data Management Systems' (EDMS). Criteria must be considered when selecting environmental compliance software: proven capability, high performance, transparent, traceable data handling, a robust calculation engine, advanced factor handling, simple integration, automated workflows and QA, and flexible reporting and data extraction.

'''{{lang|la|Eo ipso}}''' means "by (or from) the thing itself" in [[Latin]] and is similar to the sense expressed by the English idioms, "by the same token", "of itself", or "on its own account". It is often used in various schools of [[philosophy]] to demonstrate the possibility/impossibility of propositions from their nature. For example: "That I am does not {{lang|la|eo ipso}} mean that I think." The term is also used in [[law]], and it is through law that it was brought into English from Latin.

In ''[[The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress]]'', [[Søren Kierkegaard]] describes the quality of {{lang|la|eo ipso}}:

{{Quote|But to be gallant towards an artist is precisely the highest degree of insolence, a maudlin impertinence and a disgusting kind of intrusiveness.  Anyone who is something, and is something essentially, possesses "{{lang|la|eo ipso|italic=no}}," the claim to be recognized for ''exactly this special thing'', and for nothing more or less.&lt;ref&gt;[[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard, Søren]]. ''[[The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress]]'', Harper &amp; Row, 1967, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also see the following [[aphorism]] from [[Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (p. 73), as translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966): "Whoever reaches his ideal transcends it {{lang|la|eo ipso}}."

'''Falsity''' (from Latin ''falsitas'') or '''falsehood''' is a perversion of [[truth]] originating in the deceitfulness of one party, and culminating in the damage of another party. Falsity is also a measure of the quality or extent of the falseness of something, while a falsehood may also mean simply an incorrect (false) statement, independent of any intention to deceive.

In the [[Frege–Church ontology]], "truth" is the denotation of a true proposition, while "falsity" is the denotation of false propositions.

In Classical [[æsthetics]], falsity is ugly, and truth is beautiful.

In [[existentialism]], falsity is usually a thing to be avoided, and is not desired.&lt;ref&gt;''Why I AM Not A Christian'', Bertrand Russell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

{{Contract law}}

A '''firm offer''' is an [[Offer and acceptance|offer]] that will remain open for a certain period or until a certain time or occurrence of a certain event, during which it is incapable of being revoked. As a general rule, all offers are revocable at any time prior to acceptance, even those offers that purport to be irrevocable on their face.

In the [[United States]], an exception is the merchant firm offer rule set out in [[Uniform Commercial Code]] - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer to buy or sell goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-205 |title=Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205. Firm Offers|website=Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an offer is irrevocable even in the absence of [[consideration]]. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

However, even when the period of irrevocability expires, the offer may still remain open until revoked or rejected according to the general rules regarding termination of an offer.

If the offeree rejects, fails to accept the terms of the offer, fixed or otherwise, or makes a counter-offer, then the original offer is terminated.

The '''Glee Club''' is a traditional event in the UK's [[Liberal Democrat Federal Conference (UK)|Liberal Democrat Federal Conference]] and the [[Liberal Assembly]], consisting of attendees singing around a piano. It is one of the most popular fringe events in [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British politics]] and was a formative event in the lives of many British political leaders, allegedly the former leader of the Labour Party, [[Michael Foot]], amongst them. Foot described its opening song, *[[The Land (song)|''The Land'']], as the best political song he had come across, imbued with the democratic spirit, and designed to put fear in the hearts of the landlords. 

Although the Glee Club has informally existed for many years, in 1967 the first songbook (entitled ''After the Count was Over'') was published by the [[National League of Young Liberals]]. Songbooks have been produced since the 1975 by ''[[Liberator (magazine)|Liberator]]'', and in 2009 the 20th edition of the Liberator Songbook was published &amp;ndash; the 27th songbook in its publishing history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Liberator Song Book'', 2009, [[Liberator (magazine)|Liberator]], p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often combined with the ''Liberal Revue'', a series of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] consisting mostly of [[in-joke]]s and irreverent takes on political matters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2960">The '''Global Sustainability Assessment System''' (GSAS) [Originally QSAS&lt;ref&gt;[[QSAS]]&lt;/ref&gt;] is a green building certification system developed for [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] countries. This system was announced after QSAS [Qatar sustainability assessment system] got acceptance from many of the GCC countries. Hence, the local system of QSAS was expanded to a regional scale and renamed into GSAS.

GSAS was established in 2009 by the Gulf Organization for Research and Development (GORD) [a non-profit organization] with the collaboration of University of Pennsylvania. The system took into consideration well-known international green building codes, applied expert composition and modified them to suit Gulf Cooperation Council countries' climate and traditions. 
The system was recently adopted by State of Kuwait&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/18/idUS91311+18-Jun-2012+BW20120618|title=GORD Launches Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) as New Benchmark for Sustainable Development|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saudi Green building Council [SGBC].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebig5saudi.com/Content/Saudi-Green-Building-Council|title=The Big 5 Saudi 2015 - Saudi Green Building Council|work=thebig5saudi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building Schemes ==
GSAS includes several building schemes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gord.qa/uploads/formsnew/GSAS_Overview_07_for_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''-Classical Schemes'''

• Districts (NH)

• Commercial

• Residential

• Education

• Core &amp; Shell

• Hospitality

• Healthcare

'''-Unique Schemes'''

• Sports Facilities

• Mosques

• Light Industries

'''-Operations'''

== Features ==
'''Ground-up Approach''': Seamless integration between sustainability practices and regional requirements.

'''Best Mix''': Combines the best features from the world’s most established sustainability rating systems.

'''Performance-based''': A quantifiable and result-oriented rather than feature oriented approach.

'''Flexible''': Individual components are adaptable to any project of any scale without compromising the system integrity.

'''Control''': Affords complete control over the development, customization, deployment and future modifications or expansion of the rating system based on any set of specific requirements.

== Categories and Weights ==
GSAS is divided into 8 sustainability fields - categories -. Those categories are weighted based on their impact toward sustainability.

-Energy (E)    24%

-Water (W)    16%

-Indoor Environment (IE)    16%

-Cultural &amp; Economics (CE)    13%

'''''Goff and Jones on the Law of Unjust Enrichment''''' (formerly '''''Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution''''', usually simply abbreviated to '''''Goff &amp; Jones''''') is the leading authoritative [[English law]] [[textbook]] on [[restitution]] and [[unjust enrichment]] ({{ISBN|978-1847-039101}}).  It is presently in its ninth edition.  It is published by [[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]&lt;ref name=Sweet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/Catalogue/ProductDetails.aspx?productid=333340&amp;recordid=4543|title=Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forms part of the Common Law Library.

As a textbook it is somewhat remarkable in that although the first edition was published in 1966, it was not until 1991 (25 years later) that the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] formally recognised unjust enrichment as a separate branch of jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd]]|court=UKHL |year=1988 |num=12 |date={{date|1991-06-06}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is notable that a number of the key decisions in the field have been handed down by [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Goff]], and often reflect the analysis which has previously expressed academically in ''Goff &amp; Jones''.  For example, Goff's judgment in ''[[Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd]]'' [1980] 1 QB 677 was described as "the ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' of restitution for mistake",&lt;ref name=Virgo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Virgo |first1=Graham |author-link1=Graham Virgo |year=1999 |title=The Principles of the Law of Restitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpQC6F46urIC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=importance+of+barclays+bank+v+simms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ImAJYzeyW5&amp;sig=Bfd03jnXKhpWT-4sDY7fzFwG_aA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjaxqGs0arMAhXTsh4KHWvXCREQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=importance%20of%20barclays%20bank%20v%20simms&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|isbn=0-19-876377-8|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; but largely reflected the same rationalisation of the law in this area which he had supported in ''Goff &amp; Jones''.

It has been said "[i]t is no exaggeration to say that the law of unjust enrichment would not exist, certainly not as we know it, if it was not for ''Goff &amp; Jones''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carswell.com/DynamicData/ProductDocs/testimonial/praise-l10146-e8.pdf|title=Review - Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment, 8th ed.|publisher=Canadian Business Law Journal|author=Professor Mitchell McInnes|page=323|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Lord Rodger]] said that "Goff and Jones are the [[Romulus and Remus]] of the English Law of Restitution ... Out of a few weak and scattered settlements they founded a powerful city whose hegemony now extends far and wide."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/08/18/lord-goff-of-chieveley-senior-law-lord--obituary/|title=Lord Goff of Chieveley, Senior Law Lord – obituary|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hendrix Marion Fowler Sr.''', known as '''Mutt Fowler''' (February 13, 1918 &amp;ndash; September 16, 2014), was a [[politician]] and [[business]]man who served from 1953 to 1972 as [[mayor]] of the small town of [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]] in [[Red River Parish, Louisiana|Red River Parish]] in northwestern [[Louisiana]], as a member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from 1972 to 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf |title=Membership in the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2016 |publisher=house.louisiana.gov |accessdate=May 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105414/http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as the executive director of the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] Authority.

Fowler's public career ended in [[indictment]] and a [[Plea bargaining|plea bargain]] for the circumvention of state [[Bidding|bid laws]] and dissatisfaction over his having allocated scarce public monies on low-priority projects. He eventually served forty-five days in the [[Sabine Parish, Louisiana|Sabine Parish]] [[jail]]. Fowler was the third member of a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] political [[dynasty]] that also included two Louisiana state elections commissioners, the second of whom was indicted, convicted, and imprisoned for [[bribery]] and [[income tax evasion]].&lt;ref name=newspapers&gt;''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]'', March 8, 1986; March 10, 31, 1989; May 22, 1990; October 15, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fowler political dynasty==

Fowler was born to Angus Jesse Fowler and the former Zula Fair in the Holly Springs community near Coushatta,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; a [[County seat|parish seat]] of 1,964 residents (2010 [[census]]) located forty miles south of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. He had two brothers and two sisters. His older brother, [[Douglas Fowler]], was elected three times as the Red River Parish clerk of court (1940–1952) and later served two years as Coushatta's mayor from 1952 to 1954. Douglas Fowler was elected as "custodian of voting machines" in the 1959-1960 Louisiana state election cycle and served until December 31, 1979, when ill health forced him to retire. His title had been changed under a new state constitution to "elections commissioner" effective with his last term, which began in 1976.

Douglas Fowler was succeeded as elections commissioner by his younger son, H. M.'s nephew, [[Jerry Fowler|Jerry Marston Fowler]], who, like his father, was elected five times. Jerry Fowler lost the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] with a third-place finish, amid allegations of impropriety which surfaced in the campaign. [[Suzanne Haik Terrell]] then defeated fellow Republican [[Woody Jenkins]] in November 1999, to claim the position. Jerry Fowler was thereafter indicted, convicted, and imprisoned for bribery and income tax evasion in connection with his official duties. Nevertheless, both Fowlers served in the elections position for a combination of just over four decades.

The youngest of the three Fowler brothers, "Mutt" graduated in 1937 from the former Martin High School in the [[Martin, Louisiana|Martin]] community in Red River Parish and attended [[Northwestern State University]] in nearby [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], Louisiana. He left college in March 1941 to enter the [[United States Army]]. With service during [[World War II]], he attained the rank of [[sergeant]] and was assigned to a special group of soldiers to establish convalescent hospitals for injured military personnel on Army bases in five states. Fowler received orders to head to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]], but they were soon cancelled because of the historic ''[[Enola Gay]]'' [[atomic bomb]] flight over [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Fowler worked for his brother, John R. Fowler (1912-1990), in the latter's drug store in Coushatta but subsequently in 1956 became an [[insurance agent]]. He turned over the insurance firm in 1982 to his son, H. M. "Buddy" Fowler Jr. (born December 6, 1943). He delivered papers for ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]'' and was the Red River Parish agent for the Shreveport Production Credit Association.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Fowler in 1953 became mayor of Coushatta to succeed his brother, Douglas, and served for nineteen years. In the 1971-1972 election cycle, he was elected to the legislature, in which he remained for fourteen years. In his last election in 1983, he defeated two intraparty rivals, "Dickie" Alexander and Ray Dyess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10221983/10221983_41.html|title=Candidates for election on October 22, 1983|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler resigned from the House on April 1, 1986, to become executive director of the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] Authority, a port commission on the Louisiana-[[Texas]] border governed by an 11-member board based in [[Many, Louisiana|Many]] in Sabine Parish in western Louisiana.

==Fowler's troubles with Sabine Authority==

Within two years, the Authority dismissed Fowler from his position amid allegations of hiring friends and relatives, including his son. Fowler was accused of spending the limited funds of the Authority on questionable undertakings, rather than access roads and boat lanes. He was also accused of circumventing state bid laws. The Authority announced on March 10, 1989, that Fowler's two-year contract would not be renewed and that he would be replaced by William Kratz, a then 66-year-old university [[mathematics]] instructor. Fowler's salary continued through March 31, 1989, when his three-year contract lapsed. Robert Gentry, then chairman of the Sabine River Authority's committee which screened the applications for general manager, said that Fowler had lost the confidence of the board. Katherine Fowler became so irate over the developments that she declared the allegations against her husband "all lies."&lt;ref name=newspapers/&gt;

Months passed, and an intensive investigation began. In late 1990, the State of Louisiana announced that it would seek indictments against Fowler, his son, and Ottis Lewing (born 1935), a Many contractor. Lewing later admitted to bid rigging. "Mutt" Fowler was accused of two counts of forgery and one count of splitting profits, fees, and commissions. "Buddy" Fowler was similarly charged with a single violation of splitting profits, fees, and commissions.&lt;ref name=newspapers/&gt;

In March 1991, Fowler pleaded not guilty to the charges. In mid-October 1992, however, he made a plea bargain with the state in exchange for the dropping of the single charge against his son. He faced a maximum $1,000 fine, six months imprisonment, and $5,000 in reimbursement to the Sabine River Authority. Ultimately, Fowler served ninety days, with two years probation, $2,500 in [[restitution]], and one thousand hours of community service. The ninety days was cut in half because of labor performed while incarcerated.&lt;ref name=newspapers/&gt;

[[Image:H. M. Fowler grave marker, Coushatta, LA IMG_6637.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Fowler grave marker at Springville Cemetery in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Louisiana]]]]

==Personal life and death==
Fowler was a member of the Coushatta First [[United Methodist Church]]. He was married for sixty-six years to the former Katherine Posey (March 25, 1917 – September 30, 2007). Their daughter was Katherine Ann "Kathy" Fowler (March 29, 1946 – April 24, 2006).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Fowler died in September 2014 at the age of ninety-six. Except for his grandson, H. M. Fowler III (who is buried at Wesley Chapel Cemetery in Red River Parish), the family is interred at Springville Cemetery just off [[U.S. Highway 71]] in Coushatta.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/shreveporttimes/obituary.aspx?n=hm-fowler-mutt&amp;pid=172500923&amp;fhid=10234|title=H.

The '''Hennepin County Law Library''' is a [[law library]] located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], founded in 1883.

== Organization and governance ==

The Hennepin County Law Library is organized under Chapter 134A&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/134A/ Minnesota statutes, Chapter 134A]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Minnesota Statutes. The governing agency is a seven-member Board of Trustees consisting of three judges of the Fourth Judicial District, three practicing [[Lawyer|attorneys]], and a member of the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hennepin.us/your-government#leadership Hennepin County Board of Commissioners]&lt;/ref&gt; The library, which is open to the public, is funded by a combination of court fees, user fees, and an appropriation from the Hennepin County general revenue fund.

== History ==

The Hennepin County Law Library had its origin when the Minneapolis Bar Association incorporated on February 20, 1883. The Bar Association was a stock corporation that allowed members to pay for stock by contributing books, the value of which was determined by an appraisal committee. The law library's first location was a room on the second floor of a building on Nicollet Avenue adjoining the First National Bank at Washington Avenue. In August 1883 the collection was moved to the Academy of Music Building, at the corner of Washington and Hennepin Avenues. This magnificent building, a showplace for the arts and the center of the city's entertainment district, was gutted by fire on Christmas Day, 1884. The law library was completely destroyed. With the insurance proceeds of $15,000, the Bar Association began rebuilding the law library, which opened in the Boston Block on May 1, 1885. This was another famous building that boasted the first indoor court in Minneapolis. But in April 1886, it was also struck by fire, destroying the law library for a second time. With the insurance of $20,000, a third law library was established in the Temple Court building, which occupied the site of the former Academy of Music Building. By 1895 the law library contained about 7,000 volumes. In 1903 it was provided accommodations in Room 434 of the new Court House and City Hall building. In 1960 the law library moved to Room 318, where it remained until its move in September 1976 to its present location in the Hennepin County Government Center. 

The law library is named for Anne W. Grande, who served as law librarian for 33 years, from 1975-2008.

The law library was renovated in the summer of 2016.

== Staff ==
According to a 1941 Hennepin Lawyer article by Thomas Kneeland, one of the incorporators of the Minneapolis Bar Association, the Bar Association employed three librarians during the time it owned the law library. Kneeland listed the first as Edward S. Waters, though a newspaper article on December 26, 1884 in the Minneapolis Evening Journal stated that F. S. Gaylord was the librarian at the time of the Christmas Day fire. The History of the Bench and Bar of Minnesota, by Hiram F. Stevens (Minneapolis: Legal Publishing and Engraving Co., 1904) lists E.S. Waters as Treasurer of the Minneapolis Bar Association in 1904. Kneeland listed the second librarian as Frederic Klapp, who was succeeded in 1921 by his son, S. D. Kapp, who served until his death in 1937. Hennepin County law librarians include Lillian W. Taylor (1937-1944), Buelah C. Blaisdell (1944-1948), Ethel Kommes (1948-1975), Anne Grande (1975-2008), Ed Carroll (2008–2015), Karen Westwood (2015-current).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hclawlib.org/about Hennepin County Law Library About Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Dolly face closeup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dolly "the world's most famous sheep"]]

Dolly was cloned in 1996 by [[Ian Wilmut]], [[Keith Campbell (biologist)|Keith Campbell]] and colleagues at the [[Roslin Institute]], part of the [[University of Edinburgh]] Scotland. [[BBC News]] and [[Scientific American]] called Dolly "the world's most famous sheep,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/353617.stm ''Is Dolly old before her time?''], {{smallcaps|BBC News}} (May 27, 1999); Sally Lehrman, [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=no-more-cloning-around ''No More Cloning Around''], {{smallcaps|Scientific American}} (Sept. 21, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The cloning method Campbell and Wilmut used to create Dolly constituted a breakthrough in scientific discovery. Known as [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]], this process involves removing the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a regular body cell and implanting that nucleus into an egg cell that has had its cell nucleus removed. A nucleus is the [[organelle]] that holds a cell's genetic material (its DNA). Campbell and Wilmut found that if the donor, somatic cell is arrested in the stage of the cell cycle where it is dormant and non-replicating (the quiescent phase) prior to nuclear transfer, the resulting fused cell will develop into an [[embryo]]. The resulting cloned animal is an exact genetic replica of the adult mammal from which the somatic cell nucleus was taken.&lt;ref&gt;750 F.3d at 1334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent application claims the cloned animal. Claim 155 is representative:
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 155. A live-born clone of a pre-existing, non-embryonic, donor mammal, wherein the mammal is selected from cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats.

The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the claims as patent ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101 "because it constituted a natural phenomenon that did not possess 'markedly different characteristics than any found in nature.' " A patent on the method was allowed, but it is not involved in this case.&lt;ref&gt;750 F.3d at 1334-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling by Federal Circuit==

The Federal Circuit unanimously affirmed the PTO rejection of the claims in opinion by Judge [[Timothy Dyk]] joined by Judges [[Kimberly Ann Moore]] and [[Eli Wallach]].

It is "clear that naturally occurring organisms are not patentable."&lt;ref&gt;750 F.3d at 1336 (citing {{ussc|name=Diamond v. Chakrabarty|volume=447|page=303|pin=|year=1980}}, and {{ussc|name=Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.|link=|volume=333|page=127|pin=|year=1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The patent in ''Chakrabarty'' claimed a genetically engineered bacterium that was capable of breaking down various components of crude oil. The patent applicant created this non-naturally occurring bacterium by adding four plasmids to a specific strain of bacteria. The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable because it was "new" with "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature and one having the potential for significant utility." Accordingly, discoveries that possess "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature" are eligible for patent protection, but any existing organism or newly discovered plant found in the wild is not patentable. Similarly in ''[[Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref name=Myriad&gt;569 U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 2107 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held that claims on two naturally occurring, isolated genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2), which can be examined to determine whether a person is likely to develop breast cancer, were patent ineligible invalid under § 101, because the BRCA genes themselves were unpatentable products of nature.&lt;ref&gt;750 F.3d at 1336-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not disputed that the donor sheep from which Dolly was cloned could not be patented, but Dolly is an exact copy of that unpatentable sheep. "Dolly's genetic identity to her donor parent renders her unpatentable." An exact copy of a preexisting animal in not patent eligible. The court added that related Supreme Court rulings "reinforce this conclusion":

&lt;blockquote&gt;For example, Supreme Court decisions regarding the preemptive force of federal patent law confirm that individuals are free to copy any unpatentable article, such as a live farm animal, so long as they do not infringe a patented method of copying. ''[[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.]]'' clarified that a state may not "prohibit the copying of [an] article itself or award damages for such copying" when that article is ineligible for patent protection.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{ussc|name=Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.|link=|volume=376|page=225|pin=232-33|year=1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sears'', the question was whether the defendant, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., could be held liable under state law for copying a lamp design whose patent protection had expired. The Court explained that "when the patent expires the monopoly created by it expires, too, and the right to make the article—including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried when patented—passes to the public." The Court further clarified that "[a]n unpatentable article, like an article on which the patent has expired, is in the public domain and may be made and sold by whoever chooses to do so." Roslin's claimed clones are exact genetic copies of patent ineligible subject matter. Accordingly, they are not eligible for patent protection.&lt;ref&gt;750 F.3d at 1337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roslin argued that "environmental factors" lead to differences in shape, size, color, and behavior, that result from aging and the interaction of the animal with its environment. But Roslin acknowledged that any differences came about or were produced "quite independently of any effort of the patentee." As in the ''Funk'' case: "Their qualities are the work of nature. Those qualities are of course not patentable. For patents cannot issue for the discovery of the phenomena of nature." Roslin also argued that its clones are distinguishable from their original donor mammals because of differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]], which originates from the donor egg rather than the donor nucleus. But the claims do not describe clones that have markedly different characteristics from the donor animals of which they are copies. Finally, Roslin argued that its clones are patent eligible because "they are time-delayed versions of their donor mammals, and therefore different from their original mammals," but that is always true of any copy of an original.&lt;ref&gt;750 F.3d at 1338.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

● Professor Dan Burk finds that "the ''Roslin'' opinion is hardly a model of coherent judicial reasoning, either on its own terms or with regard to the Supreme Court's subject matter jurisprudence to that point." He insists that Dolly the cloned sheep was not something found in nature, because "genetically identical mammals are not what one finds in the wild." Rather, "mammals such as sheep propagate via sexual recombination which typically renders them ''not'' genetically identical." Furthermore, Dolly was born as an old sheep:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By virtue of inheriting a mature set of somatic cell chromosomes, rather than the freshly recombined set of germ-line chromosomes that would accompany natural conception, Dolly began life with shortened [[telomere]]s. Thus, Dolly was in a genetic sense 'born old' and lived a shortened life as a result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burk argues that the proper test of patent eligibility for such a product as Dolly the sheep is whether the claim preempts field of the described subject matter, so that "fundamental concepts and materials, on which all inventors must draw, [are] caught up in patent claims." He says that the Roslin patent would not "capture fundamental or basic science on which future invention will depend, or if it does so, there is no indication in the ''Roslin'' opinion that this informed the analysis of patentable subject matter." According to Burk, the patent would not be preemptive because its covers only sheep or other mammals "produced by the cloning process, a limitation that constrains the patent to the specific and novel implementation disclosed by the applicant."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Burk, [https://jlb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/16/jlb.lsv042.full ''Dolly and Alice''], {{smallcaps|J. Law Biosci.}} (Oct. 16, 2015). A later version is available at [https://jlb.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/3/606.full] (Feb. 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

● Gene Quinn in ''IP Watchdog'' deplores the ''Roslin'' decision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another nail in the coffin of innovation and a functioning patent system all because decision makers don't have enough guts to state the obvious. Being able to create something that is identical to what nature creates is an extraordinary achievement that should be celebrated, should be fostered and incentivized, and should be awarded with a patent.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Quinn, [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/05/08/dolly-the-cloned-sheep-not-patentable-in-the-u-s/id=49471/ ''Dolly the Cloned Sheep Not Patentable in the U.S.''], {{smallcaps|IP Watchdog}} (May 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

● Student author Miriam Swedlow argues that ''Roslin'' would not prevent the patenting of extinct animals, such as the dodo, passenger pigeon, or wooly mammoth, because the cloned animal would not be identical to a natural animal. Like the cDNA in ''[[Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref name=Myriad/&gt; large portions of the genome of an extinct animal would need to be guessed at and extrapolated from non-extinct animals, because the DNA recoverable from fossils is decayed. Therefore, the "re-created animal will not be an exact genetic copy of an animal that already exists and will have different structural characteristics than the original species." They would therefore be comparable to artificial animals such as the [[Oncomouse]], which was patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4736866}}, issued Apr 12, 1988, to Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the "fragile nature of extinct animal DNA allows for multiple avenues of differentiation" from the original, now-extinct animal, preempting none.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam R. Swedlow, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/washjolta11&amp;div=15&amp;start_page=183&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=1&amp;men_tab=srchresults# ''The Woolly-Mammoth in the Room: The Patentability of Animals Brought Back from Extinction through Cloning and Genetic Engineering''], 11 {{smallcaps|Wash. J. L. Tech. &amp; Arts}} 183 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4759">'''Intelegis''' is a program of the Brazilian State, funded by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IADB) and administered by the [[Federal Senate of Brazil]]. Its mission is to integrate and modernize the Brazilian Legislative Power, in Municipal, State and Federal levels. It started in 1997 in the Brazilian Senate Data Processing organ - Prodasen, born from the PhD project of [[Armando Roberto Cerchi Nascimento]], an official of that body. In 1999 the Brazilian Government signed the contract, establishing a partnership between the IADB and the Brazilian Senate, initiating the Interlegis Program, which was divided into 3 phases: [[e-Parliament]] (technology within the parliament), [[e-Government]] (process automation and availability of network services for the citizen) and [[e-Democracy]] (citizen participation in the legislative process).

In practice, Interlegis Program seeks to improve communication and information flow among [[legislators]], increase the efficiency and competence of the Legislative Houses and promote citizen participation in the legislative processes, preparing the Brazilian parliaments for Participatory Democracy or [[e-Democracy]]. It operates based on four pillars: Communication, Information, Training and Technology.

In the technology area, Interlegis Program develops systems for the parliaments, released them as free and open source software under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license and it are developed with the participation of user communities and concerned citizens, supported by Colab environment. The main systems are:

* '''SAPL''' - Legislative Process Support System - aimed at automation of electronic legislative process;
* '''Model Portal''' - a CMS portal is ready to use and customized for a Legislative Houses with transparency tools, law on access to information, public participation, [[open data]], e-democracy, among others.
* '''SAAP''' - Parliamentary Activity Support System - aimed at automation of offices of parliamentarians;
* '''SPDO''' - Protocol Document System - aimed at automating the electronic protocol of the Legislative Houses, reducing paper usage;
* '''SAAL''' - Legislative Administration Support System - aimed at administrative automation of a parliament, as a legislative ERP. Is under development and not yet have a useful version.

The Interlegis was responsible for one of the biggest digital inclusion programs at the beginning of the 21st century, distributing equipment and connecting to the Internet 3398 Brazilian municipalities through the Municipal Councils and Legislative Assemblies, thus creating Interlegis National Network - RNI. Today the technology infrastructure sector of Interlegis also active in hosting products and services developed and provided free of charge by Interlegis to the Brazilian Legislative Houses.

In 2010 Interlegis created the Colab, which is a collaborative environment for the legislative communities of practice, which has [[Internet]] tools to encourage participation of concerned citizens, officials and parliamentarians of the Legislative Houses, with the goal of solving the practical [[parliaments]] problems, allowing better communication between the participating people and collaborate in various areas of knowledge such as legislative counsel, development of technologies, legislative communication and administration, among others.

In 2013, after the administrative reform of the Brazilian Senate, Interlegis Program, which was previously run by a special secretariat called SINTER, became administrated by the Brazilian Legislative Institute - ILB, supervised by the Brazilian Senate body responsible for the training of legislative servants. At that time, the contract with the IADB regarding the 2nd phase (e-Government) has been extended until the end of 2014, when will occur the renegotiation and redefinition of the continuity of the program to start the 3rd phase (e-Democracy).

'''irrepressible.info''' was an anti-[[Internet censorship]] campaign and website by [[Amnesty International]] and ''[[The Observer]]''. It was developed in 2006 by Soda Creative and hosted by Darq Ltd. The site was based in the [[United Kingdom]], but is open to participation from people around the world.

http://irrepressible.info irrepressible.info allowed users to republish excerpts of allegedly censored sites on their websites. These excerpts linked back to irrepressible.info, where visitors could learn more about the censored site in question.

Visitors were also invited to sign a pledge opposing online [[Political repression|repression]]. Amnesty presented this petition with over 50,000 signatures at the November 2006 [[United Nations]] [[Internet Governance Forum]] in [[Athens]].

irrepressible.info was based on an idea by Alexander Kohlhofer and was created to mark the 45th anniversary of Amnesty International.

      <comment>/* Criminal law */ the change of 2010 to 2009 was because that was the date the new law was passed. In addition, the sentence "increased from 15 to 20 years, or exceptionally more" doesn't make sense because it is irrelevant and misleading. A felony in the Czech Republic carries a sentence of at least 5 years. The numbers given in the sentence are unnecessary and have no significance.</comment>

'''Czech law''', often referred to as the '''legal order of the Czech Republic''' (''{{lang|cs|právní řád České republiky}}''), is the [[Law|system of legal rules]] in force in the [[Czech Republic]], and in the international community it is a member of. Czech [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] belongs to the Germanic branch of continental legal culture ([[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]).&lt;ref name="bobek"&gt;Bobek, Michal. [http://www.nyulawglobal.org/Globalex/Czech_Republic1.htm "UPDATE: An Introduction to the Czech Legal System and Legal Resources Online. "] ''GlobaLex''. Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law, Sept. 2009. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]] are divided into branches, among them civil, criminal, administrative, procedural and labour law, and systematically codified.

Written law is the basis of the legal order, and the most important [[Sources of law|source of law]] are: [[Regulation|legal regulations]] ([[Act of Parliament|acts of parliament]], as well as [[delegated legislation]]), [[Treaty|international treaties]] (once they have been [[Ratification|ratified]] by the parliament and [[Promulgation|promulgated]]), and such findings of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]], in which a statute or its part has been nullified as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It is [[government gazette|made public]] by the periodically published ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated ''Sb.'' (“Collection of Law”, “Coll.”), and ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'' (“Collection of International Treaties”).

The system of law and justice in the Czech Republic has been in constant development since the [[Velvet Revolution|1989 regime change]]. In 1993, the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been enacted, which postulates the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]], outlines the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|structure and principles of democratic government]], and declares human rights and rights of the citizen. Since 2004, the membership in the EU means the priority of  [[European Union law]] over Czech law in some areas. Recently, a brand new Criminal Code entered into force in 2010, and the Civil Code followed in 2014.

== Sources of law ==

Sources of Czech law are (in this hierarchical order):&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

* the Constitution (''{{lang|cs|Ústava}}'') and constitutional acts (''{{lang|cs|ústavní zákony}}'')
* international treaties ratified by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|mezinárodní smlouvy ratifikované parlamentem}}'')
* statutes adopted by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|zákony přijaté parlamentem}}''), published decisions of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]
* derived legislation: government orders&lt;ref&gt;also translated as government decrees&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|nařízení vlády}}'') and notifications of ministries&lt;ref&gt;sometimes orders of ministries&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|vyhlášky ministerstev}}''); legislative acts of territorial self-government bodies: regional ordinances&lt;ref&gt;or [[by-law|byelaws]], if you prefer&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|krajské vyhlášky}}'') and municipal ordinances (''{{lang|cs|obecní vyhlášky}}'')

Acts of parliament and other legal regulations enter into force on the day they are [[Promulgation|promulgated]] (published) in the official ''Collection of Law'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated as ''{{lang|cs|Sb.}}'' – ''Coll.'' – when referring to statutes), although they may take effect at a later date.

=== Constitutional law ===

Czech [[constitution]] is written, and it consists of several [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|constitutional acts]] (one of them [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|the Constitution of the Czech Republic]]), together they are known as the [[constitutional order of the Czech Republic]] (''{{lang|cs|ústavní pořádek}}'').

The constitution can be viewed as [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]], because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A special majority (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concourt1"&gt;Czech Republic. Constitutional Court. [http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2092 "Constitutional Order of the Czech Republic. "] ''The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. '' Ústavní soud ČR, n.d. Web. 03 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.

Most important constitutional acts are:

* Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. the Constitution of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40450&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=1~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb. Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resolution No. 2/1993 Coll. [...] incorporating Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms [...]&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40453&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=2~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Usnesení č. 2/1993 Sb.

* Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Coll. on the Security of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=46612&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=110~2F1998&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 110/1998 Sb. o bezpečnosti České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 347/1997 Coll. on the Creation of Higher Territorial Self-Governing Units&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=347~2F1997&amp;rpp=15#local-content Zákon č. 347/1997 Sb. o vytvoření vyšších územních samosprávných celků a o změně ústavního zákona České národní rady č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] declares sovereignty (self-government) of the people and the values of freedom and democracy. It defines the separation of the three powers in a system of [[Separation of powers|Checks and balances]]. It gives the legislative power to the popularly elected [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] consisting of two chambers, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]]. The executive power is divided between the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] and the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]. It describes the functioning of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|judiciary]], especially the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]. Two more institutions are established, the [[Czech National Bank]] and the [[Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic|Supreme Audit Office]].

The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] (''{{lang|cs|Listina základních práv a svobod}}'') is a [[bill of rights]] document enacted in 1991 by the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovak Federative Republic]]. In the Czech Republic it was kept in its entirety and forms a part of the constitutional order (i.e. has the same legal force as the Constitution). It postulates the sanctity of natural human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as citizens' (political) rights, the equality before the law, rights of minorities and so on.

The Constitution has been seriously modified in February 2012, introducing a controversial popular vote of the [[President of the Czech Republic]]:&lt;ref name="concourt1" /&gt;

* Constitutional Act No. 71/2012 Coll.&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=77110&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=71~2F2012&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 71/2012 Sb., kterým se mění ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky, ve znění pozdějších ústavních zákonů]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;which amends the Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll., the Constitution of the Czech Republic as amended by subsequent constitutional acts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International treaties ===

On joining the [[European Union]], the Czech Republic committed itself to respect the principle of the supremacy of [[Community acquis|European law]] over Czech law in defined areas.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Republic. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "[http://www.czech.cz/en/Life-Work/How-things-work-here/Law/The-system-of-independent-courts The System of Independent Courts]. " ''[http://www.czech.cz Hello Czech Republic (Czech Republic - The Official Website)]''. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 01 Jan. 2010. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important treaty in this category is the [[Council of Europe]]’s [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

=== Statutes adopted by the Parliament ===

Major areas of Czech law are codified in a systematic manner.

==== Criminal law ====

Most important statutes in the criminal justice field are:

* Act No. 40/2009 Coll., the Criminal Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=68040&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=40~2F2009&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 40/2009 Sb trestní zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Criminal Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30139&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=141~2F1961&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 141/1961 Sb. o trestním řízení soudním (trestní řád)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered as Code of Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 218/2003 Coll., on Juvenile Criminal Justice&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=55745&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=218~2F2003&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 218/2003 Sb. o odpovědnosti mládeže za protiprávní činy a o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže a o změně některých zákonů (zákon o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Czech [[criminal law]] is regulated mainly, though not only, by the Criminal Code Act 2009 (''{{lang|cs|trestní zákoník}}''), which codifies substantive criminal law. The comprehensive regulatory statute for criminal procedure is the Criminal Proceedings Code Act 1961 (''{{lang|cs|trestní řád}}''). The two codes are complemented by the Juvenile Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with alleged offenders aged between 15 (the threshold of criminal liability as well as [[Age of consent|age of legal consent]]) and 17.

Until 2009, the criminal code statute in force dated back to 1961. In spite of numerous amendments made since the 1989, it still conformed to the communist ideology, oriented on punishment of perceived enemies of the socialist regime. As a part of an effort to comprehensively reform law and justice, a brand new codification has been written. The Ministry of Justice announced it as an "elaborate piece of work boiled down from the experience and knowledge of foremost expert on criminal law", which can be proudly compared to modern criminal codes of other democratic countries.&lt;ref name="moj"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html "Obecně o trestním zákoníku. "] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217044737/http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html |date=2013-02-17 }} ''Reforma justice. '' Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR, n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the 2009 codification was to bring the criminal justice system in line with the rest of Europe. The main change introduced by the code was transition from material to formal conception of criminal offence. Another thing the lawyers drafting the 2009 code had in mind, and expressed it in the area of sentencing tariffs, was a new balance of punishment against rehabilitation effect on the criminal. On one hand we see the sentences for felony (''{{lang|cs|zločin}}'') which carry a sentence of at least 5 years. On the other a newly created category of misdemeanour (''{{lang|cs|přečin}}'') introduces a host of community sentences (''{{lang|cs|alternativní tresty}}''), including community payback (''{{lang|cs|veřejně prospěšné práce}}'') or house arrest (''{{lang|cs|domácí vězení}}''). The code also outlaws doping.&lt;ref name="moj" /&gt;

Less serious breaches of law are called [[contravention]]s (''{{lang|cs|přestupek}}'').&lt;ref&gt;The word ''přestupek'' (pl. ''přestupky'') can be found translated variously, even in official translations, as ''infraction'', ''administrative infraction'', ''administrative offence'', ''offence'' (!), ''offence'', ''transgression'', ''misdemeanour'', or ''violation''.&lt;/ref&gt; These are not normally dealt with by the courts of law, but rather punished either by the police on the spot, or through a procedure in front of a committee at the local or municipal authority, or sometimes other administration body. The result is not a conviction, and so such a punishment will not blemish the culprit's criminal record. Like with other administrative acts, the outcome of this procedure can be challenged through the administrative justice process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novotný|first=Václav|title=Administrative Justice in Europe – Report for the Czech Republic|date=n.d.|publisher=Association of Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions|url=http://www.juradmin.eu/en/eurtour/i/countries/czech/czech_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical example of contraventions in Czech law this are driving offences. (In the common law world, acts falling into this category would be classed as [[summary offence]]s.)
* Act No. 200/1990 on Contraventions&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=38544&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=p~C5~99estupky&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 200/1990 Sb. o přestupcích]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Czech law also recognizes [[Corporate liability|criminal liability of corporations]] for offences committed by employees of a corporation, when acting on its behalf, being instructed by the board of directors or other representative of the company, or through lack of their action. In such cases, not only individuals will be prosecuted, but the corporation can be prosecuted as well for the same offence and punished by a host of measures, starting from cetrain injunctions, through fines a forfeitures, to liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trubač|first=Ondeřej|title=Trestní odpovědnost právnické osoby|url=http://finance.idnes.cz/trestni-odpovednost-pravnickych-osob-dhf-/pravo.aspx?c=A120305_210154_pravo_vr|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=iDNES.cz|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skalická|first=Hana|title=Corporate Criminal Liability in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.terralex.org/publication/p58cf9663e3/corporate-criminal-liability-in-the-czech-republic|work=Newsletter - TerraLex Practice Groups|publisher=TerraLex|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Act No. 418/2011 Coll., on Criminal Liability of Legal Persons and the Proceedings against Them&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=75794&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=418~2F2011&amp;part=&amp;name=&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 418/2011 Sb. o trestní odpovědnosti právnických osob a řízení proti nim]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil law ====

Main statutes regulating this area are:

* Act No. 89/2012 Coll. the Civil Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/sqw/sbirka.sqw?r=2012&amp;cz=89 Zákon č. 89/2012 Sb. občanský zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 99/1963 Coll. the Civil Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30398&amp;src=dulezite&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 99/1963 Sb. občanský soudní řád]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered Code of Civil Justice&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 500/2004 Coll. the Administrative Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=58370&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=500~2F2004&amp;part=&amp;name=&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 500/2004 Sb. správní řád]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;also Code of Administrative Procedure&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Code codifies core areas of [[private law]]. It has five parts. The first part is dedicated to a legal status of a person as an individual. The second regulates family law – e.g. the institute of marriage and the rights and obligations of husband and wife, parents and children.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt; Although the Code does include [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|registered partnership]], it explicitly prohibits adoption to a person in a registered partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf "Zákon 89/2012 občanský zákoník. "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709040352/http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf |date=2012-07-09 }} ''Sbírka zákonů. '' 03 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest in concerned mainly with property rights.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt;

The civil code regulation effective since 1 January 2014 is a result of eleven years of work of the recodification committee of the [[Ministry of Justice (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Justice]]. Together with the Commercial Corporations Act and the Private International Law Act it constitutes a complete recodification of private law in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="novyoz"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/cz/uvodni-stranka.html "Úvodní stránka.

'' Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR, n.d.

=== Case law ===

Theoretically, case law is not defined as a source of law in the Czech Republic. Despite that, the decisions of courts, namely supreme courts and the Constitutional Court, have a significant influence over the Czech legal system since 1989.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt; Findings of the Constitutional Court are considered a source of law, and are binding for general courts.&lt;ref&gt;"Enforceable rulings of the Constitutional Court shall be binding for all agencies and individuals. " – Constitution, Art. 89&lt;/ref&gt; If a lower court is to rule against "consistent adjudications" of the Supreme Court on the point of law, it must give detailed reasoning, and this can often be a reason for a successful appeal. This system is largely based on judiciary's own interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it gives citizens predictability and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fetter|first=Richard W.|title=Musejí nižší soudy poslouchat Nejvyšší soud?|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/paragrafy/zpravy/museji-nizsi-soudy-poslouchat-nejvyssi-soud/453253|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=České noviny|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant judgements of both courts are published in the official Collection of Laws.&lt;ref name="concourt2"&gt;Czech Republic.

== History ==
[[File:Theresiana-Titel.jpg|thumb|[[Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana]], 1768]]
In [[Czech lands]], the process of formation of modern legislation dates back to the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], when they were a core part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Reforms of government were to a large extent the work of empress [[Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], who participated in creating the first [[civil code]] of the country in 1787, called [[Josephinisches Gesetzbuch]]. This was a forbearer to the comprehensive codification of civil law in 1811, known as the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (ABGB). ABGB was [[Reception statute|received]] in 1918 by Czechoslovakia, among other successor states, but only for Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia), while Slovakia kept the customary law of Hungary. Albeit updated many times, this Austrian law was kept in Czechoslovakia, along with the legal duality, until 1950, when the "Middle Civil Code" was promulgated, soon to be superseded by the civil code of 1964, which will be in force until the "New Civil Code", enacted in 2009, will enter in force in 2014.

Following in the tracks of their enlightenment predecessors, the [[Constitutio criminalis Josephina]] of 1707 and the [[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]] of 1768, the most important Czechoslovakian [[criminal code]]s were enacted in 1950, 1961 and 2009.

The history of Czechoslovak constitutionality starts with the formation of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] out of the ruins of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the [[Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovak nation]]. This lasted over the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First Republic]] and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] was enacted after the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|communist coup]] – preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, partial division of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the "Socialist Constitution". It changed the name of the country to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak ''Socialist'' Republic]] and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation]] – this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Further radical modifications were enacted after the [[Velvet Revolution|regime change of 1989]], but they turned out to be short-lived, as in 1992 the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been promulgated after the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|division of Czechoslovakia]], and entered into force in 1993.

A '''legal terminology textbook''' is a [[textbook]] that arranges and defines legal words and phrases in groups and by topic, in contrast with a [[law dictionary]], which arranges and defines legal words and phrases individually and in alphabetical order. Thus, it may be more suitable for a student or other person interested in understanding an array of related legal words and phrases.

'''''Mugler v. Kansas''''', 123 U.S. 623 (1887), was an important [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the 8–1 opinion of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[John Marshall Harlan]] and the lone partial dissent by Associate Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]] laid the foundation for the Supreme Court's later acceptance and defense during the [[Lochner era]] of Justice Field's theory of economic [[substantive due process]] under the [[Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fourteenth Amendment]].

The companion case was ''Kansas v. Ziebold &amp; Hagelin''.

==Background==
As part of the burgeoning [[temperance movement]], the people of [[Kansas]] amended their [[Kansas Constitution|state constitution]] on November 2, 1880:
{{quote|The manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors shall be forever prohibited in this state, except for medical, scientific and mechanical purposes.}}

The [[Kansas Legislature]] subsequently enacted an accompanying [[statute]] on February 19, 1881 that provided that after May 1, 1881, any person who manufactured or aided in the manufacture of any liquor without an appropriate permit would be guilty of a [[misdemeanor]]. First-time violators were to be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500 or to be imprisoned in the county jail for not less than 20 nor more than 90 days.

On March 7, 1885, the legislature supplemented the statute by providing that all places in which intoxicating liquors were manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away or kept for sale, barter, or use were a [[nuisance]] and subject to abatement where a court judged them so. Courts adjudicating nuisance complaints were to sit in [[equity (law)|equity]]; also, the statute required the state meet the burden of proving oy that the defendant did not possess a permit, in which case the judge must declare the place complained of a nuisance. Offending owners of nuisances were to be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500 or to be imprisoned in the county jail for not less than 30 nor more than 90 days.

In 1877, prior to the passage of the Kansas constitutional amendment and its accompanying statute, Peter Mugler had built a [[brewery]] in [[Salina, Kansas]]. He spent $10,000 on the brewery’s construction and had obtained a corporate charter from the state allowing him to operate a brewery. It was completed in 1877 and used for the manufacture of intoxicating malt liquor, commonly known as [[beer]], up until May 1, 1881. Following the enactment of the statute, Mugler did not obtain a permit for the manufacture or sale of [[alcohol]]. Further, the brewery-specific design of Mugler's facility allegedly made it difficult to employ in other trades, subsequently dropping the value of the building to only $2500.

Ziebold and Hagelin were operating a brewery in [[Atchison County, Kansas]].

==Procedural history==
In November 1881, authorities [[indictment|indicted]] Peter Mugler in the District Court of [[Saline County, Kansas]] for violation of the statutes. The first indictment contained five counts alleging Mugler had sold, bartered, or given away intoxicating liquors without a permit; a sixth count alleged his brewery was a public nuisance for being a place used in violation of the statute. The second indictment contained one count alleging Mugler had manufactured intoxicating liquors without a permit.

The District Court found Mugler guilty and fined him $100 and court fees. It subsequently rejected the defendant's motions for a new trial and for an arrest of judgment. The [[Kansas Supreme Court]] affirmed on appeal.

In August 1886, authorities filed an [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]] in the District Court of [[Atchison County, Kansas]] against Ziebold and Hagelin for operating a brewery. On defendant's motion, the case was removed to the US Circuit Court under its [[equity (law)|equity]] jurisdiction. The Circuit Court dismissed the bill of information; the State of Kansas appealed.

==Issue==
Does a state law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, subsequently rendering property used for the purposes described of little economic value, deprive the owner of that property in conflict with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

Mugler's attorney posited two arguments:
# A [[substantive due process]] argument that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, Kansas lacked any authority to prohibit the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for personal use or for the purpose of export.
# A [[eminent domain|takings]] argument citing the devaluation of Mugler's property from $10,000 to $2500 by the statute, the building's brewery-specific design, and the difficulty of employing the building in other lawful trades. Mugler's attorney backed this argument with the holding of ''Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co.'', which found the damming of a nearby river in order to improve navigation and had flooded the plaintiff's land, rendering it useless and without value, was a taking requiring compensation.

The attorney for Ziebold and Hagelin echoed Mugler's two arguments but posited an additional argument attacking the nuisance statute, which allowed for the destruction of all property used in keeping and maintaining the nuisance without a trial by jury, as a denial of [[due process]]. The state, according to Ziebold and Hagelin's attorney, was using the nuisance provision out of order; instead of trying and convicting the defendants first, and then subsequently declaring the property a nuisance on the fact of their conviction and enabling authorities to destroy the liquors, the state was instead using the nuisance statutes to convict the defendants without trial. The statute removed the [[presumption of innocence]] once the state had proved the owners of the alleged nuisance did not have a permit.

==Decision==
On December 5, 1887, the US Supreme Court upheld 8–1 the ruling of the Supreme Court of Kansas, thus affirming Mugler's convictions. [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[John Marshall Harlan]], writing for the majority, held that a state’s legislation prohibiting the manufacture of intoxicating liquor within its jurisdiction does not infringe on any right or privilege secured by the Constitution of the United States. Addressing Mugler's first argument, the Court stated its belief that the principle requiring property holders not to use their property so as to be injurious to the community was compatible with the Fourteenth Amendment.

However, the Court decided that it possessed the power to inquire into the intentions of the legislature behind police power regulations to settle disputes over the relatedness of the regulation to a state's use of the police power.

Turning to Mugler's second argument, the Court found the authority for the statute in this case strictly relied upon Kansas's [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]. Since the statute dealt with the health, the safety, and the morals of the population, the Court rejected Mugler's reliance on ''Pumpelly'', distinguishing the ''Pumpelly'' case as a use solely of the state's power of eminent domain; the Court reasoned that a prohibition on the use of property, by valid legislation, for purposes of protecting the health and safety of the community cannot be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property for public benefit. Since the legislation did not restrict the owners control, right to dispose, or ability to use for lawful purposes, no taking had occurred.

Further, the Court held that states cannot be burdened with the condition that they must compensate individual owners for incidental losses suffered as a result of a prohibition on the use of property. Additionally, property values which depreciate as a result of the state's exercise of the police power is different from taking property for public use. In one case a nuisance is abated; in the other, property is taken away from the owner completely. If public safety requires certain action be taken by the legislature, lawmakers cannot be persuaded from discontinuing such activity because individuals will suffer incidental inconveniences.

The '''Octennial Act''' (7 George III c.3; [[long title]] ''An act for limiting the duration of parliaments''&lt;ref name="ild2174"&gt;ILD No.2174&lt;/ref&gt;) was a 1768&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The act was passed in the 1767–68 [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]]; the year may be quoted as the Octennial Act 1767 (start of session) or Octennial Act 1768 (when [[royal assent]] received).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] which set a maximum duration of eight years for the [[Irish House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="Jones2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Clyve|title=A Short History of Parliament: England, Great Britain, the United Kingdom, Ireland &amp; Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9sDVTsMGMMC&amp;pg=PA334|accessdate=9 March 2015|year=2012|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9781843837176|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, a [[dissolution of parliament]] was not required except on the [[demise of the Crown]], and the previous three general elections were held in 1715, 1727, and 1761, on the respective deaths of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], and [[George II of Great Britain|George II]].&lt;ref name="Jones2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath 2001, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; After the act, general elections were held in 1769, 76, 83, 90, and 98.&lt;ref name="Jones2012" /&gt;

Limiting the duration of parliament was a prime objective of the [[Irish Patriot Party|Patriot Party]].

The heads were rejected by the [[Privy Council of Great Britain]], which, under [[Poynings' Law]], had to pre-approve any [[bill (law)|bill]] before it was formally introduced in the Irish parliament.

Since the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, the British government had wished to increase the size of [[Irish regiment]]s, the part of the [[British Army]] charged on the Irish exchequer rather than the British.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett 1981, p.541&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, the [[Chatham Ministry]] appointed [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend]] as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and instructed him to secure the support of the Irish parliament for an [[Augmentation Bill]] to effect this increase. The British considered several possible concessions to win over the Patriot Party,&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett 1981, p.547&lt;/ref&gt; and at his [[speech from the throne]], Townshend promised judicial tenure [[quamdiu se bene gesserint]] (on the model of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]) and hinted at a Septennial Act.&lt;ref name="Bartlett546"&gt;Bartlett 1981, p.546&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas again introduced heads of a Septennial Bill on 20 October 1767;&lt;ref name="ild2174" /&gt; [[Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham|Barry Maxwell]] introduced heads of a judicial tenure bill the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/ild/?func=display_bill&amp;id=1595|title=For making judges commissions quam diu se bene gesserint.|work=Irish legislation database (ILD) |publisher=[[Queen's University Belfast]]|pages=No.1595|nopp=Y|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the appointment of [[James Hewitt, 1st Viscount Lifford|James Hewitt, 1st Baron Lifford]] as [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] alienated the [[Undertaker (18th century)|Undertakers]] who had hoped for the post.&lt;ref name="Bartlett546"/&gt; In addition, the British Privy Council added a [[wrecking clause]] to the judicial tenure bill, which caused the Irish parliament to reject the bill once returned to Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett 1981, p.548&lt;/ref&gt; The council also made three amendments to Lucas' bill: to the [[preamble]], to extend the limit from seven to eight years (thus an Octennial Bill) and to bring forward the date of the next general election from 1774 to 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett 1981, p.555&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Francis Plowden (barrister)|Francis Plowden]], the Privy Council insisted on the modification to eight years as a wrecking amendment, expecting that the Irish parliament would reject the bill on principle once any amendment had been made to it, and was disappointed when its amended bill was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plowden |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Plowden (barrister) |title=The history of Ireland from its invasion under Henry II to its union with Great Britain |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/historyofireland02plowuoft#page/155/mode/1up |volume=Vol.2 |year=1809 |publisher=Sold by Mr. Booker |location=London |pages=155–156 |chapter=Book III, Chapter III: The Reign of George III}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3835">'''Operation Intercept''' was an anti-drug measure announced by President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] on at 2:30pm on Sunday, September 21, 1969, resulting in a near shutdown of border crossings between Mexico and the United States.  The initiative was intended to reduce the entry of Mexican [[marijuana]] into the United States at a time that was considered to be the prime harvest season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/library/studies/cu/CU59.html ''The 1969 marijuana shortage and "Operation Intercept,"'' The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was implemented by [[Myles Ambrose]], who served as the Commissioner of Customs in the Nixon administration.&lt;ref name="washingtonpostobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schudel|first1=Matt|title=Myles J. Ambrose, who sought to curb illegal drug trade, helped set up the DEA|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/myles-j-ambrose-who-sought-to-curb-nations-drug-trade-helped-set-up-the-dea/2014/06/11/2480316c-f0c4-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|accessdate=October 15, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=June 12, 2014|quote=In 1969, Mr. Ambrose launched Operation Intercept, a controversial program in which federal agents searched cars for drugs as they entered the United States at the Mexican border.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy was instituted as a surprise move, although President Nixon had given Mexican President [[Gustavo Diaz Ordaz]] some advance warning when they met on September 8, 1969 to dedicate the [[Lake Amistad Dam International Crossing]]. The effort involved increased surveillance of the border from both air and sea, but the major part of the policy was the individual inspection, mandated to last three minutes, of every vehicle crossing into the United States from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1960/intercept/chapter1.htm Lawrence A. Gooberman, ''Operation Intercept: The Multiple Consequences of Social Policy''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of complaints from cross-border travelers, and from Mexican President [[Gustavo Diaz Ordaz|Diaz Ordaz]], the searching of vehicles was reduced after 10 days and completely abandoned after about 20 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/drugs-alcohol-encyclopedia/operation-intercept ''Operation Intercept'', Encyclopedia of Drugs, Alcohol, and Addictive Behavior.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nixon Administration believed that it had largely achieved its goal of encouraging the Mexican government to begin an effort to stem domestic drug production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB86/ Kate Doyle, ''Operation Intercept: The Perils of Unilateralism'', [[National Security Archive]] at [[George Washington University]], with copies of 18 previously classified documents.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of 1970, the [[Jefferson Airplane]] released a single entitled [[Mexico (Jefferson Airplane song)|‘Mexico’ c/w ‘Have You Seen the Saucers’]]. [[Mexico (Jefferson_Airplane_song)|‘Mexico’]] was not played on some radio stations at the time because the lyrics referred to Operation Intercept, but this song became a classic on many of the so-called underground radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Thompson (manager)|Bill Thompson]] Sleeve Notes to Jefferson Airplane’s album ‘Early Flight’ Feb 1974 Grunt APL1-0437&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempted four-day disruption of PayPal's operations was allegedly in response to PayPal's refusal to process donations to [[Wau Holland Foundation|Wau Holland Stiftung's]] PayPal account set up to collect funds for [[WikiLeaks]], and was part of a wider Anonymous campaign, [[Operation Payback]].&lt;ref name="GuiltyPlea"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/528058/20131206/paypal-14-freedom-fighters-plead-guilty-cyber.htm |author=David Gilbert |title=PayPal 14 'Freedom Fighters' Plead Guilty to Cyber-Attack |publisher=International Business Times |date=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/05/inside-the-paypal-14-trial.html |author=Alexa O'Brien |title=Inside the ‘PayPal 14’ Trial |work=The Daily Beast |date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court proceedings==
{{Update section|date=February 2017}}
The defendants were charged under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] in July 2011 for the attempted [[denial of service attacks]], which occurred in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070060/paypal-ddos-attackers-plead-guilty-some-may-walk-free.html |title=PayPal DDoS attackers pleaded guilty, some may walk free |publisher=PC World |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2013, ten of the defendants pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of damaging a protected computer and one felony count of conspiracy, and three others each pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57614906-83/anonymous-hackers-plead-guilty-to-2010-paypal-cyberattack/ |author=Steven Musil |title=Anonymous hackers plead guilty to 2010 PayPal cyberattack |publisher=CNet |date=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th defendant had their case handled separately.&lt;ref name="GuiltyPlea"/&gt;

[[New York City|New York]]-based attorney Stanley Cohen, who represented one of the defendants, claimed that the 13 committed acts of [[civil disobedience]] in political dissent, adding that he thinks that the acts were [[free speech]] protected by the [[First Amendment]]. In an interview for SKP News Cohen compared the digital 'sit-in' to protests organized by the [[Greensboro sit-ins|civil rights movement]]. Cohen further noted that the guilty pleas were for misdemeanors resulting in probation, instead of having the defendants face possible felony convictions and jail sentences. A fine of $86,000 is being equally distributed among the 13 activists, each owing $6,615. The fine must be paid by December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/13-plead-guilty-attacking-paypal-servers-21166352 |title=13 Plead Guilty to Attacking Paypal Servers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215175547/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/13-plead-guilty-attacking-paypal-servers-21166352|archivedate=15 December 2013 |publisher=ABC News |date=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leniency request==
It is unclear how many people actually took part in the attacks. [[Pierre Omidyar]], founder of the online market [[eBay]], asked federal prosecutors to show leniency, stating that "[i]n those cases, I believe justice requires leniency. In my view, they should be facing misdemeanor charges and the possibility of a fine, rather than felony charges and jail time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/527504/20131204/ebay-founder-pierre-omidyar-calls-leniency-paypal14.htm |author=David Gilbert |title=eBay Founder Pierre Omidyar Calls for Leniency for 'PayPal 14' |work=International Business Times |date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reed v. Reed''''', 404 U.S. 71 (1971), was an [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] case in the [[United States]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the administrators of [[Estate (law)|estates]] cannot be named in a way that discriminates between sexes.

==The case==
Sally and Cecil Reed, a married couple who had separated, were in conflict over which of them to designate as administrator of the estate of their deceased son. Each filed a petition with the [[Probate Court]] of [[Ada County]], [[Idaho]], asking to be named.&lt;ref name=rvr&gt;{{ussc|name=Reed v. Reed|volume=404|page=71|pin=|year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Idaho Code specified that "males must be preferred to females" in appointing administrators of estates and the court appointed Cecil as administrator of the estate, valued at less than $1000. Sally Reed was represented at the Supreme Court by [[Idaho]] lawyer, [[Allen Derr]], who argued that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] forbids discrimination based on gender.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Miller |title=Derr’s work advanced gender equality – Idaho lawyer who won landmark case dies at 85 |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/jun/11/derrs-work-advanced-gender-equality/ |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Spokesman-Review]]|date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of appeals by both Sally and Cecil Reed, the Supreme Court considered the case and delivered a unanimous decision that held the Idaho Code's preference in favor of males was arbitrary and unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=rvr /&gt;

The Supreme Court ruled for the first time in ''Reed v. Reed'' that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited differential treatment based on sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/24338/Reed-v-Reed-Significance.html Reed v. Reed – Significance, Notable Trials and Court Cases – 1963 to 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Idaho Code made a distinction based on sex, the court reasoned that "it thus establishes a classification subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause" and using the generic standard of scrutiny—ordinary or [[rational basis review]]—asked "whether a difference in the sex of competing applicants for letters of administration bears a rational relationship to a state objective."&lt;ref name=rvr /&gt;

Chief Justice [[Warren Burger|Burger]]'s opinion said:&lt;ref name=rvr /&gt;
{{quote|To give a mandatory preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings on the merits, is to make the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and whatever may be said as to the positive values of avoiding intrafamily controversy, the choice in this context may not lawfully be mandated solely on the basis of sex.}}

Before the Supreme Court decided the case, Idaho amended its statutes to eliminate the mandatory preference for males, effective July 1, 1972.&lt;ref name=rvr/&gt;

[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote the plaintiff's brief, to which she added the names of [[Pauli Murray]] and [[Dorothy Kenyon]] as co-authors in recognition of her debt to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-958315.html |title=Judge Ginsburg's Gift |author=Linda K. Kerber |date=August 1, 1993 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerber, Linda K. "Judge Ginsburg's Gift (op-ed)." The Washington Post. (August 1, 1993, Sunday, Final Edition ): 914 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2017/04/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who brought the case had hoped for a broader decision that would have deemed all classifications based on sex "suspect", a category the Supreme Court reserved for race. A suspect classification would be held to a more exacting standard of scrutiny known as [[strict scrutiny]]. The [[ACLU]] established its Women's Rights Project under Ginsburg to develop cases to persuade the court to treat sex-based distinctions that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stetson|first=Dorothy McBride|title=Women's Rights in the U.S.A.: Policy Debates and Gender Roles, 2nd edition|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SbjthGiUOkC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14027">The '''Rockefeller Drug Laws''' are the statutes dealing with the sale and possession of "[[narcotic]]" drugs in the [[New York State Penal Law]]. The laws are named after [[Nelson Rockefeller]], who was the state's [[governor]] at the time the laws were adopted. Rockefeller had previously backed drug rehabilitation, job training and housing as strategies, having seen drugs as a social problem rather a criminal one, but did an about-face during a period of mounting national anxiety about drug use and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NPR|date=2013-02-14|title=The Drug Laws That Changed How We Punish|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/14/171822608/the-drug-laws-that-changed-how-we-punish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockefeller, a staunch supporter of the bill containing the laws, had Presidential ambitions and so wanted to raise his national posture by being "tough on crime."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} If this strategy worked, he would no longer be seen as too liberal to be elected.{{speculation inline}} He signed it on May 8, 1973.

Under the Rockefeller drug laws, the penalty for selling {{convert|spell=in|2|oz|g|lk=on}} or more of [[heroin]], [[morphine]], "raw or prepared [[opium]]," [[cocaine]], or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or possessing {{convert|4|oz|g|0|spell=in}} or more of the same substances, was a minimum of 15 years to life in [[prison]], and a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. The original [[legislation]] also mandated the same penalty for committing a violent crime while under the influence of the same [[drug]]s, but this provision was subsequently omitted from the bill and was not part of the legislation Rockefeller ultimately signed. The section of the laws applying to marijuana was repealed in 1977, under the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor [[Hugh Carey]].

The adoption of the Rockefeller drug laws gave New York State the distinction of having the toughest laws of its kind in the entire United States &amp;mdash; an approach soon imitated by the state of [[Michigan]], which, in 1978, enacted a "650-Lifer Law," which called for [[life imprisonment]], without the possibility of [[parole]] for the sale, manufacture, or [[drug possession|possession]] of at least {{convert|650|g|lb|sigfig=3|lk=out}} of cocaine or any [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]] or [[Schedule II (US)|Schedule II]] opiate.

== Background ==

The laws were enacted at a time of mounting anxiety regarding drug addiction and crime, and arguments from some politicians that a draconian approach was needed. In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] declared in a White House briefing speech:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Nixon: "Remarks About an Intensified Program for Drug Abuse Prevention and Control.," June 17, 1971. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3047.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''America's public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.''

However, according to a 2016 article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' article, [[John Ehrlichman]], who had been Nixon's domestic-policy adviser, told reporter Dan Baum in a 1994 interview:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/|title=REPORT — Legalize It All: How to win the war on drugs|first=Dan|last=Baum|publisher=Harper's Magaxine|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.''

(The late Ehrlichman's children however, disputed the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Aide says Nixon's war on drugs targeted blacks, hippies|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/|publisher=CNN|date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Criticism ==

Both the New York and Michigan statutes came under harsh criticism from both the political left and the political right. [[William F. Buckley]], one of the most conservative public figures in America, was staunchly against it, as well as many in law enforcement, who saw inherent unfairness in placing the non-violent crime of [[drug trafficking]] on a par with [[murder]]. Economist [[Murray Rothbard]] called the laws "draconian: long jail sentences for heroin pushers and addicts. The Rockefeller program, which proved finally to be a fiasco, was the epitome of the belief in treating a social or medical problem with jail and the billy club."&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]] (1979-03-05) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard256.html Nelson Rockefeller, R.I.P.], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The laws also drew intense opposition from [[civil rights]] advocates, who claimed that they were [[racist]], as they were applied inordinately to [[African-American]]s and, to a lesser extent, [[Latino]]s.

In 2002, at age 46, [[Meile Rockefeller]] was arrested for protesting the Rockefeller drug laws. She was accompanied by her brother, Stuart Rockefeller, and was supported by other members of the family on the issue, including her grandfather's brother, [[Laurance Rockefeller]].&lt;ref name='Proud'&gt;{{cite news|first=Clyde|last=Haberman|authorlink=|title=NYC; Proud Of the Name, Not the Laws|date=2002-11-05|publisher=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/05/nyregion/nyc-proud-of-the-name-not-the-laws.html|work=The New York Times|pages=|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incarceration rates ==

Due to the implementation of the Rockefeller drug laws, Incarceration rates were also said to have risen with since its inception in 1973, 150,000 New Yorkers being imprisoned for non-violent drug offenses.&lt;ref name=plague&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plagueofprisons.com/research/journalofurbanhealth1.pdf|title=Population Impact of Mass Incarceration under New York's Rockefeller Drug Laws: an Analysis of Years of Life Lost|last=Drucker|first=Ernest|date=3 September 2002|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for the rising incarceration rates was due to how the Rockefeller drug laws may have imposed harsher penalties for non-violent drug offenses, but crimes related to drug use did not decrease. Throughout the 1980s this was only made worse with the imposing drug laws on dawning the newly highly popularized drug of crack-cocaine, which is said to have "caused the New York State prison population to triple."&lt;ref name=mancuso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanylawreview.org/Articles/Vol73_4/73.4.0012%20Mancuso.pdf|title=Resentencing After the "Fall" of Rockefeller: The Failure of the Drug Law Reform Acts of 2004 and 2005 to Remedy the Injustices of New York's Rockefeller Drug Laws and the Compromise of 2009|last=Mancuso|first=Peter A.|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1973, the state's prison population was approximately at ten thousand, but with the help of the Rockefeller drug laws, by the year 2002 out of the approximately seventy thousand state inmates, "19,164 were incarcerated for drug offenses"&lt;ref name=mancuso /&gt; which upon drug offenses alone had nearly doubled the state population of 1973. Even despite the steady drop in crime rates that took place in the 1990s, the effects of the Rockefeller Drug Laws were the most transparent where "high arrest rates and prison commitments for drug offenses continued to fill prison cells."&lt;ref name=plague /&gt; Another criticism of the Rockefeller drug laws has also been its distinct targeting of young minority males for as of the year 2000, black and Hispanic males made up over 90% of the population incarcerated for Rockefeller Drug Laws.&lt;ref name=plague /&gt;

== Michigan moderation ==
Michigan's statute was reformed somewhat in 1998, with the mandatory life sentence being reduced to a 20-year minimum.

== New York moderation in 2004 and 2009 ==
On December 14, 2004, New York Governor [[George Pataki]] signed into law the Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA) (2004 N.Y. Laws Ch. 738 (effective January 13, 2005)), which replaced the indeterminate sentencing scheme of the Rockefeller Drug Laws with a determinate system.   The DLRA also reduced the minimum penalty for conviction on the most serious (A-I felony) drug charge in New York from 15 years to life, to 8 years in prison, for an offender with no prior felonies.

In addition, the weight thresholds for the two most serious possession offenses (A-I and A-II) were doubled (thus making them apply to fewer defendants), and those serving life sentences were permitted to apply for re-sentencing.  Since 2004, the number of prisoners serving sentences for A-I narcotics felonies has been cut by more than half.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In his first [[State of the State address]] in January 2009, New York Governor [[David Paterson]] was critical of the Rockefeller drug laws, stating, "I can't think of a criminal justice strategy that has been more unsuccessful than the Rockefeller drug laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In April 2009, the New York Penal Law and the New York Criminal Procedure Law were revised to remove the [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentence]]s.  Under the new law, judges now had the authority to sentence defendants convicted of drug offences on guilty plea to shorter sentences, probation or drug treatment - the last known as "Judicial Diversion".  Prior to 2009, drug treatment was available at the discretion of prosecutors.  The sentencing was made retroactive, which allowed over 1000 incarcerated defendants to apply for resentencing and possible release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.troyrecord.com/articles/2009/10/08/news/doc4acd51a65865d885789894.txt | title=Drug Law Reforms in Place | author=Dave Canfield | work=The Record | location=[[Troy, New York]] | date=8 October 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City has been called the cannabis-arrest capital of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Tony|title=NYC Is the Marijuana Arrest Capital of the World|website=Huffington Post|date=May 1, 2008|accessdate=May 8, 2018|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-newman/nyc-is-the-marijuana-arre_b_99595.html}},&lt;/ref&gt; with over 40,000 arrests in 2008. Despite New York's decriminalization of simple possession, New York City police arrest suspects for possession in public view, which remains a misdemeanor.  During a [[Terry stop]], officers may falsely suggest that a suspect should voluntarily reveal contraband to avoid arrest, then arrest the suspect if he reveals cannabis to public view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabriel-sayegh/new-york-citys-massive-ma_b_269384.html | title=New York City's Massive Marijuana Arrests | author=Gabriel Sayegh | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=26 August 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]] criticized the crackdown for its cost and scope, its reliance on stop-and-frisks and police coercion to escalate simple possession into an arrestable offense, and the disproportionate number of young, black and Latino males arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[New York Civil Liberties Union]]|title=NYC Marijuana Possession Arrests Skyrocket, Illustrate NYPD Racial Bias, New Report Shows|url=http://www.nyclu.org/node/1736|date=2008-04-29|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impoverished neighborhoods==
One main criticism of these drug laws were that they put young minority males and females behind bars for carrying small amounts of drugs on them. These laws were a part of the "war on drugs" era and were meant to go after drug king pins, however it started to target lower level people as a means of keeping the streets clean. Elaine Bartlett and her story told in the book ''Life on the Outside'' critically depicts the effects of the Rockefeller Drug Laws and its policy on drug dealers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/garden/at-last-the-windows-have-no-bars.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">{{Common law}}
The '''rule of capture''' or  '''law of capture''' is common law from England,&lt;ref&gt;'' Acton v. Blundell'', 12 Mees. &amp; W. 324, 354, 152 Eng. Rep. 1223, 1235 (Ex. Ch. 1843)&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by a number of U.S. jurisdictions, that establishes a rule of non-liability and ownership of captured natural resources including [[groundwater]], [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Natural gas|gas]], and [[game animals]].  The general rule is that the first person to "capture" such a resource owns that resource. For example, a landowner who extracts or “captures” groundwater, oil, or gas from a well that bottoms within the subsurface of his land acquires absolute ownership of the substance, even if it is drained from the subsurface of another’s land.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana,'' 177 U.S. 190, 203 (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; The landowner that captures the substance owes no duty of care to other landowners.&lt;ref&gt;'' Acton v. Blundell'', 12 Mees. &amp; W. 324, 354, 152 Eng. Rep. 1223, 1235 (Ex. Ch. 1843)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a water well owner may dry up wells owned by adjacent landowners without fear of liability, unless the groundwater was withdrawn for malicious purposes, the groundwater was not put to a beneficial use without waste, or (in Texas) "such conduct is a proximate cause of the subsidence of the land of others".&lt;ref&gt;''Friendswood Development Co. v. Smith-Southwest Industries, Inc.,'' 576 S.W.2d 21 (Tex. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; A corollary of this rule is that a person who drills for groundwater, oil, or gas may not extract the substance from a well that bottoms within the subsurface estate of another by drilling on a slant.&lt;ref&gt;H. Williams and C. Meyers, Oil and Gas Terms 737 (5th ed. 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See also Nunez v. Wainoco Oil &amp; Gas Co.'', 488 So. 2d 955, 958 (La. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of ownership==
When presented with oil and gas cases, early common law jurists were somewhat reluctant to recognize a corporeal possessory interest in substances they considered to be fugacious or “wild and migratory,” and therefore subject to loss by drainage.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., Hammonds v. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co.'', 75 S.W.2d 204 (Ky.1934)&lt;/ref&gt; Among U.S. states, two different theories of ownership of oil and gas arose.  Some states, such as [[Texas]], have adopted the “ownership-in-place” theory for oil and gas that a landowner owns a corporeal possessory interest (similar to a [[fee simple]]) in the substances beneath his land, but his ownership is a determinable fee subject to the rule of capture.&lt;ref&gt;''Michel T. Halbouty et al., v. Railroad Commission of Texas et al.'', 357 S.W.2d 364 (Tex. 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other states, like [[Oklahoma]], have adopted the “exclusive-right-to-take” theory that a landowner does not own the substances that underlie his land, but merely retains the exclusive right to capture the substances, a non-corporeal interest.&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'' E. Kuntz, A Treatise on the Law of Oil and Gas&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the two theories is primarily of import in determining [[legal remedy|remedies]].

==Boundary determination==
Subsurface ownership boundaries are the same as those upon the surface, projected downward to the center of the earth.  This concept is based upon the Roman legal principle of [[property law]], ''[[cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' (for whosoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to the sky and down to the depths).

==Conservation acts==
The rule of capture creates an incentive for an owner to drill as many wells as possible on his piece of land so as to extract the groundwater, oil, or gas before his neighbor. Very dense drilling can result in dissipation of the pressure within an aquifer or oil and gas reservoir, and therefore [[overdrafting]] of the aquifer or incomplete extraction of the substance. To mitigate this danger, many states have sought to supersede the rule of capture with conservation acts.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Arkansas Code Annotated § 15-72-101 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Such acts enforce prorationing, pooling, and limits on density of drilling to avoid physical waste and ensure maximum ultimate recovery.

States following the ownership-in-place theory have actions available, including adverse possession and trespass.

{{Criminal defenses}}

In [[Sweden]], the law of '''self-defense''' ({{Lang-sv|nödvärn}}) allows a person attacked to [[excuse|excuse or justify]] a proportionate use of violence in defense of the person or property.

==The law==
Chapter 24 of the Swedish [[criminal code]] states various conditions for which a person will not be sentenced in [[court]] for committing an otherwise [[crime|criminal act]]. Self-defense is considered grounds for non-conviction if the accused acted in a situation of peril and acted in a manner that is not "blatantly unjustifiable" in relation to that which is defended.

A situation of peril is stated to exist if:
#a person is subjected to, or is in imminent danger of being subjected to, a criminal attack against property or person, or
#a person through threats, force or violence is prevented from taking back stolen property found on criminals "[[In flagrante delicto|red handed]]", or
#an intruder attempts to enter a room, house, estate or ship, or
#another person refuses to leave a residence after being told to.

The interpretation of what is to be considered not "blatantly unjustifiable" is popularly expressed in Sweden as "that force which is required by the peril". In other words, the defending party may do whatever it takes so long as no alternative, less severe options are available (except fleeing the immediate area [[:sv:Nytt juridiskt arkiv|NJA]] 1969 p425, 1999 p460). The expression "blatantly unjustifiable" allows fairly generous tolerance towards the defending party.

However, the defending party must also consider that which is defended and what injury is inflicted upon the attacker. If that which is defended is insignificant in comparison to the injuries to the attacker, the court may reject the claim that person acted in self-defense since the damage done to the attacker ''is'' "blatantly unjustifiable".  Loss of life or permanent bodily injury is rarely justified as self-defense unless the defending party was in danger of being subjected to the same.

For example, if the only way of stopping a criminal from escaping with stolen property would be by killing them, then it would not be justifiable to do so.  This is because that which is defended (property) is not as valuable as a human life and therefore the action of killing the criminal is not justifiable.

===Subjective peril===
Swedish [[legal custom]] in regards to self-defense states that peril is subjective. This means that the peril is measured from what the defending party ''perceived'' as peril and not the actual peril.

For example, if a person were to threaten someone with an unloaded [[gun]] (not an actual lethal threat), the defending party would not be convicted if defending themselves as if the gun were loaded (a lethal threat). This is because the defending party may perceive the gun as loaded and thus lethal.

===Excess===
A person who commits acts which are "blatantly unjustifiable" while in peril may also escape conviction if the situation were such that the person "could not be expected to maintain control of himself". For instance, such a situation might be if the defending party were in a state of great fear or severe rage because of the peril.

===Defense of others===
The Swedish criminal code states that anyone who assists a defending party in peril shall have the same rights as the defending party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''Slap Software''', (Software Livre da Administração Processual, or Free Software of the Procedural Management), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Open-source software|open source]] system. It was developed to be used in the automation of [[Judicial power|judicial]], [[Public management|administrative]] and [[Legislative procedure|legislative]] [[Procedural law|procedures]]. It is registered in National Industrial Property Institute (INPI).&lt;ref name="INPI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistas.inpi.gov.br/pdf/PATENTES2039.pdf|title=Patents - Revista da Propriedade Industrial nº 2039|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Revista do Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industrial|accessdate= 21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Application software|applications]] deal with systems with features of research, control, follow-up and the storing of [[data (computing)|data]], including judicial automation, digital procedure, [[electronic process of law]], or protocol.

== Purpose ==
Slap Software was created mainly to reduce government spending by the [[code reuse|reuse]] of [[Modular programming|module]]s in different parts of government.

It was intended to eliminate the institutional waste that comes reimplementing existing functionality.&lt;ref name="TJMT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tjmt.myclipp.inf.br/file/pdf/dodia/2011Jul05_noticias.pdf|title=Sistema Privado é Melhor para Virtualizar a Justiça|author=Tribunal de Justiça do Mato Grosso|date=5 July 2011|publisher=Myclipp|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose was to help improve best practices in the interdisciplinary area between [[law]] and information technology.

== Concepts ==
Modules were tasked with meeting the requirements of multiple applications in judicial, administrative and legislative domains in both [[Civil procedure|civil]] and [[Criminal procedure|criminal]]),eareas, across [[jurisdiction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, departments and special courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mauricio.bastos.nom.br/processo-eletronico/9887-slapsoftware-voce-ja-ouviu-falar.html|title=Slap Software, Alguém Já Ouviu Falar?|publisher=Maurício Bastos Juiz do Trabalho|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slavery Abolition Act 1833''' (3 &amp; 4 Will. IV c. 73) abolished [[slavery]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. This [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] expanded the jurisdiction of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] which made the purchase or ownership of slaves illegal within the British Empire, with the exception "of the Territories in the Possession of the [[East India Company]]", Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), and [[Saint Helena]]. The Act was repealed in 1997 as a part of wider rationalisation of English statute law; however, later [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|anti-slavery legislation]] remains in force.

==Background==
In May 1772, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]]'s judgment in the ''[[Somerset v Stewart|Somersett's Case]]'' emancipated a slave in [[England]] and thus helped launch the movement to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Peter P. Inks, John R. Michigan, R. Owen Williams (2007) ''Encyclopedia of antislavery and abolition', p. 643. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 ' ' Blumrosen, Alfred W. and Ruth G., Slave Nation: How Slavery United the Colonies and Sparked the American Revolution, Sourcebooks, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The case ruled that slavery was unsupported by law in England and no authority could be exercised on slaves entering English or Scottish soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl/int/cases/EngR/1827/725.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=The%20Slave,%20Grace (1827) 2 Hag Adm 94].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785, English poet [[William Cowper]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have no slaves at home – Then why abroad?&lt;br /&gt;Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs&lt;br /&gt;Receive our air, that moment they are free.&lt;br /&gt;They touch our country, and their shackles fall.&lt;br /&gt;That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud.&lt;br /&gt;And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,&lt;br /&gt;And let it circulate through every vein.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Nick (2003). William Cowper: Selected Poems. p.84. Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1783, an anti-slavery movement to abolish the slave trade throughout the Empire had begun among the British public. In 1793, Lieutenant-Governor of [[Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] signed the [[Act Against Slavery]]. Passed by the local [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]], it was the first legislation to outlaw the slave trade in a part of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Chloe-Cooley-ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206103609/http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Chloe-Cooley-ENG.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807, Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]], which outlawed the slave trade, but not slavery itself. This legislation imposed fines that did little to deter slave trade participants. Abolitionist [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] realized that trading had continued and as a new MP successfully introduced the [[Slave Trade Felony Act 1811]] which at last made slave a felony act through the empire. The [[Royal Navy]] established the [[West Africa Squadron]] to suppress the [[Atlantic slave trade]] by patrolling the coast of West Africa. It did suppress the slave trade, but did not stop it entirely. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated/exhibitions/museums/chasing.html&lt;/ref&gt; They resettled many in Jamaica and the Bahamas.&lt;ref name="Naval Museum - Chasing Freedom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Information Sheet |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |date= |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |accessdate=2 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |accessdate=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain also used its influence to coerce other countries to agree [[Abolition of slavery timeline#1800–1849|treaties]] to end their slave trade and allow the Royal Navy to [[Blockade of Africa|seize their slave ships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falola|first1=Toyin|last2=Warnock|first2=Amanda|title=Encyclopedia of the middle passage|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313334801|pages=xxi, xxxiii–xxxiv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&amp;lpg=PR34&amp;pg=PR21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels by the Royal Navy|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide. It was ironic, since they had in previous centuries been the worlds largest slave dealers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abina and The Important Men, A Graphic History|last=Getz|first=Trevor|last2=Clarke|first2=Liz|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in London. Members included [[Joseph Sturge]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[William Wilberforce]], [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]], [[Elizabeth Heyrick]], [[Mary Lloyd (abolitionist)|Mary Lloyd]], [[Jane Smeal]], [[Elizabeth Pease Nichol|Elizabeth Pease]], and [[Anne Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/shelves/slavery/ Slavery and abolition]. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; William Wilberforce had  written in his diary in 1787 that his great purpose in life was to suppress the slave trade before waging a 20-year fight on the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbn.com/special/amazingGrace/articles/Wilberforce-bio.aspx William Wilberforce: A Man for All Seasons]. CBN&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Protector of Slaves Office (Trinidad) by Richard Bridgens.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Protector of Slaves Office (Trinidad)'', Richard Bridgens, 1838.]]
During the Christmas holiday of 1831, a large-scale slave revolt in Jamaica, known as the [[Baptist War]], broke out. It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by the Baptist minister [[Samuel Sharpe]]. The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832. Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries. The results of these inquiries contributed greatly to the abolition of slavery with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.{{citation needed|date = August 2016}}

==Act==
The Act had its third reading in the House of Commons on 26 July 1833, three days before [[William Wilberforce]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1833/act/73/enacted/en/print.html |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section XII |date=28 August 1833 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received the [[Royal Assent]] a month later, on August 28, and came into force the following year, on 1 August 1834. In practical terms, only slaves below the age of six were freed in the colonies. Former slaves over the age of six were redesignated as "apprentices", and their servitude was abolished in two stages: the first set of apprenticeships came to an end on 1 August 1838, while the final apprenticeships were scheduled to cease on 1 August 1840. The Act specifically excluded "the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company, or to the Island of Ceylon, or to the Island of Saint Helena." The exceptions were eliminated in 1843.&lt;ref name=SectionLXIV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section LXIV |date=28 August 1833 |accessdate=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation for slave owners==
The Act provided for compensation for slave-owners. The amount of money to be spent on the compensation claims was set at "the Sum of Twenty Million Pounds Sterling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section XXIV|date=28 August 1833|accessdate=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Act, the British government raised £20 million (£16.5 billion in 2013 pounds, when calculated as wage values)&lt;ref name=Manning&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sanchez Manning|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-colonial-shame-slave-owners-given-huge-payouts-after-abolition-8508358.html|title=Britain's colonial shame: Slave-owners given huge payouts after|date=24 February 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to pay out in compensation for the loss of the slaves as business assets to the registered owners of the freed slaves. In 1833, £20 million amounted to 40% of the Treasury's annual income&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ukpublicrevenue.co.uk/piechart_1833_UK_total&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 5% of the British GDP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/piechart_1833_UK_total|title= UK public spending and GDP in 1833|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5% of the British GDP in 2016 was around £100 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/year_spending_2016UKmt_16mc1n#ukgs302|title=UK public spending and GDP in 2016|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To finance the compensation, the British government had to take on a £15 million loan, finalised on 3 August 1835, with banker [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] and his brother-in-law [[Moses Montefiore]]. The money was not paid back until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kris Manjapra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/29/slavery-abolition-compensation-when-will-britain-face-up-to-its-crimes-against-humanity|title=When will Britain face up to its crimes against humanity?|date=29 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Half of the money went to slave-owning families in the Caribbean and Africa, while the other half went to absentee owners living in Britain.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; The names listed in the returns for slave compensation show that ownership was spread over many hundreds of British families,&lt;ref&gt;British ''Parliamentary Papers'', session 1837–38 (215), vol. 48. The manuscript returns and indexes to the claims are held by [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]].&lt;/ref&gt; many of them (though not all&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zw8dq6f&lt;/ref&gt;) of high social standing. For example, [[Henry Phillpotts]] (then the [[Bishop of Exeter]]), with three others (as trustees and executors of the will of [[John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley]]), was paid £12,700 for 665 slaves in the West Indies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rt. Hon. Rev. Henry Phillpotts |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/18347 |publisher=UCL, Legacies of British slave-ownership|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood]] received £26,309 for 2,554 slaves on 6 plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/6180|publisher=UCL, Legacies of British slave-ownership|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of men and women who were awarded compensation under the 1833 Abolition Act are listed in a Parliamentary Return, entitled Slavery Abolition Act, which is an account of all moneys awarded by the Commissioners of Slave Compensation in the ''Parliamentary Papers'' 1837-8 (215) vol. 48.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/project/research UCL – Researching Slave-owners]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests against apprenticeships==
On 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly people being addressed by the Governor at Government House in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]], about the new laws, began chanting: "Pas de six ans. Point de six ans" ("Not six years. No six years"), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and ''de facto'' freedom was achieved. Full [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] for all was legally granted ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, John. 1992 "Pas de Six Ans!" In: ''Seven Slaves &amp; Slavery: Trinidad 1777–1838'', by Anthony de Verteuil, Port of Spain, pp. 371–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions and continuations==
As a notable exception to the rest of the British Empire, the Act did not extend to any of the Territories administered by the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]], including the islands of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], and [[Saint Helena]].&lt;ref name=SectionLXIV /&gt; Slavery was criminalised in the Company territories via the [[Indian Slavery Act, 1843|Indian Slavery Act of 1843]].{{citation needed|date = August 2016}}

A successor organisation to the Anti-Slavery Society was formed in London in 1839, the [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which worked to [[Abolitionism|outlaw slavery]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, Anne-Marie (1993), ed., ''Anti-Slavery Reporter vol 13 no 8''. P. 35, London: Anti-Slavery International&lt;/ref&gt; The world's oldest international human rights organisation, it continues today as [[Anti-Slavery International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Anti-Slavery International] UNESCO. Retrieved 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that after 1833 clandestine slave-trading continued within the British Empire; in 1854 [[Nathaniel Isaacs]], owner of the island of [[Matakong]] off the coast of [[Sierra Leone]] was accused of slave-trading by the governor of Sierra Leone, Sir [[Arthur Kennedy (governor)|Arthur Kennedy]]. Papers relating to the charges were lost when the ''Forerunner'' was wrecked off Madeira in October 1854. In the absence of the papers, the English courts refused to proceed with the prosecution.&lt;ref name=Natalia&gt;{{cite journal

==Repeal==
The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 was [[repeal]]ed in its entirety by the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980043_en_1 |title=Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1998 |date=19 November 1998 |accessdate=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1833/cukpga_18330073_en_1|title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (repealed 19.11.1998) (c.73)|accessdate=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal has not made slavery legal again, with sections of the [[Slave Trade Act 1824]], [[Slave Trade Act 1843]] and [[Slave Trade Act 1873]] continuing in force. In its place the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] incorporates into British Law Article 4 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which prohibits the holding of persons as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1029383 |title=Slave Trade Act 1824 |date=24 June 1824 |accessdate=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1034738 |title=Slave Trade Act 1843 |date=24 August 1843 |accessdate=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1052596 |title=Slave Trade Act 1873 |date=5 August 1873 |accessdate=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All%20Primary&amp;PageNumber=5&amp;BrowseLetter=H&amp;NavFrom=1&amp;activeTextDocId=1851003|title=Human Rights Act 1998|date=11 September 1998 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in popular culture==
[[Ava DuVernay]] was commissioned by the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] to create a film which debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. This film, ''August 28: A Day in the Life of a People'', tells of six significant events in [[African-American history]] that happened on the same date, [[August 28]]. Events depicted include (among others) William IV's royal assent to the Slavery Abolition Act.&lt;ref name=Essence-NMAAHC-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Rachaell|title=Why Is August 28 So Special To Black People?

The {{nihongo|'''Supreme Court of Judicature'''|大審院|Dai-shin'in}} was the highest judicial body in the [[Empire of Japan]]. It existed from 1875 to 1947.

Organized by the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] in 1875, the Japanese Supreme Court of Judicature was modeled after [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] in France. The court was composed of 120 judges in both civil and criminal divisions. Five judges would be empaneled for any given case. The criminal division of the court was the court of first instance for crimes against the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] (e.g. ''[[lèse majesté]]'') and for high crimes against public order.

The promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan]] (i.e. the “Meiji Constitution”), confirmed and formalized its position at the apex of the Japanese court system, consisting of the local courts, district courts and court of appeals.

It was abolished by order of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation authorities]] in 1947, after the abolition of the [[Meiji Constitution]].

The building of the Supreme Court of Judicature was gutted by American [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] during the [[bombing of Tokyo]] in [[World War II]]. It was repaired, and continued to be used as the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] under the post-war [[Constitution of Japan]] until 1974. The present [[Tokyo High Court]] was built on its former location.

'''TM Garret Schmid''' (born September 28, 1975 as '''Achim Schmid ''') publicly known as TM Garret, is a German-American author, producer, filmmaker, marketing expert, radio personality, human rights activist and founder of C.H.A.N.G.E, a Memphis-based non-profit organization which engages in community outreach programs, food drives, seminars, anti-racism campaigns and anti-violence campaigns. He is also the founder and organizer of the annual '''Memphis Peace Conference''', which includes an Inter-Faith and a Community Panel and was first held at Withers Collection Museum and Gallery in Memphis on Sep 29, 2018. 

== Early life == 
TM Garret was born as Achim Schmid in [[Mosbach]], Germany and raised in a small nearby town. He was raised by his mother, a cook, after his parents divorced. His father, a boatman, died later when Garret was 8 years old. He became attracted to Nationalist groups at the age of 13 and radicalized in the years after.

He joined the White Supremacist movement and founded a series of skinhead bands with names like Celtic Moon, Wolfsrudel (Wolfspack) and Höllenhunde (Hounds of Hell).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialappeal.com/news/memphis-music-producer-confirms-sordid-past-in-germany-says-hes-a-different-man-today-ep-1135501097-324384081.html/|title=Memphis music producer confirms sordid past in Germany; says he's a different man today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he became a member of a German [[Ku Klux Klan]] faction and formed his own KKK group which he later left; it disbanded in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.commercialappeal.com/news/memphis-music-producer-confirms-sordid-past-in-germany-says-hes-a-different-man-today-ep-1135501097-324384081.html |title=Memphis music producer confirms sordid past in Germany; says he's a different man today |author=Perrusquia, Marc |date=13 June 2015 |publisher=Commercial Appeal |accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, Garret is an anti-racist activist and lives in [[Horn Lake, Mississippi]]. He legally changed his name to TM Garret Schmid in 2018.

== Career ==

After leaving the White Supremacist movement in 2002, Garret used his experience he collected during that time to found companies in the call-center and internet marketing industry, the music industry, and a licensed job-recruitment company. After he moved to the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] metro area to work with his long-time friend and business partner [[Colonel Robert Morris]], he founded PicArts Media, a film production and promotion company, and Mid South Music Entertainment, a record label and booking company. He worked with artists like ''[[Canadian Idol]]'' runner up [[Jaydee Bixby]], [[Jimmy Miles]], Dani Fouts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priestrivertimes.com/news/article_5444150a-9a5f-11e3-85d3-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Be a fan of 'Nascar fan'|date=20 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubbingsracing.com/rubbingsracingWP/2014/03/06/rubbing-fenders-dani-fouts-brings-nascar-fans-a-fresh-new-song/|title=Rubbing Fenders: Dani Fouts Brings "NASCAR Fans" a Fresh, New Song – Rubbings Racing|website=rubbingsracing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[T. Graham Brown]]; TV personalities such as Mark Muller who starred in ''[[God, Guns &amp; Automobiles]]''; and the "princess of country music" Georgette Jones, the daughter of [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]. Garret sold the entertainment group in 2015.

== Awards and recognition == 

On December 5, 2014, Garret and his artist Jimmy Miles were awarded with a resolution from the Alabama State Senate, signed by Senator [[Roger Bedford Jr.]]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 2014 he helped promote [[T. Graham Brown]]'s duet "He'll Take Care of You" with [[Vince Gill]], a song from Brown's album ''Forever Changed'' which was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Roots Gospel Album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/t-graham-brown|title=T. Graham Brown|date=28 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Garret was nominated for Manager of the Year and Videographer of the Year at the annual Nashville Universe Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordovabay.com/news.php?type=article&amp;id=353|title=Cordova Bay Records|website=www.cordovabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Published works ==
Garret published two books in Germany under his birth name, Achim Schmid. ''Umsatzmaschine Leads – Der richtige Umgang mit Leads'' ("Moneymaker Leads – How to successfully use Leads") was published in 2012 by TPV Verlag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Umsatzmaschine-Leads-richtige-Umgang-mit/dp/3000385738|title=Umsatzmaschine Leads - Der richtige Umgang mit Leads: Amazon.de: Bürobedarf &amp; Schreibwaren|website=www.amazon.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his autobiography ''Wenn Alles in Scherben Fällt'' ("When everything falls apart") was released on Edition Widerschein in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Vergessene-Erinnerung-Autobiographie-ehemaligen-Rechtsextremisten-ebook/dp/B01LWPR60T/|title=Vergessene Erinnerung - Bis Alles in Scherben fällt: Autobiographie eines ehemaligen Rechtsextremisten|first1=Achim|last1=Schmid|first2=Exit|last2=Deutschland|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Edition widerschein|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

'''Simon Wiesenthal Center'''

Garret started working with the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] in fall 2018, travelling to campuses to speak to students about the effects of hate and racism and the opportunities for engagement and community building. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wataugademocrat.com/news/complete-former-neo-nazi-kkk-member-becomes-civil-rights-activist/article_a28f3014-510c-5a00-b501-123d17798ca4.html |title=Complete 180: Former Neo Nazi, KKK member becomes civil rights activist
|author=Lasure, Kayla|date=11 November 2018 |publisher=Watauga Democrat|accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''EXIT Deutschland and Life After Hate'''

In 2015 Garret started working with [[Exit Deutschland]], a German anti-Nazi organization which was founded to combat the far-right and to help people leave hate groups. He became their US ambassador&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/jed/index.php/jex/article/view/134|title=10 Fragen an Achim Schmid|first=Bernd|last=Wagner|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal Exit-Deutschland. Zeitschrift für Deradikalisierung und demokratische Kultur|volume=2|pages=200–204|via=journals.sfu.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its American counterpart EXIT-USA, which is a project of [[Life After Hate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localmemphis.com/news/local-news/mid-south-life-after-hate-ambassador-working-to-decrease-online-radicalization/793780509|title=Mid-South Life After Hate Ambassador Working to Decrease Online Radicalization|first=Dave|last=Detling|date=19 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garret is developing his own EXIT program, which includes the Erase the Hate tattoo removal campaign, participation in community events, counseling and therapy sessions, and visits to places like the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] and the Withers Collection Museum and Gallery, both located in Memphis.

'''C.H.A.N.G.E'''

After the fatal confrontation between law enforcement and Alton Sterling in Louisiana in 2016 kicked off a series of events, Garret decided to start the non-profit organization C.H.A.N.G.E Inc., which engages in community outreach programs, food drives, seminars, anti-racism campaigns and anti-violence campaigns. C.H.A.N.G.E stands for Care, Hope, Awareness, Need, Give and Education. The organization holds recurring events in high-poverty areas and supports black communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.wdr.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/aktuelle-stunde/video-bustour-usa-ku-klux-klan-gruender-wird-rassismus-gegner--100.html|title=Bustour USA: Ku Klux Klan-Gründer wird Rassismus-Gegner (6)|first=Jan|last=Hofer|date=14 August 2017|website=WDR Nachrichten}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Vv2zyfZ1s|title=WDR Bustour USA: Ku Klux Klan-Gründer wird Rassismus-Gegner  - Achim Schmid  -  TM Garret - Memphis|first=|last=Achim Schmid|date=15 August 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Tattoo covering'''

In August of 2017, Garret partnered with artists working at Sick Side Tattoo &amp; Body Piercing Studio in [[Horn Lake]], Mississippi (Memphis Metro Area). Together they work to cover up racist and gang-related tattoos through the Erase the Hate campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localmemphis.com/news/local-news/free-tattoos-help-cover-up-gang-and-racist-related-ink/785064106|title=Free Tattoos Help Cover Up Gang and Racist Related Ink|first=Dave|last=Detling|date=8 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, other tattoo parlors joined the campaign and offer to cover up racist and gang related tattoos for free. The service is currently available in Horn Lake, Mississippi, Memphis, Tennessee, Jacksonville, Florida, and Los Angeles, California. The campaign was featured in the short film ''Rewired'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8436846/|title='Rewired|first=Brianna|last=McFadden|website=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a documentary by the Chapman University about Garret, and in an upcoming film for A&amp;E network.

'''hateXchange'''

Together with other activists and members of [[Exit Deutschland]], Garret developed HateXchange, the official counterpart to EXIT Deutschland's award-winning program named Hass Hilft (Donate the Hate),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/neo-nazis-tricked-into-raising-thousands-for-anti-extremism-charity-20141118|title=Neo-Nazis Tricked Into Raising Thousands Against Themselves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where residents and sponsors turn neo-Nazi marches into "involuntary walk-a-thons" by raising money for an anti-extremist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/08/nazi-groups-countering-neo-nazis-170824072656258.html|title='Adopt a Nazi': How groups are countering neo-Nazis|first=Laurin-Whitney|last=Gottbrath|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides "walk-a-thons" and "park-a-thons"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/TheBattery/archives/2017/11/06/charities-chosen-for-anti-bannon-charleston-parks-the-hate-protest|title=Charities chosen for anti-Bannon "Charleston Parks the Hate" protest|first=Adam|last=Manno|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as on November 10, 2017 in Charleston, South Carolina, donations are also involuntarily raised by hate comments on social media. $1 per collected comment is donated to non-profit organizations like [[Life After Hate]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] and selected local non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatexchange.org|title=HateXchange - flip hate into involuntary donations|website=Hass Hilft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio career ==

Garret started developing one of the first web-based German radio shows in 2000, which ran for no longer than six months.

In 2004 he joined Radio Union with his new radio show ''Songwriter's Corner'', which aired on Sunday nights on CountryMusic24, Germany's biggest country radio station. He became the station's Co-Chief director until he quit in early 2006.

Garret and his partner Pastor Ray Johnson, a former gang member, currently host ''Let's Erase The Hate'', a weekly talk radio show, on [[CBS]] affiliate Memphis radio station [[KWAM]], which can be received locally on FM107.9 and AM990, as well as an internet live stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwam990.com/shows/Let's-Erase-the-Hate|title=KWAM The Voice of Memphis - Shows|website=www.kwam990.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ABC Tampa.ogv|right|thumb|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report of the ''Tampa affair'' and its political context, October 2001.]]
In August 2001, the [[Howard Government]] of Australia refused permission for the Norwegian freighter [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']], carrying 433 rescued refugees (predominantly [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] of [[Afghanistan]] from a distressed fishing vessel in international waters) and 5 crew to enter Australian waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unny.mission.gov.au/unny/il_271101.html Statement by Australian Ambassador], UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY 56th SESSION, 27 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2011/08/24/tampa-key-players-look-back|title=Tampa key players look back|last=Sutton|first=Ron|work=SBS News|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered an Australian political controversy in the lead up to the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 federal election]], and a diplomatic dispute [[Australia–Norway relations|between]] Australia and [[Norway]].

When the ''Tampa'' entered Australian water, the Prime Minister ordered the ship be boarded by [[Special Air Service Regiment|Australian special forces]]. This brought censure from the [[Politics of Norway|government of Norway]], which said the Australian government failed to meet its obligations to distressed mariners under international law at the United Nations.&lt;ref name="un_general_assembly"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/spanish/aboutun/organs/ga/56/verbatim/a56pv65e.pdf |format=PDF| title=United Nations General Assembly– Fifty-sixth session | publisher=United Nations | date=27 November 2001 | accessdate=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days, the government introduced the ''Border Protection Bill''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/bpaepb2001522/ Border Protection Bill 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; into the House of Representatives, saying it would confirm Australian sovereignty to "determine who will enter and reside in Australia". The government introduced the "[[Pacific Solution]]", whereby the asylum seekers were taken to [[Nauru]] where their refugee status was considered, rather than in Australia.

==Rescue at sea==
[[File:Wallenius Wilhelmsen - MV Tampa.JPG|thumb|340px|The ''MV Tampa''.]]
In the years leading up to 2001, increasing numbers of people attempted to travel to Australia by boat to seek [[right of asylum|asylum]] as [[refugee]]s. Many of these arrived off [[Christmas Island]], an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, some 2000&amp;nbsp;km off the north-west coast of Australia and 500&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia. Hundreds of people arrived on tightly packed, unseaworthy vessels, and many paid large amounts of money to [[people smuggling|people smugglers]] for their passage to Australia.

At dawn on 24 August 2001, a 20&amp;nbsp;metre wooden [[fishing boat]], the ''Palapa 1'', with 438 (369 men, 26 women and 43 children) mainly [[Hazara people|Hazara]], became stranded in international waters about 140&amp;nbsp;km north of Christmas Island.

On 26 August, Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) Australia, which had been aware of the vessel's distress, possibly through [[Australian Coastwatch|Coastwatch]] surveillance, requested all ships in the area to respond. Of the ships that acknowledged the request, the ''Tampa'' was closest to the site and began to proceed towards the distressed ''Palapa 1''.

According to international law, survivors of a shipwreck are to be taken to the closest suitable port for medical treatment. The closest suitable port was 12 hours away in [[Merak, Banten|Merak]], Indonesia. Christmas Island was six or seven hours closer,&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] &amp; [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005). ''[[Dark Victory]]'', p 30. {{ISBN|1-74114-447-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not have the ability to receive large shipping freighters.&lt;ref name="Australians bar ship laden with Afghan refugees"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shadbolt|first=Peter|title=Australians bar ship laden with Afghan refugees|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/1338765/Australians-bar-ship-laden-with-Afghan-refugees.html|publisher=The Telegraph(UK)|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=August 2014}}

The Australian rescue authorities had been the first to become aware of the vessel's distress, and for some time attempted to contact the relevant Indonesian authorities to attend to the rescue. RCC sent a fax to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) on the night of 25 August but received no response. On Sunday, 26 August, Australian EST, the Australian embassy sent the naval attaché David Ramsay to visit BASARNAS. By this time, Australian surveillance had observed that the ship's passengers had fashioned signs that read "SOS" and 'HELP" on the ship's deck and, in response, further attempts were made to contact BASARNAS, first by fax and then through the defence attaché in Jakarta. At this time, [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|DIMA]] called RCC 'asking if vessels that respond to Australian search and rescue broadcast can tow the stranded vessel to Indonesia'.

A call to shipping was broadcast at 12:48 Canberra time: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject: Distress Relay. A 35-metre Indonesian type vessel with 80 plus persons on board adrift in the vicinity of 09.32.5 south 104.44 east… vessel has SOS and HELP written on the roof. Vessels within 10 hours report best ETA and intentions to this station.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Captain {{ill|Arne Rinnan|no}} of the ''MV Tampa'' responded to the mayday call: "We are on a voyage from [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] to Singapore via [[Sunda Strait]]… We have changed course and are headed for position of distress… Please advise further course of action. A Rinnan, Master."  After an hour of setting course for the vessel, Rinnan received a direction from RCC apparently attempting to disown the rescue operation: "Please note that Indonesian search and rescue authorities have accepted co-ordination of this incident."

The ''Tampa'' reached the vessel, guided by [[Australian Coastwatch]] [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|de Havilland Dash-8]] aircraft, at about 2 pm. The first child was lifted to safety at 2:30pm and the rescue operation continued all afternoon.

Rinnan recounted in an interview with ''Norway Today'':
{{quote |They sent a plane to direct us to the sinking boat. When we arrived it was obvious to us that it was coming apart. Several of the refugees were obviously in a bad state and collapsed when they came on deck to us. 10 to 12 of them were unconscious, several had dysentery and a pregnant woman suffered abdominal pains.}}

During the rescue, Rinnan received a call from Jakarta advising him to disembark the passengers at the ferry port of Merak, Indonesia.

About half an hour after the ''Tampa'' had set sail toward Indonesia, a delegation of five asylum seekers visited the bridge to demand passage to Australian territory, specifically [[Christmas Island]], or any western country.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] &amp; [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005). ''[[Dark Victory]]'', p 26. {{ISBN|1-74114-447-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was quite aggressive and agitated and Rinnan agreed to alter course for [[Christmas Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Tampa captain defends action |work=Lateline |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2001/s360253.htm | publisher =Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{Cite news |title=All Australia can offer is guano island |url= http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,545649,00.html |publisher=The Observer |date=2 September 2001 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed by UK newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'', Rinnan explained: "A delegation of five men came up to the bridge. They behaved aggressively and told us to go to Australia. They said they had nothing to lose."&lt;ref name=observer/&gt;

==Denial of permission to enter Australia==
The ship requested the Australian government's permission to unload the asylum seekers at Christmas Island, arguing that the ship could not sail to Indonesia, because it was unseaworthy &amp;mdash; the ship was not designed for 438 people, only its 27 crew; and there were no lifeboats or other safety equipment available for the asylum seekers in the case of an emergency. The Australian government refused permission for the ship to enter Australia's territorial waters, and threatened to prosecute Captain Arne Rinnan as a [[people smuggler]] if it did so.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] &amp; [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005). ''[[Dark Victory (book)|Dark Victory]]'', p 31. {{ISBN|1-74114-447-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian government denied any obligation under international law as Christmas Island lies within a zone designated as Indonesia's responsibility for rescue according to an agreement made in 1990 between Australia and Indonesia. Indonesia had also accepted co-ordination of the rescue, and the closest suitable port was Merak in Indonesia. The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], [[Alexander Downer]] explained to parliament that "It is important that people understand that Australia has no obligation under International law to accept the rescued persons in to Australian territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010828_qwn.html |title=Question Without Notice |publisher=Australian Government |work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |date=28 August 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909065309/http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010828_qwn.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian ambassador [[David Stuart (diplomat)|David Stuart]] said in the United Nations that "the rescue by the MV Tampa occurred outside the search and rescue region designated as being the responsibility of Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.australiaun.org/unny/il_271101.html |title=Oceans and the Law of the Sea |date=27 November 2001 |publisher=Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007095150/http://www.australiaun.org/unny/il_271101.html |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Tampa'' had responded to a broadcast by an Australian rescue agency, on 30 August, Downer stated in parliament that the survivors were picked up "at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Question Without Notice |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010830qwn.html |publisher=Australian Government |work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |date=30 August 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909064612/http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010830qwn.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with Australia's threats of prosecution, Captain Rinnan agreed to turn slowly back towards Indonesia in the hope that the asylum seekers would not notice. About half an hour into the turn, however, they did notice and again became agitated. Captain Rinnan, concerned that if the ship continued to sail to Indonesia the asylum seekers could jump overboard or riot and harm the crew, decided to head back towards Christmas Island.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] &amp; [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005). ''[[Dark Victory]]'', p. 33. {{ISBN|1-74114-447-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ship approached the boundary of Australia's territorial waters ({{convert|12|nmi|km}} from the island), Captain Rinnan pleaded for permission for the ship to dock at Christmas Island. He reported that several of the asylum seekers were unconscious, and others were suffering from [[dysentery]], statements subsequently supported by the SASR physician, but later disputed by Australian authorities. The Australian government provided medical assistance and food, but still refused permission for the ship to enter Australian territorial waters. The Australian government sent military personnel to Christmas Island, ostensibly to be ready to provide this assistance to the ship.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

On 29 August, Captain Rinnan, having lost patience with the Australian authorities, and increasingly concerned for the safety of the asylum seekers and the ship's crew, declared a state of emergency and proceeded to enter Australian territorial waters without permission. The legality of this action has been the subject of debate, with the Australian government maintaining that it was illegal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Deployment of SASR==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
The Australian government responded by dispatching Australian troops ([[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|SASR]]) led by squadron commander Major Vance Khan, under Colonel [[Gus Gilmore]], to board the ship and prevent it from approaching any closer to Christmas Island.

The SASR doctor later reported that the rescuees were generally dehydrated, malnourished and unhappy. Many were suffering from dehydration, exhaustion and minor ailments including sixty one cases of [[scabies]], forty six of [[head lice]], and twenty four of [[gastroenteritis]]. They also attended to four pregnant women.

There were some disputes between the SASR and the ship's medical officer Christian Maltau, a deck officer with limited medical experience, regarding the deployment of medical supplies from the ''Tampa'', and the use of the limited supplies of water.  In one incident, the ship's officer turned off the ship's water supply while rescuees were being washed after an outbreak of [[diarrhoea]].

Captain Rinnan anchored approximately four nautical miles off Christmas Island. Shortly afterwards the [[Australian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]], reported the boarding of the ship to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].

==Escalation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
The Australian troops instructed Captain Rinnan to move the ship back into international waters; he refused, claiming the ship was unsafe to sail until the asylum seekers had been offloaded. The ship-owners said they agreed with his decision, and the Norwegian government warned the Australian government not to seek to force the ship to return to international waters against the captain's will.

The Australian government tried to persuade Indonesia to accept the asylum seekers; Indonesia refused. Norway also refused to accept the asylum seekers and reported Australia to the United Nations, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], and the [[International Maritime Organization]] for alleged failure to obey its duties under [[international law]], though it did not ask for the assistance of these organisations.

Captain Rinnan received the highest civil honour in Norway as a result of his handling of this difficult incident. Rinnan has been a sailor since 1958, and a captain for 23 years. He said of the incident: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen most of what there is to see in this profession, but what I experienced on this trip is the worst. When we asked for food and medicine for the refugees, the Australians sent commando troops on board. This created a very high tension among the refugees. After an hour of checking the refugees, the troops agreed to give medical assistance to some of them… The soldiers obviously didn't like their mission.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Border Protection Bill 2001 ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
Late on the night of 29 August, the Prime Minister introduced an emergency bill entitled the "Border Protection Bill 2001". This Bill would have provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia (s 4), to use reasonable force to do so (s 5), to provide that any person who was on the ship may be forcibly returned to the ship (s 6), that no civil or criminal proceedings may be taken against the Australian government or any of its officers for removing the ship or returning people to it (s 7), that no court proceedings are available to prevent the ship from being removed and from people being returned to it (s 8), and that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship (s 9). The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]]. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.

The Opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] announced they would not support the bill; nor would the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], [[Australian Democrats|Democrats]] or independent Senator [[Brian Harradine]]. The bill quickly passed the lower [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but was rejected by the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] later that same sitting day.&lt;ref&gt;''Senate Debates'', 29 August 2001, p. 3566.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government attacked the Opposition for refusing to pass the legislation, but indicated it would not reintroduce it at that stage.

The government subsequently acted to excise Christmas Island and a large number of other coastal islands from Australia's migration zone, effectively meaning that any asylum seekers who did not reach the Australian mainland would not be able to apply for refugee status. The Labor party supported the excision of some islands that it viewed as acting as a "magnet for people smugglers", but not others, such as [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]], Northern Territory which it viewed as being too close to the mainland to justify excision. The other parties opposed excision of any islands.

==Political effects==
Internationally, Australia was criticised by several countries, particularly Norway, which accused it of evading its human rights responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1522723.stm Australia ships out Afghan refugees], [[BBC News]], 3 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the government's line attracted strong support, especially in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The Australian government's popularity rating rose throughout the crisis.&lt;ref name="Heinemann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hi.com.au/resource/rfactsa.asp?kla=13&amp;subtopicid=3274 |title=Tampa Crisis |work=Infobase (Atlas) |publisher=[[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann Interactive]] |accessdate=15 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821101703/http://www.hi.com.au/resource/rfactsa.asp?kla=13&amp;subtopicid=3274 |archivedate=21 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Australian federal election, 2001|federal election following the arrival of the ''Tampa'']], the Liberal Party campaigned on the issue, with John Howard's statement "we decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come."

The Australian electorate largely supported the Government. Some television news polls in Australia showed as much as 90 percent support for the Australian government's actions.&lt;ref name="Heinemann" /&gt; Many viewed the asylum seekers as "queue-jumpers" falsely claiming to be refugees, and criminals who "hijacked" the Tampa to gain [[illegal entry]] into the country. There were concerns of a security risk involving a "floodgates" where people smugglers would deliberately target Australia as a perceived "soft target". Some public commentators, including then-Minister for Defence [[Peter Reith]], suggested that groups of asylum seekers arriving by boat could harbour terrorists.&lt;ref name="ReithTerrorismSuggestion"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/minister/8tpl.cfm?CurrentId=999 |title=TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PETER REITH MP: RADIO INTERVIEW WITH DERRYN HINCH – 3AK |publisher=[[3AK]] |date=13 September 2001 |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, economist [[Ross Gittins]], a columnist at ''[[Fairfax Media]]'', said former Prime Minister John Howard had been "a tricky chap " on immigration, by appearing "tough" on [[Illegal immigration to Australia|illegal immigration]] to win support from the working class, while simultaneously winning support from employers with high legal immigration.&lt;ref name="uk2"&gt;Gittens, R. (20 August 2003). Honest John's migrant twostep. The Age. Retrieved 2 October from http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261148920.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The issue also divided the Labor Party internally, with the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Left]] [[political faction|faction]] of the party arguing strongly in favour of a "softer" approach, including the abolition of mandatory detention. The party leadership's compromise stance was pilloried by the Liberals as being wishy-washy and uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Pat Secker MP, ''House of Representatives Debates'', 24 September 2001, p. 31282&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, an unauthorised biography of John Howard claimed that he had received advice from the Attorney-General's Department that refusing the asylum seekers entry into Australia would breach international law, but that he did so to gain public support in the then upcoming election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Howard book refloats Tampa |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22116795-662,00.html |publisher=news.com.au |date=23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the refugees==
[[File:HMAS Manoora 2006.jpg|thumb|right|HMAS ''Manoora'']]
The refugees from the ''Tampa'' were loaded onto a [[Royal Australian Navy]] vessel, {{HMAS|Manoora|L 52|6}}, which transported them to the small island country of [[Nauru]], where most were held in [[Nauru detention centre|two detention camps, State House and Topside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frame |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Frame (bishop) |title=No Pleasure Cruise: the story of the Royal Australian Navy |year=2004 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=Crows Nest, NSW |isbn=1-74114-233-4 |oclc=55980812 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were eventually joined by hundreds of other asylum seekers, under Australia's "[[Pacific Solution]]". Approximately 150 people were diverted to [[New Zealand]], where they were subsequently granted asylum and progress to citizenship. In 2004, following the war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], the New Zealand government began to reunite their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.au/campaigns/refugees/still_drifting/ Australia's Pacific Solution becomes "A Pacific Nightmare"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511180833/http://www.oxfam.org.au/campaigns/refugees/still_drifting/ |date=11 May 2008 }} ''[[Oxfam]]'', August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When those refugees not claimed by New Zealand arrived on Nauru, many of them refused to leave the boat after several additional weeks on board waiting for temporary shelters to be constructed, recognising they were to be held in detention camps pending the adjudication of their cases. Those eventually found to be refugees were granted three-year [[temporary protection visa]]s, under which they could be returned to their places of origin in Afghanistan and [[Iraq]] at a time of the government's choosing.

On 23 May 2004, it was reported that most [[Afghan refugees|Afghan asylum seekers]] on Nauru recently granted refugee status were likely to be resettled in Australia. The Federal Government decided to grant refugee status to 92 Afghans detained on the Pacific island nation, while 11 applications were refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Immigration/Most-Nauru-refugees-to-be-resettled/2004/05/23/1085250860544.html Most Nauru refugees to be resettled], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 23 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Holders of a Temporary Protection Visa were not allowed multiple entrances into Australia and did not have access to the same services as normally recognised refugees (for example, free English language lessons and help with job search). Another small group was later accepted by New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Australia made direct cash payments to New Zealand for accepting those refugees it did accept.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The crew of the ''Tampa'' received the [[Nansen Refugee Award]] for 2002 from the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) for their involvement in the events.&lt;ref&gt;http://touch.vg.no/article.php?tab=list&amp;saksId=516&amp;artid=8619855{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Arne Rinnan was also named captain of the year by the shipping newspaper ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' and Nautical Institute in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2001/10/17/288581.html | title = Årets kaptein | date = 17 October 2001 | work = [[Dagbladet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Hague Institute for Global Justice''', or simply '''The Hague Institute''', was an international [[think tank]] based in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Albright-crowns-city-with-new-peace-institute.htm |title=Albright crowns city with new peace institute|accessdate=August 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144443/http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Albright-crowns-city-with-new-peace-institute.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was established in 2011 by a consortium of partners including the Municipality of The Hague, an academic coalition of Hague-based organizations and with support from the [[Dutch government]]. Independent and non-partisan, The Hague Institute focused on interdisciplinary research in three perspectives:  [[conflict prevention]], [[rule of law]], and [[global governance]].

[[Abiodun Williams]], former Senior Vice President at the [[U.S. Institute of Peace]] and former Director of Strategic Planning for UN Secretaries-General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Ban Ki-moon]], was the president of The Hague Institute.

Former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine K. Albright]] chaired the Institute’s Advisory Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxPjuObF-W8&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Madeleine Albright |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Hague Institute worked at the intersection of peace, security and justice and according to its website, “aims to contribute to, and further strengthen, the global framework for preventing and resolving conflict and promoting international peace.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-About_us&amp;pid=145 |title=About us |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Institute was supported by an Advisory Council who serve as a "strategic sounding board" for the president of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-People-Advisory_Council&amp;pid=127 |title=Advisory Council |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Abiodun Williams]] was appointed as the Institute's first president on January 1, 2013. Williams previously served as Senior Vice President of the Center for Conflict Management at the [[United States Institute of Peace]] (USIP) in [[Washington, DC|Washington, D.C]]. He was preceded by Professor [[Willem van Genugten]] who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. Professor Nico Schrijver, Academic Director of the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies at [[Leiden University]] served as the Institute's first dean between January and August 2011.

==Work==
The work of The Hague Institute was organized around three programs - Conflict Prevention, Rule of Law, and Global Governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-Our_Work&amp;pid=147 |title=Our Work |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and covered a wide range of issues including [[R2P]], education and conflict, climate change, water diplomacy, cyber security, mass atrocities, illicit financial flows and the role of institutions and governance such as the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[transitional justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs&amp;pid=180 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Institute's website, The Hague Institute provided policy-relevant research, practitioner training and convenes actors from various areas of expertise to facilitate dialogue and stimulate knowledge sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-About_us&amp;pid=147 |title=Our Work |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects===

====Commission on Global Security, Justice &amp; Governance====

The Hague Institute and the [[Stimson Center]], based in Washington, DC gathered "a select group of eminent statespersons and public intellectuals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=43&amp;progid=3&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address global threats and challenges related to fragile states, climate change and the cyber-economy. The Commission, later renamed as the [[Albright-Gambari Commission]], convened consultations online and around the world to facilitate a report which complements the UN Post-2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] agenda, the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, the Fourth Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, and the UN Conference on Parties on Climate Change in [[Paris]].

====The Hague Approach====

The Hague Approach was intended a flagship project of The Hague Institute. It comprises "six guiding principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Approach:__What_is_it&amp;pid=138&amp;id=121#.UkGfdsanovQ |title=The Hague Approach: What is it? &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the Institute presented The Hague Approach Principles during the [[Peace Palace]] centenary to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-News_Archives-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=159&amp;id=124&amp;jaar=2013 |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; News Archives |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Governance Reform Initiative====

The Global Governance Reform Initiative tackled issues in cyberspace, migration, and oceans. The initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors (government, civil society, international organizations, and business) and geographical regions to address pressing issues in global governance collectively. A three-day conference titled ''The Future of Cyber Governance'' convened in May 2014 and launched the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Future_of_Cyber_Governance&amp;pid=138&amp;id=236 |title=The Future of Cyber Governance &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Diplomacy Consortium (WDC)====

The Water Diplomacy Consortium combined expertise from five Netherlands-based organizations to serve as a “global hub” to exchange knowledge and experience in water technology and water governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/7134-stockholm-water-week-new-platform-addresses-conflicting-claims-over-fresh-water-use.html |title=Stockholm water week: New platform addresses conflicting claims over fresh water use |publisher=Dutchwatersector.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute served as the lead partner of the WDC which also includes [[Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael]], Water Governance Centre, [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, and [[UPEACE]].

====Knowledge Platform Security &amp; Rule of Law====

Consisting of a network of experts and practitioners, the Knowledge Platform focused on building “security and rule of law” in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |title=Our Work|accessdate=September 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124228/http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was originally launched in late spring 2012 by [[Ben Knapen]], former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and International Cooperation. The Hague Institute served as the primary facilitator for the platform’s partners including the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]].

===Public Discussions===

The Institute organized events and conferences to analyze a broad scope of issues related to conflict prevention, transitional justice, global security and international relations. Expert round tables aim to facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing. The Institute has welcomed Deputy Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] [[Jan Eliasson]], Jurist [[James Crawford (jurist)|James Crawford]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navi Pillay]], [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court|Chief Prosecutor of the ICC]] [[Fatou Bensouda]] and United Nations Special Adviser on the [[Responsibility to Protect]] (R2P) [[Jennifer Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-Whats_Next_for_R2P_Dr_Jennifer_Welsh_on_the_Responsibility_to_Protect&amp;pid=138&amp;id=303 |title=What's Next for R2P?

In November 2013, the Institute launched the "Distinguished Speaker Series." The lecture series invites high-level international experts to discuss topics affecting global progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=33&amp;progid=4&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Joschka Fischer]], [[Jim Stavridis]], [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], [[Edi Rama]] and [[Miroslav Lajčák]].

To "stimulate debate about the current course and future trajectory of Dutch foreign policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Effectiveness_of_Dutch_Foreign_Policy:__Defense_and_Development&amp;pid=138&amp;id=204 |title=The Effectiveness of Dutch Foreign Policy: Defense and Development &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute gathered leading officials in Dutch government for a series of "Inside View" debates focused on the effectiveness of Dutch foreign policy. On September 10, 2013, the series launched with former Dutch political directors from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]] exploring the Netherlands' role in international relations, within the EU and at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkingpolitics.org/2013/09/13/part-i-panel-discussion-on-the-effectiveness-of-dutch-foreign-policy/ |title=Part I: Herman Schaper: The loss of domestic consensus on foreign policy and its consequences |publisher=Thinkingpolitics.org |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series continued with former Permanent Representatives to the United Nations on October 24, 2013 and concluded on December 11, 2013 with former Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands addressing present and future challenges of Dutch international relations.

In June 2014, the Institute, in cooperation with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and the National Security Archive at [[George Washington University]], convened 35 officials and eyewitnesses for a multi-day conference on the Rwanda Genocide. The event was based on the 'critical oral history' approach. Participants included [[Ibrahim Gambari]], [[Henry Kwami Anyidoho]], Lord [[David Hannay, Baron Hannay of Chiswick|David Hannay]], [[Prudence Bushnell]], [[Michael N. Barnett]] and Lieutenant-General [[Roméo Dallaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/world/africa/un-cables-reveal-a-turning-point-in-rwanda-crisis.html|title=UN cables Reveal a Turning Point in Rwanda Crisis|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Hague Institute's experts and programs produced a variety publications based on research and analysis on a scope of issues affecting global justice. These publications aimed to inform policymakers, academics, experts and the general public. In June 2014, the Institute launched a working paper series to complement its existing publication series of Policy Briefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179#policybriefs |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Commentary&amp;pid=174 |title=Recent Commentary |doi=10.1017/S0020589314000438 |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working paper series aimed to "contribute original research of the highest quality to scholarly and policy debates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179 |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working papers addressed [[just war theory]], sanctions against [[Iran]] and the relationship between constitutional law and [[global governance]].

In August 2013, the Institute published ''The Hague Approach Principles,'' six principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations, and a comparative study of rule of law efforts in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] titled, ''Promoting the Rule of Law in Peacebuilding: Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq''. Both publications, based on empirical evidence, were presented at the centennial celebrations of the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=138&amp;id=124#.UjmtQsanovQ |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Approach Principles have subsequently been endorsed by current and former UN and global leaders including San-Hyun Song, Judy Cheng-Hopkins and [[Jan Eliasson]].

The Hague Institute produced a biannual magazine called ''Intersections'', which highlighted activities of the Institute and featured columns from public figures working at the intersection of peace, security and global justice issues. Previous contributors to the magazine include, [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Michael Kirby (judge)]], [[Fatou Bensouda]] and [[Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert]]. The magazine was published biannually.

== Alleged mismanagement at The Hague Institute for Global Justice ==
On January 1, 2013 Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president. He was preceded by Professor [[Willem van Genugten]] who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. In an article by Dutch magazine [[De Groene Amsterdammer]] (4th April 2018), sources told the magazine that Williams insisted that the position of 'international dean' had to be restyled as 'president', in addition to a very high financial compensation package in order to lend him greater authority and benefits. &lt;ref name="groene"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/he-just-didn-t-seem-to-care|title=Hoe het Haagse Institute for Global Justice 20 miljoen subsidie verspeelde|work=De Groene Amsterdammer|access-date=2018-04-04|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch government granted up to 20 million Euros in subsidies for the Institute. According to staff members, Williams neglected fund raising, and spent considerable amounts of Institute funds on questionable expenses such as first class airfare, 5-star hotel rooms and long taxi rides not visibly related to the Institute's business, a claim confirmed by accounting firms. Furthermore, according to a reconstruction by Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krant.volkskrant.nl/?code=ST-725912-lg2Pi2ZtUBH224zGAop3-caps.volkskrant.nl&amp;state=paperId(90247),zone(NL)#/paper|title=de Volkskrant Krant Online|website=krant.volkskrant.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Williams spent thousands of euros on expensive lunches at the nearby Carlton Ambassador hotel and first class flights since 'cattle class' was not good enough for him. A senior researcher quoted in the article indicates that there were many clashes between employees and Williams. According to the researcher citied, Williams distanced himself from staff whenever he felt challenged: 'Like it was beneath his dignity to talk to me directly. There was a culture clash. We academics are egalitarian. Though he was very focused on hierarchy and quickly felt criticized.'&lt;ref name="groene" /&gt; 

Reports claim his financial mismanagement eventually led to his departure in December 2016.  In 2013, for instance, Williams claimed 10,205.50 Euro for taxi rides, including a short trip of less than a kilometer from his home to the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, which amounted to 321 Euro. On 29 October he also took a cab to Groningen costing 722.25 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;Irene van der Linde and Tjitske Lingsma, "The Death of a White Elephant," International Justice Tribune, 6 April 2018, https://www.justicetribune.com/articles/death-white-elephant-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, another organization based in The Hague, the Center for International Legal Cooperation, considered a 'structural cooperation' out of a sense of responsibility for the loss of the subsidized funds. After viewing the financial documents, the CILC was startled by the 'deplorable situation'. Allegedly, Williams was seen behind the paper shredder for hours before his departure, which documents in question were destroyed is unclear.&lt;ref name="vk1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/geldnood-nekt-prestigieuze-haagse-denktank-toezichthouder-greep-te-laat-in~a4588737/|title=Geldnood nekt prestigieuze Haagse denktank, toezichthouder greep te laat in|last=Koelé|first=Theo|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;Anton Nijssen, Williams' close associate for a long time, has been appointed by the Supervisory Board as' liquidator 'who has to take care of' the (financial) handling of cases'. There are numerous creditors, including the former landlord VNG and the Indisch Herinneringscentrum, which last year already moved into the spacious building in The Hague where the last researcher of the Hague Institute for Global Justice left just before Easter. Williams’ mismanagement is said to have been the main reason for the subsequent failure of the institute.&lt;ref name="vk1" /&gt;

Following the reports of the alleged mismanagement, the topic was raised in the Dutch parliament where several political parties posed questions to the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate, [[Eric Wiebes]]. Willem Moorlag from the Dutch socialist party [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] asked the minister whether there is any judicial ground to recover the lost funds from Williams and/or the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/kamervragen/detail?id=2018Z06289&amp;did=2018D23370|title=De frauduleuze ondergang van het The Hague Institute for Global Justice|website=www.tweedekamer.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum voor Democratie]] (FvD) asked the minister why no action was undertaken against Williams when it was already clear after several months that he didn't fulfill his role as funds raiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-tk-2018Z06381.html|title=Het financiële fiasco rondom het Haagse Institute for Global Justice (IGJ)|last=Staten-Generaal|first=Tweede Kamer der|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Paternotte from the social liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]] asked the minister how it was possible that the Institute still received subsidies after a critical report by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse Coopers]] exposed the financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/algemeen/5206955/d66-pvda-en-fvd-willen-opheldering-geldverkwisting-haagse-denktank.html|title=D66, PvdA en FvD willen opheldering over 'geldverkwisting' Haagse denktank {{!}} NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=www.nu.nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In April 2018, The Hague Institute for Global Justice closed down after becoming insolvent, reportedly caused by poor leadership from President Abiodun Williams, serious mismanagement, and lack of proper oversight of President Williams by the Advisory Board led by Dick Benschop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2018/04/the-hague-global-justice-institute-closes-due-to-lack-of-funding/ The Hague global justice institute closes due to lack of funding]; Dutchnews.nl; 4 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''unring the bell''' is an [[analogy]] used to suggest the difficulty of forgetting information once it is known.  When discussing [[trial jury|jury trial]]s, the phrase is sometimes  used to describe the judge's instructions to the jury to ignore [[admissible evidence|inadmissible]] evidence or statements they have heard. It may also be used if inadmissible evidence has been brought before a jury and the judge subsequently declares a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].

Commenting on [[truTV|Court TV]] about the pre-trial release of nearly 200 pages of documents from a hearing on the sexual activities of the accuser in the [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case]], [[jury research|jury consultant]] Idgi D'Andrea said, "It's really hard to unring the bell, once that bell has been rung, and ask people to forget what they've heard."&lt;ref name= "COURTTV"&gt;
[http://www.courttv.com/trials/bryant/082404_jurors_ap.html Bryant lawyers seek best-suited jurors from diverse pool]&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent case, judge [[Reggie Walton]] said that he could not "unring the bell" when he declared a mistrial in the [[Roger Clemens]] perjury trial.&lt;ref name=CNNJ&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-14/justice/us.clemens.mistrial_1_clemens-perjury-case-attorney-steven-durham-laura-pettitte?_s=PM:CRIME Video triggers mistrial in Clemens perjury case], CNN.com, July 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Oregon v. Rader==
One of the earliest reported legal references to unringing a bell can be found in the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] case ''State v. Rader'', 62 Ore. 37; 124 P. 195, argued on  May 9, 1912, decided on May 28, 1912.

In that case, the defendant, Frederick Rader, indicted as Fritz Rader, was tried and convicted of the crime of [[arson]] for allegedly burning two [[hay]]stacks. The prosecution’s theory was that Rader did so in retaliation for the victim’s reporting another crime (that Rader had cut off the tail of one of the victim’s cows). At trial, the victim was permitted to testify concerning Rader's alleged tail-cutting. The court ruled that improper testimony had been admitted and it constituted a reversible error. [[Thomas A. McBride|Chief Justice McBride]] noted (at p.&amp;nbsp;40):
&lt;blockquote&gt;While in some cases an express instruction to the jury to disregard testimony injuriously admitted is properly held to cure the error, yet the courts are cautious in the application of this rule. It is not an easy task to unring a bell, nor to remove from the mind an impression once firmly imprinted there, and the withdrawal of the testimony should be so emphatic as to leave no doubt in the mind of the juror as to the unequivocal repudiation by the court of the erroneously admitted matter, and even then, in a case where the testimony is evenly balanced or contradictory, courts hesitate to sanction such withdrawal, though it seems absolutely necessary to permit this course in some instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In USA v. Lowis==
The phrase also appears several times in the ruling of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] in the case USA v Lowis, 174 F.3d 881, 885 (7th Cir. 1999).  Gary Lowis was arrested for possession of [[amphetamine]] and [[marijuana]].  Between that arrest and the subsequent trial, he was arrested a second time on similar charges.  Before trial in [[United States district court|United States District Court]] on the first arrest, the judge granted a defense [[Motion to suppress|motion to exclude]] evidence of the second arrest.  However, during testimony a police witness quoted a statement made by Lowis after the second arrest.  The judge later instructed the jury to disregard that portion of the evidence.&lt;ref name= "USALOWIS"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=7th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=982727 U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, USA v LOWIS]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lowis [[appeal]]ed his subsequent conviction, arguing, among other things, that the statements were so prejudicial to him that in spite of the judge's best efforts in instructing the jury to disregard that evidence, as a practical matter it was impossible to "unring the bell."  Addressing the evidence admitted in error, the appeals court wrote that that evidence was "not a very loud bell" and the judge's instructions to the jury were adequate to "unring" it.  Lowis' conviction was upheld.

In its ruling in USA v Lowis, the appeals court provides some background and mentions a few other phrases (citations removed):&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Unring the bell" is a good analogy which can save a lot of words in making the point. That phrase originated, as far as we can find, in Sandez v. United States [1956], and was elaborated on in Dunn v. United States, which added other pertinent analogies. "After the thrust of the saber it is difficult to forget the wound," was another, and then the most colorful one of all, "If you throw a skunk into the jury box, you can't instruct the jury not to smell it."  In the present case there was no skunk thrown in the jury box. As also mentioned in Dunn, "Trials are rarely, if ever, perfect, but gross imperfections should not go unnoticed."  We find no gross imperfections which would overpower the district court's instruction to the jury to disregard Lowis' statement.&lt;ref&gt;https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1068454.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14238">'''Visiting Forces Act''' is a title often given to laws governing the status of [[military personnel]] while they are visiting within areas under the jurisdiction of another country and/or while forces of one country are attached to or serving with forces of another country.

The law may also apply to some foreign non-military persons who are associated with visiting [[military forces]] (e.g., [[dependents]], [[civilian]] [[employees]], etc.). Such laws commonly address such issues as [[criminal jurisdiction]], treatment of apprehended individuals found to be foreign military personnel who are [[Absent without leave#AWOL: Absent Without Official Leave|absent without leave]] or [[Desertion|military deserters]], [[double jeopardy]] situations, etc. Individual laws enacted by individual governments may address such issues directly, or may act as enabling legislation so that separate [[visiting forces agreement]]s between a host country and other countries may attain the force of law. Depending on the legislative climate in the host country, such enabling legislation may or may not be necessary.

==Specific countries==

Following are some examples of laws relating to visiting forces in various countries:

===Antigua and Barbuda===
The Visiting Forces Act of 2007 would define the status of foreign forces visiting Antigua and Barbuda).  Section 7 of that Act provides that a service court of a visiting force has the primary right to exercise jurisdiction in relation to an alleged commission by a member of the visiting force or a dependent of an offense in respect of (a) the property or security of the designated state; or
(b) the person or property of another member of the visiting force or a dependent. This act is presently{{clarify timeframe|date=February 2015}} embodied in a bill is pending enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===United Kingdom===
The [[Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act 1933]] was an act to make provision with respect to forces of His Majesty from other parts of the British Commonwealth when visiting the United Kingdom or a colony; with respect to the exercise of command and discipline when forces of His Majesty from different parts of the Commonwealth are serving together; with respect to the attachment of members of one such force to another such force, and with respect to deserters from such forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Allied Forces Act 1940]] enabled visiting Allied forces to conduct courts martial, but did not provide immunity from ordinary criminal law. There was a single exception, as the [[United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942]] gave members of the United States naval and military forces immunity in United Kingdom courts. That remained the position until the aforementioned acts were repealed by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]].&lt;ref name=AFDB&gt;{{cite web

The [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]] was passed to incorporate the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement into United Kingdom law. SOFA provides a basis for a mutual and reciprocal system of exemptions, immunities and privileges for visiting forces when exercising or stationed in a host country. A major feature of SOFA, which is implemented by the 1952 Act, is the question of jurisdiction for dealing with offences committed by visiting servicemen, civil servants accompanying a force, dependents and contractors. Its main provision is the agreement that the visiting force will retain jurisdiction for its people, which applies equally to United States personnel based in the United Kingdom and British forces serving in NATO countries, Commonwealth countries and, more recently, those countries that have signed up to the NATO partnership for peace.&lt;ref name=AFDB/&gt; Usually, the service authorities for the visiting force member alleged to have committed an offence and the United Kingdom authorities will be able to agree which jurisdiction is appropriate to deal with the case. If agreement is not reached the decision as to jurisdiction will be referred to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]. Where United Kingdom jurisdiction is appropriate the visiting forces case will normally be dealt with locally unless other criteria require the case to be dealt with by Crown Prosecution Service headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
