      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10482">'''Allen J. Frantzen''' (born 1947 or 1948)&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt; is an American [[Medieval studies|medievalist]] with a specialization in [[Old English literature]]. Since retiring from [[Loyola University Chicago]], he has been an [[emeritus professor]].

==Education and career==
Frantzen grew up in rural [[Iowa]] and earned a degree in English from [[Loras College]]&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allenfrantzen.com/ |title=About Allen Frantzen |website=Allen Frantzen.com |accessdate=December 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a PhD from the [[University of Virginia]] with a dissertation on the literature of [[penance]] in the Anglo-Saxon period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraprod.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:10627 |author=Frantzen, Allen J, Department of English, University of Virginia |title=The keys of heaven: penance, penitentials, and the literature of early medieval England |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] Library |accessdate=December 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a faculty member at Loyola University Chicago from 1978 until his retirement in 2014,&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite news |author=Rio Fernandes |url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Prominent-Medieval-Scholar-s/235014 |title=Prominent Medieval Scholar’s Blog on 'Feminist Fog' Sparks an Uproar |newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=January 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was named an emeritus professor. While there he headed the graduate programs in English from 1984 to 1988 and in 1992 founded the Loyola Community Literacy Center, which is open to the community as well as to students at the university.&lt;ref name=literacy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luc.edu/literacy/allenjfrantzen/ |title=English Tutoring at the Literacy Center |publisher=[[Loyola University Chicago]] |accessdate=December 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Frantzen has published introductory works intended for students, such as ''King Alfred'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review:''King Alfred'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Daniel Donoghue |journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] |volume=64 |issue=2 |date=April 1989 |pages=425–27 |doi=10.2307/2851970 |jstor=2851970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{'}}Troilus and Criseyde': The Poem and the Frame'' (1993) on [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''{{'}}Troilus and Criseyde': The Poem and the Frame'' by Allen J.

Servitude, Slavery, and Labor in Medieval England'' (1994) with Douglas Moffat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''The Work of Work. Servitude, Slavery, and Labor in Medieval England'' by Allen J. Frantzen, Douglas Moffat |author=David A. E. Pelteret |journal=[[The English Historical Review]] |volume=111 |issue=444 |date=November 1996 |pages=1235–36 |jstor=575870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''The Work of Work: Servitude, Slavery, and Labor in Medieval England'' by Allen J.

His first book was on the subject-matter of his dissertation, ''The Literature of Penance in Anglo-Saxon England'' (1983);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''The Literature of Penance in Anglo-Saxon England'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Paul E. Szarmach |journal=Speculum |volume=63 |issue=2 |date=April 1988 |pages=392–94 |doi=10.2307/2853247 |jstor=2853247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Review: ''The Literature of Penance in Anglo-Saxon England'' by Allen J.

Regan |journal=[[The Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |volume=83 |issue=4 |date=October 1984 |pages=553–57 |jstor=27709401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to the Anglo-Saxon penitential literature in ''Before the Closet: Same-Sex Love from 'Beowulf' to 'Angels in America{{'}}'' (1998), in which, himself a gay man,&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt; he argues that contrary to [[John Boswell]]'s argument, same-sex relations were not tolerated more by the Church before the [[Norman Conquest]], but rather the relationships were not "closeted"; he takes what he calls a "legitimist" rather than a "liberationist" view of the textual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Before the Closet: Same-Sex Love from 'Beowulf' to 'Angels in America{{'}}'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Susan M. Kim |journal=[[Modern Philology]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |date=August 2002 |pages=60–63 |jstor=1215583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Before the Closet: Same-Sex Love from 'Beowulf' to 'Angels in America{{'}}'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Michael W. Twomey |journal=Speculum |volume=77 |issue=1 |date=January 2002 |pages=174–76 |doi=10.2307/2903822 |jstor=2903822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Before the Closet. Same-Sex Love from 'Beowulf' to 'Angels in America{{'}}'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Frank Field |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=115 |issue=460 |date=February 2000 |pages=266–67 |jstor=579553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been described as "groundbreaking".&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt;

Frantzen has also published critiques of the field of Old English studies: ''Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition'' (1990), a study of the history of the field, and ''Speaking Two Languages: Traditional Disciplines and Contemporary Theory in Medieval Studies'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition'' by Allen J. Frantzen; ''Speaking Two Languages: Traditional Disciplines and Contemporary Theory in Medieval Studies'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Debra Magai Dove |journal=South Atlantic Review |volume=57 |issue=2 |date=May 1992 |pages=93–95 |doi=10.2307/3200220 |jstor=3200220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former, in which Frantzen argues that Anglo-Saxon studies are increasingly regarded as hidebound because of the insular approach within the field, attracted much notice. [[Fred C. Robinson]] wrote that it "should be read by all medievalists who care about their profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition''. by Allen J. Frantzen |author=[[Fred C. Robinson]] |journal=Speculum |volume=68 |issue=4 |date=October 1993 |pages=1119–21 |doi=10.2307/2865535 |jstor=2865535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Frantzen was the keynote speaker at a conference at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] that was published as ''Anglo-Saxonism and the Construction of Social Identity'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Anglo-Saxonism and the Construction of Social Identity'' by  Allen J. Frantzen, John D. Niles |author=Craig R. Davis |journal=[[The Modern Language Review]] |volume=95 |issue=3 |date=July 2000 |pages=790–91 |doi=10.2307/3735503 |jstor=3735503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bloody Good: Chivalry, Sacrifice, and the Great War'' (2004) he studied the mythology of [[chivalry]] and of ''[[Imitation of Christ|imitatio Christi]]'' as motivations for participants in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Bloody Good: Chivalry, Sacrifice, and the Great War'' by Allen J. Frantzen |author=Jeanne Fox-Friedman |journal=[[Arthuriana]] |volume=14 |issue=4 |date=Winter 2004 |pages=86–88 |jstor=27870663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: ''Bloody Good: Chivalry, Sacrifice, and the Great War'' by Allen J.

After his retirement, Frantzen wrote a blog post dated September 2015 titled "How to Fight Your Way Out of the Feminist Fog" in which he aligned himself with the [[men's rights movement]] against what he argued were the anti-man demands of [[feminist]]s; this provoked disapproving responses from medievalists after it was publicized in early 2016.&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David M.

'''The Arts Council Collection''' is a national loan collection of modern and contemporary British Art. It was founded in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/15/arts-council-collection-announces-70th-anniversary-commissions|title=Arts Council Collection announces 70th anniversary commissions|last=correspondent|first=Mark Brown Arts|date=2016-01-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Collection continues to acquire works each year. The Arts Council Collection reaches its audience through loans to public institutions, touring exhibitions, digital and outreach projects. The Collection supports artists based in the UK through the purchase and display of their work, safeguarding it.

==Details==
The Arts Council Collection has nearly 8000 works by more than 2000 artists&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/21/arts.artsnews|title=Website opens up discreet Arts Council Collection|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|date=21 December 2006|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=30 November 2017|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes important examples by prominent British artists. Operating as a ‘museum without walls’, it is widely circulated and can be seen in museums and galleries across the UK and internationally. The Arts Council Collection also lends to public buildings, including universities, hospitals and charitable associations.

The Collection includes works by [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Lucian Freud]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Victor Pasmore]], [[David Hockney]], [[Bridget Riley]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]], [[Antony Gormley]], [[Mark Wallinger]], [[Peter Doig]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Damien Hirst]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Rachel Whiteread]], [[Chris Ofili]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]], [[Mona Hatoum]], [[Tracey Emin]], [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Grayson Perry]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt; [[Glenn Brown (artist)|Glenn Brown]], [[Jeremy Deller]], [[Keith Coventry]] and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]].

As a collection ‘without walls’, it has no permanent gallery; however, changing displays of sculpture, video and installations from the Arts Council Collection are regularly on view at [[Longside Gallery]] at Yorkshire Sculpture Park. As well as lending extensively to museums and galleries across the UK and abroad, the Collection can be seen in a regular programme of touring exhibitions  - past exhibitions include ''Unpopular Culture: Grayson Perry curates the Arts Council Collection; No Such Thing as Society; Uncommon Ground: Land Art in Britain 1966 -1979'' and ''Kaleidoscope: Colour and Sequence in 1960s British Art.''

== History of the Collection ==
Since 1986, the Arts Council Collection has been managed by the [[Hayward Gallery]],&lt;ref name="guardian-higgins" /&gt;&lt;!-- This source says 1987 --&gt; [[South Bank Centre]] on behalf of [[Arts Council England]] and is based at the Hayward Gallery in [[London]] and at Longside Gallery at Yorkshire Sculpture Park.

== Acquisitions process ==
Every year the Arts Council Collection acquires work through an annual acquisitions process. Acquisitions are made through a committee of eight individuals: four internal and four external. The external advisers to the Acquisitions Committee usually include an artist, a writer and a curator, and are appointed for a fixed two-year tenure, alongside representatives from National Partners Programme venues who have a shorter, one-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artlyst.com/news/arts-council-collection-unveils-list-works-acquired-nation/|title=Arts Council Collection Unveils 2017 List Of Works Acquired For The Nation - Artlyst|work=Artlyst|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legislature}}

A '''bicameral''' [[legislature]] divides the legislators into two separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], chambers, or houses. '''Bicameralism''' is distinguished from [[unicameralism]], in which all members deliberate and vote as a single group, and from some legislatures that have three or more separate assemblies, chambers, or houses. {{as of|2015}}, fewer than half the world's national legislatures are bicameral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IPU PARLINE database: Structure of parliaments|url = http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/ParliamentsStructure.asp?REGION=All&amp;LANG=ENG|website = www.ipu.org|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the members of the two chambers are elected or selected by different methods, which vary from country to country. This can often lead to the two chambers having very different compositions of members.

[[Enactment of a bill|Enactment]] of [[primary legislation]] often requires a [[concurrent majority]] – the approval of a majority of members in each of the chambers of the legislature. When this is the case, the legislature may be called an example of '''perfect bicameralism.''' However, in many [[Westminster system]] parliaments, the house to which the executive is [[Responsible government|responsible]] can overrule the other house and may be regarded as an example of '''imperfect bicameralism'''. Some legislatures lie in between these two positions, with one house only able to overrule the other under certain circumstances.

==History of bicameral legislatures==
[[File:Casas del Parlamento. Palacio de Westminster - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Westminster]], seat of the UK Parliament]]
[[File:12-07-13-washington-by-RalfR-10.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Capitol]], seat of Congress]]

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] favoured a bicameral legislature. The idea was to have the Senate be wealthier and wiser. Benjamin Rush saw this though, and noted that "this type of dominion is almost always connected with opulence". The Senate was created to be a stabilising force, elected not by mass electors, but selected by the State legislators. Senators would be more knowledgeable and more deliberate—a sort of republican nobility—and a counter to what [[James Madison|Madison]] saw as the "fickleness and passion" that could absorb the House.&lt;ref name="HG1"&gt;[http://archives.democrats.rules.house.gov/Archives/jcoc2br.htm The Constitutional Background - House of Representatives archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

He noted further that "The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness, with more system and with more wisdom, than the popular branch." Madison's argument led the Framers to grant the Senate prerogatives in foreign policy, an area where steadiness, discretion, and caution were deemed especially important.&lt;ref name="HG1"/&gt; State legislators chose the Senate, and senators had to possess significant property to be deemed worthy and sensible enough for the position. In 1913, the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]] passed, which mandated choosing Senators by popular vote rather than State legislatures.&lt;ref name="HG1"/&gt;

As part of the [[Great Compromise]], they{{who|date=November 2018}} invented a new rationale for bicameralism in which the Senate had states represented equally, and the House had them represented by population.

The British Parliament is often referred to as the ''[[Mother of Parliaments]]'' (in fact a misquotation of [[John Bright]], who remarked in 1865 that "England is the Mother of Parliaments") because the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its [[Act of Parliament|Act]]s have created many other parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seidle|first1=F. Leslie|last2=Docherty|first2=David C.|title=Reforming parliamentary democracy|date=2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=9780773525085|page=3|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i6je60BF-3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British "three-tier" model. Most countries in Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial [[head of state]] who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house, and a smaller upper house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004151745|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for bicameralism and criticism==
{{Quote|text=A formidable sinister interest may always obtain the complete command of a dominant assembly by some chance and for a moment, and it is therefore of great use to have a second chamber of an opposite sort, differently composed, in which that interest in all likelihood will not rule.|author=[[Walter Bagehot]]|source="The English Constitution", in Norman St John-Stevas, ed., ''The Collected Works of Walter Bagehot'', London, The Economist, vol. 5, pp. 273–274.}}

There have been a number of rationales put forward in favour of bicameralism, federal states have often adopted it, and the solution remains popular when regional differences or sensitivities require more explicit representation, with the second chamber representing the constituent states. Nevertheless, the older justification for second chambers—providing opportunities for second thoughts about legislation—has survived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Growing awareness of the complexity of the notion of representation and the multifunctional nature of modern legislatures may be affording incipient new rationales for second chambers, though these do generally remain contested institutions in ways that first chambers are not. An example of political controversy regarding a second chamber has been the debate over the powers of the [[Senate of Canada]] or the election of the [[Senate of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010132156-senat-le-triomphe-de-l-anomalie Liberation.fr], Sénat, le triomphe de l'anomalie&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the two chambers varies; in some cases, they have equal power, while in others, one chamber is clearly superior in its powers. The first tends to be the case in federal systems and those with presidential governments. The latter tends to be the case in unitary states with [[parliamentary system]]s.

There are two streams of thought: Critics believe bicameralism makes meaningful political reforms more difficult to achieve and increases the risk of gridlock—particularly in cases where both chambers have similar powers—while proponents argue the merits of the "[[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]]" provided by the bicameral model, which they believe help prevent the passage into law of ill-considered legislation.

==Communication between houses==
Formal communication between houses is by various methods, including:&lt;ref name="Odgers"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_21#h02 |chapter=Chapter 21: Relations with the House of Representatives  |publisher=Parliament of Australia |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice |edition=14th |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sending messages: Formal notices, such as of [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s or the passing of bills, usually done in writing, via the [[Clerk (legislature)|clerk]] and [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of each house
;Transmission: of bills or amendment to bills requiring agreement from the other house
;[[Joint session]]: a [[plenary session]] of both houses at the same time and place.
;[[Joint committee]]s: which may be formed by committees of each house agreeing to join, or by joint resolution of each house
;Conferences:Conferences of the Houses of the English (later British) Parliament met in the [[Painted Chamber]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="Jones2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Clyve|year=2014|title=Accommodation in the Painted Chamber for Conferences between the Lords and the Commons from 1600 to 1834|journal=Parliamentary History|volume=33|issue=2|pages=342–357|issn=0264-2824|doi=10.1111/1750-0206.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically there were a distinction between an "ordinary conference" and a "free conference"; an ordinary conference in the British Parliament was last held in 1860 as the elaborate procedure was replaced by the simpler sending of messages. A "free conference" meets in private to resolve a dispute; it is organised by managers appointed by each house who report back to it. The last free conference at Westminster was in 1836 on an amendment to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]];&lt;ref&gt;Blayden 2017 p.6; {{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1836/aug/11/free-conference-municipal-corporations|title=Free Conference—Municipal Corporations' Act Amendment (, )|date=11 August 1836|work=Hansard|pages=HC Deb vol 35 cc1125–7 |nopp=Y|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the previous one was in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Blayden 2017 p.6; {{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol25/pp518-526|title=Managers for the Free Conference, on the Bill to prevent Commerce with Spain.|date=22–24 April 1740|work=House of Lords Journal|publisher=British History Online|pages=Volume 25, pp.518–526 |nopp=Y |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of Australia]] there have been two formal conferences, in 1930 and 1931, but many informal conferences.&lt;ref name="Odgers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlaydenPLPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aspg.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/BlaydenPLPP-Research-Essay-Free-Conferences-in-New-South-Wales.pdf|title=Do free conferences have a place in the present-day NSW Parliament?|last=Blayden|first=Lynsey|date=September 2017|publisher=Australasian Study of Parliament Group|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007}} the "Conference of Managers" remains the usual procedure for dispute resolution in the [[Parliament of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crump|first=Rick|date=Spring 2007|title=Why the conference procedure remains the preferred method for resolving disputes between the two houses of the South Australian Parliament|journal=Australasian Parliamentary Review|volume=22|issue=2|pages=120–136 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.611.7131&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] in 2011, the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] requested a free conference with the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] over a bill on graffiti; after a year the Council refused, describing the mechanism as archaic and inappropriate.&lt;ref name="BlaydenPLPP"/&gt; The [[United States Congress]] has [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]]s to resolve discrepancies between House and Senate versions of a bill. The number of conference reports produced by such committees fell from 67 in the [[104th Congress]] (1995–96) to 3 in the [[113th Congress]] (2013–14).

==Types==

===Federal===
Some countries, such as [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[United States]], link their bicameral systems to their [[federation|federal]] political structure.

In the United States, Australia, and Mexico, for example, each state is given the same number of seats in one of the houses of the legislature, despite variance in the population of each state — it is designed to ensure that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger states, which may have more representation in the other house of the legislature.

====Canada====
[[File:Mosaika display, Centre Block, Parliament Hill.jpeg|right|thumb|The federal bicameral [[Parliament of Canada]], which contains a [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] and a [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]]]
In Canada, the country as a whole is divided into a number of [[Canadian Senate Divisions|Senate Divisions]], each with a different number of Senators, based on a number of factors. These Divisions are [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada|Western Provinces]], and [[the Maritimes]], each with 24 Senators, [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], each with 1 Senator, and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has 6 Senators, making for a total of 105 Senators.

Senators in Canada are not elected by the people but are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]. The Senate does not originate most legislation (although a small fraction of government bills are introduced in the Senate and Senators may introduce [[private members' bills]] in the same way as MPs) but acts as a chamber of revision almost always passing legislation approved by the House of Commons, made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are elected. The Senate must pass legislation before it becomes law and can therefore act as a wise facilitator or engage in filibuster. The Senate does not have to endure the accountability and scrutiny of parliamentary elections. Therefore, the bicameral structure of Canadian parliament is more ''[[de jure]]'' than ''[[de facto]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Australia====
[[File:Parliament House - panoramio (7).jpg|right|thumb|The federal bicameral [[Parliament of Australia]], which contains a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a [[Australian Senate|Senate]]]]
The bicameral [[Parliament of Australia]] consists of two Houses, the [[lower house]] is called the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[upper house]] is named the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. The lower house currently consists of 150 members, each elected from single member constituencies, known as [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|electoral divisions]] (commonly referred to as "electorates" or "seats") using full-preference [[Instant-runoff voting]]. This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House to gain and hold power.

The upper house, the Senate, is also popularly elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]]. There are a total of 76 senators: 12 senators are elected from each of the six [[Australian state]]s (regardless of population) and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]).

Unlike upper houses in most [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary systems]], the Australian Senate is vested with significant power, including the capacity to block legislation initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British [[Westminster system|Westminster bicameralism]] and US-style bicameralism. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which must maintain the confidence of the lower house, rarely has a majority in the Senate and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop34 |title=Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate |date=1999 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
In the German, Indian, and Pakistani systems, the upper houses (the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the [[Rajya Sabha]], and the [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] respectively) are even more closely linked with the federal system, being appointed or elected directly by the governments or legislatures of each [[States of Germany|German]] or [[States and territories of India|Indian state]], or [[Provinces of Pakistan|Pakistani province]]. This was also the case in the United States before the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] was adopted. Because of this coupling to the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], German legal doctrine does not treat the ''Bundesrat'' as the second chamber of a bicameral system formally. Rather, it sees the ''Bundesrat'' and the ''[[Bundestag]]'' as independent constitutional bodies. Only the directly elected ''Bundestag'' is considered the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'', BVerfGE 37, 363, Aktenzeichen 2 BvF 2, 3/73&lt;/ref&gt; In the German [[Bundesrat of Germany|''Bundesrat'']], the various ''Länder'' have between three and six votes; thus, while the less populated states have a lower weight, they still have a stronger voting power than would be the case in a system based ''purely'' on population, as the [[North Rhine-Westphalia|most populous ''Land'']] currently has about 27 times the population of the [[Bremen (state)|least populous]]. The Indian Upper House does not have the states represented equally, but on the basis of their population.

There is also bicameralism in countries that are not federations, but have upper houses with representation on a territorial basis. For example, in South Africa, the [[National Council of Provinces]] (and before 1997, the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]]) has its members chosen by each [[Provinces of South Africa|Province]]'s legislature.

In Spain the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] functions as a ''de facto'' territorial-based upper house, and there has been some pressure from the [[Autonomous Communities]] to reform it into a strictly territorial chamber.

The [[European Union]] maintains a bicameral legislative system consisting of the [[European Parliament]], which is elected in elections on the basis of universal suffrage, and the [[Council of the European Union]], which consists of one representative for each Government of member countries, who are competent for a relevant field of legislation. The European Union is not considered a country nor a state, but it enjoys the power to address national Governments in many areas.

===Aristocratic and post-aristocratic===
In a few countries, bicameralism involves the juxtaposition of democratic and aristocratic elements.

The best known example is the British [[House of Lords]], which includes a number of [[hereditary peer]]s. The House of Lords is a vestige of the aristocratic system that once predominated in British politics, while the other house, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], is entirely elected. Over the years, some have proposed reforms to the House of Lords, some of which have been at least partly successful. The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] limited the number of hereditary peers (as opposed to [[life peer]]s, appointed by the [[British monarchy|Monarch]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) to 92, down from around 700. Of these 92, one is the [[Earl Marshal]], a hereditary office always held by the [[Duke of Norfolk]], one is the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], a hereditary office held by turns, currently by the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley]], and the other 90 are [[Representative peer|elected by all sitting peers]]. Hereditary peers elected by the House to sit as representative peers sit for life; when a representative peer dies, byelections occur to fill the vacancy. The ability of the House of Lords to block legislation is curtailed by the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. Peers can introduce bills except Money Bills, and all legislation must be passed by both [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Houses of Parliament]]. If not passed within two sessions, the [[House of Commons]] can override the Lords delay by invoking the Parliament Act. Certain legislation, however, must be approved by both Houses and can't be forced through by the Commons under the Parliament Act. These include any bill that would extend the time length of a Parliament, private bills, bills sent to the House of Lords less than one month before the end of a session, and bills that originated in the House of Lords.

Life Peers are appointed either by recommendation of the Appointment Commission; the independent body that vets non-partisan peers, typically from academia, business or culture, or by Dissolution Honour, which takes place at the end of every Parliamentary term and leaving MPs may be offered a seat to keep their institutional memory. It is traditional to offer a peerage to every outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-appointment/ How do you become a Member of the House of Lords? - UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reform of the Lords has been proposed; however, reform is not supported by many. Members of the House of Lords all have an aristocratic title, or are from the [[Lord Spiritual|Clergy]]. 26 Archbishops and Bishops of the [[Church of England]] sit as [[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]], being the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop of York]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and the next 21 longest-serving Bishops. It is usual that retiring Archbishops, and certain other Bishops, are appointed to the [[Crossbencher|Crossbenches]] and given a life peerage. Until 2009, 12 [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] sat in the House as the highest court in the land; they subsequently became justices of the newly created [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. At present, 786 people sit in the House of Lords, with 92 Hereditary, 26 being Bishops or Archbishops (the Lords Spiritual) and the rest being Life Peers. Membership is not fixed and decreases only on the death of a life peer.

Another example of aristocratic bicameralism was the Japanese [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]], abolished after [[World War II]] and replaced with the present [[House of Councillors]].

===Unitary states===

 }}
Many bicameral countries like the [[Netherlands]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Romania]] are examples of bicameral systems existing in [[unitary state]]s. In countries such as these, the upper house generally focuses on scrutinizing and possibly vetoing the decisions of the lower house.

On the other hand, in [[Italy]] the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] consists of two chambers that have the same role and power: the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] (Senate of the Republic, commonly considered the ''upper house'') and the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] (considered the ''lower house'').

In some of these countries, the upper house is indirectly elected. Members of France's [[French Senate|Senate]] and Ireland's [[Seanad Éireann]] are chosen by [[electoral college]]s, the latter's consisting of members of the lower house, local councillors, the [[Taoiseach]], and graduates of selected universities, while the Netherlands' [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] is chosen by members of provincial assemblies (which, in turn, are directly elected).

[[Norway]] had a kind of [[Storting#Qualified unicameralism (1814–2009)|semi-bicameral legislature]] with two chambers, or departments, within the same elected body, the [[Storting]]. These were called the Odelsting and were abolished after the general election of 2009. According to Morten Søberg, there was a related system in the 1798 constitution of the [[Batavian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.as/?vis=artikkel&amp;fid=3018&amp;id=0604200909214912460&amp;magasin=ja&amp;t=Senatet-som-aldri-vart Minerva.as]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], members of the unicameral [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] returned from the democratically elected geographical constituencies and partially-democratic [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] are required to vote separately since 1997 on motions, bills or amendments to government bills not introduced by the government. The passage of these motions, bills or amendments to government bills requires double majority in both groups simultaneously. (Before 2004, when elections to the Legislative Council from the [[Election Committee]] was abolished, members returned through the Election Committee vote with members returned from geographical constituencies.) The double majority requirement does not apply to motions, bills and amendments introduced by the [[Hong Kong Government|government]].

==Subnational entities==
In some countries with federal systems, individual states (like those of the United States, [[States and territories of Australia|Australia]] and a few [[States of India]]) may also have bicameral legislatures. A few such states as [[Nebraska]] in the U.S., [[Queensland]] in Australia, [[Bavaria]] in Germany, and [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] in Argentina have later adopted unicameral systems. Brazilian states and Canadian provinces had all their upper houses abolished.

===Argentina===
[[File:Legislaturas provinciales de Argentina.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Provincial legislatures of Argentina.]]
In [[Argentina]], eight [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] have bicameral legislatures, with a [[Senate]] and a [[Chamber of Deputies]]: [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] (since 1987) and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] changed to [[unicameral]] systems in 1990 and 2001 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Malamud, Andrés and Martín Costanzo (2010) "[http://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/11915 Bicameralismo subnacional: el caso argentino en perspectiva comparada]". In: Igor Vivero Ávila (ed.), Democracia y reformas políticas en México y América Latina (pp. 219-246). Mexico: M. A. Porrúa.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australian states, the lower house was traditionally elected based on the one-vote-one-value principle, whereas the upper house was partially appointed and elected, with a bias towards country voters and landowners. In Queensland, the appointed [[Queensland Legislative Council|upper house]] was abolished in 1922, while in [[New South Wales]] there were similar attempts at abolition, before the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|upper house]] was reformed in the 1970s to provide for direct election. Nowadays, the upper house both federally and in most states is elected using the [[Single transferable vote]] form of [[proportional representation]] while the lower house uses [[Instant-runoff voting]] in single member electorates. This is reversed in the state of [[Tasmania]], where proportional representation is used for the [[Tasmania House of Assembly|lower house]] and single member electorates for the [[Tasmania Legislative Council|upper house]].

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The Legislature of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], one of the two entities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], is a bicameral legislative body. It consists of two chambers. 
The House of Representatives has 98 delegates, elected for four-year terms by proportional representation.
The House of Peoples has 58 members, 17 delegates from among each of the constituent peoples of the Federation, and 7 delegates from among the other peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advokat-prnjavorac.com/legislation/constitution_fbih.pdf Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republika Srpska]], the other entity, has a unicameral parliament, known as the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/?q=en/national-assembly/about-national-assembly The National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The German federal state of [[Bavaria]] had a bicameral legislature from 1946 to 1999, when the [[Senate of Bavaria|Senate]] was abolished by a referendum amending the state's constitution. The other 15 states have used a unicameral system since their founding.

===India===
Seven Indian States, [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], have bicameral Legislatures, in these states the upper house is called [[Vidhan Parishad]] (Legislative Councils), one third of whom members are elected every two years. Among the members of legislative councils:

*One third are elected by the members of local bodies in the state such as [[Municipal governance in India|municipalities]], [[Gram panchayat|gram sabhas/gram panchayats]], [[Panchayat samiti (block)|panchayat samitis]] and the [[District Councils of India|district councils of India]].
*One third are elected by  the members of Legislative Assemblies of the State from among the persons who are not members of the Assembly.
*One sixth are nominated by the [[Governor (India)|governor]] of the state from persons having knowledge or practical experience in fields such as [[literature]], [[science]], [[arts]], the [[Cooperative|co-operative]] movement and [[Social work|social service]].
*One twelfth are elected by persons who are graduates of three years' standing residing in that state.
*One twelfth are elected by persons engaged for at least three years in teaching in [[Education in India|educational institutions within the state]] not lower than [[secondary school]]s, including [[college]]s and [[University|universities]].

From 1956 to 1958 the Andhra Pradesh Legislature was unicameral. In 1958, when the Legislative Council was formed, it became bicameral until 1 June 1985 when it was abolished. This continued until March 2007 when the Legislative Council was reestablished and elections were held for its seats. Since then the Andhra Pradesh Legislature has become once again bicameral. 
In [[Tamil Nadu]], a resolution was passed on 14 May 1986 and the Legislative Council was dissolved on 1 November 1986. Again on 12 April 2010, a resolution was passed to bring it back bicameral, but became unsuccessful in 2011. Similarly the states of [[Assam]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[West Bengal]] have also dissolved the upper house of their state legislature.

===Russia===
Under [[Soviet regime]] regional and local [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] were unicameral. After the adoption of [[Constitution of Russia|1993 Russian Constitution]] bicameralism was introduced in some regions. Bicameral regional legislatures are still technically allowed by federal law but this clause is dormant now. The last region to switch from bicameralism to unicameralism was [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] in 2012.

===United States===
During the 1930s, the Legislature of the State of Nebraska was reduced from [[bicameral]] to unicameral with the 43 members that once comprised that state's Senate. One of the arguments used to sell the idea at the time to Nebraska voters was that by adopting a unicameral system, the perceived evils of the "[[conference committee]]" process would be eliminated.

A conference committee is appointed when the two chambers cannot agree on the same wording of a proposal, and consists of a small number of legislators from each chamber. This tends to place much power in the hands of only a small number of legislators. Whatever legislation, if any, the conference committee finalizes must then be approved in an unamendable "take-it-or-leave-it" manner by both chambers.

During his term as [[Governor]] of the State of [[Minnesota]], [[Jesse Ventura]] proposed converting the Minnesotan legislature to a single chamber with [[proportional representation]], as a reform that he felt would solve many legislative difficulties and impinge upon legislative corruption. In his book on political issues, ''Do I Stand Alone?'', Ventura argued that bicameral legislatures for provincial and local areas were excessive and unnecessary, and discussed unicameralism as a reform that could address many legislative and budgetary problems for states.

==Reform==

===Arab political reform===
A 2005 report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/pdf/Arab_Democracy_TF.pdf 2005 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705153315/http://www.cfr.org/pdf/Arab_Democracy_TF.pdf |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on democratic reform in the Arab world by the U.S. [[Council on Foreign Relations]] co-sponsored by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] urged Arab states to adopt bicameralism, with upper chambers appointed on a 'specialized basis'. The Council claimed that this would protect against the '[[Tyranny of the majority]]', expressing concerns that without a system of checks and balances extremists would use the single chamber parliaments to restrict the rights of [[minority group|minority]] groups.

In 2002, [[Bahrain]] adopted a bicameral system with an elected lower chamber and an appointed upper house. This led to a boycott of parliamentary elections that year by the [[Al Wefaq]] party, who said that the government would use the upper house to veto their plans. Many secular critics of bicameralism were won around to its benefits in 2005, after many MPs in the lower house voted for the introduction of so-called [[morality police]].

===Romania===
A [[Romanian parliamentary reform referendum, 2009|referendum]] on introducing a unicameral Parliament instead of the current bicameral [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] was held in [[Romania]] on 22 November 2009. The turnout rate was 50.95%, with 77.78% of "Yes" votes for a unicameral Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-ro.info/referendum-turnout-5095-7778-said-yes-for-a-unicameral-parliament-8884-voted-for-the-decrease-in-the-number-of-parliamentarians.html Referendum turnout 50.95%. 77.78 said YES for a unicameral Parliament, 88.84% voted for the decrease in the number of Parliamentarians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231024/http://www.news-ro.info/referendum-turnout-5095-7778-said-yes-for-a-unicameral-parliament-8884-voted-for-the-decrease-in-the-number-of-parliamentarians.html |date=21 July 2011 }}, Official results from the Romanian Central Electoral Commission&lt;/ref&gt; This referendum had a consultative role, thus requiring a parliamentary initiative and another referendum to ratify the new proposed changes.

===Ivory Coast===
A [[Ivorian constitutional referendum, 2016|referendum]] on a new [[Constitution of Ivory Coast#2016 Constitution (proposed)|constitution]] was held on 30 October 2016. The constitution draft would create a bicameral [[Parliament of Ivory Coast|Parliament]] instead of the current unicameral. The [[Senate (Ivory Coast)|Senate]] is expected to represent the interests of territorial collectivities and Ivoirians living abroad. Two thirds of the Senate is to be elected at the same time as the general election. The remaining one third is appointed by the president elect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/news/innovations-draft-constitution-cote-divoire-towards-hyper-presidentialism|title=Innovations of the Draft Constitution of Cote d’Ivoire: Towards hyper-presidentialism?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Biocultural diversity''' is defined by [[Luisa Maffi]] as "the diversity of life in all its manifestations: [[biology|biological]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[linguistics|linguistic]] — which are interrelated (and possibly coevolved) within a complex [[socio-ecological system|socio-ecological]] [[adaptive system]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|title=The SAGE Handbook of Environment and Society|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nyZFZgbpdKYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=maffi+l+2007+biocultural+diversity+and+sustainability&amp;ots=gm2o2vvjok&amp;sig=-19eTvoZ0ikAqSJ1xpQMzxGM34Q#v=onepage&amp;q=maffi&amp;f=false|authorlink=Biocultural Diversity and Sustainability|editor=Jules Pretty|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=269|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The diversity of life is made up not only of the diversity of plants and animal species, habitats and ecosystems found on the planet, but also of the diversity of human cultures and languages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|title=Biocultural Diversity Conservation|year=2012|publisher=Earthscan|location=UK|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain geographic areas have been positively correlated with high levels of biocultural diversity, including those of [[low latitudes]], higher rainfalls, higher temperatures, [[coastline]]s, and [[high altitude]]s. A negative correlation is found with areas of [[high latitudes]], [[plain]]s, and drier climates. Positive correlations can also be found between biological diversity and [[linguistic diversity]], illustrated in the overlap between the distribution of plant diverse and language diverse zones. Social factors, such as modes of [[subsistence]], have also been found to affect biocultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|title=Biocultural Diversity Conservation|year=2012|publisher=Earthscan|location=UK|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic Diversity==
Cultural traditions are passed down through language, making language an important factor in the existence of biocultural diversity. There has been a decline in the number of languages globally. The [[Linguistic Diversity Index]] has recorded that between 1970 and 2005, the number of languages spoken globally has decreased by 20%. This decline has been especially observed in [[indigenous language]]s, with a 60% decline in the Americas, 30% in the Pacific, and 20% in Africa. Currently, there are 7,000 languages being spoken in the world. Half the population speaks only 25 of these languages, the top 5 in order being [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. The remaining 6975 languages are divided between the other half of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harmon, Loh |first=David, Jonathan |title=Index of Linguistic Diversity |url=http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/ |work=Terralingua: unity in biocultural diversity |accessdate=29 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822015417/http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/ |archivedate=22 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because languages develop in a given community of speakers as that society adapts to its environment, languages reflect and express the [[biodiversity]] of that area. In areas of high biodiversity, language diversity is also higher, suggesting that a greater diversity in culture can be found in these areas. In fact, many of the areas of the world inhabited by smaller, isolated communities are also home to large numbers of endemic plant and animal species. As these people are often considered to be "[[Stewardship|stewards]]" of their environments, loss of language diversity means a disappearance of traditional ecological knowledge ([[Traditional Environmental Knowledge|TEK]]), an important factor in the conservation of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Biocultural Diversity|year=2001|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington|pages=1–11|editor=Luisa Maffi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration of Belem==
Awareness about the balance between biological and cultural diversity has been increasing for a few decades. At the first international congress on ethnobiology in 1988, scientists met with indigenous peoples to discuss ways to better manage the use of natural resources and protect vulnerable communities around the world. They developed the [http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/global-coalition-2/declaration-of-belem/ Declaration of Belem], named after the city where the congress was held, which outlined eight steps to ensure conservation efforts would be implemented effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Belem|url=http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/global-coalition-2/declaration-of-belem/|publisher=International Society of Ethnobiology|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hotspots of Biocultural Diversity==
There are three areas which have been identified as hotspots of biocultural diversity: The Amazon Basin, Central Africa, and Indomalaysia/Malenesia. Hot spots of biocultural diversity can be calculated by averaging a countries biological diversity and cultural diversity. Cultural diversity is scored based on "a country's language diversity, religion diversity, and ethnic group diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loh|first=Jonathan|author2=Harmon|title=A Global Index of Biocultural Diversity|journal=Ecological Indicators|date=August 2005|volume=5|issue=3|pages=231–241|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X0500018X|accessdate=21 November 2012|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent programs in the Eastern Himalayas have also engaged this concept to promote conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Cardale Babington.jpg|thumb|Charles Cardale Babington]]
'''Charles Cardale Babington''' (23 November 1808 – 22 July 1895) was an English [[botanist]] and [[archaeologist]].  He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1851.
Babington was the son of [[Babington family|Joseph Babington]] and Cathérine née Whitter, and a nephew of [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]. He was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]&lt;ref&gt;Darby, Michael. A Biographical Dictionary of British Coleopterists. http://www.coleopterist.org.uk/biogdict-intro.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205359/http://www.coleopterist.org.uk/biogdict-intro.htm# |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], obtaining his Bachelor of Arts in 1830 and his Master of Arts in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BBNN825CC|name=Babington, Charles Cardale}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overlapped at Cambridge with [[Charles Darwin]], and in 1829 they argued over who should have the pick of [[beetle]] specimens from a local dealer.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Correspondence Project Database. http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-60/ (letter no. 60; accessed 28 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
He obtained the chair of botany at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1861 and wrote several papers on insects. He married Anna Maria Walker on 3 April 1866.

Babington was a member of several scientific societies including the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]], the [[Linnean Society of London]] (1853), the [[Geological Society of London]], the [[Royal Society]] (1851), and in 1833 he participated in the foundation of the [[Royal Entomological Society]]. Babington  was President of the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]] at their meeting at [[Church Stretton]] in 1881 and for many years served as Chairman of the council of the Association.

He wrote ''Manual of British Botany'' (1843), ''Flora of Cambridgeshire'' (1860), ''The British Rubi'' (1869) and edited the publication [[Annals and Magazine of Natural History]] from 1842. His herbarium and library are conserved by the University of Cambridge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27305">"'''Communication Theory as a Field'''" is a 1999 article by [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]], attempting to unify the academic field of [[communication theory]].{{sfn|Craig|1999}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}

Craig argues that communication theorists can become unified in dialogue by charting what he calls the "dialogical dialectical tension", or the similarities and differences in their understanding of "communication" and demonstrating how those elements create tension within the field.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}}  Craig mapped these similarities and differences into seven suggested traditions of communication theory and showed how each of these traditions understand communication, as well as how each traditions understanding creates tension with the other traditions.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-149}}

The article has received multiple awards,&lt;ref name="international communication" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCA" /&gt; has become the foundation for many communication theory textbooks,{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} and has been translated into several different languages.{{sfn|Craig|2009b}}&lt;ref name="vita" /&gt;

"Communication theory as a field" has created two main dialogues between Craig and other theorists. Myers argued that Craig misrepresented the theoretical assumptions of his theory, and that the theory itself does not distinguish between good and bad theories.{{sfn|Myers|2001}} Craig responded that Myers misunderstood not only the basic argument of the article, but also misrepresented his own case study.{{sfn|Craig|2001}} Russill proposed pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication theory,{{sfn|Russill|2004}}{{sfn|Russill|2005}} Craig responded by expanding this idea and placing Russill's proposition in conversation with the other seven traditions.{{sfn|Craig|2007}}

==Metamodel==
Sparked by the "[[Great Debates (international relations)|Third Debate]]" within the field of International Relations Theory in the 1980s, "Communication Theory as a Field" expanded the conversation regarding disciplinary identity in the field of communication.{{sfn|Donsback|2006}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008|pp=6}}{{sfn|Penman|2000}}{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004}}{{sfn|Lindlof|Taylor|2002}}{{sfn|D'Angelo|2002}}{{sfn|Jimenez|Guillem|2009}} At that time, communication theory textbooks had little to no agreement on how to present the field or what theories to include in their textbooks.{{sfn|Anderson|1996|pp=200-201}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120}}  This article has since become the foundational framework for four different textbooks to introduce the field of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}} In this article Craig "proposes a vision for communication theory that takes a huge step toward unifying this rather disparate field and addressing its complexities."{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}} To move toward this unifying vision Craig focused on [[communication theory]] as a practical discipline and shows how "various traditions of communication theory can be engaged in dialogue on the practice of communication."{{sfn|Craig|2006|pp=13}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=6}}  In this deliberative process theorists would engage in dialog about the "practical implications of communication theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001}} In the end Craig proposes seven different traditions of communication theory and outlines how each one of them would engage the others in dialogue.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-146}}

Craig argues that while the study of communication and communication theory has become a rich and flourishing field "Communication theory as an identifiable field of study does not yet exist" and the field of communication theory has become fragmented into separate domains which simply ignore each other.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=119-120}} This inability to engage in dialog with one another causes theorists to view communication from isolated viewpoints, and denies them the richness that is available when engaging different perspectives.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} Craig argues that communication theorists are all engaging in the study of practical communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} By doing so different traditions are able to have a common ground from which a dialog can form, albeit each taking a different perspective of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} Through this process of forming a dialog between theorists with different viewpoints on communication "communication theory can fully engage with the ongoing practical discourse (or metadiscourse) about communication in society."{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}}

The communication discipline began not as a single discipline, but through many different disciplines independently researching communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|p=121}} This interdisciplinary beginning has separated theorists through their different conceptions of communication, rather than unifying them in the common topic of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=120-123}} Craig argues that the solution to this incoherence in the field of communication is not a unified theory of communication, but to create a dialogue between these theorists which engages these differences with one another to create new understandings of communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=123-125}}{{sfn|Penman|2000|pp=76}}

To achieve this dialog Craig proposes what he calls "Dialogical-Dialectical coherence," or a "common awareness of certain complementaries and tensions among different types of communication theory."{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}} Craig believes that the different theories cannot develop in total isolation from one another, therefore this dialogical-dialectical coherence will provide a set of background assumptions from which different theories can engage each other in productive argumentation.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=124}} Craig argues for a [[metatheory]], or "second level" theory which deals with "first level" theories about communication.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=126-127}}  This second level metamodel of communication theory would help to understand the differences between first level communication traditions.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=123-132}} With this thesis in place, Craig proposes seven suggested traditions of communication that have emerged and each of which have their own way of understanding communication.{{sfn|Anderson|Baym|2004|pp=440}}{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132-134}}
#[[Rhetoric]]al: views communication as the practical art of discourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-136}}
#[[Semiotic]]: views communication as the mediation by signs.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=136-138}}
#[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenological]]: communication is the experience of dialogue with others.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=138-140}}
#[[cybernetics|Cybernetic]]: communication is the flow of information.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=141-142}}
#[[Social psychology (sociology)|Socio-psychological]]: communication is the interaction of individuals.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=142-144}}
#[[sociocultural|Socio-cultural]]: communication is the production and reproduction of the social order.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=144-146}}
#[[Critical theory|Critical]]: communication is the process in which all assumptions can be challenged.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=146-149}}

These proposed seven traditions of communication theory are then placed on two separate tables{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=133-134}} first to show how each traditions different interpretation of communication defines the tradition's vocabulary, communication problems, and commonplaces,{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,133}} and next to show what argumentation between the traditions would look like.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=132,134}}  Craig then outlines the specifics of each tradition.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=135-149}}

===Conclusion===

Craig concluded with an open invitation to explore how the differences in these theories might shed light on key issues, show where new traditions could be created, and engaging communication theory with communication problems through metadiscourse.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149}} Craig further proposes several future traditions that could possibly be fit into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=149,151}} A feminist tradition where communication is theorized as "connectedness to others", an aesthetic tradition theorizing communication as "embodied performance", an economic tradition theorizing communication as "exchange", and a spiritual tradition theorizing communication on a "nonmaterial or mystical plane of existence."{{sfn|Craig|1999|pp=151}}

==Response==

===Myers, constitutive metamodel, and truth===
In 2001 Myers, a [[computer-mediated communication]] scholar from [[Loyola University New Orleans]], criticizes Craig's ideas in "A Pox on All Compromises: A reply to Craig (1999)."{{sfn|Myers|2001}}  Myers makes two main arguments against Craig's article. Myers argues that Craig misrepresents the metamodel, and that the lack of any critical truth within Craigs construction is problematic for the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=219}}{{sfn|Craig|2007}} The metamodel is misrepresented by unjustly arguing that there is a separation between first and second level constitutive models while hiding the paradox within this statement, and that it privileges the constitutive model rather than another theoretical conception.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=219-123, 226}} Next Myers argues that Craig fails to draw any way to discern truth within the theories.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=222-223}} Using a case study regarding the rise and fall of [[technological determinism]] among computer-mediated communication scholars,{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=223-226}} Myers argues that a metamodel needs to provide some mechanism that will "reduce misrepresentation and mistake" in evaluating theory.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=226}} Myers frames Craig's ideas of collective discourse without an evaluative criteria of what is good theory and bad theory as [[The Hatter|"a Mad Hatter's tea party"]] which will "allow all to participate in this party of discourse" but will not be able to "inform any of the participants when it is time to leave."{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=226}}

====Craig's response to Myers====

Craig responded, in "an almost [[William James|Jamesian]] reply",{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=300}} that Myers criticisms were not founded in actual inconsistencies within Craigs argument.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=232}} Rather they were founded in the difference between Myers and Craig's "respective notions of truth and the proper role of [[Empiricism|empirical truth]] as a criterion for adjudicating among theories."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=232}} In regard to Myers first claim that the separation between first level theories and second level metatheory is paradoxical and therefore an inaccurate or misguided distinction, Craig admits that there is a paradox inherent within a separation between first order theories and metatheory but "slippage between logical levels is an inherent feature (or bug) of communication, and we should not forget that theory is, among other things, communication. "{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234}} Craig cites [[Gregory Bateson]] as pointing out that while the [[Double bind#Theory of logical types|theory of logical types]] forbids the mixing of different "levels" to avoid paradox, "practical communication necessarily does exactly that."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}}  Actual communication is fraught with paradox, and while a logicians ideal would have us try and resolve these paradoxes, in actual practice we don't because there is no way to do so.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}} In actually occurring communication people employ different means of dealing with this paradox, but resolving the paradox is not a possible solution.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=233}} Craig argues that Myers has been unable to prove any inconsistency or misrepresentation when it came to using the constitutive model for his metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234-235}} Rather than trying to subvert every other theory to a constitutional model, Craig used the constitutive model not for some theory of truth or logical necessity, but because the constitutive model pragmatically will accomplish the goal of the project, that of opening up a space from which competing theories of communication can interact.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=234}} With this the constitutional model will be able to maintain a theoretical cosmopolitanism.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236}}

On the second argument that the metamodel lacks any empirical truth criteria, Craig argues that not only did Myers miss the point of the metamodel by claiming it should evaluate the truth of theories{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236-237}} but that Myers own case study fails to back up his point.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=236,238}} The metamodel itself does not distinguish the falseness of other models.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=237}} However, contrary to Myers claim, the metamodel does allow theorists engaged in discussion to judge the validity of theories "on the basis of empirical evidence in ordinary reasonable ways."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=237}} What the metamodel does deny is a universally established absolute truth in the field of communication theory.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=230}} Craig points out that Myers was correct in that the metamodel is ill-equipped to judge theories as valid or invalid, it also doesn't do a good job of closing "the Antarctic ozone hole or solve other problems for which it was not designed."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} The case study that Myers presents is the debate about [[technological determinism]] in the realm of Computer Mediated Communication.{{sfn|Myers|2001|pp=223-226}} Craig points out that this debate occurred between [[Social psychology (sociology)|social scientific]] researchers.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} This type of research has a shared commitment to [[empirical research]] methods.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} So in spite of already possessing a shared truth criteria, these researchers failed to prevent errors Myers hopes would be avoided by holding onto a form of absolute truth.{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} This case study would be a good critique of empirical truth but "how it supports a critique of the constitutive metamodel is less than apparent."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}} By relying upon this case study Myers sabotages his argument for establishing an absolute truth criteria, demonstrating that "we would gain little by holding on to such a criterion."{{sfn|Craig|2001|pp=238}}

=== Russill, pragmatism as an eighth tradition ===
After this exchange between Myers and Craig, there was no real disciplinary discussion of the metamodel{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125-126}}{{sfn|Craig|2009a|pp=7}} besides textbooks which used the metamodel as a framework for introducing the field.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=125}}{{sfn|Craig|Muller|2007}}{{sfn|Littlejohn|Foss|2008}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006}}{{sfn|Miller|2005}}
Then in 2004 in an unpublished dissertation,{{sfn|Russill|2004}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}} which was mentioned in a footnote in his 2005 "The road not Taken: William James's Radical Empiricism and Communication Theory,"{{sfn|Russill|2005}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}} Russill proposed the possibly of [[pragmatism]] as an eighth tradition of [[communication studies]].{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=126}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281-282}}{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=296-298}}{{sfn|Craig|2009a}}  This was attempted by using "Craig's rules" for the requirements of a tradition in communication theory{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=282}}{{sfn|Russill|2005|pp=300}} which Russill formulates as "a problem formulation..., an initial vocabulary..., and arguments for the plausibility of this viewpoint in relation to prevailing traditions of theory."{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=133}}

Russill did not write his dissertation with the goal of constructing a tradition of communication theory, rather he was attempting to "resuscitate and reconstruct [[John Dewey|Dewey's]] theory of the public as a pragmatist theory of democratic communication."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=iii, 5, 68-105, 279-283}}  To accomplish this goal Russill places Dewey in conversation with a variety of theorists including [[William James]], [[John Locke]], [[James W. Carey|James Carey]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], and [[Walter Lippmann]] among others.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130}}{{sfn|Russill|2004}}  Russill makes the argument that the pragmatist tradition "conceptualizes communication in response to the problem of incommensurability."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}  Incommensurability being how a pluralistic society can engage in cooperation when there is an absence "of common, absolute standards for resolving differences."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}  Russill briefly attempted to construct a pragmatist tradition of communication only to establish Dewey's theory of the public within that tradition.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130-131}}{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281-282}}  To do this he outlines pragmatism as a tradition that identifies the problem formulation as "incommensurability", and the vocabulary as "democracy, publics, power, criticism, response-ability, triple contingency."{{sfn|Russill|2004|pp=281}}{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=131}}

====Craig's response to Russill====

Craig responds to this in "Pragmatism in the Field of Communication Theory" and mentions that while Russill "does not entirely follow 'Craig's Rules'" for a new tradition of communication theory, Russill "does define a pragmatist tradition in terms of a distinct way of framing the problem of communication and articulates premises that make the tradition theoretically and practically plausible."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=130-131}}  Craig points out that Russill is not the first communication theorists who writes on pragmatism, however he is the first to use the constitutive metamodel to define it as a tradition of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=134}}  This conception of pragmatism as an eighth tradition of communication studies allows a new space for theories, which Craig identified as either ambiguously placed or neglected, to "immediately snap into focus as contributors to a distinct [pragmatic] tradition."{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=134}}

To fully outline a new tradition of communication theory, Russill would have had to fully incorporate that tradition within the dialogical-dialectical matrix.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135}}  Russill failed to fully consider the full range of criticism which would occur between the Pragmatist tradition and the other traditions of communication.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135}}  Craig uses the dialogical-dialectical matrix to outline how pragmatism could be incorporated into the metamodel.{{sfn|Craig|2007|pp=135-137}}

'''Contour rivalry''' is an artistic technique used to create multiple possible visual interpretations of an image. An image may be viewed as depicting one thing when viewed in a certain way; but if the image is flipped or turned, the same lines that formed the previous image now make up an entirely new design.

[[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|250px|A detail of the Raimondi Stela, an example of contour rivalry produced by the Chavin culture.]]
This technique was widely practiced by the artists of the [[Chavín culture]] of the central [[Andes]] about two thousand years ago. An example of this technique from the Chavín is the [[Raimondi Stela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritage-key.com/category/tags/contour-rivalry |title=Contour rivalry, Raimondi Stela |accessdate=2009-09-06 |publisher=Heritage Key}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia''''' (Hodder &amp; Stoughton. {{ISBN|0-340-66637-4}}) is a 1988 autobiographical crime book written by [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (assisted by Richard Woodley) about his story as an [[FBI agent]] going undercover and infiltrating the [[American mafia|Mafia]]. In 1997, the book was made into a feature film titled ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Al Pacino]]. Louis DiGiaimo, a casting director who worked on ''[[The Godfather]]'' and a childhood friend of Pistone, consulted on the book and film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.moviefone.com/2012/02/27/donnie-brasco-15th-anniversary "''Donnie Brasco'' 15th Anniversary: 25 Things You Didn't Know About Johnny Depp's Classic Mob Movie"]. ''The Moviefone Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was re-released in a second edition the same year the film was released.

== Plot ==

Pistone becomes an [[FBI agent]] after spending time working for [[Naval Intelligence]]. He first goes undercover to infiltrate a [[theft]] ring. The operation pays off when the FBI arrests one of the largest and most profitable theft rings in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0610_050610_tv_mafia.html "FBI Agent ''Donnie Brasco'' Recalls Life in the Mafia"] ''National Geographic News'', June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the operation, the FBI and Pistone consider going undercover and infiltrating [[truck hijacking]] gangs and the [[American mafia|Mafia]]. After months of preparation, the FBI erases Pistone's personal history and he goes undercover as Donald Brasco, an expert jewel thief from [[Miami, Florida]]. Hanging out at known crime spots, such as bars and social clubs, he eventually befriends a bartender and joins a crime gang.

He moves on to Jilly Greca's crew, who are associates in the [[Colombo crime family]]. The crew are involved in truck hijacking and selling stolen merchandise. Brasco meets [[Anthony Mirra]] and the two begin hanging out. Mirra is a soldier in the [[Bonanno crime family]] and is a lot better connected, respected and feared than Greca's crew. Brasco decides it would be a better choice for the operation to go with Mirra, so he starts hanging out more with Mirra.

Through Mirra, Brasco meets another Bonanno soldier called [[Benjamin "Lefty" Ruggiero]]. When Mirra is sent back to prison, Brasco and Lefty become close friends. Brasco gains the reputation of being a trustworthy and good earner. He is responsible for several lucrative business ventures, including the ''Kings Court Bottle Club'' in Florida, which begins a good relationship with the Bonannos and [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante]].

The Bonannos, particularly captain [[Dominick "Sonny Black" Napolitano]], are happy with Brasco's work and are prepared to sponsor him for membership into the mafia. Brasco struggles in his personal life because he does not see his real family often, spending months without seeing his wife and three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/26/nyregion/inside-the-mob-agent-recalls-game-of-wits.html "Inside the Mob: Agent Recalls 'Game of Wits'"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; A family dispute breaks out over who "[[own]]s" Donnie Brasco. Mirra claims he owns him since he brought him in, Lefty says he owns him because he was the first to put a claim on him, and Sonny Black as the captain says Brasco belongs to him.

After six years undercover, the operation becomes increasingly dangerous. Three powerful captains are murdered; gunned down by fellow Bonanno family members. The FBI want to pull the plug on the operation due to the danger of Brasco getting killed. Pistone wants to stay at least until he gets "[[Made man|made]]", in order to prove that the mafia is not invincible. A date is set when Brasco is ordered to come out of the operation. There are six weeks left until Brasco is revealed to be an FBI agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120722035630/http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&amp;action=view&amp;profileId=262890&amp;selectedIndex=1&amp;sectionName=Biography "True Story – ''Donnie Brasco''"] . ''Biography.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a made man, Brasco is ordered to kill [[Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato]], although Bruno has fled New York. FBI agents eventually reveal to Sonny Black that their associate is actually an agent. Although Sonny Black and others consider it hard to believe that Brasco is an agent, he informs his superiors. The men responsible for bringing Brasco into the family are ordered to be murdered. Sonny Black and Mirra are murdered, while Lefty escapes death when he is arrested before he arrives at a meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mafianewsreport.com/bonanno-mobster-bruno-indelicato-files-for-release-from-prison "Bonanno mobster Bruno Indelicato files for release from prison"]. ''Mafia News Report'', July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistone's work is not complete yet as he has to testify at trials all over America. Operation Donnie Brasco leads to more than 200 indictments and over 100 convictions of mafia members.

The '''Du Pont family''' ({{IPAc-en|dj|uː|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|t}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dupont "DuPont"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] family descended from [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] (1739–1817). Since the 19th century, the Du Pont family has been one of the richest families in America.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/du-pont/|title=Du Pont  family|work=forbes.com|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many former Du Pont family estates have been opened to the public as museums, gardens, or parks, such as [[Nemours Mansion and Gardens]], [[Longwood Gardens]], and [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library]]. The family's first American estate, located at [[Hagley Museum and Library]], has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In recent years, the family has continued to be known for its association with political and business ventures, as well as philanthropic efforts on behalf of various organizations such as [[The Jockey Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunger Estate Makes Major Contribution to Equine Research|url=http://www.jockeyclub.com/default.asp?section=Resources&amp;area=0&amp;archives=show&amp;story=194|website=The Jockey Club|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duvoisin|first1=Marc|title=Family's Reach Influenced Business, Politics And Arts The Du Pont Family Can Take Some Credit For The Creation Of Longwood Gardens, The Atomic Bomb And Nylon Hosiery.|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-01-28/news/25653867_1_du-pont-eleuthere-irenee-pont-iv|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=28 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Delaware Art Museum]], and the [[Grand Opera House (Wilmington, Delaware)|Grand Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagengast|first1=Larry|title=The Past, Present and Future of DuPont|url=http://www.delawaretoday.com/Delaware-Today/April-2014/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-DuPont/index.php?cparticle=7&amp;siarticle=6#artanc|publisher=Delaware Today|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two family members were the subjects of well-publicized criminal cases.

The family fortune as of 2016 was $14.3 billion with over 3,500 living members around the world, most of whom are only marginally related.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

==History==
[[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] was the son of a Parisian watchmaker and a member of a [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] [[Huguenot]] family, and descendant of a minor [[nobility|noble family]] on his mother's side. He and his sons, [[Victor Marie du Pont]] and [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], emigrated from France in 1800 to the United States and used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of [[United States|American]] families, and one of its most successful [[corporation]]s, [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], initially established by Éleuthère Irénée as a gunpowder manufacturer.

In 1802, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont established a gunpowder mill on the banks of the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine River]] near [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The location provided all the necessities to operate the mill: a water flow sufficient to power it, available timber (mainly willow trees) that could be turned into charcoal fine enough to use for gunpowder, close proximity to the [[Delaware River]] to allow for shipments of sulfur and saltpeter, the other ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder. There were also nearby stone quarries to provide needed building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanroads.net/happy_trails.winter2014.htm|title=Happy Trails|work=americanroads.net|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the [[DuPont|Du Pont company]] grew into the largest black powder manufacturing firm in the world. The family remained in control of the company up through the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DuPont Co.'s 19 leaders since 1802|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/10/05/duponts-leaders/73422578/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and family trusts still own a substantial amount of the company's stock. This and other companies run by the Du Pont family employed up to 10 percent of Delaware's population at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Scott|title=Delaware's dilemma: A fading DuPont|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/industries/2015/10/23/delawares-dilemma-fading-dupont/74329022/|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the Du Pont family maintained their family wealth by carefully arranged marriages between [[inbreeding|cousins]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin] by Richard Conniff, From the August 2003 issue, published online August 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which, at the time, was the norm for many families.

The family played a large part in politics during the 18th and 19th centuries and assisted in negotiations for the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and the [[Louisiana purchase]]. Both [[T. Coleman du Pont|T. Coleman]] and [[Henry A. du Pont]] served as U.S. senators, and [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] served as Governor of Delaware.

The family has also played an important role in historic preservation and land conservation, including helping to found the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], preserving President [[James Madison]]'s home [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], and establishing numerous museums such as Winterthur and the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]]. The Brandywine Conservancy founded by family member [[George Alexis Weymouth]] owns around {{convert|2350|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and owns permanent conservation easements on an additional {{convert|37000|acres|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauers|first1=Sandy|title=Conservancy gains easement Winterthur's pastoral beauty is now protected|url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-07-25/news/25358114_1_winterthur-henry-f-du-pont-easement|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=25 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=Jeff|title=The Brandywine Conservancy: Preserving Nature, Art, and History|url=http://php.delawareonline.com/news/assets/2014/09/WIL_1001_BRANDYWINE_CONSERVANCY_.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2015|work=Wilmington News Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Lammot du Pont Copeland]]'s [[Mt.

Beginning with [[William du Pont, Jr.]] and his sister, [[Marion duPont Scott]], many members of the Du Pont family have been involved in the breeding and racing of [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]], as well as establishing racehorse venues and training tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emc.vetmed.vt.edu/emcmariondupontscott.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011227114730/http://emc.vetmed.vt.edu/emcmariondupontscott.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 December 2001|title=Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spelling of the name==
The stylings “Dupont”, “DuPont”, du Pont" and "Du Pont" for the family name have both been widely used in published writings. In many publications, the styling is "du Pont" when quoting an individual's full name and "Du Pont" when speaking of the family as a whole, although some individual Du Ponts have chosen to style it differently, such as [[Samuel Francis Du Pont]]. The name of the chemical company founded by the family is today styled solid as "[[DuPont]]" in the short form (but the long form is styled as E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company); the stylings "Du Pont" and "DuPont" for the company's short name coexisted in the 20th century, but the latter is now consistently used in the company's branding. The solid styling "duPont" is less common, but the [[Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]] uses it, as does the [[duPont Registry]]. William S. Dutton's mid-20th-century history of the family business&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dutton |first=William S. |year=1942 |title=Du Pont: One Hundred and Forty Years |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEtZAAAAYAAJ |lccn=42011897 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses "Du Pont" both for the family mentioned generally and for the company's short name but "du Pont" in an individual's full name (for example, "[[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]]", "[[Henry du Pont]]", "[[Alfred V. du Pont |Alfred Victor du Pont]]", "[[Lammot du Pont I|Lammot du Pont]]"); for example, "when he [Lammot du Pont] went to General Henry du Pont with the proposal that the Du Ponts manufacture dynamite, he was answered by a blunt and unqualified 'No!'"&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|116}}) The first page of Dutton's monograph&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|3}} contains the following footnote about the surname's styling (the mention of "Samuel Dupont" here refers to the 18th-century Parisian watchmaker, not to [[Samuel Francis Du Pont|his 19th-century descendant]]): "Samuel Dupont used this form of the family name [i.e., Dupont], but beginning in 1763 [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|his son]] signed himself 'Du Pont.' Later, he added 'de Nemours' to his name to prevent confusion with two other Duponts in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|French Chamber of Deputies]]. Du Pont, in English, is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. In French, neither syllable is accented."&lt;ref name="Dutton_1942"/&gt;{{rp|3}} 

[[French orthography|French orthographic]] tradition for the styling of ''de'' (or its inflected forms) as a surname particle, in either nobiliary or non-nobiliary form, is discussed at ''[[Nobiliary particle#France|Nobiliary particle 
§ France]]''. In non-nobiliary form, the prevalent French styling of the name is "[[Wiktionary:Dupont|Dupont]]", and thus the choice by Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to begin styling himself so during the monarchical era hints at social ambition. But the influence of French orthography and prerevolutionary class structure on how [[English orthography]] styles surnames today is outweighed by how families and individuals so named style themselves.

This '''history by period''' summarizes significant eras in the [[history of the world]], from the ancient world to the present day.

== Ancient history (60,000 BC – 650 AD) ==
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period in which scientists have found the earliest remains of human activity, approximately 60,000 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 650 AD.

The [[Bronze Age]] is the time period in which humans around the world began to use [[bronze]] as a major metal in tools. It is generally accepted as starting around 3600 BC and ending with the advent of iron in 1000 BC.

The [[Iron Age]] is often called Antiquity or the Classical Era, but these periods more commonly refer to only one region. It begins around 1000 BC with the widespread use of [[iron]] in tools. It is often accepted to end at approximately 650 AD, with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations.

Note that BC and BCE refer to the same time period. BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era, and BC for Before Christ. AD is Anno Domini, and CE is Common Era. This is done in order to standardize time periods across the world ([[ISO 8601]]).
*[[Stone Age]] Ended between 6,000 and 2,000 BC (depending on the area; until 1600s European contact in Australia)
*[[History of Mesopotamia]] 6000 BC - 1100 BC
*[[Indus Valley Civilization]] 3300 BC - 1300 BC
*[[Old Kingdom]] ([[Egypt]], 3000 BC - 2000 BC)
*[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (Egypt, 2000 BC - 1300 BC)
*[[Vedic period]] [[History of India|India]], (1750 - 500 BC)
*[[New Kingdom]] (Egypt, 1300 BC - 700 BC)
*[[Shang Dynasty]] (China 1800 BC - 1200 BC)
*[[Classical antiquity|Mediterranean Antiquity]]
*[[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] Dynasty (China, 1200 BC–500 BC)
*[[Ancient Greece]], (circa 1000 BC–323 BC) (see [[Timeline of Ancient Greece]])
*[[Mahajanapadas]], (India 600 - 300 BC)
*[[Timeline of Roman history|Ancient Rome]] 753 BC - 476 AD)
*[[Classical India]] (230 BC - 500 AD)
*[[Six Dynasties]] (China, 220 AD–581 AD)
**[[Three Kingdoms]] (China, 220–280)

{{main article|Postclassical Era}}
The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for [[Europe]], the [[Middle Ages]], begins around 500 CE after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of [[Islam]]. The period ends around 1450–1500, with events like the rise of [[printing press|moveable-type printing]] in Europe, the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]], and the Ottoman Empire's [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]].

'''''In Patagonia''''' is an English travel book by [[Bruce Chatwin]], published in 1977.

==Preparations==

During the [[Second World War]] Chatwin and his mother stayed at the home of his paternal grandparents, who had a [[curiosity cabinet]] that fascinated him. Among the items it contained was a "piece of [[brontosaurus]]" (actually a [[mylodon]], a [[giant sloth]]), which had been sent to Chatwin's grandmother by her cousin Charles Amherst Milward. 

In a [[Cueva del Milodón|cave]] in Chilean Patagonia, Milward had discovered the remains of a giant sloth, which he later sold to the [[British Museum]]. He sent his cousin a piece of the animal's skin, and members of the family mistakenly referred to it as a "piece of brontosaurus." The skin was later lost but it inspired Chatwin decades later to visit Patagonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Bruce|title=In Patagonia|date=1977|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=4475 Utz, Richard. "In Patagonia". The Literary Encyclopedia. 09 March 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Chatwin was hired by the ''[[Sunday Times Magazine]]'' as an adviser on art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer [[Eileen Gray]] in her [[Paris]] salon, where he noticed a map of the area of [[South America]] called [[Patagonia]] which she had painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I've always wanted to go there," Bruce told her. "So have I," she replied, "go there for me." 

==In Patagonia==

Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to [[Lima]] in Peru and reached Patagonia a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shakespeare|1999|pp=287–291}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later claim that he sent a [[telegram]] to his editor merely stating: "Have gone to Patagonia." Actually he sent a letter: "I am doing a story there for myself, something I have always wanted to write up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent six months in the area, travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there. He used his quest for his own "piece of brontosaurus" (the one from his grandparents' cabinet had been thrown away years earlier) to frame the story of his trip. 

Chatwin described ''In Patagonia'' as "the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one&amp;nbsp;... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage: the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal: on his way he lands in strange situations, people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatwin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Under the Sun|date=2010|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The book is highly experimental in the way that it is structured. It is divided into a total of 97 separate sections, some of which are as short as a lone paragraph. In a sense this construction with its frequent use of digression, rather than a standard linear structure, mirrors one of the underlying themes of the work as a whole: a meditation upon wandering and nomadism in human life. This is accentuated by the fact that many of the narratives of the people that Chatwin meets in the work involve discussions of the nomadic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacFarlane|first1=Robert|title=Book of a Lifetime: In Patagonia, By Bruce Chatwin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-in-patagonia-by-bruce-chatwin-7873053.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
This work established Chatwin's reputation as a travel writer. One of his biographers, [[Nicholas Murray (biographer)|Nicholas Murray]], called ''In Patagonia'' "one of the most strikingly original postwar English travel books"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that it revitalised the genre of travel writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1993|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a "little masterpiece of travel, history, and adventure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0142437190 Review at Powell's Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Some reviewers{{who|date=February 2016}} compared it with classics of travel literature such as ''Travels'' by [[Sir John Mandeville]], ''[[Eothen]]'' by [[Alexander Kinglake]] and ''[[The Road to Oxiana]]'' by [[Robert Byron]].

However, residents in the region contradicted the account of events depicted in Chatwin's book. It was the first time in his career, but not the last, that conversations and characters which Chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''In Patagonia'' contains 15 black and white photographs by Chatwin. According to [[Susannah Clapp]], who edited the book, "[[Rebecca West]] amused Chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous the entire text of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapp|title=With Chatwin|date=1996|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==

For ''In Patagonia'' Chatwin received the [[Hawthornden Prize]] and the [[E. M. Forster Award]] from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|title=Bruce Chatwin|date=1999|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fascism sidebar}}
'''Integral nationalism''' ({{lang-fr|nationalisme intégral}}) is a type of [[nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;David Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ruiGAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Contemporary Nationalism], Routledge, 2003, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More recently, [[Peter Alter]] discussed integral nationalism in his book ''Nationalismus'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Integral nationalism is one of five types of [[nationalism]] defined by [[Carlton Hayes]] in his 1928 book ''The Historical Evolution of Modern Nationalism.''&lt;/ref&gt; originated in 19th-century [[France]] and opposed to [[Risorgimento nationalism]].

==Overview==
Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a [[nation]] seeking to establish a liberal [[State (polity)|state]] (for example the [[Risorgimento]] in [[Italy]] and similar movements in [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Japan]] in the 19th century or [[civic nationalism]], e.g., [[American nationalism]]), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved [[independence]] and has already established a state. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism. Some of the qualities that characterise integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive [[expansionist]] [[militarism]]. Integral states are [[totalitarian]] and the government or state dominates all aspects of society.

Integral nationalism generally tends to arise in states (such as colonies or countries that do not have [[sovereignty]]) where a strong [[military]] ethos has become entrenched through a struggle for independence, resulting in the belief that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state once the state attains independence. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.

== Terminology ==

The literal use of the phrase "Islamic terrorism" is disputed. Such use in Western political speech has variously been called "counter-productive", "highly politicized, intellectually contestable" and "damaging to community relations".&lt;ref name="Jackson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Richard|year=2007|title=Constructing Enemies: 'Islamic Terrorism' in Political and Academic Discourse|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1477-7053.2007.00229.x/abstract|journal=Government and Opposition|publisher=Wiley Online Library|volume=42|issue=3|pages=394–426|doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.2007.00229.x|issn=0017-257X|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others have referred to the refusal to use the term as an act of "self-deception", "full-blown censorship" and "intellectual dishonesty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436507/orlando-attack-was-islamic-terrorism-obama-still-refuses-name-it|title=Obama Would Rather Declare War on the English Language than Speak of Islamic Terrorism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/04/04/4-things-to-know-about-obama-censoring-the-words-islamist-terrorism/|title=4 Problems With Obama Censoring 'Islamist Terrorism'|first=|last=Terrorism|date=4 April 2016|website=The Federalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/06/20/obama-admin-deletes-isis-references-from-orlando-911-calls/|title=Obama Admin Deletes ISIS References From Orlando 911 Calls|first=|last=Terrorism|date=20 June 2016|website=The Federalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/why-cant-we-talk-frankly-about-islamic-terrorism/news-story/3d27bc22b4d3044c6d6afba794563e87|title=Why can't we talk frankly about Islamic terrorism?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some Muslim commentators assert that extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach of ''[[takfir]]'', whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/ |title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failed post-colonial attempts at state formation and the creation of Israel, a series of Marxist and anti-Western transformations and movements swept throughout the Arab and Islamic world. The growth of these nationalist and revolutionary movements, along with their views that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals, generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as Al Fatah and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel's [[Six-Day War|1967 defeat of Arab forces]], Palestinian leaders began to see that the Arab world was unable to militarily confront Israel. During the same time, lessons drawn from revolutionary movements in Latin America, North Africa, Southeast Asia as well as during the Jewish struggle against Britain in Palestine, saw the Palestinians turn away from classic guerrilla, a typically rural-based, warfare toward urban terrorism. The year 1979 was a turning point in international terrorism. Throughout the Arab world and the West, the Iranian Islamic revolution ignited fears of a wave of revolutionary Shia Islam. Meanwhile, the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and the subsequent anti-Soviet mujahedin war, lasting from 1979 to 1989, started the rise and expansion of terrorist groups. Since their beginning in 1994, the Pakistani-supported [[Taliban]] militia in Afghanistan has gained several characteristics traditionally associated with state-sponsors of terrorism, providing logistical support, travel documentation, and training facilities. Since 1989 the increasing willingness of religious extremists to strike targets outside immediate country or regional areas highlights the global nature of contemporary terrorism. The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, are representative of this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/modern.html| title=The Evolution of Islamic Terrorism: an Overview|author=John Moore|publisher=PBS Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship issues===

Since World War II, Muslim immigrants have emigrated to [[Western world|western countries]] in large numbers because fellow Muslim countries that are well-off economically and socially do not accept them. Out of the 57 Muslim majority countries, only two nations (Turkey and Malaysia) offer a formal path for immigrants to become naturalized citizens, regardless of birthplace, religious beliefs, marital status or ethnic origin. Even the oil-rich [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf states]] do not grant citizenship to immigrants, regardless of how long they have resided in those countries. To make matters more difficult, Gulf states have stringent laws which explicitly state that an immigrant or [[Expatriate|expat]] can become a citizen only if his/her father was a citizen or, in some cases, if an expat woman marries an Arab national. These laws make it almost impossible for expats (both Muslim and non-Muslim) to gain citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfbusiness.com/2014/01/gcc-citizenship-debate-a-place-to-call-home/#.U5eL0lJOVdh |title=GCC Citizenship Debate: A Place To Call Home |publisher=Gulf Business |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/gcc-residents-demand-gulf-states-grant-citizenship-122557.html|title=GCC residents demand Gulf states grant citizenship – Politics &amp; Economics|date=2007-12-17|publisher=ArabianBusiness.com|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the self-appointed [[Caliph]] [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], the leader of the unrecognised [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], took advantage of this resentment among some Muslims living in other Arab states and urged those Muslims to emigrate to the new Islamic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1293113/isis-urges-muslims-to-emigrate-to-new-state|title=ISIS Urges Muslims To Emigrate To 'New State'|work=Sky News|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIS, also known as "The Islamic State", promised all Muslim immigrants "citizenship" immediately upon arrival. They even went as far as issuing "Caliphate Passports" to the newly arrived immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/05/ISIS-allegedly-issues-caliphate-passport.html |title=ISIS allegedly issues 'caliphate' passport |publisher=Al Arabia |date=July 5, 2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic motivations===
The Muslim world has been afflicted with economic stagnation for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Chaney |format=PDF |url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~webfac/cromer/e211_f07/chaney.pdf |title=Economic Development, Religious Competition, and the Rise and Fall of Muslim Science |publisher=eml.berkeley.edu |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/04/opinion/opinion_30018026.php |title=Islamic world faces intellectual stagnation |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828012553/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/04/opinion/opinion_30018026.php |archivedate=2013-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] stated that apart from crude oil, the exports of the entire [[Greater Middle East]] with its 400 million population roughly equals that of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-economics-of-obamas-arab-spring-speech/2011/05/19/AFIh0K7G_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | date=19 May 2011 | first=Michelle | last=Singletary | title=The economics of Obama's Arab Spring speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been estimated that the exports of Finland, a European country of only five million, exceeded those of the entire 370 million-strong [[Arab world]], excluding [[Crude oil|oil]] and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2002-01-27/how-the-islamic-world-lost-its-edge|title=How the Islamic World Lost Its Edge|work=Businessweek.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic stagnation is argued by historian David Fromkin in his work [[A Peace to End All Peace]] to have commenced with the demise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1924, with trade networks being disrupted and societies torn apart with the creation of new nation states. Although the Ottoman Empire was referred to as the [[Sick man of Europe]], the parts of the Middle East under Ottoman rule still had a diverse and steady growing economy with more general prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/klieman/ps132a/fromkin.pdf|title=A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East, 1914–1922|last=Fromkin|first=David|publisher=Andre Deutsch|year=1989|format=PDF|authorlink=David Fromkin|origyear=1989|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822010735/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/klieman/ps132a/fromkin.pdf|archivedate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity-based frameworks for analyzing Islamist-based terrorism===
Islamist-based fundamentalist terrorism against Western nations and the U.S. in particular, has numerous motivations and takes place the larger context of a complex and tense relationship between the 'West' and the Arab and Muslim 'world,'&lt;ref&gt;"The Muslim world and the West: the roots of conflict". 2005. Web. 16 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which is highlighted in the previous section on motivations and Islamic terrorism. Identity-based theoretical frameworks, including theories of [[social identity]], social categorization theory, and [[psychodynamics]] are used to explain the reasons terrorism occurs.&lt;ref&gt;"Perspectives on Terrorism – Explaining Terrorism: A Psychosocial Approach". Web. 16 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social identity]] is explained by Karina Korostelina as a "feeling of belonging to a social group, as a strong connection with social category, and as an important part of our mind that affects our social perceptions and behavior"&lt;ref name="Korostelina, K. 2007"&gt;Korostelina, K. (2007). Social Identity and Conflict: Structures, Dynamics and Implications. New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This definition can be applied to the case of [[Osama bin Laden]], who, according to this theory, had a highly salient perception of his social identity as a Muslim, a strong connection to the social category of the Muslim [[Ummah]] or 'community,' which affect his social perceptions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;"Osama bin Laden's growing anxiety". ''The Christian Science Monitor'' – CSMonitor.com. Web. 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden's ideology and interpretation of Islam led to the creation of al-Qaeda in response to perceived threats against the Muslim community by the Soviet Union, the U.S. in particular due to its troop presence in Saudi Arabia, and American support for Israel.&lt;ref name="Israel National News 2010"&gt;"[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/133413 Al-Qaeda Blames 9/11 on US Support for Israel – Defense/Middle East – Israel National News.]" Web. 16 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda has a group identity, which includes "shared experiences, attitudes, beliefs, and interests of in-group members", and is "described through the achievement of a collective aim for which this group has been created",&lt;ref name="Korostelina, K. 2007"/&gt; which in this case is to achieve "a complete break from the foreign influences in [[Muslim countries]], and the creation of a new Islamic [[caliphate]]".

Social categorization theory has been discussed as a three-stage process of identification, where "individuals define themselves as members of a [[social group]], learn the stereotypes and norms of the group, and group categories influence the perception and understanding of all situations in a particular context"&lt;ref name="Korostelina, K. 2007"/&gt; This definition can be applied to the US-led [[war on terror]], in which conflict features such as the phenomenon of [[Anti-Americanism]]&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Arab anti-Americanism". Lee Smith  ''Slate''. Web. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the phenomenon of non-Arab countries like [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] lending support to Islamist-based terrorism by funding or harboring terrorist groups such as Hezbollah&lt;ref&gt;"Hizballah (Party of God)". Web. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and al-Qaeda&lt;ref&gt;"Analysis Of Al Qaeda In Afghanistan and Pakistan". ''Eurasia Review''. Web. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; against Western nations, particularly [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hezbollah and its Goals". Web. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;"Al-Qaida". Web. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; are, according to social categorization theory, influenced by a three-stage process of identification. In this three-stage process of identification, the Arab and Muslim world(s) are the social group(s), in which their members learn [[stereotype]]s and [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which categorize their social group vis-à-vis [[Western world|the West]].&lt;ref&gt;"Global Connections. Stereotypes". PBS. Web. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This social categorization process creates feelings of high-level in-group support and allegiance among Arabs and Muslims and the particular context within which members of the Arab and Muslim world(s) social group(s) understand all situations that involve the West. Social categorization theory as a framework for analysis indicates causal relationships between group identification processes and features of conflict situations.&lt;ref&gt;Korostelina, K. (2007) ''Social Identity and Conflict: Structures, Dynamics and Implications''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===
{{Jihadism sidebar}}

One ideology that plays a role in terrorism by using the name of Islam, is [[Wahabism]].&lt;ref name="School2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naval Postgraduate Naval Postgraduate School|title=Wahhabism: Is It a Factor in the Spread of Global Terrorism?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25JPrgEACAAJ|date=19 March 2015|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1508936138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Allen|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|title=God's Terrorists: The Wahhabi Cult and the Hidden Roots of Modern Jihad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKK0_bM-4n8C|date=1 March 2009|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0786733002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeLong-Bas2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwX_UJ-p2rsC&amp;pg=PA4|title=Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2007|isbn=978-1845113223|pages=4–|author=Natana J.

Transnational [[Islamism|Islamist]] ideology, specifically of the militant Islamists, assert that Western policies and society are actively anti-Islamic, or as it is sometimes described, waging a "[[war against Islam]]". Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], dating back as far as the [[Crusades]], among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. [[Osama bin Laden]], for example, almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. [[Defensive jihad]] differs from offensive jihad by being "[[fard]] al-ayn", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than "fard al-kifaya", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required of others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than appearing to be an aggressor, and giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.

Many of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and [[Israel]]. An example is bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which is also known as "International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders". Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and they often oppose its very existence.

According to [[U.S. Army]] Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, "ideology", rather than any individual or group, is the "center of gravity" of al-Qaeda and related groups, and that ideology is a "collection of violent Islamic thought called [[Qutbism]]".&lt;ref name="eikmeier"/&gt; He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:
* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to "pure Islam" as originally practiced during the time of [[Muhammad]].
* The path to "pure Islam" is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], along with implementation of Muhammad's commands.
* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.
* That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudential tradition]] is mere sophistry.&lt;ref name="eikmeier"/&gt;

The historic rivalry between [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Muslims in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]] has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, India topped the list of countries most affected by Islamic terrorism.

In addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as [[Morality|immoral]] [[secularism]]. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of [[pornography]], [[immorality]], [[secularism]], [[homosexuality]], [[feminism]], and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about them in his messages, in his "Letter to America", he answered the question, "What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?" with

&lt;blockquote&gt;We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed 24 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Retrieved 30 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Reuters]] reported that pornography was found among the materials seized from [[Death of Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad compound that was raided by U.S. Navy SEALs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/13/us-binladen-porn-idUSTRE74C4RK20110513 Exclusive: Pornography found in bin Laden hideout: officials], "Reuters",  13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Britain's then head of [[MI5]] [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]] said of Al-Qaeda that it "has developed an ideology which claims that Islam is under attack, and needs to be defended". "This," she said "is a powerful narrative that weaves together conflicts from across the globe, presenting the West's response to varied and complex issues, from long-standing disputes such as Israel/Palestine and Kashmir to more recent events as evidence of an across-the-board determination to undermine and humiliate Islam worldwide."&lt;ref name="EM-B"&gt;{{cite web|first=Eliza|last=Manningham-Buller|authorlink=Eliza Manningham-Buller|url=http://www.icjs-online.org/index.php?article=1121|title=Transcript of speech: The International Terrorist Threat to the UK|publisher=ICJS Research|date=November 10, 2006|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that the video wills of [[United Kingdom|British]] suicide bombers made it clear that they were motivated by perceived worldwide and long-standing injustices against Muslims; an extreme and minority interpretation of Islam promoted by some preachers and people of influence; their interpretation as anti-Muslim of UK foreign policy, in particular the UK's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan."&lt;ref name="EM-B"/&gt; She also cautioned how difficult it was to gain a proper perspective, saying that although there are more important dangers we face daily without feeling so threatened by them, such as climate change and road deaths, and though terrorist deaths were few, the intelligence services had prevented some potentially large threats and that vigilance was needed.&lt;ref name="EM-B"/&gt;

Colonel Eikmeier points out the "questionable religious credentials" of many Islamist theorists, or "Qutbists", which can be a "means to discredit them and their message":

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the exception of [[Abul Ala Maududi]] and [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], none of Qutbism's main theoreticians trained at Islam's recognized centers of learning. Although a devout Muslim, [[Hassan al-Banna]] was a teacher and community activist. [[Sayyid Qutb]] was a literary critic. [[Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag]] was an electrician. Ayman al-Zawahiri is a physician. Osama bin Laden trained to be a businessman.&lt;ref name="eikmeier"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eikmeier|first=Dale C.|date=Spring 2007|title=Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism|url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm|journal=[[Parameters (journal)|Parameters]]|volume=XXXVII|issue=1|pages=85–98|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609120804/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm|archivedate=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religious motivation===
[[Daniel Benjamin]] and [[Steven Simon]], in their book, ''The Age of Sacred Terror'', argue that Islamic terrorist attacks are purely religious. They are seen as "a sacrament ... intended to restore to the universe a moral order that had been corrupted by the enemies of Islam." It is neither political or strategic but an "act of redemption" meant to "humiliate and slaughter those who defied the hegemony of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Age of Sacred Terror|page=40|author=Daniel Benjamin|author2=Steven Simon|year=2002|isbn=978-0756767518|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Kouachi brothers responsible for the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] called a French journalist, saying, "We are the defenders of Prophet Mohammed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/13/opinion/bergen-islam-terrorism/index.html | title=Does Islam fuel terrorism? | publisher=CNN | date=13 January 2015 | accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two studies of the background of Muslim terrorists in Europe—one of the UK and one of France—found little connection between religious piety and terrorism. According to a "restricted" report of hundreds of case studies by the UK domestic counter-intelligence agency [[MI5]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;[f]ar from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation.&lt;ref name=Travis-20-8-2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Travis|first1=Alan|title=MI5 report challenges views on terrorism in Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2015 "general portrait" by Olivier Roy (see above) of "the conditions and circumstances" under which people living in France become "Islamic radicals" (terrorists or would-be terrorists) found radicalisation was not an "uprising of a Muslim community that is victim to poverty and racism: only young people join, including converts".&lt;ref name=roy-inside&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roy |first=Olivier |date=18 December 2015 |title=What is the driving force behind jihadist terrorism? |url=http://insidestory.org.au/what-is-the-driving-force-behind-jihadist-terrorism |accessdate=25 February 2016 |magazine=Inside Story |issn=1837-0497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy believes terrorism/radicalism is "expressed in religious terms" because

# most of the radicals have a Muslim background, which makes them open to a process of re-Islamisation ("almost none of them having been pious before entering the process of radicalisation"), and&lt;ref name=roy-inside/&gt;
# jihad is "the only cause on the global market". If you kill in silence, it will be reported by the local newspaper; "if you kill yelling 'Allahuakbar', you are sure to make the national headlines". Other extreme causes—ultra-left or radical ecology are "too bourgeois and intellectual" for the radicals.&lt;ref name=roy-inside/&gt;

According to Indonesian Islamic leader Yahya Cholil Staquf in a 2017 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] interview, according to classical Islamic tradition, the relationship between Muslims and Non-Muslims is one of segregation and enmity. In his view extremism and terrorism are linked with orthodox Islam and that radical Islamic movements are nothing new. He also added that Western politicians should stop pretending that extremism is not linked to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4930742/islam-terrorism-islamophobia-violence/|title=Orthodox Islam and Violence 'Linked' Says Top Muslim Scholar|last=|first=|date=|website=Time|access-date=2017-12-27|quote=Western politicians should stop pretending that extremism and terrorism have nothing to do with Islam.

====Interpretations of the Qur'an and Hadith====
{{see also|Quran and violence}}

Donald Holbrook, a Research Fellow at the [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], analyzes a sample of 30 works by jihadist propagandists and finds several passages of the Quran exploited and distorted to suit the objectives of violent jihad.&lt;ref name=holbrook1/&gt; [[An-Nisa]] (4:74–75) is quoted most frequently; other popular passages are [[At-Taubah]] (9:13–15, 38–39, 111) and [[Al-Baqarah]] (2:190–191, 216). Consider [[Sword Verse|Surah 9:5]]:

{{quote|But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. But if they repent and fulfill their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.}}

Holbrook notes they cherry-picked the first part "slay the idolaters" but fail to quote and discuss limiting factors at the end of the [[ayat]], "but if they repent …"  This, Holbrook argues, is how violent jihadists are "shamelessly selective in order to serve their propaganda objectives."&lt;ref name=holbrook1/&gt; Peter Bergen notes that bin Laden cited this verse in 1998 when making a formal declaration of war.&lt;ref name=bergen150113&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/opinion/bergen-islam-terrorism/|title=Does Islam fuel terrorism?|author=[[Peter Bergen]]|work=CNN|date=13 Jan 2015|accessdate=28 Jun 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Sells]] and Jane I. Smith (a Professor of Islamic Studies) write that barring some extremists like [[al-Qaeda]], most Muslims do not interpret Qur'anic verses as promoting warfare today but rather as reflecting historically dated contexts.&lt;ref name="Sells"&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Sells | title=Understanding, Not Indoctrination | url=https://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/msells.htm|date=August 8, 2002 | publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author=Jane I. Smith | title=Islam and Christianity | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Christianity | publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 | isbn=978-0195223934}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sells, "[Most Muslims] no more expect to apply [the verses at issue] to their contemporary non-Muslim friends and neighbors than most Christians and Jews consider themselves commanded by God, like the Biblical [[Joshua]], to exterminate the [[infidel]]s."&lt;ref name="Sells"/&gt; In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam]]'', [[Iranian-American]] academic [[Reza Aslan]] argues that there is an internal battle currently taking place within Islam between [[individualism|individualistic]] reform ideals and the [[ulama|traditional authority of Muslim clerics]]&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Shasha|title=No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SBL/is_1-2_19/ai_n15340018/|date=January 2002|journal = International Journal of Kurdish Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  similar to that of the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation|reformation]] in [[Christianity]], which was as old as Islam currently is at that period.&lt;ref name=stan&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2006/pr-aslan-102506.html Author of No god but God: The Origins, Evolution and Future of Islam to speak on campus].

Accessed May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes, "the notion that historical context should play no role in the interpretation of the Koran—that what applied to Muhammad's community applies to all Muslim communities for all time—is simply an untenable position in every sense."&lt;ref name=times&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/books/review/29RODENBE.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 'No god but God': The War Within Islam (Book Review)] |By Max Rodenbeck| nytimes.com| May 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Beginning with the 7th-century AD [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquests|era of Muslim conquests]], and continuing on until the 21st-century resurgence of Muslim violence on non-Muslims in the name of "[[Jihad]]", many have debated whether Islam was fundamentally a religion of peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=President and Founder of the Christian Apologetic and Research Ministry, Matt Slick |url=http://carm.org/religious-movements/islam/islam-religion-peace-and-terrorism |title=Islam, the religion of peace, and terrorism|work=carm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of violence, or perhaps of some combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Political Language of Islam |last=Lewis |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Lewis |year=1988 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226476928 |page=72}} Cf. {{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=William M. |editor1-first=Thomas P. |editor1-last=Murphy |title=The Holy War |year=1976 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=978-0814202456 |page=143 |chapter=Islamic Conceptions of the Holy War}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Supporters of bin Laden have also pointed to reports according to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad attacked towns at night or with catapults, and argued that he must have condoned incidental harm to noncombatants, since it would have been impossible to distinguish them from combatants during such attacks.&lt;ref name="peters-cook"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2014|title=Jihād|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199739356.001.0001/acref-9780199739356-e-0263|last=Peters|first=Rudolph|first2=David|last2=Cook|subscription=yes|doi=10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199739356.001.0001/acref-9780199739356-e-0263|doi-broken-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments were not widely accepted by Muslims.&lt;ref name=peters-cook/&gt;{{additional citation|date=January 2018}}

====Jihad and Islamic jurisprudence====
{{main|Jihad}}

The [[Princeton University]] Middle Eastern scholar [[Bernard Lewis]] states that classical [[Islamic jurisprudence]] does not allow terrorism, and the "classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered [jihad] the kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard, 'Islam: The Religion and the People' (2009). pp. 53, 145–50&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Professor Lewis noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bernard Lewis |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1001547201928681240 |title=Jihad vs. Crusade |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=September 27, 2001 |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Being a religious obligation, jihad is elaborately regulated in sharia law, which discusses in minute detail such matters as the opening, conduct, interruption and cessation of hostilities, the treatment of prisoners and noncombatants, the use of weapons, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari 50:891&lt;/ref&gt;... Similarly, the laws of Jihad categorically preclude wanton and indiscriminate slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Quran (8:12)&lt;/ref&gt; The warriors in the holy war are urged not to harm non-combatants, women and children, "unless they attack you first". ... A point on which they insist is the need for a clear declaration of war before beginning hostilities, and for proper warning before resuming hostilities after a truce. What the classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered is the kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations that we saw in New York two weeks ago. For this there is no precedent and no authority in Islam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While techniques of war are restricted by classical Islamic jurisprudence, the scope is not. Lewis states that Jihad is an unlimited offensive to bring the whole world under Islamic rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard, ''The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2000 Years'', pp. 233–34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fiqh#Diagram of early scholars|Classical Islamic jurisprudence]] imposes, without limit of time or space, the duty to subjugate non-Muslims, according to Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard, ''The Political Language of Islam'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wael Hallaq]] writes that in the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbOtAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA335|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|page=335|author=Wael B. Hallaq|isbn=978-1107394124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While modernists view jihad as defensive and compatible with modern standards of warfare, some Islamists go beyond the classical theory to insist that the purpose of jihad is the fight against oppressive regimes and conversion of non-Muslims to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbOtAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA338|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|pages=338–39|author=Wael B. Hallaq|isbn=978-1107394124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal motivations===
[[Scott Atran]] has found the greatest predictors of suicide bombings to be not religion but group dynamics:
While personal humiliation does not turn out to be a motivation for those attempting to kill civilians, the perception that others with whom one feels a common bond are being humiliated can be a powerful driver for action. "Small-group dynamics involving friends and family that form the [[diaspora]] cell of [[fraternity|brotherhood]] and [[camaraderie]] on which the rising tide of martyrdom actions is based".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism] pp. 138, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorists, according to Atran, are social beings influenced by social connections and values. Rather than dying "for a cause", they might be said to have died "for each other".&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/scott-atran-talking-to-the-enemy-review|title=Talking to the Enemy by Scott Atran – [book] review|date=23 October 2010|agency=The Observer|last1=Burke|first1=Jason|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Cottee in the ''New York Times'' suggested that [[sexual frustration]] is a major motivating factor in Islamist suicide bombing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/opinion/sex-shame-incels-jihadists-minassian.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western foreign policy===

For example, [[Hezbollah]] initiated suicide bombings after a complex reworking of the [[martyrdom in Islam|concept of martyrdom]]. Kramer explains that the [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)|Israeli occupation of the South Lebanon Security Zone]] raised the temperature necessary for this reinterpretation of Islam, but occupation alone would not have been sufficient for suicide terrorism.&lt;ref name=kramer2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2401 |title=Suicide Terrorism in the Middle East: Origins and Response |publisher=Washingtoninstitute.org |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112232504/http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2401 |archivedate=January 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The only way to apply a brake to suicide terrorism," Kramer argues, "is to undermine its moral logic, by encouraging Muslims to see its incompatibility with their own values."&lt;ref name=kramer2010/&gt;

Former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Michael Scheuer]] argues that terrorist attacks (specifically [[al-Qaeda]] attacks on targets in the United States) are ''not'' motivated by a religiously inspired hatred of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] or religion, but by the belief that [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East,&lt;ref name="Scheuer 2004 9"&gt;Scheuer (2004), p. 9&lt;br&gt;
"The focused and lethal threat posed to U.S. national security arises not from Muslims being offended by what America is, but rather from their plausible perception that the things they most love and value—God, Islam, their brethren, and Muslim lands—are being attacked by America."&lt;/ref&gt; condensed in the phrase "They hate us for what we do, not who we are." U.S. foreign policy actions Scheuer believes are fueling Islamic terror include: the US–led intervention in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq; [[Israel–United States relations]], namely, financial, military, and political support for [[Israel]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/us-support-for-israel-prompted-911-osama-bin-laden/story-e6frg6so-1225772727712|title=US Support for Israel prompted 9/11|publisher=The Australian|agency=AFP|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John J.]] and [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]]|title=The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0374177724 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Six-shot-one-killed-at-Seattle-Jewish-federation-1210235.php#ixzz1hCIBKtsf.|title= Six shot, one killed at Seattle Jewish federation | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/25/nyregion/the-gunman-premeditated-the-attack-officials-say.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title= The Gunman Premeditated The Attack, Officials Say|accessdate= | work=The New York Times|first=Matthew|last=Purdy|date=25 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. support for "[[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]]" [[police state]]s in Muslim nations such as Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Kuwait;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/front/interviews/scheuer.html|title= Frontline: Al Qaeda's New Front: Interviews: Michael Scheuer|accessdate=March 8, 2008 |work= |quote= Bin Laden has had success because he's focused on a limited number of U.S. foreign policies in the Muslim world, policies that are visible and are experienced by Muslims on a daily basis: our unqualified support for Israel; our ability to keep oil prices at a level that is more or less acceptable to Western consumers.

[[Maajid Nawaz]], in a debate with [[Mehdi Hasan]], countered Scheuer's contention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a tiny minority, from within the non-Iraqi British Muslim communities, reacted with violence on 7 July 2005. To interpret this simply as a "nationalist struggle" to remove occupation ignores the blatantly obvious fact that, first, the terrorists were not Iraqis, they were British-Pakistanis (though British Iraqis have lived here for a long time); second, the vast majority of the Stop the War protesters were non-Muslims, yet only a handful from among a minority of Muslims reacted to the war with terrorism. Even though occupation may have caused agitation among the 7 July bombers, these northern-born lads with thick Yorkshire accents confessed in their suicide tapes to considering themselves soldiers with a mission to kill our people (Britons) on behalf of their people (Iraqis). The prerequisite to such a disavowal of one's country of birth is a recalibration of identity; this is the undeniable role of ideological narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/07/age-extremes-muslim-mehdi-hasan-maajid-mawaz|title= Age of extremes: Mehdi Hasan and Maajid Nawaz debate |work= New Statesman |date= 4 July 2012|accessdate=24 October 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Profiles of terrorists==

According to [[Scott Atran]], a [[NATO]] researcher studying suicide terrorism, the available evidence contradicts a number of simplistic explanations for the motivations of terrorists, including mental instability, poverty, and feelings of humiliation.&lt;ref name="burke" /&gt;

Forensic psychiatrist and former foreign service officer [[Marc Sageman]] made an "intensive study of biographical data on 172 participants in the jihad", in his book ''Understanding Terror Networks''.&lt;ref&gt;Sageman (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded [[social network]]s, the "tight bonds of family and friendship", rather than [[emotional and behavioral disorders]] of "poverty, trauma, madness, [or] ignorance", inspired [[Social alienation|alienated]] young Muslims to join the jihad and kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14036.html |title=Understanding Terror Networks|author= [[Marc Sageman]]|publisher=Upenn.edu |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Lawrence Wright]] described the characteristic of "[[displacement (psychology)|displacement]]" of members of the most famous Islamic terrorist group, al-Qaeda:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What the recruits tended to have in common—besides their urbanity, their [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] backgrounds, their education, their facility with languages, and their computer skills—was displacement. Most who joined the jihad did so in a country other than the one in which they were reared. They were Algerians living in [[expatriate]] enclaves in France, [[Moroccans]] in Spain, or [[Yemen]]is in Saudi Arabia. Despite their accomplishments, they had little standing in the host societies where they lived.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Loming Tower'' (2006), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholar [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the background of the hundreds of ''global'' (as opposed to local) terrorists who were incarcerated or killed and for whom authorities have records, as being surprising for their Westernized background; for the lack of [[Palestinians]], [[Iraqis]], [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] "coming to avenge what is going on in their country"; their lack of religiosity before being "born again" in a foreign country; the high percentage of converts to Islam among them; their "de-territorialized backgrounds"—"For instance, they may be born in a country, then educated in another country, then go to fight in a third country and take refuge in a fourth country"; their nontraditional belief that jihad is permanent, global, and "not linked with a specific territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olivier Roy Interview (2007): Conversations with History |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people7/Roy/roy07-con5.html |publisher=Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This profile differs from that found among recent local (as opposed to global) Islamist suicide bombers in Afghanistan, according to a 2007 study of 110 suicide bombers by Afghan pathologist Dr. Yusef Yadgari. Yadgari found that 80% of the attackers studied had some kind of physical or mental disability. The bombers were also "not celebrated like their counterparts in other Muslim nations. Afghan bombers are not featured on posters or in videos as martyrs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15276485 |title=Disabled Often Carry Out Afghan Suicide Missions |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Byman, a Middle East expert at the [[Brookings Institution]], and Christine Fair, an assistant professor in peace and security studies at [[Georgetown University]], say that many of the Islamic terrorists are foolish and untrained, perhaps even untrainable.&lt;ref name="Byman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-case-for-calling-them-nitwits/8130/|title=The Case for Calling Them Nitwits|authorlink2=C.

Studying 300 cases of people charged with jihadist terrorism in the United States since September 11, 2001, author [[Peter Bergen]] found the perpetrators were "generally motivated by a mix of factors", including "militant Islamist ideology; dislike of American foreign policy in the Muslim world; a need to attach themselves to an ideology or organization that gave them a sense of purpose"; and a "cognitive opening" to militant Islam that often was "precipitated by personal disappointment, like the death of a parent".&lt;ref name="Bergen-15-6-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bergen|first1=Peter|title=Why Do Terrorists Commit Terrorism?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/opinion/why-do-terrorists-commit-terrorism.html?_r=0|accessdate=16 June 2016|agency=New York Times|date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslim attitudes toward terrorism==
{{Main|Muslim attitudes towards terrorism}}

Muslim popular opinion on the subject of attacks on civilians by Islamist groups varies. [[Fred Halliday]], a British academic specialist on the Middle East, argues that most Muslims consider these acts to be egregious violations of Islam's laws.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Fred: ''Islam and the Myth of Confrontation: Religion and Politics in the Middle East'' (New York: I.B. Tauris, 2003), 107&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims living in the West denounce the September 11th attacks against United States, while Hezbollah contends that their rocket attacks against Israeli targets are [[defensive jihad|defensive Jihad]] by a legitimate [[resistance movement]] rather than terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/statement01.html |title=Statement of purpose |publisher=Almashriq.hiof.no |date=March 20, 1998 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/hizballah-background.html |title=Hizbullah: Views and Concepts |publisher=Almashriq.hiof.no |date=June 20, 1997 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of modern Islamic scholars===

[[Charles Kurzman]] and other authors have collected statements by prominent Muslim figures and organizations condemning terrorism.&lt;ref name=kurzman/&gt;

Although Islamic terrorism is commonly associated with the [[Salafi]]s (or "[[Wahhabi]]s"), the scholars of the group have constantly attributed this association to ignorance, misunderstanding and sometimes insincere research and deliberate misleading by rival groups.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021337/http://www.salafimanhaj.com/pdf/SalafiManhaj_NYPD.pdf "The Book, "Is Salafiyyah a cause of Terrorism"]"&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh]], the [[Grand Mufti]] of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, made an official statement that "the Islamic Sharee'ah (legislation) does not sanction" such actions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/downloads/pdf/CAF020015.pdf "The Mufti of Saudi Arabia on the New York Attacks]"&lt;/ref&gt; A Salafi "Committee of Major Scholars" in Saudi Arabia has declared that "Islamic" terrorism, such as the May 2003 [[Riyadh compound bombings|bombing in Riyadh]], are in violation of [[Sharia]] law and aiding the enemies of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/downloads/pdf/CAF020016.pdf  "The Major Scholars on the Salafi Position Towards the Suicide Bombings by the Khawaarij in Riyadh]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Winter]] wrote that the proclamations of bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] "ignore 14 centuries of Muslim scholarship", and that if they "followed the norms of their religion, they would have had to acknowledge that no school of mainstream Islam allows the targeting of civilians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamfortoday.com/murad04.htm|title=Abdal-Hakim Murad, Bin Laden's Violence is a Heresy Against Islam|publisher=Islamfortoday.com|accessdate=April 25, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103130922/http://islamfortoday.com/murad04.htm|archivedate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fethullah Gülen]], a prominent Turkish [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]], has claimed (c.f. [[No True Scotsman]]) that "a real Muslim", who understood Islam in every aspect, could not be a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Ali Gomaa]], former [[Grand Mufti]] of Egypt, stated not only for the Islam but in general: "Terrorism cannot be born of religion. Terrorism is the product of corrupt minds, hardened hearts, and arrogant egos, and corruption, destruction, and arrogance are unknown to the heart attached to the divine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.themuslimtimes.org/2013/07/religion/terrorism-has-no-religion|title= Terrorism has no religion|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to suicide attacks, Hannah Stuart notes there is a "significant debate among contemporary clerics over which circumstance permit such attacks."  Qatar-based theologian, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], criticized the 9/11 attacks but previously justified suicide bombings in Israel on the grounds of necessity and justified such attacks in 2004 against American military and civilian personnel in Iraq. According to Stuart, 61 contemporary Islamic leaders have issued fatawa permitting suicide attacks, 32 with respect to Israel. Stuart points out that all of these contemporary rulings are contrary to classical [[Islamic jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="Stuart1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Countering Radicalization and Violent Extremism Among Youth to Prevent Terrorism|publisher=IOS Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1614994695|pages=74–76|author=Hannah Stuart|editor=Marco Lombardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Pakistani clerics of [[Jamaat Ahle Sunnat|Jamaat Ahl-e-Sunnah]] ([[Barelvi]] movement) who were gathered for a convention denounced suicide attacks and beheadings as un-Islamic in a unanimous resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Top-Pak-clerics-declare-suicide-attacks-un-Islamic/articleshow/4543693.cms|title=Top Pak clerics declare suicide attacks un-Islamic|publisher=The Times of India|date=May 17, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2013 in [[Lahore]], 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings.

===Opinion surveys===
* [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] conducted tens of thousands of hour-long, face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries between 2001 and 2007. It found that more than 90% of respondents condemned the killing of non-combatants on religious and humanitarian grounds.&lt;ref name="australia.to"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/al-qaida-today-the-fate-of-a-movement|title=Al-Qaida today: a movement at the crossroads|work=openDemocracy|author=Fawaz A. Gerges|authorlink=Fawaz Gerges|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Esposito]], using poll data from [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], wrote in 2008 that Muslims and Americans were equally likely to reject violence against civilians. He also found that those Muslims who support violence against civilians are no more religious than Muslims who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Excerpt: 'Who Speaks for Islam?' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87860378 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A subsequent Gallup poll released in 2011 suggested "that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians... it is human development and governance—not piety or culture—that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence." The same poll concluded that populations of countries in the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] were slightly more likely to reject attacks on civilians in all cases, both military and individual, than those in non-member countries.&lt;ref name="views"&gt;{{cite web|title=Views of Violence|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another poll conducted, in 2005 by the [[Fafo Foundation]] in the Palestinian Authority, found that 65% of respondents supported the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/95535#.UFBe5NWgSSo 65% of Palestinians Applaud Terror Attacks on US and Europe] IsraelNationalNews.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Pakistan, despite the recent rise in the Taliban's influence, a poll conducted by Terror Free Tomorrow in Pakistan in January 2008 tested support for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, other militant Islamist groups and Osama bin Laden himself, and found a recent drop by half. In August 2007, 33% of Pakistanis expressed support for al-Qaeda; 38% supported the Taliban. By January 2008, al-Qaeda's support had dropped to 18%, the Taliban's to 19%. When asked if they would vote for al-Qaeda, just 1% of Pakistanis polled answered in the affirmative. The Taliban had the support of 3% of those polled.&lt;ref name="australia.to"/&gt;
* Pew Research surveys in 2008, show that in a range of countries—Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh—there have been substantial declines in the percentages saying suicide-bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets can be justified to defend Islam against its enemies. Wide majorities say such attacks are, at most, rarely acceptable. The shift of attitudes against terror has been especially dramatic in Jordan, where 29% of Jordanians were recorded as viewing suicide-attacks as often or sometimes justified (down from 57% in May 2005). In the largest majority-Muslim nation, Indonesia, 74% of respondents agree that terrorist attacks are "never justified" (a substantial increase from the 41% level to which support had risen in March 2004); in Pakistan, that figure is 86%; in Bangladesh, 81%; and in Iran, 80%.&lt;ref name="australia.to"/&gt;
* A poll conducted in Osama bin Laden's home country of Saudi Arabia in December 2008 shows that his compatriots have dramatically turned against him, his organisation, Saudi volunteers in Iraq, and terrorism in general. Indeed, confidence in bin Laden has fallen in most Muslim countries in recent years.&lt;ref name="australia.to"/&gt;

==Tactics==

===Suicide attacks===
{{see also|Suicide attack}}

An increasingly popular tactic used by terrorists is suicide bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The_MIPT_Terrorism_Annual|url=http://www.tkb.org/documents/Downloads/2006-MIPT-Terrorism-Annual.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=tkb.org|accessdate=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129192403/http://www.tkb.org/documents/Downloads/2006-MIPT-Terrorism-Annual.pdf |archivedate = November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic is used against civilians, soldiers, and government officials of the regimes the terrorists oppose. A recent clerical ruling declares terrorism and suicide bombing as forbidden by Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8544531.stm | work=BBC News | first=Dominic | last=Casciani | title=Muslim scholar condemns terrorism | date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, groups who support its use often refer to such attacks as "[[Istishhad|martyrdom operations]]" and the suicide-bombers who commit them as "[[martyr]]s" (Arabic: shuhada, plural of "shahid"). The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ([[Shahid|shaheed]]) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of [[Jannah|paradise]] for their actions.

===Hijackings===
Islamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the [[September 11 attacks|"9/11"]] attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of [[aircraft hijacking]].

===Kidnappings and executions===
{{Main|Beheading in Islamism}}
{{see also|Beheading video|ISIL beheading incidents}}

Along with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is [[decapitation]], another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] resulted in the 1986 [[Iran–Contra affair]]. During the chaos of the [[Iraq War]], more than 200 kidnappings [[Foreign hostages in Iraq|foreign hostages]] (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the [[kidnapping of Alan Johnston]] by [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]] resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.

[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|title=Global Jihad and the Tactic of Terror Abduction: A Comprehensive Review of Islamic Terrorist Organizations|date=December 2013|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1845196110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Rubin]] argued in 2005 that hostage-taking became popular among terrorist groups as a tactic that can hold the attention of a public that had become inured to mass death techniques such as [[suicide bombing]], and that it can garner significant "political and diplomatic" payoff. Rubin writes that Islamist kidnappers have the additional, "ideological goals" of using hostages both to "shock the outside world" and to "appeal to their own constituency", and that the public humiliation of hostages is a specific Islamist goal.

====Kidnapping as political tactic====

=====Islamist self-justifications=====
According to the [[International Business Times]], in October, 2014 the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)]] released a five-point justification of its right to take non-Muslims hostage, and decapitate, ransom or enslave them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnlee|first1=Varghese|title=ISIS Lists Out 5 Islamic Reasons to Justify Beheading Alan Henning and other Captives|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-lists-out-5-islamic-reasons-justify-beheading-alan-henning-other-captives-610585|accessdate=13 October 2014|publisher=International Business Times|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Muslim cleric [[Anjem Choudary]] told [[The Clarion Project]] that kidnapping and even [[Beheading in Islamism|beheading]] hostages is justified by Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mauro|first1=Ryan|title=UK's Anjem Choudary Justifies Beheading of James Foley|url=http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/uks-anjem-choudary-justifies-beheading-james-foley|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kidnapping as revenue====
[[Nasir al-Wuhayshi]] leader of the [[Islamist]] militant group [[Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]] describes kidnapped hostages as "an easy spoil... which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callimachi|first1=Rukmini Maria|title=Paying Ransoms, Europe Bankrolls Qaeda Terror|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europe-becomes-al-qaedas-patron.html|accessdate=4 September 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 investigation, by journalist [[Rukmini Maria Callimachi]] published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' demonstrated that between 2008 and 2014, Al Qaeda and groups directly affiliated with al-Qaeda took in over US$125 million from kidnapping, with $66 million of that total paid in 2013 alone. The article showed that from a somewhat haphazard beginning in 2003, kidnapping grew into the group's main fundraising strategy, with targeted, professional kidnapping of civilians from wealthy European countries—principally France, Spain and Switzerland—willing to pay huge ransoms. US and UK nationals are less commonly targeted since these governments have shown an unwillingness to pay ransom.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

====Islamist self-justification====
According to [[CNN]], the self-styled [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] "justifies its kidnapping of women as sex slaves citing Islamic theology" in an article entitled, 'The revival (of) slavery before the Hour,' (of Judgement Day), published in the [[ISIL]] online magazine, "Dabiq", claimed that [[Yazidi]] women can be taken captive and forced to become sex slaves or concubines under Islamic law, "One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar—the infidels—and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah, or Islamic law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdelaziz|first1=Salma|title=ISIS states its justification for the enslavement of women|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/12/world/meast/isis-justification-slavery/|accessdate=13 October 2014|publisher=CNN|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 21st century, emerged a worldwide network of hundreds of web sites that inspire, train, educate and recruit young Muslims to engage in jihad against the United States and other Western countries, taking less prominent roles in mosques and community centers that are under scrutiny.

Some prominent Islamic terror groups and incidents include the following:

=== Africa ===

====Algeria====
The [[Armed Islamic Group]], active in Algeria between 1992 and 1998, was one of the most violent Islamic terrorist groups, and is thought to have [[takfir]]ed the Muslim population of Algeria. Its campaign to overthrow the Algerian government included [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|civilian massacres]], sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation. It also targeted foreigners living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriates in the country. In recent years it has been eclipsed by a splinter group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), now called [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2008/06/sec-080627-cfr01.htm|title=Backgrounder: Armed Islamic Group (Algeria, Islamists) (a.k.a.

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Taliban]] and [[Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin]] forces have "sharply escalated bombing and other attacks" against civilians since 2006. In 2006, "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/afghanistan0407/ ''The Human Cost: The Consequences of Insurgent Attacks in Afghanistan''].

The [[Abu Sayyaf|Abu Sayyaf Group]], also known as al-Harakat al-Islamiyya, is one of several militant Islamic-separatist groups based in and around the southern islands of [[Philippines|the Philippines]], in [[Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao]] ([[Jolo]], [[Basilan]], and [[Mindanao]]) where for almost 30 years various Muslim groups have been engaged in an insurgency for a state, independent of the predominantly [[Christian]] [[Philippines]].

Lethal attacks on civilians in Europe which have been credited to Islamist terrorism include the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 bombings of commuter trains in Madrid]], where 191 people were killed,  the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], also of public transport, which killed 52 commuters, and the 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], in [[Paris]], where 12 people were killed in response to the satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' depicting cartoons of [[Muhammad]]. On November 13, 2015 the French capital suffered [[November 2015 Paris attacks|a series of coordinated attacks]], claimed by [[ISIS]], that killed 129 people in restaurants, the [[Bataclan theatre]] and the [[Stade de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Paris attack: Isis warns 'This is just the beginning' after killing at least 127 people in French capital|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-attacks-this-is-just-the-beginning-isis-vows-after-killing-at-least-127-people-in-french-a6734546.html|accessdate=17 November 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a [[Europol]] report showed that more than 99% of terrorist attacks in Europe over the last three years were, carried out by non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat2009_1.pdf|title=EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report TE-SAT|year=2007–2009|publisher=[[Europol]]|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of 1,009 arrests for terrorism in 2008, 187 were in relation to Islamist terrorism. The report showed that the majority of Islamist terror suspects were second or third generation immigrants.&lt;ref name="Europol-2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report TE-SAT 2009|publisher=[[Europol]]|year=2009|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/tesat2009_1.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish economist [[Tino Sanandaji]] has criticised the use of statistics where the number of attacks are counted instead of the number of killed, since 79% of terrorist deaths 2001-2011 in Europe were due to Islamic terrorism. Therefore statistics focusing on the number of attacks instead of the number killed are exploited by those who wish to trivialise the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Islamists caused overwhelming majority of terrorist deaths in Europe during last decade|url=http://tino.us/2011/02/islamists-caused-overwhelming-majority-of-terrorist-deaths-in-europe-during-last-decade/|work=Tino Sanandaji blog|date=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great difference in the number of attacks versus the number of killed is that separaist attacks in Spain, typically involve vandalism and not killing. So in statistics, the global terrorist plot leading to the 9/11 attack and a party headquarters being vandalised and painted with slogans by domestic terrorists each count as one terrorist attack.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to a report by [[Europol]] on terrorism in the [[European Union]], in 2016 "nearly all reported fatalities and most of the casualties were the result of jihadist terrorist attacks." A majority of about two-thirds of all terrorist-related arrests in the EU were also jihadist-related.&lt;ref name="Europol17"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report (TE-SAT) 2017|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/eu-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-te-sat-2017|journal=EU Terrorism Situation &amp; Trend Report (Te-Sat)|publisher=Europol|year=2017|page=10|isbn=978-9295200791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of deaths by terrorism in Europe from 2001 to 2014 were caused by Islamic terrorism, even while not including Islamic terrorist attacks in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Daily chart: Terror attacks |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/01/daily-chart-8|work=The Economist|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the British think tank&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTt0rG_B130C&amp;pg=PA103|title=Understanding Terrorism in the Age of Global Media: A Communication Approach|last=Archetti|first=Cristina|date=2012-10-29|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230360495|location=|pages=103|language=en|quote=The London think tank, International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence|ICSR]], up to 40% of terrorist plots in Europe are part-financed through [[petty crime]] such as drug-dealing, theft, robberies, loan fraud and burglaries. Jihadists use ordinary crime as a way to finance their activity and have also argued this to be the "ideologically correct" way to wage jihad in [[Dar al-Harb|non-Muslim lands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icsr.info/2016/10/new-icsr-report-criminal-pasts-terrorist-futures-european-jihadists-new-crime-terror-nexus/|title=Criminal Pasts, Terrorist Futures: European Jihadists and the New Crime-Terror Nexus / ICSR|last=|first=|date=2016-10-11|work=[[The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence]]|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern of jihadist attacks in 2017 led Europol to conclude that terrorists preferred to attack ordinary people rather than causing property damage or loss of capital.&lt;ref name="Europol18"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|title=European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2018 (TE SAT 2018)|last=|first=|date=2018|publisher=[[Europol]]|year=|isbn=978-92-95200-91-3|location=|pages=5–9, 22–25, 35–36|accessdate=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620144052/https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|archive-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Europol]], the jihadist attacks in 2017 had three patterns:&lt;ref name="te_sat_2018_p4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|title=European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2018 (TE SAT 2018)|last=|first=|date=2018|publisher=[[Europol]]|year=|isbn=978-92-95200-91-3|location=|pages=4|accessdate=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620144052/https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|archive-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Indiscriminate killings: London [[2017 Westminster attack|March]] &amp; [[2017 London Bridge attack|June]] attacks and [[2017 Barcelona attacks|Barcelona]] attacks.&lt;ref name="te_sat_2018_p4" /&gt;

*Attacks on symbols of authority: Paris attacks in February, June and August.&lt;ref name="te_sat_2018_p4" /&gt;

The agency's report also noted that jihadist attacks had caused more deaths and casualties than any other type of terrorist attack, that such attacks had become more frequent, and that there had been a decrease in the sophistication and preparation of the attacks.&lt;ref name="Europol183"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|title=European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2018 (TE SAT 2018)|last=|first=|date=2018|publisher=[[Europol]]|year=|isbn=978-92-95200-91-3|location=|pages=5–9, 22–25, 35–36|accessdate=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620144052/https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|archive-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Susanne Schröter]], the 2017 attacks in European countries showed that the military defeat of the Islamic State did not mean the end of Islamist violence. Schröter also wrote that the events in Europe looked like a delayed implementation of jihadist strategy formulated by [[Abu Musab al Suri|Abu Musab al-Suri]] in 2005, where an intensification of terror should destabilise societies and encourage Muslim youth to revolt. The expected civil war never materialised Europe, but did occur in other regions such as North Africa and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.normativeorders.net/de/presse/medienecho/40-presse/presse-echo/5606-dschihadisten-als-elitetruppe-des-islams-eine-klare-ablehnung-dieser-position-durch-islamische-verbaende-in-deutschland-fehlt-von-susanne-schroeter|title=Dschihadisten als Elitetruppe des Islams.

Had its first occurrences with religious extremism in the 1980s due to French involvement in the [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanese civil war]]. In the 1990s, a series of attacks on French soil were executed by the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria]] (GIA). In the 1990-2010 time span, France experienced repeated attacks linked to international jihadist movements.&lt;ref name="ispi2018"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ispionline.it/sites/default/files/pubblicazioni/mediterraneo_def_web.pdf|title=DE-RADICALIZATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN - Comparing Challenges and Approaches|last=Vidino et al|first=|publisher=ISPI|year=2018|isbn=9788867058198|location=Milano|pages=13-15, 24, 26, 35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported on 26 July 2016 that "Islamist Terrorism" had caused 236 dead in France in the preceding 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/07/26/le-terrorisme-islamiste-a-fait-236-morts-en-france-en-18-mois_4975000_4355770.html|title=Le terrorisme islamiste a fait 236 morts en France en 18 mois|date=26 July 2016|work=Le Monde|language=French|quote=De l'attaque de « Charlie Hebdo » et de l'« Hyper casher » en janvier 2015 à la mort du père Jacques Hamel à Saint-Etienne-de-Rouvray, mardi 26 juillet, ce sont 236 personnes qui ont perdu la vie dans des attentats et attaques terroristes|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadly attacks in 2015 in France changed the issue of Islamist radicalization from a security threat to also constitute a social problem. Prime minister [[François Hollande]] and prime minister [[Manuel Valls]] saw the fundamental values of the French republic being challenged and called them attacks against secular, enlightenment and democratic values along with "what makes us who we are".&lt;ref name="ispi2018"/&gt;

====Italy====
{{See also|Terrorism in Italy#Islamic terrorism}}
Despite Italy having several factors which could have made it a hub of jihadist activity such as proximity to the Middle East and North Africa, reatively porous borders and a large influx migrants from Muslim majority countries, Italy has not experienced the same surge in radicalization as other European countries. While 125 individuals with "ties" to Italy, a minority of whom are Italian citizens, left Italy to join the civil war in Iraq and Syria, this is a small number considering that Belgium had 470 and Sweden had 300 such individuals despite both having much smaller populations. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, there have been a small number of plots either thwarted or failed. Two individuals born in Italy have been involved in 2010s terrorist attacks, Youssef Zaghba one of the trio of attackers in the June [[2017 London Bridge attack]] while ISIS sympathizer Tomasso Hosni attacked soldiers at [[Milano Centrale railway station|Milan's Central station]] in May 2017. Deportation of foreign suspects have been the cornerstone of Italy's counter-terrorism strategy and from January 2015 to April 2018, 300 individuals were expulsed from Italian soil.&lt;ref name="ispi2018"/&gt;

==== Norway ====
In 2012, two men were sentenced in Oslo to seven and a half years in jail for an attack against Mohammad-cartoonist [[Kurt Westergaard]].This was the first sentence under the new anti-terror legislation. A third man was freed from the accusation of terrorism, but was sentenced for helping with explosives and he received a fourth month prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/terror-prozess-in-oslo-haftstrafen-fuer-geplanten-mord-an-mohammed-zeichner-a-812250.html|title=Terror-Prozess in Oslo: Haftstrafen für geplanten Mord an Mohammed-Zeichner|date=2012-01-30|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spain ====
Jihadists were present in Spain from 1994, when an al-Qaeda cell was established.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ispionline.it/sites/default/files/pubblicazioni/mediterraneo_def_web.pdf|title=DE-RADICALIZATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN - Comparing Challenges and Approaches|last=Vidino et al|first=|publisher=ISPI|year=2018|isbn=9788867058198|location=Milano|pages=24, 35-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria]] (GIA), an organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda, founded a cell in the province of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]]. In the 1995-2003 period, slightly over 100 people were arrested for offences releated to militant [[Salafi movement|salafism]], an average of 12 per year. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 2004, Madrid commuters suffered the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], which were perpetrated by remnants of the first al-Qaeda cell, members of the [[Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group]] (GICM) plus a gang of criminals turned into jihadists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the period 2004-2012, the there were 470 arrests, an average of 52 per year and four times the pre-Madrid bombings average which indicated that the jihadist threat persisted after the Madrid attack. In the years after the Madrid attack, 90% of all jihadists convicted in Spain were foreigners, mainly from [[Moroccans in Spain|Morocco]], [[Pakistanis in Spain|Pakistan]] and Algeria, while 7 out of 10 resided in the metropolitan areas of Madrid or Barcelona. The vast majority were involved in cells linked to organisations such as al-Qaeda, the [[Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group|GICM]], the Algerian salafist group [[Group for Preaching  and Combat]] which had replaced the GIA, and [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the period 2013, jihadism in Spain transformed to be less overwhelmingly associated with foreigners. Arrests 2013-2017 show that 4 out of 10 arrested were Spanish nationals and 3 out of 10 were born in Spain. Most others had Morocco as country of nationality or birth with its main focus among Moroccan descendants residing in the North African cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. The most prominent jihadist presence was the province of Barcelona.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2013 and 2014 there were cells associated with [[Al-Nusra Front]], the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2017, a terrorist cell based in the province of Bacelona carried out the vehicle ramming [[2017 Barcelona attacks]], even if their original plans were on a larger scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2018 there were an estimated 5000 radicalized Muslims living on Spanish soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/08/31/59a70a48ca4741f7588b45e4.html|title=El coordinador antiterrorista de la UE: "Lo de Barcelona volverá a pasar, hay 50.000 radicales en Europa"|work=ELMUNDO|access-date=2018-09-09|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
[[File:Beslan school no 1 victim photos.jpg|thumb|[[Beslan school siege|Beslan school]] victim photos]]
Politically and religiously motivated attacks on civilians in Russia have been traced to separatist sentiment among the largely Muslim population of its [[North Caucasus]] region, particularly in [[Chechnya]], where the central government of the Russian Federation has waged two bloody wars against the local [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|secular separatist government]] since 1994. In the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] in October 2002, three Chechen separatist groups took an estimated 850 people hostage in the Russian capital; at least 129 hostages died during the storming by Russian special forces, all but one killed by the chemicals used to subdue the attackers (whether this attack would more properly be called a [[nationalism|nationalist]] rather than an Islamist attack is in question). In the September 2004 [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] more than 1,000 people were taken hostage after a school in the [[Republics of Russia|Russian republic]] of [[North Ossetia–Alania]] was seized by a pro-Chechen multi-ethnic group aligned to [[Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs]]; hundreds of people died during the storming by Russian forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', January/February 2008, p. 74, "The Myth of the Authoritarian Model"&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, Russia has also experienced [[Suicide attacks in the North Caucasus conflict|a string of suicide bombings]] that killed hundreds of people in the Caucasian republics of Chechnya, [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]], as well as in Russia proper including Moscow. Responsibility for most of these attacks were claimed by either [[Shamil Basayev]]'s Islamic-nationalist rebel faction or, later, by [[Dokka Umarov]]'s pan-Islamist movement [[Caucasus Emirate]] which is aiming to unite most of Russia's North Caucasus as an [[emirate]] since its creation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/40b2b7e8-3e84-11df-a706-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1QqDmL2UZ|title=Changing face of terror in Russia|work=Financial Times|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the creation of the Caucasus Emirate, the group has abandoned its secular nationalist goals and fully adopted the ideology of Salafist-takfiri Jihadism&lt;ref&gt;Darion Rhodes, [http://www.ict.org.il/Article/132/Salafist-Takfiri%20Jihadism%20the%20Ideology%20of%20the%20Caucasus%20Emirate Salafist-Takfiri Jihadism: the Ideology of the Caucasus Emirate], International Institute for Counter-terrorism, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to advance the cause of Allah on the earth by waging war against the Russian government and non-Muslims in the North Caucasus, such as the local [[Sufi]] Muslim population, whom they view as [[mushrikeen]] (polytheists) who do not adhere to true Islamic teachings.

Historians have said that militant Islamism first gained ground among Kurds before its appeal grew among ethnic Turks and that the two most important radical Islamist organizsations have been an outgrowth of Kurdish Islamism rather than Turkish Islamism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;*German Jihad: On the Internationalisation of Islamist Terrorism by Guido Steinberg. Columbia University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish or Kurdish Hizbullah is a primarily Kurdish group has its roots in the predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey and among Kurds who migrated to the cities in Western Turkey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The members of the IBDA-C were predominantly Kurds, most members if not all are ethnic Kurds like its founder, as in the Hizbullah. The IBDA-C stressed its Kurdish roots, and is fighting Turkish secularism, and is also anti-Christian. The Hizbula reestablished in 2003 in southeastern Turkey and "today its ideology might be more widespread thean ever among Kurds there".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The influence of these groups confirms "the continuing Kurdish domination of Turkish islamism". Notable Kurdish Islamists include also&lt;ref&gt;Mamdouh Mahmud Salim&lt;/ref&gt;(an Iraqi Kurd born in Sudan) co-founder of the Islamist terrorist network al-Qaeda. There is a strong Kurdish element in Turkish radical Islamism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Kurdish and Turkish Islamists have also co-operated together, one example being the 2003 Istanbul bombings, and this co-operation has also been observed in Germany, as in the case of the Sauerland terror cell. Political scientist Guido Steinberg stated that many top leaders of Islamist organizations in Turkey fled to Germany in the 2000s, and that the Turkish Hizbullah has also "left an imprint on Turkish Kurds in Germany".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also many Kurds from Iraq (there are about 50,000 to 80,000 Iraqi Kurds in Germany) financially supported Kurdish-Islamist groups like Ansar al Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Many Islamists in Germany are ethnic Kurds (Iraqi and Turkish Kurds) or Turks. Before 2006, the German Islamist scene was dominated by Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, but since 2006 Kurds and Turks from Turkey are dominant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]] is a Palestinian Islamist group based in the [[Syria]]n capital, [[Damascus]], and dedicated to waging jihad to eliminate the state of Israel. It was formed by Palestinian Fathi Shaqaqi in the Gaza Strip following the [[Iranian Revolution]] which inspired its members. From 1983 onward, it engaged in "a succession of violent, high-profile attacks" on Israeli targets. The Intifada which "it eventually sparked" was quickly taken over by the much larger [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;p. 122, ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' by Gilles Kepel&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in September 2000, it started a campaign of suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians. The PIJ's armed wing, the Al-Quds brigades, has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks in Israel, including suicide bombings. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by several Western countries.

[[Popular Resistance Committees]] is a coalition of a number of armed Palestinian groups opposed to what they regard as the conciliatory approach of the [[Palestinian Authority]] and [[Fatah]] towards Israel.

'''Jewish humor''' is the long tradition of [[humour|humor]] in [[Judaism]] dating back to the [[Torah]] and the [[Midrash]] from the ancient [[Middle East]], but generally refers to the more recent stream of verbal and often anecdotal humor of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] which took root in the [[United States]] over the last hundred years, including in [[secular Jewish culture]]. European Jewish humor in its early form developed in the Jewish community of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with theological satire becoming a traditional way of clandestinely opposing [[Christianization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanny|first1=Jarrod|title=The Anti-Gospel of Lenny, Larry and Sarah: Jewish Humor and the Desecration of Christendom|journal=American Jewish History|date=2015|volume=99|issue=2|pages=167–193|doi=10.1353/ajh.2015.0023|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+anti-gospel+of+Lenny%2C+Larry+and+Sarah%3A+Jewish+humor+and+the+...-a0411333834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Jewish humor emerged during the nineteenth century among German-speaking Jews of the ''[[Haskalah]]'' (Jewish Enlightenment), matured in the [[shtetl]]s of the Russian Empire, and then flourished in twentieth-century America, arriving with the millions of Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe between the 1880s and the early 1920s. {{cn|date=January 2018}}

Beginning with [[vaudeville]], and continuing through [[radio]], [[stand-up comedy]], [[film]], and [[television]], a disproportionately high percentage of American, German, and Russian comedians have been Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;While numbers are inevitably fuzzy, Paul Chance, reviewing Lawrence Epstein's ''The Haunted Smile: The Story Of Jewish Comedians In America'' (''Psychology Today'', Jan-Feb, 2002) wrote "While Jews make up only about 3 percent of the U.S. population, 80 percent of professional comics are Jewish." Accessed [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1175/is_1_35/ai_82261813 online]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314020526/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1175/is_1_35/ai_82261813 |date=2007-03-14 }} 25 March 2007. Comedian Mark Schiff, [http://www.aish.com/jewlariousFeatures/jewlariousFeaturesDefault/Why_Are_Jews_Funny$.asp reviewing the same book on Jewlarious.com], writes "Most of the comedians that made us all laugh in the 1950s, '60s and '70s were Jewish." Similarly, Drew Friedman (author of ''Old Jewish Comedians''), in a March 22, 2007 [http://www.mrmedia.com/2007/03/fridays-with-mr-media-drew-friedman.html interview on Fridays with Mr. Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621003827/http://www.mrmedia.com/2007/03/fridays-with-mr-media-drew-friedman.html |date=2007-06-21 }}: "Somebody said, 'You could do an Old Protestant Comedian book,' and I said, 'Well, that would be a pamphlet, wouldn't it?'"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] estimated in 1978 that 80 percent of professional American comics were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948701,00.html|date=October 2, 1978|title=Behavior: Analyzing Jewish Comics |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish humor, while diverse, favors [[wordplay]], [[irony]], and [[satire]], and its themes are highly [[anti-authoritarian]], mocking religious and secular life alike.&lt;ref name="Attardo2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Attardo|title=Encyclopedia of Humor Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjRzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA542|date=25 February 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-4617-5|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] considered Jewish humor unique in that its humor is primarily derived from mocking of the in-group (Jews) rather than the "other". However rather than simply being [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] it also contains a dialectical element of self-praise, which works in the opposite direction.

==History==
Jewish humor is rooted in several traditions. Recent scholarship places the origins of Jewish humor in one of history's earliest recorded documents, the Hebrew Bible, as well as the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey H. Friedman and [[Linda Weiser Friedman]], ''God Laughed: Sources of Jewish Humor'', NJ: [[Transaction Publishers]] 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the intellectual and legal methods of the [[Talmud]], which uses elaborate legal arguments and situations often seen as [[farce|so absurd as to be humorous]], in order to tease out the meaning of religious law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523082732/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/HUMOROUSCASESTALMUD.htm|title=Talmudic Humor and the Establishment of Legal Principles: Strange Questions, Impossible Scenarios, and Legalistic Brainteasers|author=Hershey H. Friedman, Ph.D.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827110425/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/HUMOROUSCASESTALMUD.htm#_ednref1|archivedate=May 23, 2016|deadurl=yes|journal=Thalia: Studies in Literary Humor|volume=21|issue=1|year=2004|at=fn1|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hillel Halkin]] in his essay about Jewish humor&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207081355/http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=2180 "Why Jews Laugh at Themselves"], an essay by [[Hillel Halkin]], ''[[Commentary Magazine]]'', Vol 121, April 2006, No 4, pp. 47–54&lt;/ref&gt; traces some roots of the Jewish [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] humor to the medieval influence of Arabic traditions on the Hebrew literature by quoting a witticism from [[Yehuda Alharizi]]'s ''Tahkemoni''.

A more recent one is an egalitarian tradition among the Jewish communities of [[Eastern Europe]] in which the powerful were often mocked subtly, rather than attacked overtly—as [[Saul Bellow]] once put it, "Oppressed people tend to be witty." Jesters known as [[badchen]]s used to poke fun at prominent members of the community during weddings, creating a good-natured tradition of humor as a levelling device. Rabbi [[Moshe Waldoks]], a scholar of Jewish humor, argued:

{{quote|You have a lot of shtoch, or jab humor, which is usually meant to deflate pomposity or ego, and to deflate people who consider themselves high and mighty. But Jewish humor was also a device for self-criticism within the community, and I think that's where it really was the most powerful. The humorist, like the prophet, would basically take people to task for their failings. The humor of Eastern Europe especially was centered on defending the poor against the exploitation of the upper classes or other authority figures, so rabbis were made fun of, authority figures were made fun of and rich people were made fun of. It really served as a social catharsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/cover_aug04.html|title=What's with Jewish comedy?|work=San Diego Jewish Journal|author=Jeff Berkwits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151852/http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/cover_aug04.html|archivedate=May 11, 2008|date=Aug 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Jews began to immigrate to America in large numbers, they, like other minority groups, found it difficult to gain mainstream acceptance and obtain [[social mobility|upward mobility]] (As [[Lenny Bruce]] lampooned, "He was charming. ... They said, 'C'mon! Let's go watch the Jew be charming!'"). The newly-developing entertainment industry, combined with the Jewish humor tradition, provided a potential route for Jews to succeed. One of the first successful radio "[[sitcom]]s", ''[[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]]'', featured a Jewish family. As radio and television matured, many of its most famous comedians, including [[Jack Benny]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[George Burns]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Jack Carter (comedian)|Jack Carter]], [[Henny Youngman]], [[Milton Berle]], and [[Jerry Lewis]] were Jewish. The Jewish comedy tradition continues today, with Jewish humor much entwined with that of mainstream humor, as comedies like ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' and [[Woody Allen]] films indicate.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[Sigmund Freud]] in his ''[[Humour in Freud|Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]'', among other things, analyzes the nature of Jewish jokes.

==Types of Jewish humor==

===Religious humor===
As befits a community to which religion was so important, much humor centres on the relationship of Judaism to the individual Jew and the community.

{{quotation|Two Rabbis argued late into the night about the existence of God, and, using strong arguments from the scriptures, ended up indisputably disproving His existence. The next day, one Rabbi was surprised to see the other walking into the [[Synagogue|shul]] for morning services.

"I thought we had agreed there was no God," he said.

"Yes, what does that have to do with it?" replied the other.
}}

The cognate to this is the part left out, the fact that it was traditional to go to services, regardless of what one believed, and the rabbi was merely following that tradition.  This is like the story of the boy who tells his rabbi he can't [[Jewish prayer|daven]] (pray), because he no longer believes in God. The rabbi merely tells him, "Yes God, no God: doesn't matter! Three times a day, you DAVEN!"

====Assimilation====
The American Jewish community has been lamenting the rate of assimilation and disappearance of their children as they grow into adults.

{{quotation|Two Rabbis were discussing their problems with squirrels in their synagogue attic. One Rabbi said, "We simply called an exterminator and we never saw the squirrels again." The other Rabbi said, "We just gave the squirrels a [[bar mitzvah]], and we never saw them again."}}

Or,

{{quotation|The rate of Jewish intermarriage is a serious problem. Scientists estimate that unless something can be done to stop intermarriage, in 100 years, the Jewish people will be reduced to a race of gorgeous blondes.}}

====Self-deprecating====
Jews often mock their own negative stereotypes.

{{quotation|Question: How can you always spot a convert to Judaism?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer: That's easy. They're the only normal one in the congregation.}}

====Wits====
Similarly, in the tradition of the legal arguments of the Talmud, one prominent type of Jewish humor involves clever, often legalistic, solutions to Talmudic problems, such as:

{{quotation|
Q: Is one permitted to ride in an airplane on the Sabbath?&lt;br/&gt;
A: Yes, as long as your seat belt remains fastened. In this case, it is considered that you are not riding, you are wearing the plane.}}

====Tales of the Rebbes====
Some jokes make fun of the "[[Rebbe]] miracle stories" and involve different [[Hasidic Judaism|hasidim]] bragging about their teachers' miraculous abilities:
{{quotation|Three ''hasidim'' are bragging about their ''Rebbes'': "My ''rebbe'' is very powerful. He was walking once, and there was a big lake in his path. He waved his handkerchief, and there was lake on the right, lake on the left, but no lake in the middle." To which the second retorted, "That's nothing. My ''rebbe'' is even more powerful. He was walking once, and there was a huge mountain in his path. He waved his handkerchief, and there was mountain on the right, mountain on the left, but no mountain in the middle!" Said the third, "Ha! That is still nothing! My ''rebbe'' is the most powerful. He was walking once on ''[[Shabbos]]'' (Saturday, the holy day in Judaism, on which it is forbidden to handle money), and there was a wallet crammed full of cash in his path. He waved his handkerchief, and it was ''Shabbos'' on the right, ''Shabbos'' on the left, but not ''Shabbos'' in the middle!"}}

Or
{{quotation|Caesar said to [[Joshua ben Hananiah]] "Why does the Sabbath dish have such a fragrant odor?" Joshua said "We have a certain spice called Shabbat ([[dill|shevet]]), that we put in it. "Let me have some", he requested. Joshua replied, "For those who observe Shabbat, it works; for those who don't, it doesn't."|[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 119a.}}

The lives of the early [[Hasidic Judaism|hasidim]], while not funny in and of themselves, are rich in humorous incidents. The dealings between [[rabbi]]s, [[tzadik]]im, and peasants form a rich tapestry of lore.

===Eastern European Jewish humor===
A number of traditions in Jewish humor date back to stories and anecdotes from the 19th century.

====Chełm====
{{refimprove-section|date=February 2018}}
[[Jewish folklore]] makes fun of the Jewish residents of [[Chełm]] (Yiddish: '''כעלעם''', Hebrew: '''חלם'''; often transcribed as '''Helm''') as well-meaning fools. These stories often center around the "wise" men and their silly decisions, similarly to the English [[Wise Men of Gotham]] or the German [[Schildbürger]].

For example: One Jewish Chełm resident bought a fish on Friday in order to cook it for [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. He put the live fish underneath his coat and the fish slapped his face with his tail. He went to the Chełm court to [[Animal_trial|submit a charge]] and the court sentenced the fish to death by drowning.

Most of these stories have become well-known thanks to storytellers and writers such as [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Jewish writer in the [[Yiddish]] language, who wrote ''The Fools of Chełm and Their History'' (published in English translation in 1973), and the great Soviet Yiddish poet [[:yi:שיקע_דריז|Ovsey Driz]] who wrote stories in verse. The latter achieved great popularity in the Soviet Union in Russian and Ukrainian translations, and were made into several animated films.

Other notable adaptations of folklore Chełm stories into the mainstream culture are the comedy ''Chelmer Khakhomim'' ("The Wise Men of Chelm") by [[Aaron Zeitlin]], ''The Heroes of Chelm'' (1942) by [[Solomon Simon|Shlomo Simon]], published in English translation as ''The Wise Men of Helm'' (Solomon Simon, 1945) and ''More Wise Men of Helm'' (Solomon Simon, 1965), and the book ''Chelmer Khakhomim'' by [[Y. Y. Trunk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/chelm/che045.html "The Myth of Chełm in Jewish Literature"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The animated short film comedy ''[[Village of Idiots]]'' also recounts Chełm tales.

[[Allen Mandelbaum]]'s "[[Chelmaxioms : The Maxims, Axioms, Maxioms of Chelm]]" (David R. Godine, 1978) treats the wise men less as fools than as an "echt  Chelm" of true scholars who in their narrow specialized knowledge are nonetheless knowledgeable but lacking sense. 
The poetry of [Chelmaxioms] is supposedly the discovered lost manuscripts of the wise men of Chelm. 

One popular humorous tradition from Eastern Europe involved tales of the people of [[Chełm]], a town reputed in these jokes to be inhabited by fools. The jokes were almost always centred on silly solutions to problems. Some of these solutions display "foolish wisdom" (reaching the correct answer by the wrong train of reasoning), while others are simply wrong.&lt;ref name="Gottesman2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Itzik Nakhmen Gottesman|title=Defining the Yiddish nation: the Jewish folklorists of Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fptXhc0-hYC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=29 September 2011|year=2003|publisher=Wayne State University Press |isbn=978-0-8143-2669-5 |pages=13, 49, 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chełm tales were told by authors like [[Sholom Aleichem]], [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] and [[Solomon simon|Solomon Simon]].  A typical Chełm story might begin, "It is said that after God made the world, he filled it with people. He sent off an angel with two sacks, one full of wisdom and one full of foolishness. The second sack was much heavier. So after a time it started to drag. Soon it got caught on a mountaintop and so all the foolishness spilled out and fell into Chełm."  The short animated film ''[[Village of Idiots]]'' is based upon classic Chełm tales.

Here are a few examples of a Chełm tale:{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

{{quotation|In Chełm, the ''[[wikt:shammes|shammes]]'' used to go around waking everyone up for ''[[minyan]]'' (communal prayer) in the morning. Every time it snowed, the people would complain that, although the snow was beautiful, they could not see it in its pristine state because by the time they got up in the morning, the ''shammes'' had already trekked through the snow. The townspeople decided that they had to find a way to be woken up for ''minyan'' without having the ''shammes'' making tracks in the snow.&lt;br/&gt;
The people of Chełm hit on a solution: they got four volunteers to carry the ''shammes'' around on a table when there was fresh snow in the morning. That way, the ''shammes'' could make his wake up calls, but ''he'' would not leave tracks in the snow.}}

Or,

{{quotation|The town of Chełm decided to build a new synagogue. So, some strong, able-bodied men were sent to a mountaintop to gather heavy stones for the foundation. The men put the stones on their shoulders and trudged down the mountain to the town below. When they arrived, the town constable yelled, "Foolish men! You should have rolled the stones down the mountain!" The men agreed this was an excellent idea. So they turned around, and with the stones still on their shoulders, trudged back up the mountain, and rolled the stones back down again.}}

Or,

{{quotation|A young housewife living in the town of Chełm had a very strange occurrence. One morning, after buttering a piece of bread she accidentally dropped it on the floor. To her amazement, it fell buttered side up.&lt;br&gt;
As everyone knows, whenever a buttered piece of bread is dropped on the floor, it always falls buttered side down; this is like a law of physics. But on this occasion it had fallen buttered side up, and this was a great mystery which had to be solved. So all the Rabbis and elders and wise men of Chełm were summoned together and they spent three days in the synagogue fasting and praying and debating this marvelous event among themselves. After those three days they returned to the young housewife with this answer:&lt;br&gt;
"Madam, the problem is that you have buttered the wrong side of the bread."}}

Or,

{{quotation|The sexton of the synagogue decided to install a poor box so that the fortunate might share their wealth with the needy. On shabbes eve, he announced to the congregation that a new opportunity for a ''mitzvoh'' was available. "But," one member complained, "it will be so easy for the goneffs (thieves) to steal from the box." The sexton thought long and hard that night, and announced the next day that he had found a solution. Pointing upward, he showed, the poor box was now suspended from a chain at the ceiling, high, high, high overhead. "But now how do we put money in the box?" &lt;br/&gt;
The next week, the congregation saw the wonderful solution. A lovely circular stairway now ascended to the poor box making it easy to contribute.}}

====Hershele Ostropoler====
[[Hershele Ostropoler]], also known as Hershel of Ostropol, was a legendary prankster who was based on a historic figure. Thought to have come from [[Ukraine]], he lived in the small village of [[Ostropol]], working as ''[[shochet]]'', a ritual slaughterer. According to legend he lost his job because of his constant joking, which offended the leaders of the village.

In his subsequent wanderings throughout [[Ukraine]], he became a familiar figure at restaurants and inns.

Eventually he settled down at the court of Rabbi [[Boruch of Medzhybizh]], grandson of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]. The rabbi was plagued by frequent depressions, and Hershele served as a sort of court jester, mocking the rabbi and his cronies, to the delight of the common folk.

After his death he was remembered in a series of pamphlets recording his tales and witty remarks.

He was the subject of several epic poems, a novel, a comedy performed in 1930 by the [[Vilna Troupe]], and a U.S. television programme in the 1950s.  Two illustrated children's books, ''The Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol'', and ''Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins'', have been published. Both books were written by [[Eric Kimmel]] and illustrated by [[Trina Schart Hyman]].  In 2002, a play entitled ''Hershele the Storyteller'' was performed in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/hershele_the_storyteller/|title=Hershele the Storyteller|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027000107/http://geocities.com/hershele_the_storyteller/|archivedate=October 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor about antisemitism===
Much Jewish humor takes the form of [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] comments on [[Jewish culture]], acting as a shield against [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic stereotypes]] by exploiting them first:

{{quotation|Rabbi Altmann and his secretary were sitting in a [[coffeehouse]] in Berlin in 1935. "Herr Altmann," said his secretary, "I notice you're reading ''[[Der Stürmer]]''! I can't understand why. A Nazi libel sheet! Are you some kind of [[Sadomasochism|masochist]], or, God forbid, a [[self-hating Jew]]?"&lt;br/&gt;
"On the contrary, Frau Epstein. When I used to read the Jewish papers, all I learned about were pogroms, riots in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] in America. But now that I read ''Der Stürmer'', I see so much more: that the Jews control all the banks, that we dominate in the arts, and that we're on the verge of taking over the entire world. You know&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; it makes me feel a whole lot better!"}}

Or, on a similar note:

{{quotation|After the assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], a government official in Ukraine menacingly addressed the local rabbi, "I suppose you know in full detail who was behind it."&lt;br/&gt;
"Ach," the rabbi replied, "I have no idea, but the government's conclusion will be the same as always: they will blame the Jews and the chimneysweeps."&lt;br/&gt;
"Why the chimneysweeps?" asked the befuddled official.&lt;br/&gt;
"Why the Jews?" responded the rabbi.}}

And another example, a direct slice of ''galgenhumor'' ([[Black comedy|gallows humor]]):

{{quotation|During the days of oppression and poverty of the Russian ''[[shtetl]]s'', one village had a rumor going around: a Christian girl was found murdered near their village. Fearing a ''[[wiktionary:pogrom|pogrom]]'', they gathered at the synagogue. Suddenly, the rabbi came running up, and cried, "Wonderful news! The murdered girl was Jewish!"}}

There is also humor originating in the [[United States]], such as this joke:

{{quotation|During World War II, a sergeant stationed at [[Fort Benning]] gets a telephone call from a prejudiced woman.
"We would love it," she said, "if you could bring five of your soldiers over to our house for Thanksgiving dinner."&lt;br/&gt;
"Certainly, ma'am," replied the sergeant.&lt;br/&gt;
"Oh... just make sure they aren't Jews, of course," said the woman.&lt;br/&gt;
"Will do," replied the sergeant.
So, that Thanksgiving, while the woman is baking, the doorbell rings. She opens her door and, to her horror, five black soldiers are standing in front of her.&lt;br/&gt;
"Oh, my!" she exclaimed. "I'm afraid there's been a terrible mistake!"&lt;br/&gt;
"No ma'am," said one of the soldiers. "Sergeant Rosenbloom never makes mistakes!"}}

This one combines accusations of the lack of patriotism, and avarice:

{{quotation|Post-Soviet Russia. [[Russian jokes#Rabinovich|Rabinovich]] calls the [[Pamyat]] headquarters: "Is it true that we Jews sold out [[Mother Russia]]?"  "Damn right, you filthy kike!" "Oh good. Could you tell me where I might get my share?"}}

===American Jewish humor===

====Role of Yiddish====
[[File:Gefiltefish.JPG|thumb|"[[Gefilte fish|Gefilte]] fish" on an automobile, a humoristic parody of the [[Variations of the ichthys symbol|fish symbol]]]]
Some [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] words may sound comical to an English speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Rosten]], ''The Joys of Yinglish''&lt;/ref&gt; Terms like [[List of English words of Yiddish origin|shnook and shmendrik, shlemiel and shlimazel]] (often considered [[inherently funny word]]s) were exploited for their humorous sounds, as were  "[[Yinglish]]" [[shm-reduplication]] constructs, such as "fancy-schmancy".  Yiddish constructions—such as ending sentences with questions—became part of the verbal [[word play]] of Jewish comedians.

====About religion====
One common strain of Jewish humor examines the role of religion in contemporary life, often gently mocking the religious hypocrite. For example:

{{quotation|A Reform Rabbi was so compulsive a golfer that once, on Yom Kippur, he left the house early and went out for a quick nine holes by himself.  An angel who happened to be looking on immediately notified his superiors that a  grievous sin was being committed.  On the sixth hole, God caused a mighty wind to take the ball directly from the tee to the cup&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a miraculous shot.&lt;br/&gt;
The angel was horrified. "A hole in one!" he exclaimed, "You call this a punishment, Lord?!"&lt;br/&gt;
Answered God with a sly smile, "So who can he tell?"}}

Or, on differences between [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements:

{{quotation|An Orthodox, a Conservative, and a Reform rabbi are each asked whether one is supposed to say a ''[[Berakhah|brokhe]]'' (blessing) over a lobster (non-[[kosher]] food, normally not eaten by religious Jews).&lt;br/&gt;
The Orthodox rabbi asks, "What is this...'lobster'...thing?" The Conservative rabbi doesn't know what to say, muttering about ''[[Conservative responsa|responsa]]''. The Reform rabbi says, "What's a ''brokhe''?"}}

In particular, Reform Jews may be lampooned for their rejection of traditional Jewish beliefs. An example, from one of [[Woody Allen]]'s early stand-up routines:
{{quotation|We were married by a Reform rabbi in Long Island. A ''very'' Reform rabbi. A Nazi.}}

Jokes have been made about the shifting of gender roles (in the more traditional Orthodox movement, women marry at a young age and have many children, while the more liberal Conservative and Reform movements make gender roles more [[egalitarian]], even ordaining women as [[Rabbi]]s). The [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement was the first to ordain [[homosexual]]s, all of which leads to this joke:

{{quotation|At an Orthodox wedding, the bride's mother is pregnant. At a Conservative wedding, the bride is pregnant. At a Reform wedding, the rabbi is pregnant. At a Reconstructionist wedding, the rabbi and her wife are both pregnant.}}

Often jokes revolve around the ''social'' practice of the Jewish religion:

{{quotation|A man is rescued from a desert island after 20 years.  The news media, amazed at this feat of survival, ask him to show them his home.&lt;br/&gt;
"How did you survive?  How did you keep sane?" they ask him, as he shows them around the small island.&lt;br/&gt;
"I had my faith.  My faith as a Jew kept me strong. Come." He leads them to a small glen, where stands an opulent temple, made entirely from palm fronds, coconut shells and woven grass.  The news cameras take pictures of everything&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; even a ''torah'' made from banana leaves and written in octopus ink. "This took me five years to complete."&lt;br/&gt;
"Amazing! And what did you do for the next fifteen years?"&lt;br/&gt;
"Come with me." He leads them around to the far side of the island. There, in a shady grove, is an even ''more'' beautiful temple.  "This one took me twelve years to complete!"&lt;br/&gt;
"But sir" asks the reporter, "Why did you build ''two'' temples?"&lt;br/&gt;
"This is the temple ''I'' attend. That other place? Hah! I wouldn't set foot in that other temple if you PAID me!"}}

As with most ethnicities, jokes have often mocked Jewish [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s—at times gently, and at others quite harshly. One of the kinder examples is:

{{quotation|One early winter morning, Rabbi Bloom was walking beside the canal when he saw a dog in the water, trying hard to stay afloat. It looked so sad and exhausted that Rabbi Bloom jumped in, and after a struggle, managed to bring it out alive.&lt;br/&gt;
A passer-by who saw this remarked, "That was very brave of you! You must love animals; are you a vet?"&lt;br/&gt;
Rabbi Bloom replied, "And vhat did you expect? Of course I'm a&amp;ndash;vet! I'm a&amp;ndash;freezing cold as vell!"}}

====About Jews====
Jewish humor continues to exploit stereotypes of Jews, both as a sort of "in-joke", and as a form of self-defence.  [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mothers]], "cheapness", hypochondria,  and other stereotyped habits are all common subjects. Frugality has been frequently singled out:

{{quotation|An old Jewish beggar was out on the street in New York City with his tin cup.&lt;br/&gt;
"Please, sir," he pleaded to a passerby, "could you spare seventy-three cents for a cup of coffee and some pie?"&lt;br/&gt;
The man asked, "Where do you get coffee and pie for seventy-three cents in New York? It costs at least a dollar!"&lt;br/&gt;
The beggar replied, "So who buys retail?" }}

Or,

{{quotation|What did the waiter ask the group of dining Jewish mothers? "Pardon me ladies, but is ANYTHING all right?"}}

Or,

{{quotation|A Catholic priest, a Reverend, and a Rabbi are discussing their income. &lt;br/&gt;
The Priest says: "I draw a circle on the ground, take the offering, and throw it up into the air. Any money that falls outside the circle is for the Lord, and the money that falls inside the circle is for me." &lt;br/&gt;
The Reverend says: "I do things almost the same, except the money that falls outside the circle is my salary, and the money that falls inside the circle is for the Lord." &lt;br/&gt;
The Rabbi says: "I do things quite different. I take the offering, throw it up into the air, and pray: "Lord take whatever You need, and feel free to send back the rest."}}


Or,

{{quotation|Did you hear they built the first Starbucks in Israel? There's a fork in the sugar bowl.}}

Or,

{{quotation|A Buddhist monk goes to a barber to have his head shaved. "What should I pay you?" the monk asks. "No price, for a holy man such as yourself," the barber replies. And what do you know, the next day the barber comes to open his shop, and finds on his doorstep a dozen gemstones.&lt;br/&gt;
That day, a priest comes in to have his hair cut. "What shall I pay you, my son?" "No price, for a man of the cloth such as yourself." And what do you know, the next day the barber comes to open his shop, and finds on his doorstep a dozen roses.&lt;br/&gt;
That day, Rabbi Finklestein comes in to get his ''payoss'' [sideburns] trimmed. "What do you want I should pay you?" "Nothing, for a man of God such as yourself." And the next morning, what do you know? The barber finds on his doorstep&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a dozen rabbis!}}

Or,

{{quotation|A Jewish man lies on his deathbed, surrounded by his children. "Ah," he says, "I can smell your mother's [[brisket]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; how I would love to taste it one last time before I die." So one of his sons hurries down to the kitchen, but he returns empty-handed.&lt;br/&gt;
"Sorry, papa. She says it's for the [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]]."}}

Or, about traditional roles of men and women in Jewish families:

{{quotation|A boy comes home from school and tells his mother he got a part in the school play.&lt;br/&gt;
"That's wonderful!" says the mother, "Which part?"&lt;br/&gt;
"The part of a Jewish husband," says the boy, proudly.&lt;br/&gt;
Frowning, the mother says, "Go back and tell them you want a ''speaking'' role!"}}

Or,

{{quotation|A Jewish girl bemoans, "Finally, I meet a nice, rich Jewish boy! He's just like papa. He looks like him. He acts like him. Oy vey, mama hates him!"}}

Or,

{{quotation|After performing a marriage the Rabbi gave some advice to the newlyweds: "The first ten years are always the hardest," said the Rabbi.
"How many years have you been married?" They asked.
"Ten years," the Rabbi replied.}}

Or, on parenting (from [[David M. Bader|David Bader]]'s ''Haikus for Jews''):

{{quotation|Is one Nobel Prize&lt;br/&gt;
so much to ask from a child&lt;br/&gt;
after all I've done?}}

Or

{{quotation|"Sarah, how's that boy of yours?"&lt;br/&gt;
"David? Ach, don't ask&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; he's living in Miami with a man named Miguel."&lt;br/&gt;
"That's terrible!"&lt;br/&gt;
"I know&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; why couldn't he find a nice Jewish boy?"}}

Regarding hypochondria:

{{quotation|A Frenchman, a German and a Jew walk into a bar. "I'm tired and thirsty," says the Frenchman. "I must have wine."  "I'm tired and thirsty," says the German. "I must have beer."  "I'm tired and thirsty," says the Jew. "I must have diabetes."}}

Or, on [[List of English words of Yiddish origin#kvetch|kvetch]]ing,

{{quotation| A Jewish man in a hospital tells the doctor he wants to be transferred to a different hospital. &lt;br /&gt;
The doctor says "What's wrong?  Is it the food?"  &lt;br/&gt;
"No, the food is fine.  I can't kvetch." &lt;br/&gt;
"Is it the room?" &lt;br/&gt;
"No, the room is fine.  I can't kvetch." &lt;br/&gt;
"Is it the staff?" &lt;br/&gt;
"No, everyone on the staff is fine.  I can't kvetch."  &lt;br/&gt;
"Then why do you want to be transferred?" &lt;br/&gt;
"I can't kvetch!"}}

{{quotation|An old Jewish man riding on a train begins to moan: "[[Oy vey|Oy]], am I thirsty; oy, am I thirsty", to the annoyance of the other passengers. Finally, another passenger gets a cup of water from the drinking fountain and gives it to the old man, who thanks him profusely and gulps it down. Feeling satisfied, the other passenger sits down again, only to hear "Oy, was I thirsty; oy, was I thirsty".}}

A version of that joke is quoted in ''[[Born To Kvetch]]: Yiddish Language and Culture in All Its Moods'', by [[Michael Wex]], who writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt; "It contains virtually every important element of the Yiddish-speaking mind-set in easily accessible form: the constant tension between the Jewish and the non-Jewish; the faux naivete that allows the old man to pretend that he isn't disturbing anyone; the deflation of the other passenger's hopes, the disappointment of all his expectations after he has watered the Jew; and most importantly of all, the underlying assumption, the fundamental idea that kvetching—complaining—is not only a pastime, not only a response to adverse or imperfect circumstance, but a way of life that has nothing to do with the fulfillment or frustration of desire."&lt;ref&gt;

====About Christianity====
Many Jewish jokes involve a rabbi and a Christian clergyman, exploiting different interpretations of a shared environment. Often they start with something like "A rabbi and a priest..." and make fun of either the rabbi's interpretation of Christianity or (seeming) differences between Christian and Jewish interpretation of some areas.

{{quotation|A rabbi and a Catholic priest are having lunch in a restaurant. The priest's food arrives, a scrumptious-looking ham entrée.
The priest attacks his lunch, savoring every bite of the ham. Noticing the rabbi eyeing him, he asks, "So tell me, Rabbi Goldblum, have you ever had any pork before?"&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi hesitates. "Well, it's not for me to say..."&lt;br/&gt;
The priest pushes on. "Oh, c'mon, Rabbi. We're both men of God here. We can tell each other our sins. Nothing to it."&lt;br/&gt;
"Umm... well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did have pork once."&lt;br/&gt;
Smugly the priest teases him, "And a fine meat it was, wasn't it? Heheh."&lt;br/&gt;
"Yeah, I'll say."&lt;br/&gt;
A few moments pass. The rabbi asks the priest: "Tell me Father, have you ever had sex with a woman before?"&lt;br/&gt;
"Why of course... well, before I took holy orders, that is."&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi smirks, "Better than pork, eh?"}}

Or, much more succinctly,

{{quotation|A Catholic priest says to a rabbi, "It seems to me that, since the Creator made pork, He must have made it for some purpose. Therefore, it must be a sin not to ''use'' it, don't you think? So, will you finally eat some pork?"&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi replies, "I ''will'' try some, Father&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; at ''your'' wedding."}}

A few more examples:

{{quotation|A rabbi once asked his old friend, a priest, "Could you ever be promoted within your Church?"&lt;br/&gt;
The priest says, thoughtfully, "Well, I could become a bishop."&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi persists, "And after that?"&lt;br/&gt;
With a pause for consideration, the priest replies, "Maybe I could be a cardinal, even."&lt;br/&gt;
"And then?" &lt;br/&gt;
After thinking for some time, the priest responds, "Someday I may even rise to be the Pope." &lt;br/&gt;
But the rabbi is still not satisfied. "And ''then''?"&lt;br/&gt;
With an air of incredulity, the priest cries, "What more could I become? God Himself?"&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi says quietly, "One of ''our'' boys made it."}}

Or,

{{quotation|A rabbi is on his deathbed, and a friend asks him if he has any last requests. The Rabbi asks his friend to find him a Catholic priest, so that he might convert.
Confused, his friend asks, "Rabbi, why? You have been a great teacher and leader of your followers, and you have led a good and honorable Jewish life. Why would you want to become a Catholic now, before you die?"&lt;br/&gt;
He says, "Eh, better one of them than one of us."
:(Note: This joke is also seen with an Irish Catholic replacing the Rabbi, and a Protestant minister replacing the Catholic priest.)}}

Or, 

{{quotation|A rabbi, a minister, and a priest were playing poker when the police raided the game.  
Turning to the priest, the lead police officer said, "Father Murphy, were you gambling?"
Turning his eyes to heaven, the priest whispered, "L*rd, forgive me for what I am about to do."  
To the police officer, he then said, "No, officer; I was not gambling."
The officer then asked the minister, "Pastor Johnson, were you gambling?" 
Again, after an appeal to heaven, the minister replied, "No, officer; I was not gambling."
Turning to the rabbi, the officer again asked, "Rabbi Goldstein, were you gambling?" 
Shrugging his shoulders, the rabbi replied, "With whom?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wqbe.com/fun-stuff/jokes/gambling-joke|title= Gambling Joke |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150416212659/http://www.wqbe.com/fun-stuff/jokes/gambling-joke |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or,

{{quotation|A minister told his friend Rabbi Goldman, "Last night, I dreamed of the Jewish Heaven. It was a slum, and it was overflowing with people&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; running, playing, talking, sitting&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; doing all sorts of things. But the dream, and the noise, was so terrific that I woke up."&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi said, "Really? Last night, I dreamed of the Protestant Heaven. It was a nice, proper suburb, with neatly trimmed lawns, and houses all neatly lined up."&lt;br/&gt;
"And how did the people behave?" asked the minister. &lt;br/&gt;
"What people?"}}

Or,

{{quotation|A Catholic priest is called away by a family emergency one day, while on duty attending confession. Not wanting to leave the confessional unattended, he asks his friend, a rabbi from the synagogue across the street, if he can fill in for him.&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi says he wouldn't know what to do, so the priest agrees to stay with him for a few minutes and show him the ropes.&lt;br/&gt;
They enter their half of the confessional together and soon enough, a woman enters and says, "Father forgive me, for I have sinned."&lt;br/&gt;
"What did you do?" asks the priest.&lt;br/&gt;
"I have committed adultery," she replies.&lt;br/&gt;
"How many times?" continues the priest.&lt;br/&gt;
"Three times."&lt;br/&gt;
"Do three Hail Marys, put $5 in the poor-box, and sin no more," finishes the priest.&lt;br/&gt;
The woman leaves and not long after a man enters and says, "Father forgive me, for I have sinned."&lt;br/&gt;
"What did you do?"&lt;br/&gt;
"I have committed adultery."&lt;br/&gt;
"How many times?"&lt;br/&gt;
"Three times."&lt;br/&gt;
"Do three Hail Marys, put $5 in the poor-box, and sin no more." The man leaves.&lt;br/&gt;
The rabbi tells the priest he thinks he's got it figured out now, so the priest leaves, and the rabbi waits until another woman enters the confessional, who says, "Father forgive me, for I have sinned."&lt;br/&gt;
"What did you do," asks the rabbi.&lt;br/&gt;
"I have committed adultery," she replies.&lt;br/&gt;
"How many times?"&lt;br/&gt;
"Twice."&lt;br/&gt;
"I tell you what," says the rabbi. "Go do it one more time and come back. We got a special this week, three for $5!"}}

And finally, possibly the most gigantic clash of religions:

{{quotation|One Pope, in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], decreed that all Jews had to leave Rome. The Jews did not want to leave, and so the Pope challenged them to a [[disputation]] to prove that they could remain. No one, however, wanted the responsibility... until the synagogue sexton, Moishe, volunteered.&lt;br/&gt;
As there was nobody else who wanted to go, Moishe was given the task. But because he knew only Hebrew, a silent debate was agreed.
The day of the debate came, and they went to St. Peter's Square to sort out the decision. First the Pope waved his hand around his head. Moishe pointed firmly at the ground.&lt;br/&gt;
The Pope, in some surprise, held up three fingers. In response, Moishe gave him the middle finger.&lt;br/&gt;
The crowd started to complain, but the Pope thoughtfully waved them to be quiet. He took out a bottle of wine and a wafer, holding them up. Moishe took out an apple, and held it up.&lt;br/&gt;
The Pope, to the people’s surprise, said, "I concede. This man is too good. The Jews can stay." &lt;br/&gt;
Later, the Pope was asked what the debate had meant. He explained, "First, I showed him the Heavens, to show that God is everywhere. He pointed at the ground to signify that God is right here with us. I showed him three fingers, for the Trinity. He reminded me that there is One God common to both our religions. I showed him wine and a wafer, for God's forgiveness. With an apple, he showed me original sin. The man was a master of silent debate."&lt;br/&gt;
In the Jewish corner, Moishe had the same question put to him, and answered, "It was all nonsense, really. First, he told me that this whole town would be free of Jews. I told him, Go to Hell! We’re staying right here! Then, he told me we had three days to get out. I told him just what I thought of that proposal." An older woman asked, "But what about the part at the end?" "That?" said Moishe with a shrug, "Then we had lunch!"}}

====About Antisemitism====
{{quotation|Moishe and Solly are passing a Catholic Church and see a sign that reads "Convert to Catholicism, $50 Cash."&lt;BR&gt;  Moishe turns to his friend Solly and says, "Hey, I'm going to try it."  He enters the church and returns a few minutes later.&lt;br&gt; "So, did you convert? What was it like?" Solly eagerly asks. &lt;br&gt;"It was nothing", says Moishe, "I walked in, a priest sprinkled holy water on me, and said 'you're a Catholic.'"&lt;br&gt; "Wow," says Solly, "and did you get the $50?"&lt;br&gt;Replies Moishe, "is that all you people think about?" }}

However, current events, situations, traditions, and cultural factors which are unique to the country make it hard to understand the joke for someone who is not aware of the events being referred to.

===Jewish humor in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[police state]], it was not uncommon to get [[Great purge|purged]] not only for telling a casual joke, but even for [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|not reporting it to the authorities]]. ''See [[Russian jokes]] in general, or more specifically [[Russian joke#Rabinovich|Rabinovich jokes]], [[Russian joke#Jews|Russian Jewish jokes]], [[Russian joke#Political jokes|Russian political jokes]]; also [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union]].''

{{quotation|
''Q:'' Rabinovich, what is a fortune?&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' A fortune is to live in our [[Socialist]] motherland.&lt;br/&gt;
''Q:'' And what's a misfortune?&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' A misfortune is to have such a fortune.}}
Or
{{quotation|An old [[Armenians|Armenian]] is on his deathbed: "My children, remember to defend the Jews."&lt;br/&gt;
"Why Jews?" &lt;br/&gt;
"Because if they are gone, we will be next."}}
Or
{{quotation|An old Jewish man is picked up by the Stalinist police and brought in for questioning:&lt;br&gt;
''Q:'' Where were you born?!&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;br/&gt;
''Q:'' Where do you live?!&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' [[Leningrad]].&lt;br/&gt;
''Q:'' (menacingly) Where would you like to die?!&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' St. Petersburg.}}
Or, in the last years of the Soviet Union:
{{quotation|
''Q:'' Comrade Lev, why now, just when things are getting better for your people, are you applying for an exit visa to make ''[[aliyah]]'' to Israel?&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' Well, comrade, there are two reasons. One is that my next-door neighbor is ''[[Pamyat]]'' and he tells me that after they get rid of you communists, they are coming next after the Jews.&lt;br/&gt;
''Q:'' But they will never get rid of us communists!&lt;br/&gt;
''A:'' I know, I know, of course you are right! And that's the ''other'' reason.}}
Or
{{quotation|An old Jewish man was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union, to emigrate to Israel. When he was searched at the Moscow airport, the customs official found a bust of Lenin.&lt;br/&gt;
''Customs:'' What is that?&lt;br/&gt;
''Old man:'' What is that? What is that?! Don't say "''What'' is that?" say "''Who'' is that?" That is Lenin! The genius who thought up this worker's paradise!&lt;br/&gt;
The official laughed and let the old man through.&lt;br/&gt;
The old man arrived at Tel Aviv airport, where an Israeli customs official found the bust of Lenin.&lt;br/&gt;
''Customs:'' What is that?&lt;br/&gt;
''Old man:'' What is that? What is that?! Don't say "''What'' is that?" say "''Who'' is that?" That is Lenin! The sonofabitch! I will put him on display in my toilet for all the years he prevented an old man from coming home.&lt;br/&gt;
The official laughed and let him through.&lt;br/&gt;
When he arrived at his family's house in Jerusalem, his grandson saw him unpack the bust.&lt;br/&gt;
''Grandson:'' Who is that?&lt;br/&gt;
''Old man:'' Who is that? Who is that?! Don't say "''Who'' is that?" say "''What'' is that?" ''That'', my child, is eight pounds of gold!}}

===Israeli humor===
[[Israel]]i humor featured many of the same themes as Jewish humor elsewhere, making fun of the country and its habits, while containing a fair bit of [[black comedy|gallows humor]] as well, as a joke from a 1950 Israeli joke book indicates:

{{quotation|An elderly man refuses to leave for the air raid shelter until he can find his dentures. His wife yells at him, "What, you think they are dropping [[sandwich]]es?"}}

Israelis' view of themselves:
{{quotation|
An Israeli, a Brit, a Russian, a Vietnamese, and an American are sitting in a restaurant. A reporter comes by and asks, "Excuse me, but can I get your opinion on the recent grain shortage in the third world?" &lt;br/&gt;
The Brit asks: "What's a 'shortage'?" &lt;br/&gt;
The Vietnamese asks: "What's 'grain'?"&lt;br/&gt;
The Russian asks: "What's an 'opinion'?" &lt;br/&gt;
The American asks: "What's the third world?"&lt;br/&gt;
The Israeli asks: "What's 'excuse me'?"&lt;br/&gt;
: (As a note, this is not strictly an Israeli joke; the Israeli can be replaced by other stereotypically rude or overbearing people—for example, New Yorkers—or those used to being treated as second-rate citizens, with little effect on the joke.)}}

Finally, in a clash of Rabbinical humor and Israeli humor:
{{quotation|A Rabbi dies and goes up to the gates of heaven. Before he's let in, the angel in charge has to consult with God for a long period of time if he deserves a place in heaven. As the Rabbi is waiting, an Israeli bus driver approaches the gates of heaven. Without a second thought, the angel who was consulting with God let the bus driver through. The Rabbi points at the bus driver and yells, "Hey! How come he gets in so quickly? He's a simple bus driver, while I'm a Rabbi!" The angel explains, "Dear Rabbi, you don't understand. When you would be giving your sermon during the prayer services, your whole congregation would fall asleep. When this bus driver drove towards [[Tel Aviv]], all his passengers would be at the edge of their seats praying to God!"}}

'''Joseph Bosworth''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (1788 – 27 May 1876) was an [[England|English]] scholar of the [[Anglo-Saxon language]] and compiler of the first major Anglo-Saxon dictionary.

==Biography==
Born in [[Derbyshire]] in 1788, Bosworth was educated at [[Repton School]] as a 'Poor Scholar' but left in his early teens and did not go to university{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Despite the lack of a degree he somehow gained sufficient academic standing for the Church of England to allow him to become a priest. He became a curate in Bunny, Notts in 1814 and three years later became vicar of [[Little Horwood]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. He was proficient in many European languages and made a particular study of Anglo-Saxon. This suggests that his years between leaving Repton and becoming a priest were spent working for someone whose own interests lay in these directions and who greatly encouraged Bosworth's academic development. There is no proof as to who this was but possible candidates are [[Sharon Turner]] (1768-1847) {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}},  a London solicitor turned researcher or [[Alexander Crombie]] (1762-1840), a Scottish-born philologist and proprietor of a school in London.

Bosworth was awarded an M.A. in 1822 by the [[University of Aberdeen]] on the recommendation of three other Buckinghamshire clergymen{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. In  1823, his ''Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar'' appeared, and he also matriculated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] as a [[Ten-year man|'ten-year' student]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BSWT823J|name=Bosworth, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In July 1825 he was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 1829, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bosworth%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|accessdate = 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, Bosworth went to the Netherlands as a chaplain, first in [[Amsterdam]] and then in [[Rotterdam]]. In 1831, the degree of Ph.D. was conferred on him by the [[University of Leyden]]. Trinity College, Cambridge granted him the degree of B.D. in 1834 and D.D. in 1839. He remained in the Netherlands until 1840, working on his ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary|A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language]]'' (1838), his best-known work. [[Thomas Northcote Toller]] later compiled a new edition of the dictionary based on Bosworth's work, both printed and in manuscript,{{sfn|Henry|1886}} and added a supplement (2 vols. 1898-1921).  The [[University of Aberdeen]] granted him a LL.D. in 1838 on the recommendation of [[Alexander Crombie]] (see above) and Thomas Orger{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

In 1858 Bosworth became Rector of [[Water Stratford]], Buckinghamshire, and [[Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He gave £10,000 to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867 for the establishment of the [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon|professorship of Anglo-Saxon]].{{sfn|Henry|1886}} He died on 27 May 1876 leaving behind him a mass of annotations on the Anglo-Saxon charters{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} and was buried on 2 June 1876 in [[Water Stratford|Water Stratford churchyard]].{{sfn|Henry|1886}} Income from his estate was left to various relatives for their lifetimes but as they died it was added to the endowment of his Oxford professorship.

==Legacy==
Bosworth was succeeded by [[John Earle (professor)|John Earle]] (1824–1903) and [[Arthur Sampson Napier]] (1853–1916). 
In 1916, the  chair  was renamed to [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] in honour of Bosworth and his endowment, the first "Rawlinson and Bosworth" professor being [[Sir William Alexander Craigie]] (1867–1957), who in 1925 moved to a post at the University of Chicago (in order to work on his ''Dictionary of American English'') and was succeeded by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who held the post from 1925 to 1945.

The '''Juan B. Ambrosetti Museum of Ethnography''' is an [[Argentine]] museum maintained by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] School of Philosophy and Letters and located in [[Buenos Aires]].

==Overview==

An estate on an eight-hectare (20 acre) property in Buenos Aires' [[Nueva Pompeya]] ward became the site of a homemade museum in 1866, when 14-year-old [[Francisco Moreno]] and his father classified and mounted their extensive collection of fossils and artifacts, gathered in excursions along the property and surroundings. The younger Moreno organized his collection as a public display, and with funding from the [[Province of Buenos Aires]], inaugurated the Anthropology and Ethnography Museum of Buenos Aires in 1879.&lt;ref name=museo&gt;[http://museoetnografico.filo.uba.ar/portalMuseo.html Museo Etnográfico Ambrosetti: Historia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706084816/http://museoetnografico.filo.uba.ar/portalMuseo.html |date=2011-07-06 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selknam bow.JPG|left|thumb|165px|Bow and tools of the [[Selknam]] People ([[Tierra del Fuego]])]]

Featuring over 15,000 artifacts, the collection was ultimately transferred to the new [[La Plata Museum]] in 1888. Explorations in the [[Gran Chaco]] region conducted at the time by [[University of Buenos Aires]] naturalist [[Juan Bautista Ambrosetti]] led to an extensive, new collection, however, and in 1904, the latter inaugurated the University of Buenos Aires Museum of [[Ethnography]].&lt;ref name=museo/&gt;

The museum became the first in Argentina to introduce guided [[excursion]]s for its patrons, and travels along the [[Inca road system]] resulted in the 1908 discovery of [[Pucará de Tilcara]], among the best-preserved ruins of settlements by [[Pre-Inca cultures]] in the area. Elaborate [[petroglyphs]] and over 3,000 other relics were recovered and catalogued in the following three years, and most were added to the collections of the Museum of Ethnography.&lt;ref name=museo/&gt; The settlement itself was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1116 UNESCO World Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Ambrosetti died in 1917, and its management was continued by his collaborators, Drs. [[Salvador Debenedetti]] and [[Félix Faustino Outes|Félix Outes]]. The museum was relocated to its present location in the city's [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] ward in 1927; the [[Italianate]] structure had been designed by [[Pedro Benoit]] for the School of Law, and completed in 1878. Many of the collections of archeology and anthropology of the [[Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum]] were assigned to this museum in the decade of 1940, despite this, the institution became largely overshadowed. It was bolstered, however, by the 1958 creation of a Degree in [[Anthropology]] by the University of Buenos Aires, and the institution was subsequently transferred to the university's School of Philosophy and Letters.&lt;ref name=museo/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3818">{{About|judicial philosophy|other uses|Minimalism (disambiguation)}}

'''Judicial minimalism''' refers to a philosophy in [[United States constitutional law]] which promotes itself as a politically moderate viewpoint such as that of retired Judge Sandra Day O'Connor. It is often compared to other judicial philosophies such as judicial activism, judicial originalism, and judicial textualism.

==The minimalist viewpoint==
Minimalists offer very small, case-specific interpretations of Constitutional Law as an alternative to what they see as the excesses of extremists on both sides.  They believe that a stable Constitutional Law is in everybody's interest, and place great importance on the concept of precedent and ''[[stare decisis]]''.  They argue that only very small interpretations away from precedent, narrowly applied, and based on the general direction of society constitute true [[judicial restraint]] rather than any originalist or strict constructionist viewpoint (in opposition to conservatives), while still allowing for a [[Living Constitution]] (albeit one with a much slower adaptation than many liberals would like). Depending on the minimalist's particular preferences, a minimalist on the court would be likely to either very slowly bolster or chip away at [[abortion]] precedents rather than proclaim a lasting ban on or legalization of abortion via Constitutional rulings.

[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor]] is often hailed by minimalists as their ideal Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, Cass (2006). ''Stanford Law Review'', Volume 58, Issue 6 - April 2006, "Problems with Minimalism."&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurring opinion in the 2011 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[NASA v. Nelson]]'', Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] derided minimalism as a "never-say-never disposition [which] does damage for several reasons".&lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;[[Eugene Volokh|Volokh, Eugene]] (2011-01-19) [http://volokh.com/2011/01/19/judicial-minimalism-at-least-of-one-sort-pro-and-con/#more-41851 “Judicial Minimalism” (at Least of One Sort), Pro and Con], ''[[Volokh Conspiracy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Samuel Alito]], writing for the majority, defended the Court's minimalist approach in choosing to "decide the case before us and leave broader issues for another day".&lt;ref name=Volokh/&gt;

==Summary and complaints against "judicial extremism"==

Largely associated with [[Cass Sunstein|Cass R. Sunstein]], it is a viewpoint which criticizes the more [[American conservatism|conservative]] stance of [[originalism]] as being [[judicial activism]] in disguise.  Minimalists believe that a faithful application of originalist theory would result in a system of constitutional law in which modern societal standards would be ignored, in favor of the now-antiquated opinions held by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], probably including their views on [[gender equality]], [[racism]], and other things, which modern society would find objectionable. Minimalists claim that conservatives who subscribe to originalism are likely to ignore [[precedent]] where it is convenient for conservative political aims. Minimalists also criticize traditional [[American liberalism|liberal]] judicial activism as overexpansive and as ignorant of [[precedent]] when it is convenient to liberal political aims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1814">'''''L'Année épigraphique''''' (''The Epigraphic Year'', standard abbreviation '''''AE''''') is a French publication on [[epigraphy]]. It was set up by [[René Cagnat]], as holder of the chair of 'Epigraphy and Roman antiquities' at the [[Collège de France]] and Jean-Guillaume Feignon, as assistant epigraphist, in 1888. 
It was linked to the ''[[Revue archéologique]]'' until the issue dated 1964, when it became an autonomous publication of the  [[Presses universitaires de France|PUF]] benefiting from a grant from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], a part was edited under its aegis. It systematically collects all the inscriptions discovered each year from all across the world concerning [[Ancient Rome]], mainly in Latin or ancient Greek, and sorted by period.

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

{{History of Louisiana}}
{{Confederate states in the American Civil War}}

[[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] [[Louisiana]] was a [[slave state]], where enslaved [[African Americans]] had comprised the majority of the population during the eighteenth century [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] colonial period. By the time the [[Louisiana Purchase|United States acquired the territory]] (1803) and [[Louisiana]] became a [[U.S. state|state]] (1812), the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was entrenched. By 1860, 47% of the state's population were enslaved, though the state also had one of the largest free black populations in the [[United States]]. Much of the [[White American|white]] population, particularly in the cities, supported southern [[states rights|states' rights]] and slavery, while pockets of support for the U.S. and its [[Federal government of the United States|government]] existed in the more rural areas.

Louisiana declared that it had [[secession|seceded]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 26, 1861. [[New Orleans in the Civil War|New Orleans]], the largest city in [[History of the Southern United States|the South]], was strategically important as a [[port]] city due to its southernmost location on the [[Mississippi River]] and its access to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] early on planned for its capture. The city was taken by [[Union Army|U.S. Army]] forces on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the U.S. government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana then under [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] control as a state within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], with its own elected representatives to the [[U.S. Congress]]. For the latter part of the war, both the [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S.]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] recognized their own distinct [[Governor of Louisiana|Louisiana governors]].&lt;ref name="hearn"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Capture of New Orleans 1862|last=Hearn|first=Chester G.|year=1995|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0-8071-1945-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–9}}

==Politics and strategy in Louisiana==
===Secession===
{{main|Louisiana secession}}
On January 8, 1861, Louisiana Governor [[Thomas Overton Moore]] ordered the Louisiana militia to occupy the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] arsenal at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and the U.S. forts guarding New Orleans, Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. A wealthy [[Plantations in the American South|planter]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slave holder]], Moore acted aggressively to engineer the secession of Louisiana from the Union by a convention on January 23. Only five percent of the public were represented in the convention, and the state's military actions were ordered before secession had been established—in defiance of the state constitution, which called for a popular referendum to establish a convention. Moore attempted to justify these actions, saying: "I do not think it comports with the honor and self-respect of Louisiana as a slave-holding state to live under the government of a Black Republican president", using an epithet for Republicans used by many Democrats at the time.

The strategies advanced to defend Louisiana and the other [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] states of the Confederacy were first, the idea of [[King Cotton]]; that an unofficial embargo of cotton to Europe would force Britain to use its navy to intervene in protecting the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The second was a [[privateer]] fleet established by the issue of letters of [[marque and reprisal]] by President [[Jefferson Davis]], which would sweep the sea clear of U.S. naval and commercial ships, and at the same time sustain Louisiana's booming [[port]] economy. The third was a reliance on the ring of pre-war masonry forts of the [[Seacoast defense in the United States|Third System]] of American coastal defense, combined with a fleet of revolutionary new [[ironclads]], to safeguard the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] from the U.S. Navy. All of these strategies were failures.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 2-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1861, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue practicing slavery:

{{Quotation|With the social balance wheel of slavery to regulate its machinery, we may fondly indulge the hope that our Southern government will be perpetual... Louisiana looks to the formation of a Southern confederacy to preserve the blessings of African slavery...|George Williamson|speech to the Texan secession convention|(March 1861).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=E.W.|last=Winkler|title=Journal of the Secession Convention of Texas|location=Texas|date=1861|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/fighting-for-slavery.80951/page-3|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One Louisianan artillery soldier gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that "I never want to see the day when a negro is put on an equality with a white person. There is too many free niggers . . . now to suit me, let alone having four millions."&lt;ref name=JMMcPherson1997p109&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qhEHVki8tEC&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=109|last=McPherson|first=James M.|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M. McPherson|isbn=0-19-509-023-3|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union plans===
[[File:New Orleans Map 1863.jpg|thumb|300px|Approaches to [[New Orleans]], [[Department of the Gulf]] Map No. 5, February 14, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Official atlas: plate XC.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Union's response to Moore's leveraged secession was embodied in U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s realization that the [[Mississippi River]] was the "backbone of the Rebellion." If control of the river were accomplished, the largest city in the Confederacy would be taken back for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and the Confederacy would be split in half. Lincoln moved rapidly to back Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]]'s idea of a naval advance up the river to both capture [[New Orleans]] and maintain Lincoln's political support; by supplying cotton to northern textile manufacturers and renewing trade and exports from the port of New Orleans. The U.S. Navy would become both a formidable invasion force and a means of transporting Union forces, along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. This strategic vision would prove victorious in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Chester G. Hearn, ''The Capture of New Orleans, 1862'' (LSU Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red River Campaign, Politics &amp; Cotton in the Civil War|last=Johnson|first=Ludwell H.|year=1993|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=0-87338-486-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10–78}}

==Notable Civil War leaders from Louisiana==
A number of notable leaders were associated with Louisiana during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], including some of the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]]'s senior ranking generals, as well as several men who led [[brigade]]s and [[division (military)|division]]s. Antebellum Louisiana residents [[P.G.T. Beauregard]], [[Braxton Bragg]], and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]] all commanded significant independent armies during the war. Taylor's forces were among the last active Confederate armies in the field when the war closed.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 22-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Watkins Allen]] led a brigade during the middle of the war before becoming the Confederate Governor of Louisiana from 1864 to 1865. [[Randall L. Gibson]], another competent brigade commander, became a [[Reconstruction era of the United States|postbellum]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] as a Democrat. Other brigadiers of note included [[Alfred Mouton]] (killed at the [[Battle of Mansfield]]), [[Harry T. Hays]], [[Chatham Roberdeau Wheat]] (commander of the celebrated "[[Louisiana Tigers]]"  of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]), and [[Francis T. Nicholls]] (commander of the "Pelican Brigade" until he lost his left foot at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]]). [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Lidell]] was a prominent brigade commander in the [[Army of Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fighting Men of the Civil War|last=Davis|first=William C.|year=1991|publisher=Smithmark Publishers Inc.|isbn=0-8317-3264-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|166}}&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Gray (politician)|Henry Gray]], a wealthy plantation owner from [[Bienville Parish]], was a brigadier general under Richard Taylor before being elected to the [[Second Confederate Congress]] late in the war. [[Leroy A. Stafford]] was among a handful of Louisiana generals to be killed during the war. [[Albert Gallatin Blanchard]] was a rarity—a Confederate general born in [[Massachusetts]].

Governor Thomas Overton Moore, came held office from 1860 through early 1864. When war erupted, he unsuccessfully lobbied the Confederate government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] for a strong defense of New Orleans. Two days before the city surrendered in April 1862, Moore and the legislature abandoned [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] as the state capital, relocating to [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] in May. Thomas Moore organized military resistance at the state level, ordered the burning of [[cotton]], cessation of trade with the Union forces, and heavily recruited troops for the state [[militia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration to Union==
After meeting the requirements of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], including ratifying amendments to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] to abolish slavery and grant citizenship to former slaves, Louisiana's representatives were readmitted to Congress. The state was fully restored to the United States on July 9, 1868.

As part of the [[Compromise of 1877]], under which Southern Democrats acknowledged [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as president, there was the understanding that the Republicans would meet certain demands. One affecting Louisiana was the removal of all U.S. military forces from the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=C. Vann|title=Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction|date=1966|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|pages=169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, U.S. troops remained in only [[Louisiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], but the Compromise saw their complete withdrawal from the region.

The '''Manitou Cliff Dwellings''' are a group of relocated [[Anasazi]] ruins [[cliff dwelling]]s and museums located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] on [[U.S. Highway 24 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 24]] in [[Manitou Springs, Colorado|Manitou Springs]].  

The Anasazi Museum was established and the cliff dwellings built starting in 1904, and were opened to the public in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffdwellingsmuseum.com/museum.htm Anasazi Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161716/http://www.cliffdwellingsmuseum.com/museum.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum features displays about the lives of the ancient Anasazi, including exhibits of archaeological artifacts, tools, pottery and weapons. Visitors can also walk through the ancient-style ruins outside.

==History==
The Anasazi lived and roamed the [[Four Corners]] area of the Southwestern United States from 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1300.  The Anasazi did not live in the Manitou Springs area, but lived and built their cliff dwellings in the Four Corners area, several hundred miles southwest of Manitou Springs. The Manitou Cliff Dwellings were built at their present location in the early 1900s, as a museum, preserve, and tourist attraction. The stones were taken from a collapsed Anasazi site near [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]] in southwest Colorado, shipped by railroad to Manitou Springs, and assembled in their present form as Anasazi-style buildings closely resembling those found in the Four Corners.  The project was done with the approval and participation of well-known anthropologist Dr. [[Edgar Lee Hewett]], and Virginia McClurg, founder of the Colorado Cliff Dwelling Association.&lt;ref&gt;Troy Lovata, ''Inauthentic Archaeologies'', (Walnut Creek, Calif: 2007, Left Coast Press) {{ISBN|978-1-59874-011-0}}, p.49-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Sprague]], ''Newport in the Rockies: The Life &amp; Good Times of Colorado Springs '', (various editions, including Swallow Press, 1988) {{ISBN|978-0-8040-0899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manzai by unknown artist - wittig collection.jpg|thumb|200px|A pair of ''Manzai'' performers at a New Year celebration; the ''tsukkomi'' at front, the ''boke'' behind him. 19th-century Japanese painting]]

{{nihongo|'''''Manzai'''''|[[wikt:漫才|漫才]]}} is a traditional style of [[stand-up comedy]] in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA608&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Manzai"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzai usually involves two performers (''manzaishi'')—a [[Double act|straight man]] (''[[Glossary of owarai terms#tsukkomi|tsukkomi]]'') and a [[double act|funny man]] (''[[Glossary of owarai terms#boke|boke]]'')—trading [[joke]]s at great speed.  Most of the jokes revolve around mutual misunderstandings, [[double-talk]], [[pun]]s and other verbal gags.

In recent times, ''manzai'' has often been associated with the [[Osaka]] region, and ''manzai'' comedians often speak in the [[Kansai dialect]] during their acts. 

[[Yoshimoto Kogyo]], a large entertainment conglomerate based in Osaka, introduced Osaka-style ''manzai'' to [[Tokyo]] audiences, and coined the term "漫才" (one of several ways of writing the word ''manzai'' in Japanese; see "etymology" below) in 1933. In 2015, Matayoshi Naoki's manzai novel, {{nihongo|''[[Hibana: Spark]]''|火花}} won the [[Akutagawa Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kyodo, Jiji |title=Comedian Matayoshi's literary win offers hope for sagging publishing industry |date=July 17, 2015 |newspaper=Japan Times |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/07/17/entertainment-news/comedian-matayoshi-shares-akutagawa-prize-higashiyama-bags-naoki/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827052500/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/07/17/entertainment-news/comedian-matayoshi-shares-akutagawa-prize-higashiyama-bags-naoki/ |archivedate=August 27, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A mini-series adaptation was released on Netflix in 2016.

==History==
Originally based around a festival to welcome the [[Japanese New Year|New Year]], ''manzai'' traces its origins back to the [[Heian period]]. The two ''manzai'' performers came with messages from the gods and this was worked into a standup routine, with one performer showing some sort of opposition to the word of the other. This pattern still exists in the roles of the ''boke'' and the ''tsukkomi''.

[[File:Manzai.jpg|Print depicting two ''manzai'' comedic actors, also in a New Year setting; c. 1825|thumb|left]]

Continuing into the [[Edo period]], the style focused increasingly on the humor aspects of stand-up, and various regions of Japan developed their own unique styles of ''manzai'', such as {{nihongo|''Owari manzai''|尾張万歳|}}, {{nihongo|''Mikawa manzai''|三河万歳|}}, and {{nihongo|''Yamato manzai''|大和万歳|}}. With the arrival of the [[Meiji Period]], {{nihongo|''Osaka manzai''|大阪万才|}} began changes that would see it surpass in popularity the styles of the former period, although at the time [[rakugo]] was still considered the more popular form of entertainment.

With the end of the [[Taishō period]], [[Yoshimoto Kogyo|Yoshimoto Kōgyō]]—which itself was founded at the beginning of the era, in 1912—introduced a new style of ''manzai'' lacking much of the celebration that had accompanied it in the past. This new style proved successful and spread all over Japan, including Tokyo. Riding on the waves of new communication technology, ''manzai'' quickly spread through the mediums of [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], [[radio]], and eventually, [[television]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanese.about.com/library/blhiraculture31.htm Hiragana lesson through Japanese culture – manzai&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanfortheuninvited.com/articles/manzai.html Manzai (Double-act comedy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gojapan.about.com/od/japanesetheater/a/yosetheater.htm Japanese yose theater – Japanese comedy shows&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103193307/http://gojapan.about.com/od/japanesetheater/a/yosetheater.htm |date=3 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corkill, Edan, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ft20120525r1.html Yoshimoto Kogyo play reveals manzai's U.S. roots]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 May 2012, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, Brian, "[http://kotaku.com/5846764/ni-no-kunis-funny-bone-has-quite-the-history Ni no Kuni’s Funny Bone Has Quite the History]", ''[[Kotaku]]'', 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[kanji]] for ''manzai'' have been written in various ways throughout the ages. It was originally written as {{nihongo||萬歳||lit. ''[[ten thousand years]]'' or ''banzai'', meaning something like "long life"}}, using 萬 rather than the alternative form of the character, 万, and the simpler form 才 for 歳 (which also can be used to write a word meaning 'talent, ability'). The arrival of ''Osaka manzai'' brought another character change, this time changing the first character to 漫.

==''Boke'' and ''tsukkomi''==
Similar in execution to the concepts of "funny man" and "straight man" in [[double act]] comedy (e.g. [[Abbott and Costello]]), these roles are a very important characteristic of ''manzai''. {{nihongo|''Boke''|ボケ}} comes from the verb ''bokeru'' (惚ける or 呆ける) which carries the meaning of "senility" or "air headed-ness" and is reflected in the ''boke''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word {{nihongo|''tsukkomi''|突っ込み}} refers to the role the second comedian plays in "butting in" and correcting the ''boke''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s errors.  In performances it is common for the ''tsukkomi'' to berate the ''boke'' and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional ''manzai'' prop often used for this purpose is a {{nihongo|pleated paper fan called a ''[[harisen]]''|張り扇}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C WWWJDIC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103191356/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C |date=3 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional ''manzai'' prop is a small drum, usually carried (and used) by the ''boke''.  A Japanese bamboo and paper umbrella is another common prop.

The tradition of ''tsukkomi'' and ''boke'' is often used in other [[Owarai|Japanese comedy]], although it may not be as obviously portrayed as it usually is in ''manzai''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==What Media Cloud does==

On May 6, 2011 the Berkman Center relaunched Media Cloud, “a platform designed to let scholars, journalists and anyone interested in the world of media ask and answer quantitative questions about media attention. For more than a year, we’ve been collecting roughly 50,000 English-language stories a day from 17,000 media sources, including major mainstream media outlets, left and right-leaning American political blogs, as well as from 1000 popular general interest blogs.”&lt;ref name=relaunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Zuckerman|first=Ethan|title=Media Cloud, Relaunched|url=http://www.mediacloud.org/blog/2011/05/06/media-cloud-relaunched/|accessdate=20 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227203521/http://www.mediacloud.org/blog/2011/05/06/media-cloud-relaunched/|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The data was used to “analyze the differences in coverage of international crises in professional and citizen media and to study the rapid shifts in media attention that have accompanied the flood of breaking news that’s characterized early 2011.”&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt; International research has led the way to publishing of “new research that uses Media Cloud to help us understand the structure of professional and citizen media in Russia and in Egypt.”&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt;
The relaunch of Media Cloud allows users who are interested in using its tools to analyze “what bloggers and journalists are paying attention to, ignoring, celebrating or condemning."&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt;

==Design Process==
Discussions about the media landscape were a constant between the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard University’s Berkman Center]], and they faced the common obstacle of needing a solution for crunching data about news stories in large scale, in order to obtain the answers to certain questions. The motivation for the creation of Media Cloud did not come from one particular question, but from a myriad of them. In the about section of their webpage, the developers of Media Cloud cite some of the early driving questions the system was intended to solve:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*''Do bloggers introduce storylines into mainstream media or the other way around?''
*''Is online media or print news more powerful in setting news agendas?''
*''What parts of the world are being covered or ignored by different media sources?''
*''Where and how do important news stories begin?''
*''How are competing terms for the same event used in different publications?''
*''Can we characterize the overall mix of coverage for a given source?''
*''How do patterns differ between local and national news coverage?''
*''Can we track news cycles for specific issues?''
*''Do online comments shape the news?''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;	
The [[data analysis]] would then be able to analyze different aspects of the news coverage, such as the media sources and the languages that would cover these stories.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==How it works==

First, Media Cloud chooses a set of media sources and uncovers the feeds for each.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Each feed is then crawled in order to determine if any stories have been added to any feed.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; All content is then extracted of each relevant story. Any advertisements or other navigation pages are left behind.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The text of each story is broken down into word counts, which shows the different word choices that each media source uses in discussing any relevant topic.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The word counts are then analyzed and published to show data trends.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Uses and application==
Media Cloud was used from September 2010 through January 2012 to obtain data for a study at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] that analyzed a set of 9,757 online stories related to the [[Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act|COICA]]-[[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]]-[[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]] debate. The open source application was utilized for the text and [[link analysis]] portion of the research.&lt;ref name=sopa&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckman Center for Internet and Society|title=New Publication: "Social Mobilization and the Networked Public Sphere : Mapping the SOPA-PIPA Debate"|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/8416|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from this research were published in July 2013 [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2295953].

The [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] website offers an interactive visualization map [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/mediacloud/2013/mapping_sopa_pipa/#] from this study, which was created to “depict media sources (“nodes”, which appear as circles on the map with different colors denoting different media types)… [and] track media sources and their linkages within discrete time slices and allows users to zoom into the controversy to see which entities are present in the debate during a given period…”&lt;ref name=sopa/&gt; This map allows for the visualization of how the [[Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act|COICA]]-[[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]]-[[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]] controversy evolved over time by using [[link analysis]].

Many companies are taking advantage of the ability to analyze and organize this new data that media cloud can create. Companies such as [[RAMP Simulation Software for Modelling Reliability, Availability and Maintainability|RAMP]] offer a "cloud-based" way to analyze and create every type of [[metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramp.com/platform/mediacloud/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217175447/http://www.ramp.com/platform/mediacloud/ |archivedate=2014-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion about media bias has been affected in the way that the Media Cloud project is viewed as having transformed the debate into less of a matter of personal opinions of journalists, and more into a data-driven discussion.&lt;ref name="globalviews"&gt;{{cite news |first=Shan |last=Wang |title=This new collaboration hopes to aid the endless debates about media with some actual hard data |date=6 June 2016 |newspaper=NiemanLab |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/06/this-new-collaboration-hopes-to-aid-the-endless-debates-about-media-with-some-actual-hard-data/ |access-date= 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confirmation bias]] is one form of development of media bias, in which individuals will seek sources of information that align with the beliefs they already have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Plous | first=Scott | title=The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making | page=233 | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the ultimate consequence of confirmation bias is the creation of [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]], a situation in which all the sides of a dispute (usually two) are talking only to themselves, and that will most likely stagnate the debate and muddle the creation of consensus.&lt;ref name="echochamber"&gt;{{cite news |author=sdf |title=John Gorenfeld, Moon the Messiah, and the Media Echo Chamber |date=24 June 2004 |newspaper=Daily Kos |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/6/23/34812/- |access-date= 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of Media Cloud about the [[Gamergate controversy]], an episode of personal attacks on female game developers,&lt;ref name="gamergate"&gt;{{cite news |first=Fruzsina |last= Eördögh |title=Gamergate and the new horde of digital saboteurs |date=25 November 2014 | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/Tech-Culture/2014/1125/Gamergate-and-the-new-horde-of-digital-saboteurs |access-date= 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed two cluster of news sources and discussions that were divided by the criteria of the most common opinions. Although there were links between these points in the analysis graph, they did not represent the creation of consensus, and were pointed to as hate-links, in which the sources that would link sources from the other clusters would do so in order to strongly disagree with the content of the link.&lt;ref name="hatelinking"&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=Zeynep |last=Tufekci |title=Big Questions for Social Media Big Data: Representativeness, Validity and Other Methodological Pitfalls |date=28 March 2014 | eprint=1403.7400|class=cs.SI }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bridgesorhatelinks"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alyssa |last=Smith| author2=Nathan Matias |title=Bridges or Hate-Links?

==Influence==

Media cloud's key functionality comes from using [[web crawling]] to periodically fetch articles from various sources and then break them down into words that are counted. These word counts are then analyzed to determine what sources are saying about certain news.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; This process is not unique to Media Cloud and in fact is an application of the recently popular [[streaming algorithm|stream algorithms]]. These are algorithms characterized by operating on a continuous and unending stream of data, rather than waiting for a complete batch of information to be assembled. These algorithms are very useful because they allow monitoring of trends without having to know which topics are going to be the most popular. This type of functionality first noticeably emerged with network managers trying to dynamically see which sites have the highest traffic volumes. From there, stream algorithms have been used to have programs dynamically act on financial information, and by researchers whose experiments generate more data than can be analyzed, so stream algorithms are used to dynamically filter the initial data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/the-britney-spears-problem/1&lt;/ref&gt; Media cloud has similarly taken advantage of the functionality of stream algorithms to dynamically associate words to news as it crawls through various sources, and then provide its signature service of generating sentences based on words that the users are interested in and related media reports.

==Ideology==
The [[Center for Civic Media]] states their goal as the fostering of political action and the supporting of civic media, by providing a [[wikt:hub|hub]] for the production of technological innovation that can be used as tools for such purposes, and by the coordination of community-based design processes at municipal, nation and global levels.&lt;ref name="aboutciviccenter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://civic.mit.edu/about |title=About the Center for Civic Media |author=Ethan Zuckerman |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Media Cloud is one of the tools used by the Center for Civic Media, and with the capacity for providing [[data analysis]] about news coverage from different sources, it has been used in many situations to derive conclusions about the history of news coverage of an event or category, and to generate [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref name="sevenprojects"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://civic.mit.edu/blog/ethanz/understanding-media-coverage-media-cloud-experiments |title=Understanding Media Coverage: Seven Summer-Long Experiments With Media Cloud |author=Ethan Zuckerman |date=26 August 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers of Media Cloud intend to help [[Internet activism|online activism]], providing tools to verify the impact of media stories written by activists. These online activists can verify their impact by data analysis acquired using the tool, and looking for important locations it was not able to reach. The sharing of content that has not reached specific target groups can be done by the use of the provided platform.&lt;ref name="mediacloudgoals"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/can-innovators-build-a-future-thats-both-disruptive-and-just-49871 |title=Can innovators build a future that’s both disruptive and just? |author=Ethan Zuckerman |date=30 October 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project self-identifies as one of solution by [[Innovation]].

==Studies==

===SOPA/PIPA===
A social study that states that the public debate was responsible for the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] failing, and how it played its role, was proposed by five researchers of the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University]]. The data analysis was based on the use of Media Cloud to analyze the profile of those engaged in the issue. Among those involved in the debate, the study lists people from all groups of political beliefs. As for the sources of coverage and platforms for discussion, tech media, gaming sites and political blogs are said to have played a role bigger than the one of mainstream media. The main conclusion of the study is that the diversification of the political views rather than polarization of the debate enabled the creation of consensus which pressured the policymakers to vote against the bill.&lt;ref name="sopapipa"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2295953|title=Social Mobilization and the Networked Public Sphere: Mapping the SOPA-PIPA Debate |author=Benkler et al. |date=July 2013 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Trayvon Martin===
The [[Pew Research Center]] classified the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]], a teenager who was shot in the chest by a Florida policeman,&lt;ref name="MiamiHerald"&gt;{{cite news|first=Audra D. S.|last=Burch|author2=Laura Isensee |title=Trayvon Martin: a typical teen who loved video games, looked forward to prom|date=March 22, 2012|newspaper=The Miami Herald|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/trayvon-martin/article1939761.html |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most covered news with a social component in the five years that anteceded the event. The paper, conducted with use of Media Cloud, proposes that alternative media participation helped shift the focus of the story from the episode of the shooting to a series of reports on [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name="trayvonmartinstudy"&gt;{{cite news|first=Erdhaert|last=Graeff|author2=Matt Stempeck |author3=Ethan Zuckerman |title=The Battle for ‘Trayvon Martin’: Mapping a Media Controversy On- and Offline|date=17 January 2014|newspaper=First Monday|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4947/3821 |access-date= 7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deathoftrayvonmartin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/02/how-a-crime-becomes-political-trayvon-martin-and-the-way-different-media-co-create-the-news/ |title=How a crime becomes political: Trayvon Martin and the way different media co-create the news |author=Caroline O’Donovan |date=14 February 2014 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
A study by Julia Wejchert and Katherine Ida made use of Media Cloud to analyze the nature of the news coverage about the abortion debate, focusing on the most shared on social media. According to the proponents, the numbers of the study indicated that the [[News|media coverage]] was focused on legislation and activism. Also, after hand-classifying sources of news coverage as having specific [[Political Spectrum|political leanings]] ([[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]), they point to different use of imagery inside these clusters, with what they classified as liberal media showing protests, mainstream media showing legislative photos, and conservative media showing images of a fetus or a live infant. Julia and Katherine concluded from these results that there is a lack of strategy on the part of the [[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice side]], in contrast with what they see as a well-shaped narrative on the part of the [[United States pro-life movement|pro-life side]].&lt;ref name="sevenprojects"/&gt;

===Charlie Hebdo and Baga massacre===
During the first week of 2015, two different episodes of [[religious violence]] caused by [[Islamic Extremism|Islam extremists]] took place in [[Baga, Borno|Baga]] and [[Paris]]. A study conducted by media outlet [[The Conversation (website)|The Coversation]] using Media Cloud evaluated and compared the news coverage about the two events. The results of the study pointed to a much larger coverage of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]]&lt;ref name="hebdo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30708237 |title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror |date=14 January 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; than the [[2015 Baga massacre|Baga massacre]]&lt;ref name="baga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/13/opinion/boko-haram-7-questions/ |title=Boko Haram massacre: 7 questions worth asking |first=Elizabeth |last=Donnelly |date=13 January 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; globally. The study also reported that the coverage for the Paris attacks exceeded the coverage for the Baga massacre even in [[Nigeria]]. The report attributed the uneven media attention not only to [[Eurocentrism]], but to the difficulty in taking a side in the conflict between the [[Boko Haram]] and the [[Nigerian Army]].&lt;ref name="hebdoxbaga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/media-coverage-of-charlie-hebdo-and-the-baga-massacre-a-study-in-contrasts-36225 |title=Media coverage of Charlie Hebdo and the Baga massacre: a study in contrasts |first=Ethan |last=Zuckerman |date=13 January 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Net Neutrality===

A study of the Berkman Klein Center based on the results of data analysis of Media Cloud about the influence of the Internet&lt;ref name="netneutralitycomments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/09/02/what-can-we-learn-from-800000-public-comments-on-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan/ |title=What can we learn from 800,000 public comments on the FCC’s net neutrality plan? |first=Robert |last=Lannon|author2=apendleton |date=2 September 2014 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the overruling of the proposed policy on [[Net Neutrality]] by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] advocated that the diversity of the debate helped shape the result of the appeal.&lt;ref name="netneutrality"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.harvard.edu/files/2015_02_10_Score_Another_One_for_the_Internet_0.pdf |title=Score Another One for the Internet?

===Nirbhaya Case===
The news of the [[gang rape]] of a medical student, Nirbhaya, in [[New Delhi]]&lt;ref name="nirbhaya"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/nirbhaya-case-anger-and-protests-as-juvenile-delhi-gang-rapist-freed-after-three-years-in-reform-a6780601.html |title=Nirbhaya Case: Anger and widespread protests as juvenile Delhi gang rapist freed after three years in reform centre |author=Emma Henderson |date=20 December 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused a rise in news coverage of sexual assault in India. This event was the focus of a research study by Media Cloud that analyzed the nature of reports about sexual assault. The proponents of the study defended that the news coverage had ignored gender inequality as a cause for such episodes, and that they had been treated as episodic happenings, in which the individuals responsible were the only ones to blame, according to the data analysis they obtained.&lt;ref name="indianwomen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/anushka-shah/this-is-whats-wrong-with-how-the-indian-news-reports-womens-is/ |title=This Is What's Wrong With How The Indian News Reports Women's Issues|author=Anushka Shah |date=10 December 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future use ==
The day that Media Cloud relaunched, Ethan Zuckerman said, "We hope the tools we're providing are a complement to amazing efforts like Project for Excellence in Journalism's News Coverage and New Media indices--we consider their tools the gold standard for understanding what topics are discussed in American media. PEJ works their magic using talented teams of coders, who sample different corners of the media ecosystem to find out what's being discussed. We use huge data sets, algorithms, and automation to give a different picture, one focused on language instead of topic."&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt;

Future uses for Media Cloud can involve [[smart phone]] or [[tablet computer|tablet]] applications to introduce the platform to users away from a computer. A Media Cloud app could serve as a news source while on the go for users. If Media Cloud were to expand into different information sites, it could target social media sites and incorporate news into them. [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] have incorporated features for trending news and topics similar to what Media Cloud aims to do.

The tool is expanding to sources that are not qualified as media, to understand the repercussion of studied events.&lt;ref name="mediaghanaglobal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphic.com.gh/features/features/digital-media-and-ghana-s-place-on-the-global-stage.html |title=Digital Media and Ghana's Place on the Global Stage |first=Ethan |last=Zuckerman |date=24 August 2015 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is the main target, as it includes not only the sharing of news, but also the response to shared content.&lt;ref name="mediaghana"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontiersman.com/schools/student_view/today-s-social-media-and-its-impact-on-society/article_8ba11738-b45a-11e6-9242-fb81ead450f6.html |title=Today’s social media and its impact on society |first=Alley |last=Kelsey |date=27 November 2016 |access-date= 7 December 2016 |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mooghaun North Hoard''' or ''Great Clare Find'' is the name of an important Bronze Age hoard found at [[Mooghaun]] North, near Newmarket-on-Fergus in [[County Clare]], Ireland. Considered one of the greatest [[Bronze Age]] hoards of gold ever found north of the Alps, unfortunately most of the treasure was melted down soon after its discovery. What remains of the hoard is currently split between the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin and the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/info/objectsandtechniques.aspx National Museum of Ireland website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5133&amp;plaA=5133-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; It is no. 11 in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''.

==Discovery==
In March 1854, some workers building the [[West Clare Railway]] near [[Newmarket-on-Fergus]] were realigning a [[ditch|dyke]] near [[Mooghaun]] Lake, when they accidentally uncovered a huge cache of gold jewellery from the Bronze Age. While shifting a stone they brought to light a large cavity in the ground where the treasure was kept.  Most of the precious objects were sold to local dealers who melted them down for their [[bullion]] value and only 29 out of a total of over 150 objects survived. Most of the British Museum's share of the find was purchased from [[William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen|William Willoughby Cole]], 3rd Earl of Enniskillen in 1857.

==Description==
When discovered, the Mooghaun North Hoard was one of the largest Bronze Age treasures ever found in Northern or Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|13}}  It consisted of over 150 gold objects including 138 bracelets, six collars, two [[torc]]s and several other items which in total weighed over 5&amp;nbsp;kg. Just 29 objects survived the melting pot - 15 in the [[National Museum of Ireland|National Museum]] and 14 in the [[British Museum]]. The extant items of jewellery from the hoard are mostly crescent-shaped bracelets (23) and six neck collars. Fortunately many pieces from the hoard were copied before they were destroyed. Archaeologists are unsure why the hoard was deposited in the stone chamber - it may have been for safe-keeping during a local crisis or was perhaps a [[votive offering]] to the gods.

Recent research indicates that much of the gold used in the creation of these pieces came from the [[Mourne Mountains]] in County Down.&lt;ref name="Arch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

The '''Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología''' (MUNAE; ''National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology'') is a [[national museum]] of [[Guatemala]], dedicated to the conservation of [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnological]] artifacts and research into Guatemala's [[history of Guatemala|history]] and [[cultural heritage]]. The museum is located in [[Guatemala City]], at Finca La Aurora. First created by a governmental decree on 30 June 1898, the institution and collections of MUNAE relocated premises several times subsequently, until established in its present building in 1946. It has some 3000 square meters of exhibition space, and 1500 sq.m. devoted to restorative and research purposes. MUNAE's collections amount to some 20 thousand archaeological [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and 5 thousand ethnological items.

The '''Museo Popol Vuh''' (''Popol Vuh [[Museum]]'') is home to one of the major collections of [[Maya art]] in the world. It is located on the campus of the [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in Zone 10,  [[Guatemala City]] and is known for its extensive collection of [[pre-Columbian]] and colonial art of the [[Maya civilization|Maya culture]]. 

The Popol Vuh Museum is a private, nonprofit, scientific institution supported by its own funds and external donations. The museum is operated by a Board of Directors of citizens of [[Guatemala]] interested in the preservation and public display of the exhibits. One of its missions is to provide an educational focus for people who want to see and learn about the pre-Columbian past of Guatemala with the preservation, research, and diffusion of information.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; 

Although the museum is well known for its funerary [[ceramic art]], the collection includes a variety of portable stone sculptures, especially from the Preclassic period, and from the coast and adjacent highlands. The section on Maya pottery includes some of the best preserved Maya vases and bowls.&lt;ref name="numberthree"&gt;http://www.maya-archaeology.org/museums/popolvuh/popolvuh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|First page of the Popol Vuh manuscript, Newberry Library, Chicago, IL]]
The origin of the museum dates back to 1975, when Mr.Jorge Castillo hired Maro Tejada, a student of archaeology at la Universidad del Valle, to classify his extensive collection. After it was classified and set up for display in chronological order and it was opened up to the public in zone 1. After Mr.Castillo died in 1977, he decided to donate the collection to the Universidad Francisco Marroquín.The museum was created originally in 1977 to house the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Castillo and now forms part of a beautiful architectural complex of the [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in Guatemala City. Jorge and Ella Castillo donated most of their collection of archaeological and colonial pieces in 1978 which are the basis of the Popol Vuh Museum today. They began their private collection of archaeological and colonial objects years before they established founding in 1977. The first location was in La Reforma Ave and 16th street, [[Guatemala City]], but later moved to the Galerias Reforma building in Zone 9 in Guatemala City after three years.  Sixteen years later, it was moved to Zone 10, where it stands today. 

The museum is named after the [[Popol Vuh]], a book written soon after the [[Spanish conquest]] of [[Guatemala]]. It narrates myths and [[pre-Columbian]] history of the Quiche, whose kings dominated great part of the Western plateau of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popolvuh.ufm.edu.gt/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607025354/http://www.popolvuh.ufm.edu.gt/ |archivedate=2007-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection at the Popol Vuh Museum includes many objects related to the narratives of the [[Popol Vuh]] book.

== Buildings and facilities ==
The Museo Popol Vuh is one of the most modern of all the museums in [[Guatemala]] in terms of physical facilities. It has a very geometric architectural style opposed to the Mayan ruins and [[renaissance]] styles erected by the Spanish in [[Guatemala City]]. The museum has its preservations behind clear walls with advanced technology of display. The inside walls maintain neutral colors to keep focus on the artifacts. 

The Popol Vuh Museum is located on the campus of [[Universidad Francisco Marroquin]] in Zone 10 of Guatemala City. It is open Monday through Friday from nine to five, Saturday from nine to one and is closed on Sunday. Wheelchair accessibility is available in the facility.  There are no bus routes available to the museum. Transportation includes walking downhill from Sexta Avenida or yellow cab service.&lt;ref name="numberthree"/&gt; 

The museum offers guided tours of each gallery along with workshops such as archaeological excavation, restoration activities, Mayan pottery creation, etc. Presentations, lectures, and courses are organized throughout the year to educate the community of the Mayan culture in the Guatemalan heritage.

== Collections and holdings ==
[[Image:Clovis Point.jpg|thumb|right|A clovis projectile point]]
The exhibit galleries are organized chronologically beginning with the [[Paleoindian]], Archaic, Preclassic, Early Classic, Late Classic, and [[Postclassic]] periods of the ancient Maya and ending with Colonial Art . More than 400 archaeological and colonial treasures are on display. 

'''''Paleoindian (15,000 – 9000 BC):'''''

The oldest object in the Museum, which dates back to 9000 BC, is a [[clovis point]], used as a sharp stone tool. It was found in [[Nahuala]] in Guatemala’s western highlands and is one of the few found in the country. The [[Paleoindian]] period is characterized by hunter-gatherer groups who entered the America by crossing a land bridge connecting eastern Siberia and Alaska.&lt;ref name="numberfive"&gt;http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/paleoind.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''''Archaic (9000 – 1500 BC):'''''

Most of the art found from the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] was excavated from the central highlands and eastern pacific coast and includes many styles of ceramics, in specific, pottery. The Archaic period is recognized as the second period of human existence in the Americas and the shift from agriculture to sedimentary farming. Political organizations of chiefs and [[caciques]] and permanent agricultural settlements had been established by the end of this era.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; This civil structure influenced artists and what was painted on surface drawings on pottery art. 
[[Image:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|thumb|right|Kaminaljuyu and other Preclassic sites]]

'''''Preclassic (1500 BC – 250 AD):'''''

Popular material found in artifacts during the Preclassic period involves ceramic, jade, and stone, much of which was traded with the [[Olmecs]] in the southern coast. The most notable site where most objects were found is the [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the valley of Guatemala, which became popular for its irrigation canal system and its great buildings.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; The scale of their development reflected the status, power, and wealth of the chiefs of [[Kaminaljuyu]]. Many of the oldest examples of hieroglyphic texts are from Guatemala from this rich site.  Exhibits from this era include ceramics from the Middle and Late Preclassic era from the Kaminaljuyu and southern coast.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; 

[[Image:NaranjoStela10Maler.jpg|thumb|right|An inscription in Maya hieroglyphic text from the site of Naranjo (Peten,Guatemala)]]
'''''Early Classic (250–600):'''''

During this period, [[hieroglyph]] text was adopted as the main form of communication and art and multi-colored ceramics emerged as a popular element of Classic Maya art.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; Exhibits include polychrome ceramics from this period.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; Influence from the large city of [[Teotihuacan]] in central Mexico is evident in [[ceramic art]] with incense burner and cylindrical tripods of decorative styles.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; The largest area of the permanent exhibit at the Popol Vuh Museum is dedicated to the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world66.com/centralamericathecaribbean/guatemala/guatemalacity/sights/popolvuh&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Late Classic (600 – 900):'''''

This period is known for the greatest exponential growth of population in the northern lowlands.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; The Mayan hieroglyphic texts excavated from this region were advanced, indicating a great level of complex interaction between cities and their political leaders. Exhibits include painted [[ceramic art]] of several regional styles depicting mythology, religion with god like figures containing hieroglyphic texts, and often indicating the owner of the piece and the artist.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; 

'''''Postclassic (900 – 1,500):'''''

This era is registered as the decline of the [[Maya civilization]] prior to the [[Spanish conquest]]. During this time, much of the population in the highlands and southern coast sough change with the use and trade of gold and copper. Exhibits in the museum from this era include plumbate pottery which has orange and grey tones and depicted lives of animals and supernatural entities of their surfaces. Such pottery was greatly influenced by Mexican culture and was widely traded throughout the [[Mesoamerica]] until the end of the Early Postclassic period.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt;

'''''Colonial Period (1500 – 19th century):'''''

The colonial period followed the [[Spanish conquest]] and was marked by a rigidly stratified society. During the Colonial period in [[Guatemala]], artistic forms were predominantly educational and religious.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt; Guatemalan sculptures of the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries include examples of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], and Neoclassic styles.&lt;ref name="numbertwo"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3995">The '''Museum Computer Network''' ('''MCN''') is a [[United States|US]]-based non-profit organization for professionals with an interest in the use of [[computer technology]] for [[museum]]s.

==Overview==
MCN was established in 1967 in the [[New York City]] area.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcn.edu/history | title=History | publisher=Museum Computer Network| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of MCN spans a period during which information technology developed at an exponential pace. The organization began as an informal grouping of museums with the goal of automating registration records. With funding from the New York Council on the Arts, MCN developed a prototype mainframe network that was shared by participants from 1968 to 1971. When the funding ended in 1971, MCN was formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization that has since attracted members from around the world. As new technology superseded the original shared registration system, MCN evolved into a network of professionals wishing to improve their means of developing, managing, and conveying museum information through the use of automation.
&lt;br&gt;MCN organizes an annual conference, the MCN-L [[discussion forum]], [[special interest group]]s, an online directory of museum websites, etc. Members include individuals, institutions and companies. The organization is run by a Board of Directors. Officers include a president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer.

==Conference==
MCN has held an annual conference since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mcn.edu/conferences/past-conferences/ | title=Past Conferences | publisher=[[mcn.edu]] | accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ostrusha.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Entrance of the monolithic central chamber]]

The '''Ostrusha mound'''  is a [[Thracians|Thracian]] burial [[tumulus]] near the [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] town of [[Shipka (town)|Shipka]]. It was constructed in the middle of the 4th century BC. The stone structures under the more than 18 meters high mound form one of the biggest representative tomb-cult complexes with 6 rooms on an area of 100 square meters. It was professionally excavated in 1993.

One of the chambers is fully maintained. It is made of two carved-out solid granite blocks, weighing a total of more than 60 tons. The roof block is divided into dozens of square and circle shaped niches filled with masterfully painted portraits, scenes with people, fighting between animals, plants and geometric decorations. Most of the frescoes are severely damaged apart from a portrait of a young noble woman. A horse with full set of silver appliques as well as a gilded armor collar and two silver vessels were found in one of the other rooms that was not robbed in antiquity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17846">'''Phonemic restoration effect''' is a [[perceptual]] phenomenon where under certain conditions, sounds actually missing from a speech signal can be restored by the brain and may appear to be heard. The effect occurs when missing [[phonemes]] in an auditory signal are replaced with a noise that would have the physical properties to mask those phonemes, creating an ambiguity. In such ambiguity, the brain tends towards filling in absent phonemes. The effect can be so strong that some listeners may not even notice that there are phonemes missing. This effect is commonly observed in a conversation with heavy background noise, making it difficult to properly hear every phoneme being spoken. Different factors can change the strength of the effect, including how rich the context or linguistic cues are in speech, as well as the listener's state, such as their hearing status or age.

This effect is more important to humans than what was initially thought. [[Linguists]] have pointed out that at least the English language has many false starts and extraneous sounds. The phonemic restoration effect is the brain's way of resolving those imperfections in our speech. Without this effect interfering with our [[language processing]], there would be a greater need for much more accurate speech signals and human speech could require much more precision. For experiments, white noise is necessary because it takes the place of these imperfections in speech. One of the most important factors in language is continuity and in turn [[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligibility]].
[[File:Phonemic Restoration Effect.jpg|thumbnail|Phonemic Restoration Effect]]

==Background==
The phonemic restoration effect was first documented in a 1970 paper by Richard M. Warren entitled "Perceptual Restoration of Missing Speech Sounds". The purpose of the experiment was to give a reason to why in background of extraneous sounds, masked individual phonemes were still comprehensible.

:''“The state governors met with their respective legislatures convening in the capital city.”''

In his initial experiments, Warren provided the sentence shown and first replaced the first 's' phoneme in legislatures  with extraneous noise, in the form of a cough. In a small group of 20 subjects, 19 did not notice a missing phoneme and one person misidentified the missing phoneme. This indicated that in the absence of a phoneme, the brain filled in the missing phoneme, through [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Neuroscience and psychology|top-down processing]]. This was a phenomenon that was somewhat known at the time, but no one was able to pinpoint why it was occurring or had labeled it. He again did the same experiment with the sentence:

:'“It was found that the wheel was on the axle.”'

He replaced the 'wh' sound in wheel and the same results were found. All people tested wrote down wheel. Warren later did much research for next several decades on the subject.&lt;ref name=pmid5409744&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1970Sci...167..392W |title=Perceptual Restoration of Missing Speech Sounds |last1=Warren |first1=Richard M. |volume=167 |year=1970 |pages=392–3 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.167.3917.392 |pmid=5409744 |issue=3917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Warren, much research has been done to test the various aspects of the effect. These aspects include how many phonemes can be removed, what noise is played in replacement of the phoneme, and how different contexts alter the effect.

==Neuroanatomy==
[[File:Primary auditory cortex.PNG|thumbnail|Human auditory cortex]]
Neurally, the signs of interrupted or stopped speech can be suppressed in the [[thalamus]] and [[auditory cortex]], possibly as a consequence of top-down processing by the auditory system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0440-12.2012 |title=Hearing an Illusory Vowel in Noise: Suppression of Auditory Cortical Activity |year=2012 |last1=Riecke |first1=L. |last2=Vanbussel |first2=M. |last3=Hausfeld |first3=L. |last4=Baskent |first4=D. |last5=Formisano |first5=E. |last6=Esposito |first6=F. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=32 |issue=23 |pages=8024–34 |pmid=22674277}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Key aspects of the speech signal itself are considered to be resolved somewhere in the interface between auditory and language-specific areas (an example is [[Wernicke's area]]), in order for the listener to determine what is being said. Normally, the latter is thought to be instantiated at the end stages of the [[language processing]] system, but for restorative processes, much remains unknown about whether the same stages are responsible for the ability to actually fill-in the missing phoneme.

Phonemic restoration is one of several phenomena demonstrating that prior, existing knowledge in the brain provides it with tools to attempt a guess at missing information, something in principle similar to an [[optical illusion]]. It is believed that humans and other vertebrates have evolved the ability to complete acoustic signals that are critical but communicated under naturally noisy conditions. For humans, while it is not fully known at what point in the processing hierarchy does the phonemic restoration effect occurs&lt;ref name=pmid22569838&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10162-012-0334-3 |title=Effect of Speech Degradation on Top-Down Repair: Phonemic Restoration with Simulations of Cochlear Implants and Combined Electric–Acoustic Stimulation |year=2012 |last1=Başkent |first1=Deniz |journal=Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=683–92 |pmid=22569838 |pmc=3441953}}&lt;/ref&gt;, evidence points to dynamic restorative processes already occurring with basic modulations of sound set at natural articulation rates&lt;ref name=pmid29235479&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-17063-0 |title=Dynamic cortical representations of perceptual fulling-in for missing acoustic rhythm |year=2017 |last1=Cervantes Constantino |first1=F. |last2=Simon |first2=J.Z. |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=17536 |pmid=29235479|pmc=5727537}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Factors==

===Hearing impairment===
People with mild and moderate hearing loss were tested for the effectiveness of phonemic restoration. Those with mild hearing loss performed at the same level of a normal listener. Those with moderate hearing loss had almost no perception and failed to identify the missing phonemes. This research is also dependent on the amount of words the observer is comfortable understanding because of the nature of top-down processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2009.11.007 |title=Phonemic restoration by hearing-impaired listeners with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss |year=2010 |last1=Başkent |first1=Deniz |last2=Eiler |first2=Cheryl L. |last3=Edwards |first3=Brent |journal=Hearing Research |volume=260 |pages=54–62 |pmid=19922784 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people with [[cochlear implants]], acoustic simulations of the implant indicated the importance of spectral resolution.&lt;ref name=pmid22569838/&gt; When the brain is using top-down processing, it uses as much information as it can to make a decision on if the filler signal in the gap belongs to the speech, and with lower resolution, there is less information to make a correct guess. A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2013.12.003 |title=Top–down restoration of speech in cochlear-implant users |year=2014 |last1=Bhargava |first1=Pranesh |last2=Gaudrain |first2=Etienne |last3=Başkent |first3=Deniz |journal=Hearing Research |volume=309 |issue=4 |pages=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; with actual cochlear implant users indicated that some implant users can benefit from phonemic restoration, but again they seem to need more speech information (longer duty cycle in this case) to achieve this.

===Age===
The age effects were studied in children and older adults, to observe if children can benefit from phonemic restoration and if so, at what capacity, and if older adults maintain the restoration capacity in the face of age-related neurophysiological changes. 

Children are able to produce results comparable to adults by about the age of 5, however still not doing as well as adults. At such an early age most information is processed through bottom-up processing due to the lack of information to recall from. However,this does mean they are able to use previous knowledge of words to fill in the missing phonemes with much less of their brain developed than adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0142716404001237 |title=Perceptual restoration in children versus adults |year=2004 |last1=Newman |first1=Rochelle S. |journal=Applied Psycholinguistics |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=481–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pattison |first=Darcy Sue |hdl=2097/11418 |title=Phonemic restoration in nursery school children |publisher=Kansas State University |year=1976 |type=Thesis |oclc=33842958}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Older adults (older than 65 years) with no or minimal hearing loss show benefit from phonemic restoration. In some conditions restoration effect can be stronger in older adults than in younger adults, even when the overall speech perception scores are lower in older adults. This observation is likely due to strong linguistic and vocabulary skills that are maintained in advanced age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10162-013-0422-z |title=Perceptual Restoration of Degraded Speech Is Preserved with Advancing Age |year=2014 |last1=Saija |first1=Jefta D. |last2=Akyürek |first2=Elkan G. |last3=Andringa |first3=Tjeerd C. |last4=Başkent |first4=Deniz |journal=Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=139–148|pmc=3901857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaekel|first1=Brittany N.|last2=Newman|first2=Rochelle S.|last3=Goupell|first3=Matthew J.|title=Age effects on perceptual restoration of degraded interrupted sentences|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=2018|volume=143|issue=1|pages=84–97|doi=10.1121/1.5016968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
In children, there was no effect of gender on phonemic restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0142716404001237 |title=Perceptual restoration in children versus adults |year=2004 |last1=Newman |first1=Rochelle S. |journal=Applied Psycholinguistics |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=481–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adults, instead of completely replacing the phonemes, researchers masked them with tones that are informative(helped the listeners pick the correct phoneme), uninformative(neither helped or hurt the listener select the correct phoneme), or misinformative (hurt the listener in picking the correct phoneme). The results showed that women were much more affected by informative and misinformative cues than men. This evidence suggests that women are influenced by top-down semantic information more than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0023830910388000 |title=Are Women More Influenced than Men by Top-down Semantic Information when Listening to Disrupted Speech? |year=2011 |last1=Liederman |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Gilbert |first2=Kristen |last3=Fisher |first3=Janet McGraw |last4=Mathews |first4=Geetha |last5=Frye |first5=Richard E. |last6=Joshi |first6=Pallavi |journal=Language and Speech |volume=54 |pages=33–48 |pmid=21524011 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting===
The effect reverses in a [[reverberation room]], which echoes real life more so than the typical quiet rooms used for experimentation. This allows for echoes of the spoken phonemes to act as the replacement noise for the missing phonemes. The additional produced white noise that replaces the phoneme adds its own echo and causes listeners to not perform as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2012ASAJ..131L..28S |title=Phonemic restoration effect reversed in a reverberant room |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Nirmal Kumar |last2=Zahorik |first2=Pavel |volume=131 |year=2012 |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |doi=10.1121/1.3665120 |pmid=22280726 |pages=EL28–34 |issue=1 |pmc=3261052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rate===
Another study by Warren was done to determine the effect of the duration of the replacement phoneme on comprehension. Because the brain processes information optimally at a certain rate, when the gap became approximately the length of the word is when the effect started top breakdown and become ineffective. At this point the effect is no longer effective because the observer is now cognisant of the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.397178 |title=Illusory continuity of interrupted speech: Speech rate determines durational limits |year=1988 |last1=Bashford |first1=James A. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1635–8 |pmid=3209768 |last2=Meyers |first2=MD |last3=Brubaker |first3=BS |last4=Warren |first4=RM|bibcode = 1988ASAJ...84.1635B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multisensory===
Much like the [[McGurk Effect]], when listeners were also able to see the words being spoken, they were much more likely to correctly identify the missing phonemes. Like every sense, the brain will use every piece of information it deems important to make a judgement about what it is perceiving. Using the visual cues of mouth movements, the brain will you both in top-down processing to make a decision about what phoneme is supposed to be heard. Vision is the primary sense for humans and for the most part assists in [[speech perception]] the most.&lt;ref name=pmid5409744/&gt;

===Context===
Because languages are distinctly structured, the brain has some sense of what word is to come next in a proper sentence. When listeners were listening to sentences with proper structure with missing phonemes, they performed much better than with a nonsensical sentence without a proper structure. This comes from the predictive nature of the [[pre-frontal cortex]] in determining what word should be coming next in order for the sentence to make sense. Top-down processing relies on the surrounding information in a sentence to fill in the missing information. If the sentence does not make sense to the observer then there will be little at the top of the process for the observer to go off of. If a puzzle piece of a familiar picture was missing, it would be very simple for the brain to know what that puzzle piece would look like. If the picture of something that makes no sense to the human brain and has never been seen before, the brain will have much more difficulty understanding what is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2010.09.003 |title=The phonemic restoration effect reveals pre-N400 effect of supportive sentence context in speech perception |year=2010 |last1=Groppe |first1=David M. |last2=Choi |first2=Marvin |last3=Huang |first3=Tiffany |last4=Schilz |first4=Joseph |last5=Topkins |first5=Ben |last6=Urbach |first6=Thomas P. |last7=Kutas |first7=Marta |journal=Brain Research |volume=1361 |pages=54–66 |pmid=20831863 |pmc=2963680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.123 |title=Phonemic restoration in a sentence context: Evidence from early and late ERP effects |year=2006 |last1=Sivonen |first1=Päivi |last2=Maess |first2=Burkhard |last3=Lattner |first3=Sonja |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=Brain Research |volume=1121 |pages=177–89 |pmid=17027933 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensity===
Only when the intensity of the noise replacing the phonemes is the same or louder as the surrounding words, does the effect properly work. This effect is made apparent when listeners hear a sentence with gaps replaced by white noise repeat over and over with the white noise volume increasing with each iteration. The sentence becomes more and more clear to the listener as the white noise is louder. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008ASAJ..123..295S |title=Influences of auditory object formation on phonemic restoration |last1=Shinn-Cunningham |first1=Barbara G. |last2=Wang |first2=Dali |volume=123 |year=2008 |pages=295–301 |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |doi=10.1121/1.2804701 |pmid=18177159 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dichotic listening===
When a word with the segment 's' is removed and replaced by silence and a comparable noise segment were presented [[dichotically]]. Simply put, one ear was hearing the full sentence without phoneme excision and the other ear was hearing a sentence with a 's' sound removed. This version of the phonemic restoration effect was particularly strong because the brain was doing much less guess work with the sentence, because the information was given to the observer. Observers reported hearing exactly the same sentence in both ears, regardless of one of their ears missing a phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.414598 |title=Phonemic restoration and integration during dichotic listening |year=1996 |last1=Eimas |first1=Peter D. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=1141–7 |pmid=8609298 |last2=Tajchman |first2=G |last3=Nygaard |first3=LC |last4=Marcus |first4=DJ|bibcode = 1996ASAJ...99.1141E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The restoration effect is studied mostly in English and Dutch, where the restoration effect seemed similar between the two languages. While no research directly compared the restoration effect further for other languages, it is assumed that this effect is universal for all languages.

The '''Royal Oak Foundation''' is an alliance of American citizens supporting the mission of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is Britain's largest heritage organisation. The foundation is headquartered in [[New York City]].

Founded in 1973 the Royal Oak Foundation is a United States tax-exempt non-profit [[501(c)|501(c) (3)]] organisation. The foundation supports the preservation and conservation of places of natural beauty, historic properties and monuments and houses and gardens in Britain.

In the United States, the foundation sponsors the Drue Heinz Lecture Series, which delivers lectures to the public in major U.S. cities on the subjects of architecture, social history, landscape design, interior decoration and decorative arts. The foundation also supports the Damaris Horan Prize Fellowship in Landscape History, sponsoring promising scholars and professionals to work on projects with the National Trust. 

Membership is open to the general public, and includes free admission to historic properties operated by the National Trust in the United Kingdom.

The '''Saint Louis Art Museum''' is one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|principal]] U.S. [[art museum]]s, with [[paintings]], [[sculptures]], cultural objects, and ancient masterpieces from all corners of the world. Its three-story building stands in [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where it is visited by up to a half million people every year. Admission is free through a subsidy from the cultural tax district for St. Louis City and County.&lt;ref name="Visitor"&gt;Saint Louis Art Museum Visitor Guide (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the featured exhibitions, the museum offers rotating exhibitions and installations. These include the ''Currents'' series, which features contemporary artists, as well as regular exhibitions of new media art and works on paper.&lt;ref name="SLAM"/&gt;

==History==
The museum was founded in 1879&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MUSEUM FOUNDATION |url=https://www.slam.org/aboutus/foundation.php |website=St Louis Art Museum |accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''Saint Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts''', an independent entity within [[Washington University in St. Louis]], housed in a downtown building.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;''Saint Louis Art Museum Handbook of the Collection'' (2004), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The building was originally built by [[Wayman Crow]] as a memorial to honor his son, Wayman Crow Jr. Crow employed Boston architects Peabody &amp; Stearns to design the building located at 19th and Lucas Place (now Locust Street). The school, led by directory Halsey C. Ives, educated two generations of St. Louis artists and craftspeople and offered studio and art history classes supported by a museum collection. After the school moved to Washington University's campus and the museum moved to Forest Park, the building fell into disrepair and was eventually demolished in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cio.slpl.org/2016/03/31/the-st-louis-school-and-museum-of-fine-arts-wellspring-of-st-louis-arts/|title=The St. Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts – Wellspring of St. Louis Arts|last=St. Louis Public Library|first=|date=|website=St. Louis Public Library|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum moved after the [[1904 World's Fair]], also known as the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]], to the Palace of Fine Arts, built for the fair from 1902 to 1903. The building was designed by architect [[Cass Gilbert]], who took inspiration from the [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name="Arch"&gt;''Saint Louis Art Museum, An Architectural History'' (1987), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum]] remained part of Washington University, and the collection was lent to the Saint Louis Art Museum for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the collection  {{!}} Kemper Art Museum|url = http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/node/112|website = kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the museum's first director, [[Halsey Cooley Ives]], arranged for a municipal tax to support the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Walter B. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the museum separated from Washington University and was renamed the City Art Museum.  An organizing board was assigned to take control in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''Saint Louis Art Museum Handbook of the Collection'' (2004), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, the museum added an extension to include an [[auditorium]] for films, concerts and lectures.

In 1971, efforts to secure the museum's financial future led voters in St. Louis City and County to approve the creation of the [[Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District]] (ZMD). This expanded the tax base for the 1908 tax to include St. Louis County.&lt;ref name="Arch26"&gt;Saint Louis Art Museum, An Architectural History, (1987), Page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the museum was again renamed, to the Saint Louis Art Museum.&lt;ref name="Arch26"/&gt;

Today, the museum is supported financially by the tax, donations from individuals and public associations, sales in the Museum Shop, and foundation support.&lt;ref&gt;''Saint Louis Art Museum Handbook of the Collection'' (2004), pp. 4–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
Plans to expand the museum, which existed in the 1995 [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]] Master Plan and the museum's 2000 Strategic Plan, began in earnest in 2005, when the museum board selected the British architect Sir [[David Chipperfield]] to design the expansion; Michel Desvigne was selected as [[landscape architect]]. The St. Louis-based firm, [[Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum]] (HOK) was the architect of record to work with the construction team.

On November 5, 2007, museum officials released the design plans to the public and hosted public conversations about those plans. A model of the new building was displayed in the museum's Sculpture Hall throughout the construction project. In 2008, citing the declining state of the economy, the museum announced that it would delay the start of the expansion, whose cost was then estimated at $125 million.&lt;ref&gt;David Itzkoff ( November 6, 2008), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/in-tough-times-st-louis-museum-delays-expansion/ In Tough Times, St. Louis Museum Delays Expansion] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 2009; the museum remained open.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper.com"&gt;Javier Pes (June 20, 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/A-quiet-and-reserved-new-wing-for-Saint-Louis-Art-Museum/29783 A ‘quiet and reserved’ new wing for Saint Louis Art Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630224202/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/A-quiet-and-reserved-new-wing-for-Saint-Louis-Art-Museum/29783 |date=2013-06-30 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slam.org/expansion/ |title=Saint Louis Art Museum: Expansion |publisher=Slam.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion added more than {{convert|224000|sqft|m2}} of gallery space, including an underground garage, within the lease lines of the property. Money for the project was raised through private gifts to the capital campaign from individuals, foundations and corporations, and from proceeds from the sale of tax-exempt bonds. The fundraising campaigned covered the $130-million cost of construction and a $31.2 million increase to the museum's endowment to support incremental costs of operating the larger facility. The expanded facility opened in the summer of 2013.

==Collection==
The collection of the Saint Louis Art Museum contains more than 30,000 art works dating from antiquity to the present. The collection is divided into eleven areas:

:# African
:# [[The Americas|American]]
:# Ancient and [[Islamic]]
:# Asian
:# [[Contemporary art|Contemporary]]
:# [[Decorative Arts]] and Design
:# European
:# [[Modernism|Modern]]
:# [[Ocean]]ic
:# [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]]
:# [[Printmaking|Prints]], [[Drawings]], and [[Photographs]]

The modern art collection includes works by the European masters [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]], [[Monet]], [[Picasso]], [[Giambattista Pittoni]] and [[Van Gogh]]. The museum's particularly strong collection of 20th-century German paintings includes the world's largest [[Max Beckmann]] collection, which includes ''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Beckmann)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]''. In recent years, the museum has been actively acquiring post-war German art to complement its Beckmanns, such as works by [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Martin Kippenberger]] and others.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper.com"/&gt; The collection also includes [[Chuck Close]]'s ''Keith'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis Art Museum, Handbook of the Collection (2004), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of [[Pacific Islander|Oceanic]] and [[Mesoamerican]] works, as well as handwoven [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[carpet|rugs]], are among the finest in the world. The museum holds the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy]] ''Amen-Nestawy-Nakht'', and two mummies on loan from Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;Washington University of Saint Louis, ''Student Life, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection of American artists includes the largest U.S.-museum collection of paintings by [[George Caleb Bingham]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The collection contains at least six pieces that Nazis confiscated from their own museums as degenerate.&lt;ref name="stltoday.com"&gt;Hunn,David. "How a French masterpiece stolen by Nazis came to St. Louis" [http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/how-a-french-masterpiece-stolen-by-nazis-came-to-st/article_b0dee910-808f-5597-a8b3-5c8734742582.html] [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], February 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Max Beckmann]]’s “Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery” which came to the museum through a New York art dealer, [[Curt Valentin]], who specialized in [[Nazi plunder|Nazi confiscations]], and Matisse's “Bathers with a Turtle” which [[Joseph Pulitzer]] purchased at the [[Theodor Fischer (auctioneer)|Galerie Fischer auction]] held in the Grand Hôtel National, Lucerne, Switzerland, June 30, 1939.&lt;ref name="stltoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein,Laurie."The History and Reception of Matisse's Bathers with Turtle in Germany, 1908-1939" St. Louis: The Saint Louis Art Museum, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slam.org:8080/emuseum/view/objects/asitem/2492/271/title-desc?t:state:flow=05f6beb5-fe7f-488b-9b22-8dbe095bf295&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the museum's 2013 expansion, British artist [[Andy Goldsworthy]] created ''Stone Sea'', a site-specific work for a narrow space between the old and new buildings. Twenty-five tightly packed, ten-foot-high arches made of native limestone rise in a sunken courtyard. The artist was inspired by the fact that the sedimentary rock was formed when the region was a shallow sea in Prehistoric times.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper.com"/&gt;

'''San Pablo Huitzo''' (commonly referred to as '''Huitzo''') is a town and [[Municipalities of Oaxaca|municipality]] in [[Oaxaca]] in south-western [[Mexico]]. The municipality covers an area of 63.80&amp;nbsp;km².
It is part of the [[Etla District]] in the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales region]]. As of 2005, the municipality had a total population of 5,242.&lt;ref name =Huitzo&gt;{{cite web|title=San Pablo Huitzo|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20294a.htm|work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|publisher=[[Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal]]|accessdate=June 12, 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://huitzo.webcindario.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area comprising Huitzo was inhabited as early as 1200 [[BCE]]. By 1400 AD a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] village existed that was known by the name of ''Huijazoo'', a word that means ''Warrior Watchtower'' in the  [[Zapotec language]].&lt;ref name=Huitzo/&gt;  In 1522 Spanish troops arrived and founded the current city, giving it the name ''Gueixolotitlan''.  However, by 1700 the name ''Huitzo'' had been adopted by the populace.  When the first [[Roman Catholic]] monks arrived to [[evangelize]] the local population, they selected [[St. Paul the Apostle]] ''(San Pablo, in Spanish)'' as the [[patron saint]] of the village and erected a church by the same name. The church is notable for a large number of 16th-century and other colonial-era ''santos'', statues of the saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/santos/huitzo/index.html Santos in Oaxaca's Ancient Churches: San Pablo Huitzo] Retrieved 2012-04-13&lt;/ref&gt;  It was through the influence of the Catholic Church that the town arrived at its present name San Pablo Huitzo.&lt;ref name=Huitzo/&gt;

==Modern day==
[[File:Tomb in San Pablo Huitzo, Oaxaca.jpg|left|thumb|Post-classic era tomb in Huitzo]]
Today Huitzo is a farming community noted for growing vegetables and flowers, with almost half of its population employed by farms or other agriculture-related ventures.&lt;ref name=Huitzo/&gt;  Archaeological sites in the area consist of several tombs, walls, and similar Zapotec structures. Most of the sites are overgrown with vegetation, however they do attract some tourists and [[archaeologists]].&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ8AAqwPTRoC&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=%22Huitzo%22&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Huitzo%22&amp;f=false|title=An archaeological guide to central and southern Mexico|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|author1=Kelly, Joyce |author2=Kelly, Jerry |accessdate=2010-11-11|isbn=0-8061-3349-X|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury-in-repose-Villa-of-the-Papyri-Herculaneum-1908-Barker.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of bronze statue of a nude male youth, seated on a rock with one leg outstretched, from the 1908 volume Buried Herculaneum by Ethel Ross Barker; caption reads "Mercury in Repose"|This sculpture has also been identified as depicting [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/buriedherculaneu00barkuoft#page/122/mode/2up|title=Buried Herculaneum|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The bronze '''''Seated Hermes''''', found at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]] in 1758, is at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;NM 5625; illustrated in Margarete Bieber, ''the Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age'', 1961:figs. 106-07.&lt;/ref&gt; "This statue was probably the most celebrated work of art discovered at Herculaneum and [[Pompeii]] in the eighteenth century", [[Francis Haskell]] and [[Nicholas Penny]] have observed,&lt;ref&gt;''Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900'', 1981, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; once four large engravings reproducing it had appeared in ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'', 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Volume VI, 1771, pp. 113-22.&lt;/ref&gt; To protect it from Napoleonic depredations, it was packed into one of the fifty-two cases of antiquities and works of art that accompanied the Bourbon flight to [[Palermo]] in 1798. It was once again in the royal villa at [[Portici]] in 1816 (Haskell and Penny 1981:269).

[[Martin Robertson]] (1975, vol I:474) classifies it as a Roman copy, made before AD 79, needless to say, of a Greek bronze original of the late fourth or early third century BC, in the tradition of [[Lysippos]], whose name has been invoked in connection with the sculpture since its first reappearance. [[Margarete Bieber]] classifies it as "school of Lysippos" and dates it ''ca'' 100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1961:162&lt;/ref&gt; Many bronze statues posed on actual rocks must have been set up in late Hellenistic and Roman gardens, where, [[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway]] suggests,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway|Ridgway]], "The Setting of Greek Sculpture" ''Hesperia'' '''40'''.3 (July - September 1971:336-356) pp 346f.&lt;/ref&gt; natural boulders "increased the idyllic aspect of the composition." The ''Hermes'' rests his hand casually on the (restored) rock, integrating the composition.

The '''Shahrisabz Museum of History and Material Culture''' is a [[museum]] in [[Shahrisabz]], [[Uzbekistan]]. It was founded in 1996 on the 660th anniversary of [[Amir Timur]]'s birth and contains arcaheological, ethnographic, and numismatic collections.

==About Museum Structure==
The museum building is located in the complex of madrasah Chubin built in XIV-XVI ages and invested by [[UNESCO]] into the list of "Common to all mankind cultural wealth". At that time there were more than 40 madrasahs and mosques in the town where religious and universal sciences were taught as registered in the written sources of ''[[Amir Temur]]'' and the Timurids’ epoch. In this regard architectural structures of madrasah were very convenient to use them as a museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan.htm There has been a lot of changes there]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The attitude to historical culture fundamentally changed in the [[Kashkadaria]] region since the first years of Republic of Uzbekistan. In 1996 in ''Shakhrisabz'' the Museum of Historicy of material culture of Amir Temur was opened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.uz/en/ Other art museums]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996 as a result of the archeological excavations in connection with 660- year- old anniversary of ''Amir Temur'', more than 6500 items of unique mosaic, a majolica, ceramic, copper, iron and wooden carved products were collected, they made the greatest collection of museum.

==Architectural Monuments in Shakhrisabz==
Constantly operating exhibition ''"Amir Temur is the main architect of Shakhrisabz city"'' is organized in the museum. Written sources and the archeological finds telling about a youth of Amir Temur, his contribution to the history of Shakhrisabz, his constructions of architectural monuments when he was governor are shone here. Archeological expedition for the purpose of definition of historical age of Shakhrisabz was organized at the initiative of museum administration. Archeological researches in ''Sangirtepa'' and Uzunkir procceded within 3 years. Scientists of the [[Edinburgh University]]&lt;ref&gt;''Edinburgh University of Great Britain'' is one of the famous and well-organized university in the world.&lt;/ref&gt; of Great Britain and workers of the Hermitage of Russian Federation took part in them. Archeological expedition defined formation of the ancient city of Kesh&lt;ref&gt;Kesh is the first given name to today’s Shakhrisabz city&lt;/ref&gt;- Shakhrisabz begun 2700 years ago, the museum was filled up more than 8500 archeological finds they were the basis for the organization of constantly operating exhibition named as ''"Shakhrisabz is a coeval of [[Avesta]]"''.
18 architectural monuments of Temurid's epoch in Shakhrisabz are entered in "Universal heritage" of ''UNESCO'' list.&lt;ref&gt;Information is taken from "Moziydan Sado" magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

In core, formation and definitions of the legal status of a museum, gathering more than 13000 exhibits, definition of scientific orientation directions passed in 1996- 2002 fundamental exhibitions were organized. During 2002-2010 the museum carried out interesting international contacts, increased the professional qualification of workers. Scientific relations with museums of Japan, Borodo-3 University of France, the Russian Hermitage, the Museum of ceramics of Italy, museums of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Germany, cultural centers ''"Dashi-Art"'' of [[Kazakhstan]] was established.

'''Statolatry''', which combines [[idolatry]] with the [[State (polity)|state]], first appeared in [[Giovanni Gentile]]'s ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'', published in 1931 under [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s name, and was also mentioned in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks (1971) sometime between 1931-1932, while he was imprisoned by Mussolini. The same year, the [[encyclical]] ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'' by [[Pope Pius XI]] criticized [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] as developing "a [[paganism|pagan]] worship of the state" which it called "statolatry".&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:1beJv0ilFMwJ:www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11FAC.HTM+%22Non+Abbiamo+Bisogno%22+%22statolatry%22&amp;hl=en ''Non abbiamo bisogno'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''politiolatry''' was used to describe [[reason of state]] doctrine in the 17th century with similar intent.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, J. H. (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 1450-1700''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ludwig von Mises' ''Omnipotent Government'' (1944) ==

The term was also popularized and explained by [[Ludwig von Mises]] in his 1944 work ''[[Omnipotent Government]]''. '''Statolatry''' is literally worship of the State analogous to ''[[idolatry]]'' as worship of idols. It asserts that the glorification and aggrandizement of 'State' or 'Nation' is the object of all legitimate human aspiration at the expense of all else, including personal welfare and independent thought. Expansion of the power and influence of one's State is to be achieved, if necessary, through aggressive [[war]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] adventures (i.e. [[imperialism]]). It far exceeds the [[patriotism]] of those who recognize the rights of people other than themselves to [[self-determination]], and might best be described as super-patriotism or [[chauvinism]].

==Biography==
Theodore Roosevelt Schellenberg was born on February 24, 1903 to Abraham Lawrence and Sarah Schroeder Schellenberg in [[Garden Township, Harvey County, Kansas]]. He attended [[Tabor College (Kansas)|Tabor College]] (1924–6) before transferring to the [[University of Kansas]]. He graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in [[history]] in 1928. He continued his education, receiving his Master's in History from the University of Kansas  in 1930 and his Ph.D from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="Kansas Historical Society, T.

Schellenberg Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Jane|date=Fall 1981|title=Theodore R. Schellenberg: Americanizer and Popularizer|journal=The American Archivist|volume=44|issue=4|page=317|doi=10.17723/aarc.44.4.2227r081gnx07r0p}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he secured a position with the Joint Committee on Materials for Research as Executive Secretary, part of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[Social Science Research Council]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
Schellenberg had a long career with the federal government working mostly in the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). In 1935, he gained his first position within NARA when he was appointed as a Deputy Examiner, part of a group of academics who were tasked with examining the records of executive agencies in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was appointed chief of the Division of Agriculture Department Archives in 1938. It was in this position that he published his first paper in 1939, ''European Archival Practices in Arranging Records'', which laid the groundwork for his life’s work. In it, he observed that European methods only applied to U.S. [[records management]] in a limited way. Americans were creating documents at an unprecedented rate, and European archival practices did not adequately respond to the changing needs of American records management. Experiencing this issue firsthand during his work at NARA, Schellenberg's theory of the archives came from the practical need to adapt European archival practices to working with the massive scale of the federal records climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=Frank|last2=Greene|first2=Mark A.|date=Summer 1996|title=Et Tu Schellenberg? Thoughts on the Dagger of American Appraisal Theory|journal=American Archivist|volume=59|issue=3|pages=298–310|doi=10.17723/aarc.59.3.k3x81g0852825l31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schellenberg briefly left NARA for three years at the close of [[World War II|WWII]] in 1945, when he took a job as a Records Officer in the [[Office of Price Administration]]. His work there illustrated the many difficulties found in managing vast amounts of government records, which only increased his commitment to finding solutions. In 1948, he returned to NARA as Program Advisor to the Archivist and published his first major work in 1949 called ''Disposition of Federal Records: How to Develop an Effective Program for the Preservation and Disposal of Federal Records.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Schellenberg was promoted to Director of Archival Management in 1950 and served in that capacity until 1961. One of his first projects was to craft a rigorous training program for NARA employees, since there was inadequate standardization in his division’s policies and procedures. In addition, he created guidelines for how positions would be categorized and ensured that job descriptions were consistent. He continued to provide archival training throughout his tenure at NARA: at one point planning a two-semester course that was offered at the [[American University]]; organizing a series of symposiums for senior archivists; and finally, traveling to records centers throughout the U.S. in the late 1950s to provide three-day classes on archives management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also oversaw a massive reappraisal of documents to [[deaccessioning|deaccession]] old records and enforced a methodology more selective in the appraisal of new records.

== Influence ==

=== Schellenberg on appraisal ===
Schellenberg's major contribution to archival practice was to emphasize the centrality of [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]] in archival work, and to make selection a primary role of the archivist. To Schellenberg, a record has "primary value" to the creator as evidence of activities, but also has "secondary value" (i.e. evidential or informational value) to future users of the records outside of the originating agency, such as other agencies, historians, or private users.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He argued the most efficient way to deal with the sheer volume of records that archives were dealing with at the time was to differentiate between a record's primary and secondary value and, thus, determine the relative value of the records based on the secondary value of the records.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tschan|first=Reto|date=2002|title=A Comparison of Jenkinson and Schellenberg on Appraisal|journal=The American Archivist|volume=65|issue=2|pages=176–195|doi=10.17723/aarc.65.2.920w65g3217706l1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation was key for Schellenberg as he argued for a greater distinction between records and archives. In his definition, records only have current, primary value to their creators, but archives are records deemed to have significant secondary value by an archivist (i.e. meriting permanent preservation) outside of their original value to the record's creators. Consequently, records were under the purview of [[records manager]]s, and only those records holding value for future users (particularly for future historical inquiry) would become a part of the archives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===''Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques''===
In 1954, Schellenberg was given the opportunity to travel to Australia through the [[Fulbright Program]] to assist Australians in creating an archival system suited to their archival issues.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern archives : principles &amp; techniques|last=1903-1970.|first=Schellenberg, T. R. (Theodore R.)|date=2003|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=Jones, H. G. (Houston Gwynne), 1924-|isbn=978-0931666025|location=Chicago|oclc=54021415}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent months helping address records management concerns through a lecture and seminar series that allowed him to travel throughout the continent and even to Tasmania and New Zealand. During this time, his lecture and seminar notes began to take the shape of a textbook on archival work and management practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1956, he published this work as the acclaimed text ''Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques''—thus creating the first exhaustive American approach to archival administration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The book takes up emerging issues, concerns, and approaches to archival theory and practice that modern archivists encounter, thereby reflecting the desire for a closer and more efficient working relationship between records management and archival work and giving readers a broad overview of principles of public records management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In responding to modern archival problems, particularly distinctly American archival concerns, the book also juxtaposes American archival work and theory with those of foreign countries to clarify the fundamental nature and methods of archives, records management, and archival management.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leland|first=Waldo Gifford|date=October 1956|title=Reviews of Books|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=19|pages=325–327|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schellenberg's textbook was largely well received in the archival field, both in America and internationally, and quickly became a central text for students in archival training programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After the publication, historian and archivist [[Waldo Gifford Leland]] positively reviewed the text in the October 1956 issue of the ''[[American Archivist]]'', stating: "This compact and well written book is, at least in the opinion of the reviewer, the most significant and useful statement yet produced on the administration of modern records and archives."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The following year Schellenberg won a meritorious service award to honor the contributions made to the archival profession through the textbook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Untitled Web Series About a Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time''''' (''UWSAASTWCATTT''), also known as '''''Inspector Spacetime''''', is an ongoing [[adventure]]-[[sci-fi]] [[web series]] created by Travis Richey, and based on the television comedy series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Inspector Spacetime' Travis Richey enters new frontier|url=http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/article/20130116/WDH0505/301110520/Greater-Wausau-Inspector-Spacetime-Travis-Richey-enters-new-frontier|publisher=Wausau Daily Herald|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is based on a fictional series first mentioned during the episode "[[Biology 101]]" of ''Community''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upcoming Web Series Borrows Much From Community’s Inspector Spacetime |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/07/upcoming-web-series-borrows-much-from-communitys-inspector-spacetime/|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inspector Spacetime'' is, by itself, a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' parody. ''UWSAASTWCATTT'' follows The Inspector, a character that can travel through time and space by way of a red BOOTH (Bio Organic Omnidirectional Time Helix), a special space/timeship similar in some ways to the [[TARDIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention 'Community' fans: 'Inspector Spacetime' is real|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/09/12/community-fans-inspector-spacetime/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reception for the series has been positive, with ''USA Today'' including it in their "Best of TV on the Web in 2012" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lorena |last=Blas |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Best of TV on the Web in 2012 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2012/12/25/best-of-web-tv-2012/1790331/ |date=January 6, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature film based on the series, entitled '''''The Inspector Chronicles''''', is currently in production.

==Production==
The series was initially pitched to [[NBC]] (''Community''{{'}}s television network at the time), who appeared uninterested. Richey then began a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund the series, which was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/16/community-inspector-spacetime-travis-richey_n_1888891.html |title='Community's' Inspector Spacetime, Travis Richey, Producing 'Untitled Web Series About A Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time' |date=16 September 2012 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an animated teaser episode for the series was produced, NBC requested the production be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/entertainment/61834-nbc-nixes-inspector-spacetime |title=NBC nixes Inspector Spacetime |date=3 March 2012 |publisher=TG Daily |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richey continued with the series, but with references to the name 'Inspector Spacetime' removed and the appearance of the character altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themarysue.com/inspector-spacetime-episode-one/ |title=Here’s Episode One of the Inspector-Spacetime-in-Everything-but-Name Inspector Spacetime Webseries |date=9 September 2012 |publisher=The Mary Sue |accessdate= 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC tries to kill Inspector Spacetime, but he regenerates instead|url=http://io9.com/5889335/nbc-tries-to-kill-inspector-spacetime-but-he-regenerates-instead|publisher=io9|accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' name was then changed to ''Untitled Web Series About a Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch the first episode of the Inspector Spacetime webseries that can’t legally call itself Inspector Spacetime|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/watch-the-first-episode-of-the-inspector-spacetime,84911/|work=[[The A.V.

Season two began shooting in April 2013, with the announcement that [[Mayim Bialik]] would be joining the series as the voice of the time machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2013/04/mayim-bialik-joins-cast-of-untitled-web-series-about-a-space-traveler-who-can-also-travel-through-time/|title=Mayim Bialik joins 'Untitled Web Series About A Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time'|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it was also announced that ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' alum [[Robert Picardo]] would also be joining the cast for season two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2013/07/untitled-web-series-about-a-space-traveler-who-can-also-travel-through-time-returns-for-second-season/|title=‘Untitled Web Series about a Space Traveler Who Can Also Travel Through Time’ Returns For Second Season|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has recently been announced that season 2, will instead be a feature film called the Inspector Chronicles: A Motion Picture about a Space Traveler who can also travel through time. Sylvester McCoy has joined the cast as Uncle Roderick. A crowdfunding campaign at indiegogo.com was released to fund development of the film, it made $36,993, passing its goal, which was $25,000.
