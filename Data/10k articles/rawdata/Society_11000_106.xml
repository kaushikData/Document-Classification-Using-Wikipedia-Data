Early on the Sunday morning of April 25, 1965, 16-year-old Michael Andrew Clark opened fire on cars traveling along [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Highway 101]] just south of [[Orcutt, California]], from a nearby hilltop. Three people were killed and ten were wounded before Clark committed suicide upon arrival of police.

==Shooting==
Late on the night of April 24, 1965 Michael Andrew Clark, who lived in [[Long Beach, California]], had left home in his parents' car, without their permission. In the back of the car, he had a [[Swedish Mauser]] military rifle equipped with [[telescopic sight]] and a [[pistol]] he had removed from his father's locked gun safe along with a large quantity of ammunition. Early the next Sunday morning, he climbed to the top of a hill overlooking a stretch of Highway 101 near Orcutt. As the sun came up, Clark began shooting at automobiles driving down the 101 highway.&lt;ref&gt;''Santa Maria Times'', April 26, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', April 26, 1965 "SNIPER KILLS 2"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid Demaris, ''America the Violent'', Penguin Books, 1971, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Two were killed and six more were wounded as the shooting continued for hours before [[Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office]] deputies rushed the hill and Clark committed suicide as they closed in.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', April 26, 1965 "Highway Sniper Dies After Killing Two, Wounding Six"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', May 7, 1965 "Michael Andrew Clark, 16, took his own life after killing two passers by and fatally wounding a third with a high-powered rifle on Highway 101 near here April 25, a coroner's jury ruled Thursday."&lt;/ref&gt; A five-year-old-boy wounded in the head died a day later bringing the total to three dead for the rampage.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', April 27, 1965 "Highway Sniper's Bullet Proves Fatal to Boy, 5"&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly the two men killed at the scene of the shooting were attempting to assist others who were trapped in a vehicle which had been hit by the gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', April 28, 1965, Part II, p. 1; "Both men who were killed by a teen-age sniper on U.S. 101 may have been trying to aid victims in another auto, it was disclosed Tuesday."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A lawsuit was eventually brought to the courts by victims William, Lucille, and Kim Reida, complaining that parents Forest and Joyce Clark were negligent in two counts: "failure of the Clarks to train, control, and supervise son Michael" and also, "failure of Forest Clark to keep the rifle out of Michael’s hands."  The case was decided in favor of the Clarks and generally upheld on appeal, although the appeals court found negligence on the part of father Forest Clark for not adequately securing the weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlink.com/research/CaseLevel3/49081 Reida v. Lund 18 Cal.App.3d 698]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Awlad Sidi Shaykh''' (or '''Ouled Sidi Cheikh''') was a confederation of Arab tribes in the west and south of Algeria led by the descendants of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint Sidi Shaykh. The Awlad had religious authority, and also owned agricultural settlements and engaged in trade. During the French occupation of Algeria they alternately cooperated with and opposed the colonialists.

}}
The Awlad Sidi Shaykh trace their ancestry to the saint Sidi Shaykh, a descendent of [[Muhammad]]'s father-in-law [[Abu Bakr]], the first caliph.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=100}}
In the 16th century the growing population in the south-western Algerian Sahara created a need for more intense farming and for collaboration between farmers and nomads.
Saint Sidi Shaykh founded a community of date farmers and nomads engaged in the caravan trade.{{sfn|Sivers|1983|pp=113ff}}
A. G. P. Martin dates this to 1651, when the ''[[wali]]s'' of the [[Tuat]] and [[Gurara]] brought the Sharifian ideology to the villages of the [[Zenata]] Berbers.{{sfn|Bellil|1999|p=80}}
The headquarters was a prayer-meditation center that taught the ethics of hard work and sharing among and between the farmers and nomads.{{sfn|Sivers|1983|pp=113ff}}

Arab tribes in the Gurara and the [[Sahara]] such as the Khenafsa became faithful to the Awlad Sidi Shaykh, the ''mrabtin''{{efn|The ''mrabtin'' trace their genealogy to the prophet Mohamed through his daughter Fatima and his son-in-law Ali.{{sfn|Aīssa Ouitis|1977|p=94}} }} of the Saharan Atlas.{{sfn|Bellil|1999|p=80}}
As the population pressure slackened in the following centuries the Awlad Sidi Shaykh gradually took control of the prayer-meditation center and grew into a mid-sized tribe. The religious ideals of cooperation were replaced by a system where the Awlad Sidi Shaykh used alms to maintain their dominance.{{sfn|Sivers|1983|pp=113ff}}
They became the dominant tribal and religious federation in the [[Aïn Madhi]] region of the central northern Algerian desert.
They owned houses and storage places in the [[Gourara]] and [[Tuat]] region, and controlled ''zawaya'' religious strongholds throughout the greater Tuat.
The ''zawaya'' owned large gardens worked by slaves and served as markets and travel lodges.
They sent their earnings to the mother ''zawiya'' in [[El Abiodh Sidi Cheikh]] in the northwest of Algeria.{{sfn|Scheele|2012|p=45}}

Descendents of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh lived in the ''zawaya'', where they were known as ''Zuwa'' or ''Ahl 'Azzi''.
They also owned land in the [[Hoggar Mountains]], where they were religious scholars, teachers and traders.
In the Hoggar Mountains they established agricultural settlements using slave labour, and these sometimes became staging posts on trade routes.{{sfn|Scheele|2012|p=45}}
There were trading communities of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh far to the south in [[Timbuktu]], [[Kidal]] and [[Agadez]], and to the east in [[Ghadames]] and [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]].{{sfn|Scheele|2012|p=46}}
The confederation often came under the influence of the Sultan of Morocco.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=100}}

==Colonial era==

After the French [[invasion of Algiers in 1830]] it became clear that they might try to occupy the whole country and impose a rule much less acceptable than that of the Turkish Bey. 
In 1831 the [[Duc de Rovigo]] caused a scandal in [[Algiers]] when he built a military highway through two functioning cemeteries with no respect for the human remains, and converted several mosques into Catholic churches.{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=50}}
Algerians opposed to the French occupation came to accept [[Emir Abdelkader|'Abd al-Qadir]] as leader of their movement.{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=50}}
Some of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh recognized 'Abd al-Qadir as sultan, as did the powerful [[Banu Hashim]] and [[Banu 'Amir]].{{sfn|Clancy-Smith|1994|p=71}}
These groups of the Oran Plateau and the Plain of Gharis accepted Muhyi al-Din, chief of the [[Qadiriyya]] Sufis, as the "Champion of Islam" against the French.{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=51}}

In the 1840s the Awlad Sidi Shaykh assisted the Governor-General [[Thomas Robert Bugeaud]] in his struggle with the Emir 'Abd al-Qadir.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=100}}
However, in the southern desert regions they supported  'Abd al-Qadir.{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=61}}
In the early 1850s the confederation was still divided.
Some, led by Si Hamza, cooperated with the French.
Others, led by Mohammed bin Abdallah, opposed them.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=100}}

[[File:Mausolée de Sidi Cheikh ضريح سيدي الشيخ 2.jpg|thumb|Mausoleum of Sidi Shaykh in [[El Abiodh Sidi Cheikh]] ]]
Between 1864 and 1865 the Awlad Sidi Shaykh rose in rebellion against the French.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=100}}
The rebellion stopped southward French expansion near [[Oran]].{{sfn|Suwaed|2015|p=23}}
It was triggered by officers of the Arab Bureau (''bureaux arabes'') who were insensitive to the traditions of the Awlad.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|pp=100–101}}
One of the main military leaders of the revolt was Si Sliman, head of one of the main families.
The French suppressed the revolt through greatly superior force.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=101}}
Awlad Sidi Ahmad Majdub of the Amir Bedouin tribe of Morocco participated in the revolt, but was pardoned and placed in the Sebdou circle.{{sfn|Suwaed|2015|p=23}}
The Awlad were restive during the [[Kabyle Revolt]] (1871–72) but did not play a major role.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=101}}
In the 1870s and 1880s local politics in Algeria were dominated by Europeans, commercial farming by French immigrants expanded, and funding for Islamic courts was cut, as was funding for schools that trained interpreters and judges.
It was in this context that the Awlad Sidi Shaykh staged the last, desperate rural revolts along the frontier with Morcocco.{{sfn|Shillington|2013|p=89}}

Plans to destroy the second [[Flatters expedition]] of 1880–81 were made by the [[Kel Ahaggar]] Tuaregs of the [[Hoggar Mountains]], the Awlad Sidi Shaykh confederation and the [[Senussi]] before the expedition left [[Ouargla]].
They knew the planned route and were kept informed by the expedition guides, who helped sabotage the expedition by leading it past wells.
Six hundred men of the three tribes gathered to ambush the expedition near the wells of Bir el-Garama.{{sfn|Grandjean}}
The result was a massacre of half the expedition members, while many of the others died during a long retreat.{{sfn|Ney|1891|pp=636ff}}

Until 1883 the Awlad continued to occasionally mount raids against the colonialists.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=101}}
The rebellion in the southwest led by [[Cheikh Bouamama]] (Shaykh Bu 'Amamah) from 1881 to 1883 fell apart due to disagreements among the tribes.{{sfn|Krause|2017|loc=PT175}}
When Cheikh Bouamama retreated to Morocco in 1882 the French conquest of the south of Algeria was complete.{{sfn|Sivers|2012}}
After this the Awlad Sidi Shaykh largely accepted French authority.{{sfn|Naylor|2015|p=101}}
As the rebellion died down, the itinerant [[marabout]]s of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh turned to rebuilding their business, demanding donations to their shrine from the peasants, who still thought they had strong influence with God.{{sfn|Burke|2014|p=53}}
The colonial administrator [[Alfred Le Chatelier]], a relatively enlightened secularist and republican, succeeded in convincing the Mekhedma tribe of the Sud-Oranais that they need not pay tribute.{{sfn|Burke|2014|pp=53–54}}
There were still disturbances until 1902, and one of Awlad's leaders, Bu 'Imama, continued to resist until 1904.{{sfn|Martin|2003|pp=39–40}}

The '''Bulgarian Red Cross''', or '''BRC''', was established in 1878 after the liberation of the Principality of Bulgaria and the region of Eastern Rumelia  from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The first BRC organization was established in May 1878 in [[Sofia]]. The regional governor, V.P. Alabin, recruited many prominent citizens of the city, and led their work in the first BRC. The two Bulgarian provinces, Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, became unified on September 20, 1885. The National Organization of the BRC was then founded, with the approval of the statues of the organization by the first Bulgarian Prince, [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]]. On October 20, 1885, the BRC was recognized by, and became a member of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC). Significant contributions made by [[Tsar Boris III]] during the period of 1918-1943, which provided the organization with the ability to establish itself, and to take the first steps towards creating a Bulgarian social health system.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulgarian Red Cross.'' Web.  7 October 2010.  http://www.redcross.bg/cgi-bin/e-cms/vis/vis.pl?s=001&amp;p=0078&amp;g=&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of the BRC is located in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]].  The branches of the BRC are located in: [[Blagoevgrad]], [[Burgas]], [[Varna]], [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Vidin]], [[Vratsa]], [[Gabrovo]], [[Dobrich]], [[Kardjali]], [[Kyustendil]], [[Lovech]], [[Montana]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Pernik]], [[Pleven]], [[Plovdiv]], [[Razgrad]], [[Russe]], [[Silistra]], [[Sliven]], [[Smolyan]], [[Sofia]], [[Stara Zagora]], [[Targovishte]], [[Haskovo]], [[Shumen]], and [[Yambol]].

The '''Caracol''' people are an ethnic people of mainly [[Europe]]an/[[English people|English]]-[[African people|African]]-[[Caribbean people|Caribbean]] descent, who have been concentrated in Northern [[Honduras]] (specifically, the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]]) since the early 19th century. They speak an [[Bay Islands Creole|English-based creole]]. ''Caracol'' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term that literally translates as [[conch]], or snail shell; it associates the people of the Bay Islands to their environment and seafaring culture.&lt;ref name=chambers/&gt; In its current usage, the term Caracol refers to all people born in the Bay Islands region and their descendants. The region of the Bay Islands encompasses the three major islands of [[Roatán]], [[Útila]], [[Guanaja]], and the smaller islands or keys.

== History ==

The first known [[English language|English]]-speaking groups to settle in the Bay Islands are believed to have migrated from the [[Cayman Islands]] near Jamaica. They arrived in the 1830s shortly after Britain abolished slavery in its colonies, which disrupted the labor system supporting [[Culture of the Cayman Islands|Caymanian]] culture.&lt;!--How did slavery relate to native seafaring culture; does not compute --&gt; Caymanians were largely a seafaring culture and were familiar with the area from turtle fishing ventures and other activities.

The Bay Islands population grew steadily in the latter half of the 19th century, and new settlements were developed all over Roatán and the other islands. Individual settlers were attracted from numerous nations and played a part in developing and shaping the face of the Caracol culture. A fruit trade industry started by islanders became very profitable; by the 1870s it was acquired by American interests, most notably the New Orleans and Bay Islands Fruit Company. Later companies, Standard Fruit and United Fruit, became the foundation for modern day fruit companies. Their economic and political influence was so strong that Honduras was called a "[[banana republic]]".

== The Bay Islands ==

The Bay Islands were first discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his fourth voyage to [[Americas|America]] in 1502. They were later claimed, and successively held, by [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch United Provinces]]. England finally took control in 1643 and, with the exception of a one-month period of Spanish dominance in 1780, held onto them as a Crown colony, dependent on [[Jamaica]]. In 1860, in the aftermath of the American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] filibustering affair, the British Crown recognized Honduran sovereignty . It ceded possession of the Bay Islands to it. The department of "Islas de la Bahía" was officially incorporated to Honduras on 14 March 1872.

== Economy ==

Traditionally, the economy of the Bay Islands region has consisted of industrial [[fishing]], remittances from merchant marine activities, and, more recently, extensive [[tourism]].

== Language ==

The English language spoken by the Caracol changed over time. The language differs mostly in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] but also in pronunciation and accent and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from that of the other British colonies. The various creole languages are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.

The '''Chontal Maya''' are a [[Maya people]] of the Mexican state of [[Tabasco]]. "Chontal", from the [[Nahuatl]] word for ''chontalli'', which means "foreigner", has been applied to various ethnic groups in Mexico. The Chontal refer to themselves as the '''Yokot'anob''' or the '''Yokot'an''', meaning "the speakers of [[Yoko ochoco]]", but writers about them refer to them as the Chontal of Centla, the Tabasco Chontal, or in Spanish, ''Chontales''. They consider themselves the descendants of the [[Olmec]]s, and are not related to the [[Oaxaca Chontal people|Oaxacan Chontal]].

== Location ==

The Yokot'an inhabit 21 towns in a large area known as "la [[Chontalpa]]" that extends across five [[municipalities of Tabasco]]: [[Centla]], [[El Centro (municipality)|El Centro]], [[Jonuta]], [[Macuspana]], and [[Nacajuca]]. In Nacajuca, they form a majority of the population. The terrain is highly varied &amp;mdash; no single landform dominates &amp;mdash; and it has many bodies of water. The land is traversed by seasonally-flooding rivers, and there are numerous lakes, lagoons, and wetlands. The climate is humid and tropical, and the fauna was typical of tropical regions until the environment was altered by human [[industrialization]]. The [[mangrove]] is the predominant form of vegetation.

== History ==

The territory of the Yokot'an was the cradle of the Olmec civilization, which lived there from about 1400 BCE until about 400 BCE. The [[Maya civilization]] reached its height in about the year 300 of the [[Common Era]]. At this time, the Yokot'an were also at their cultural apex. They had already begun to decline by the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], and are mentioned in the narratives of [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] and [[Hernán Cortés]].

In 1518, [[Juan de Grijalva]] arrived in Yokot'an lands, and was greeted with hostility. The next year, Cortés's expedition reached Tabasco, and he met with [[Tabscoob]] and other [[Tribal chief|chiefs]], who supplied him the translator who later became known as Doña Marina or [[La Malinche]]. According to Díaz, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Before we left, Cortés won the chiefs by his many kind words, telling them how our master, the Emperor, had many grand lords who gave him obedience and that they should also obey him ; that whatever they might need we would give them. All the chiefs thanked him very much and declared themselves vassals of our great emperor, the first in New Spain to give obedience to His Majesty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1614, the first church was built in Nacajuca, then considered the center of the Yokot'an world. Nacajuca was the only urban center to survive the [[New Spain|colonial period]], partly due to the introduction of animal husbandry, which limited the range of cultivation.

== Economy ==

The traditional economy is based on [[agriculture]], [[fishing]], the raising of [[livestock]], and the [[hunting]] of small game. Another source of income is palm-wood artisanry. In the past, the manufacture of [[oyster]]-shell [[lime (mineral)|lime]] for mortar was an important economic activity, but the availability of mass-produced building materials has reduced demand to the point where its production is no longer profitable.

=== Agriculture ===

The agriculture of the Yokot'an has been studied extensively and has been shown to be related to ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] agrarian methods. They cultivate high-altitude lands that are enriched with mineral-rich loam by flooding. The principal crop is [[maize]]. Agriculture has been in decline since the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], when [[animal husbandry]] was introduced. Maize, beans, and squash are planted seasonally.

=== Fishing ===

While fishing may have been as an important part of the Yokot'an economy as agriculture in [[Pre-Columbian]] times, today, due to environmental degradation, it doesn't have the same importance. The people continue, however, to fish, especially during periods of abundance. There are three main groups of fishermen. The "''libre''" ("free") fishermen use very simple "hoop and basket" technology and work in small groups led by an elected "boss". Members of official cooperatives enjoy the benefits of official organization, but are often underpaid. The third group consists of well-equipped business owners who work with contractors.

=== Livestock ===

The raising of livestock, unlike fishing, is a growing sector of the economy, often at the expense of agriculture. Many shallow lagoons formerly used for fishing have been drained for use as pastureland.

=== Hunting ===
The Yoko'tan hunt game such as the [[White-tailed deer]], but small game has much more importance.

=== Crafts ===

Hats are woven from palm and sleeping mats called ''petates'' are woven from the fibers of ''cañita'', the ''[[Cyperus giganteus]]'', but the primary craft of the Yoko'tan people is the dugout canoe and its smaller counterpart, the ''cayuco'', which is used for fishing and to reach the many islands used for planting.

== Culture ==
=== Housing ===

Traditional houses are rectangular in shape, made of palm, wood and are supported by six to eight posts. The roofs are steep to minimize the effect of the heavy rains, and are built by hired professionals. Houses tend to be surrounded by overhangs for outdoor work. Kitchen work is generally done in under one of these awnings. One modern element of house construction that has been incorporated is the use of nails.

=== Family ===

The Yoko'tan family is nuclear, monogamous, and cohesive. There is a tendency to marry young, and gender roles are specifically defined. Nonetheless, women are accorded more respect in traditional villages than in villages with high mestizo populations.

=== Religion ===

The original [[mythology]] and [[cosmogony]] of the Yokot'an is only beginning to be studied. Their myths are filled with supernatural water- and mangrove-creatures, and the story of [[La Llorona]] is also told.

Public religious displays center around [[Calendar of saints|feast day]]s, which points to the importance of [[syncretism]] in the adoption of the Catholic faith. As the traditional religion was inextricably entwined with the economy and culture, the "Christianization" of seasonal celebrations became an effective way of imposing the Spanish faith and culture. The most important feasts are of [[Carmelites|Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], the former patroness of fishermen associated with ''Ix Bolom'', the goddess of the sea, (July 16), the [[Immaculate Conception]] (December 8), and the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] (September 29). April 29 is celebrated for the flood season.

During the 1980s, the Catholic Church sought to decrease the influence of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries, who had established themselves in the region as stalwarts against [[alcoholism]] and ''la costumbre'', or traditional Maya religious practices.

In response, the Catholic Church formed groups of neighborhood catechists to take a hardline stance. They gave Catholic studies of the Gospel, discouraged the making of ''ofrendas'' (dedications to saints upon the building or purchase of a new house). They even discouraged music and dance.

This strong Catholic stance against ''la costumbre'' prompted a general withdrawal of the people from service to the Church and the decentralization of feast day celebration. Now the feasts are celebrated privately, among the family.

=== Language ===

Most Yoko'tan are bilingual. Yoko ochoco was in danger of dying out, but flourished in the 1980s after official preservation efforts.


=== Environmental ===

Environmental decline began with the draining of shallow lakes for pastureland when the raising of livestock was introduced. Land formerly used for cultivation was also used for grazing. More recently, [[Pemex]] has extensively polluted the waters of northern Tabasco and caused other ecologically-threatening changes such as altering the water's salinity. Some species have been driven to extinction and others have abandoned the affected habitats, reducing the average catch. The mangrove has receded and has thus been able to provide fewer [[Forestry|forest]] resources. These actions have spurred local peoples movements against Pemex and their contractors.

=== Social and economic ===

The environmental degradation has driven many Yokot'an, especially men, to urban centers for employment. As a result, family cohesion has suffered and traditions, especially those pertaining to the traditional economy, are not as well preserved. There is also a major [[alcoholism]] problem caused by difficulty adapting to mainstream Mexican society and the comparative wealth experienced by recent arrivals to the cities.

'''Crime in Saint Lucia''' is investigated by the [[Law enforcement in Saint Lucia|Royal Saint Lucia Police Force]].

== Crime by type ==

=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, Saint Lucia had a murder rate of 21.6 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 39 murders in Saint Lucia in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''.

In January 2014, British citizen Roger Pratt was murdered on his yacht, Magnetic Attraction, while moored off Vieux Fort, St Lucia. His widow, Margaret Pratt, has voiced her concerns repeatedly about delays in bringing four men charged with the murder to trial, and systematic failures that led to forensic evidence from the murder scene being contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justiceforroger.com/2017/03/the-murder-of-roger-pratt-and-our.html|title=The murder of Roger Pratt and our journey for justice|website=www.justiceforroger.com|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robbery ===
Robbery is an issue in Saint Lucia.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/centralamericaandcaribbean/saintlucia/10585183/St-Lucia-is-it-safe-to-visit.html "St Lucia: is it safe to visit?", Fred Mawer, The Telegraph, 20 January 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Saint Lucia was ranked as one of the top 10 most dangerous cruise destinations in the world, reporting instances of sixty nine cruise passengers being robbed at gun point on just two excursions. 

On December 14, 2015 an American couple was robbed by two men carrying a kitchen knife and a machete. Despite filing in a report, they have not heard from the police again and it is presumed that the perpetrators are still at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Violent Crime Problem In St. Lucia - St. Lucia News From The Voice St. Lucia|url = http://www.thevoiceslu.com/2015/12/violent-crime-problem-in-st-lucia/|website = St. Lucia News From The Voice St. Lucia|access-date = 2016-02-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2014, a British couple was robbed on board their yacht while it was moored off Vieux Fort, St Lucia, with the husband being murdered.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;

In 2013, 55 cruise ship passengers were robbed at gunpoint during daylight at the Botanical Gardens in [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufriere]].&lt;ref name="StLuciaMassRobbery" /&gt; No one was injured during the incident.&lt;ref name="StLuciaMassRobbery"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/cruiselog/2013/04/15/st-lucia-cruise-robbery/2083533/ "St. Lucia: Mass robbery of cruisers a 'rare incident'", Gene Sloan,] [[USA Today]], 15 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

High crime areas in the capital [[Castries]] include Chaussee Road, Wilton's Yard, Leslie Land, Marchand and Morne Du Don.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbean360.com/news/st-lucia-crime-surge-linked-gang-activity-commissioner "St Lucia crime surge linked to gang activity - commissioner", Caribbean 360, 18 July 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime dynamics ==

=== Policing ===
The [[Law enforcement in Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia police]] have been accused, largely by prominent figures in the then opposition party (St. Lucia Labour Party),  of keeping death lists and carrying out extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals in an attempt to make St Lucia more attractive to tourists.&lt;ref name=StLuciaPoliceKillings/&gt; Alleged shootings by police took place in 2010 and 2011 during a security drive called ''Operation Restore Confidence'', which was aimed at reducing violent crime and boosting tourism.&lt;ref name=StLuciaPoliceKillings/&gt; According to an independent report, officers from the Royal St. Lucia Police Force staged a dozen killings of suspected criminals.&lt;ref name=StLuciaPoliceKillings/&gt; The police then reported the killings as murders committed by unknown assailants, planting weapons at the scene.&lt;ref name=StLuciaPoliceKillings/&gt; In August 2013 the US government suspended assistance to the Saint Lucia police in light of rumors of the extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name=StLuciaPoliceKillings&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/st-lucia-police-kept-death-lists-killed-suspected-criminals-to-keep-island-tourist-friendly-report "St. Lucia police kept death lists, killed suspected criminals to keep island tourist-friendly: report", Nick Allen, [[National Post]], 11 March 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the [[demographic]] features of the population of [[Peru]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, the health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Peru is a [[Multiethnic society|multiethnic]] country, which means that it is home to people of many different historical backgrounds. Therefore, it is a multicultural country as well. Since it is a multiethnic society, Peruvian people usually treat their [[nationality]] as a [[citizenship]] instead of an [[ethnicity]]. The [[Census in Peru|Peruvian census]] does not contain information about ethnicity so only rough estimates are available.

==Population==

Peru is a multiethnic country formed by the amalgamation of different cultures and ethnicities over thousands of years.
[[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited the land for over ten millennia before the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century; their cultures and influence represent the foundation of today's Peru.

As a result of European contact and conquest, the population of the area now known as Peru decreased from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around {{val|600000}} in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520–1620'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This happened mostly because of the unintended spread of germs and infectious diseases. In fact, the spread of [[smallpox]] greatly weakened the Inca empire, even before the Spanish arrival. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] did not have as much natural immunity to the disease as did the Europeans who had been exposed to smallpox for roughly two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html|title=Guns Germs &amp; Steel: Variables. Smallpox - PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, several Amerindian populations were decimated. Furthermore, the disease killed Inca ruler Wayna Capac, triggering a civil war in the Inca empire that preceded the conquest efforts the Spaniards. Thus, the conquest was facilitated by the weakness of the Inca empire which was recovering from both a civil war and epidemics of unknown diseases.
[[File:AIenvaluacion.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Peruvian girls]]
However, other reasons for the decrease of Amerindian population include violence during the conquest followed by the breakdown of the Inca social system and famine. The Amerindian population suffered further decrease as the Spanish exploited an Inca communal labor system called [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] for mining purposes, thus killing thousands in forced labor.

[[Spaniards]] arrived in large numbers under colonial rule. After the independence, there has been a gradual [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigration from Austria, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Croatia and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Vázquez, "Immigration and mestizaje in nineteenth-century Peru", pp. 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.peruviantimes.com/19/scottish-independence-an-historical-view-and-a-peruvian-perspective/22915/ &lt;/ref&gt; Polynesians also came to the country lured to work in the Guano islands during the boom years of this commodity around the 1860s. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] arrived in the 1850s as a replacement for slave workers in the sugar plantations of the north coast and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mörner, ''Race mixture in the history of Latin America'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Other immigrant groups include [[Arabs]], [[South Asians]], Japanese and [[United States|Americans]] from the United States and Colombia(75,000). {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''[[Mestizos]]''' compose about 60%&lt;ref name="ethnicity2017"/&gt; of the total population. The term traditionally denotes Amerindian and European ancestry (mostly [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] ancestry). This term, was part of the caste classification during colonial times, whereby people of exclusive Spanish descent but born in the colonies were called criollos, people of mixed Amerindian and Spanish descent were called mestizos, those of African and Spanish descent were called mulatos and those of Amerindian and African descent were called Zambos. Nowadays, these terms have racist connotations.

Most Peruvian mestizos are of Amerindian and European descent, but other ethnic backgrounds (such as Asian, Middle Eastern and African) are also present, in varying degrees, in some segments of the mestizo population. Most mestizos are urban dwellers and show stronger European inheritance in regions like [[Lima Region]], [[La Libertad Region]], [[Callao Region]], [[Cajamarca Region]], [[Piura Region]], [[Lambayeque Region]], and [[Arequipa Region]].

'''[[Amerindians]]''' constitute around 26%&lt;ref name="ethnicity2017"/&gt; of the total population. The two major [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or ethnic groups are the [[Quechuas]] (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A large proportion of the indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] or [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and have vibrant cultural traditions, some of which were part of the [[Inca Empire]]. Dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the [[Andes Mountains]] in the [[Amazon basin]]. This region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include [[Iquitos]], [[Nauta]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], [[Pucallpa]] and [[Yurimaguas]]. This region is home to numerous [[indigenous people]]s, though they do not constitute a large proportion of the total population. Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the [[Shipibo]], [[Urarina]],&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cocama]], and [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]], to name just a few.

'''[[White Peruvians|European]]''' descendants constitute around 6%&lt;ref name="ethnicity2017"/&gt; of the total population. They are descendants of the Spanish colonizers and other Europeans such as [[Italian Peruvians|Italians]], [[British Peruvians|British]], [[French Peruvians|French]], [[German Peruvian|Germans]], [[Jews]] and [[Croatian Peruvian|Croatians]] (see also [[Croats]]) who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries. The majority of them live also in the largest cities (like mestizos), usually in the North and Center of Peru: [[Lima]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]], and through all the highlands of [[North macroregion, Peru|Northwest]], like [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]] and [[San Martín Region|San Martin]]. The only southern city with a significant white population is [[Arequipa]]. Recently, Peru has seen a migration of American retirees and businessmen come to settle in the country, due to lower cost of living and economic booms in the 1990s and 2000s, though Peru experiences busts in between. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Chinatown Lima Peru.jpg|thumb|right|Chinatown in Lima]]

There is also the presence of [[Asian Peruvian]]s, primarily [[Chinese Peruvian|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Peruvian|Japanese]], that constitutes 0.2% of the population, which in proportion to the overall population.&lt;ref name="ethnicity2017"/&gt; Peru has the second largest population of people of Japanese descent in Latin America after [[Brazil]] and the largest population of Chinese descent in Latin America. Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian [[upper Amazon]], including cities such as [[Yurimaguas]], [[Nauta]], [[Iquitos]] and the north central coast (Lambayeque and Trujillo). In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru, the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the [[rice fields]] during the Viceroyalty and to replace the [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, during the abolition of slavery itself. Despite the presence of Peruvians of Asian heritage being quite recent, in the past decade they have made significant advancements in business and political fields; a past president ([[Alberto Fujimori]]), several past cabinet members, and one member of the Peruvian congress are of Japanese or Chinese origin. Small numbers of [[Arab diaspora|Arab]] Peruvians, mostly of Lebanese and Syrian origin, and [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinians]] also reside, as well a small [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Hindustani]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The remaining is constituted by '''[[Afro-Peruvian]]s,''' a legacy of Peru's history as an importer of slaves during the colonial period. Today also [[mulatto]]s (mixed African and European) and [[zambos]] (mixed African and Amerindian) constitute an important part of the population as well, especially in [[Piura]], [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]], Lima and [[Ica region|Ica]] regions. The Afro-Peruvian population is concentrated mostly in coastal cities south of Lima, such as that of those found in the Ica Region, in cities like [[Cañete Province|Cañete]], [[Chincha Alta District|Chincha]], [[Ica (city)|Ica]], [[Nazca]] and [[Acarí]] in the border with the [[Arequipa Region]]. Another large but poorly promoted segment of Afro-Peruvian presence is in the ''Yunga'' regions (west and just below the Andean chain of northern Peru), (i.e., [[Piura]] and [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]]), where sugarcane, lemon, and mango production are still of importance. Important communities are found all over the [[Morropón Province]], such as in the city of [[Chulucanas]]. One of them is [[Yapatera]], a community in the same city, as well as smaller farming communities like [[Pabur]] or [[La Matanza District|La Matanza]] and even in the mountainous region near [[Canchaque]]. Further south, the colonial city of [[Zaña]] or farming towns like [[Help:Disambiguation|Capote]] and [[Tuman River|Tuman]] in [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]] are also important regions with Afro-Peruvian presence.

Socioeconomic and cultural indicators are increasingly important as identifiers. For example, Peruvians of Amerindian descent who have adopted aspects of Hispanic culture also are beginning to consider themselves "[[mestizo]]". With economic development, access to education, intermarriage, and large-scale migration from rural to urban areas, a more homogeneous national culture''' is developing, mainly along the relatively more prosperous coast. 

Most of Peru's population (about 50% percent) lives in the ''Costa'' (coastal area), while 36% live in the [[Geography of Peru#Andean Mountain Ranges|Sierra]] (the Andes) and only 12% in the [[Selva]] or [[Amazon rain forest]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Almost one-third of the nation's population lives in the [[Lima and Callao Metropolitan Area]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Lima is home to over 8 million Peruvians, one of South America's largest urban areas, it includes the neighboring community of [[Callao, Peru|Callao]] that's grown fast and expanded since the 1960s.

[[File:MANTEQUILLA and ROY MASON 236x272.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peruvian Paso]]]]
According to the [[Peruvian Constitution]] of 1993, Peru's official languages are Spanish and, Amerindian languages such as Quechua, Aymara and other such indigenous languages in areas where they predominate. Today, Spanish is spoken by some 83.9%  Spanish is used by the government and the media and in education and commerce. Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and are ethnically distinct from the diverse indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the Amazon basin.

Peru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a socioeconomic divide between the coast's mestizo-Hispanic culture and the more diverse, traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional customs, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the mestizo-Hispanic culture.
[[File:Baby got Back.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Amerindian woman with child]]

According to official sources, the use of Spanish has increased while the knowledge and use of indigenous languages have decreased considerably during the last four decades (1960–2000). At the beginning of the 1960s some 39% of the total Peruvian population were registered as speakers of indigenous languages, but by the 1990s the figures show a considerable decline in the use of Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages, when only 28% is registered as Quechua-speaking (16% of whom are reported to be bilingual in Spanish) and Spanish-speakers increased to 72%.

For 2017, government figures place Spanish as being spoken by 82.6% of the population, but among Amerindian languages, another decrease is registered. Of the indigenous languages, Quechua remains the most spoken, and even today is used by some 13.9% of the total Peruvian population or a third of Peru's total indigenous population. The number of Aymara-speakers and other indigenous languages is placed at 2.5%, and foreign languages 0.2%.

The drastic decline in use and knowledge of indigenous languages is largely attributed to the recent demographic factors. The urbanization and assimilation of Peru's Amerindian plurality into the Hispanic-mestizo culture, as well as the new socioeconomic factors associated with class structure, have given privilege to the use of Spanish at the expense of the Amerindian languages which were spoken by the majority of the population less than a century ago.

The major obstacle to a more widespread use of the Quechua language is the fact that multiple dialects of this language exist. Quechua, along with Aymara and the minor indigenous languages, was originally and remains essentially an oral language. Therefore, there is a lack of modern media which use it: for example books, newspapers, software, magazines, technical journals, etc. However, non-governmental organizations, as well as state sponsored groups, are involved in projects to edit and translate major works into the Quechua language; for instance, in late 2005 a version of [[Don Quixote]] was presented in Quechua. There has also been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken.

The percentage of native speakers of Quechua who are illiterate has been decreasing lately&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3tAqIU0dPsC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Peru+Quechua+literacy+rate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M9oWEVd0Li&amp;sig=EjUEmGRk54AqG_oREbYLh8Ck2Uk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_on7vqvZAhVR2GMKHQPRCbwQ6AEIZjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Peru%20Quechua%20literacy%20rate&amp;f=false|title=One Thousand Languages: Living, Endangered, and Lost|last=Austin|first=Peter|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520255609|location=|pages=202|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as 86.87% of the Peruvian population is literate.

As part of the recent push in Peru to recognize and integrate indigenous into national life, [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski|Kuczynski]]'s government is supporting the use of [[indigenous languages in Peru]], with the state-run TV station starting to broadcast in December 2016 a daily news program in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and in April 2017 one in [[Aymara language|Aymara]].

== Education ==
[[File:Kids with OLPC laptop.jpg|thumb|Peruvian school children with an [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop]]
Under the 1993 constitution, primary education is free and compulsory. The system is highly centralized, with the Ministry of Education appointing all public school teachers. Although 83% of Peru's students attend public schools at all levels, over 15% percent (usually the upper-classes and upper middle-class) attend private.

School enrollment has been rising sharply for years, due to a widening educational effort by the government and a growing school-age population. The [[illiteracy]] (2008) rate is estimated at 7.1% (10.6% for women), 19.0% in rural areas and 3.7% in urban areas [http://www.andina.com.pe/Espanol/Noticia.aspx?id=NiBnWpBzahw=].
[[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is mostly an oral language, so in some cases, in rural areas, people do not speak Spanish and therefore do not know how to read or write. Elementary and secondary school enrollment is about 7.7&amp;nbsp; million. Peru's 74 universities (1999), 39% public and 61% private institutions, enrolled about {{val|322000}} students in 1999.

The movement [[Copyright reform movement|objects]] to what they consider over-restrictive [[copyright]] laws.

[[Creative Commons]] is an organization started by [[Lawrence Lessig]] which provides [[Creative Commons license|license]]s that permit sharing and [[Remix culture|remixing]] under various conditions, and also offers an online search of various Creative Commons-licensed works.

The free-culture movement, with its ethos of free exchange of ideas, is aligned with the [[Free software movement|free and open-source-software movement]].

Today, the term stands for many other movements, including [[open access]] (OA), the [[remix culture]], the [[hacker culture]], the [[access to knowledge movement]], the [[Open Source Learning]], the [[copyleft]] movement and the [[public domain]] movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== History ==

=== Precursors ===
In the late 1960s, [[Stewart Brand]] founded the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' and argued that technology could be liberating rather than oppressing.&lt;ref name="Ronald J. Baker"&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O5E_k2u7enkC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=information%20wants%20to%20be%20free&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=information%20wants%20to%20be%20free&amp;f=false | title = Mind over matter: why intellectual capital is the chief source of wealth | first = Ronald J | last = Baker | page = 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He coined the slogan "[[Information wants to be free]]" in 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge338.html | title = Edge 338 | journal = Edge | number = 338 | accessdate = 2011-04-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; against limiting [[freedom of information|access to information]] by governmental control, preventing a public domain of information.&lt;ref name="R. Polk Wagner"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/wagner.control.pdf | title = Information wants to be free: intellectual property and the mythologies of control | first = R Polk | last = Wagner | publisher = University of Pennsylvania | format = [[PDF]] essay}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background of the formation of the free-culture movement ===
In 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] which President Clinton signed into law. The legislation extended copyright protections for twenty additional years, resulting in a total guaranteed copyright term of seventy years after a creator's death. The bill was heavily lobbied by music and film corporations like [[Disney]], and dubbed as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. Lawrence Lessig claims copyright is an obstacle to cultural production, knowledge sharing and technological innovation, and that private interests – as opposed to public good – determine law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |date=2004 |title=Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hs1GWwnx-wC&amp;dq=free+culture |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |pages=368 |isbn=9781101200841 |accessdate=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled the country in 1998, giving as many as a hundred speeches a year at college campuses, and sparked the movement. It led to the foundation of the first chapter of the [[Students for Free Culture]] at [[Swarthmore College]].

In 1999, Lessig challenged the Bono Act, taking the case to the [[US Supreme Court]]. Despite his firm belief in victory, citing the Constitution's plain language about "limited" copyright terms, Lessig only gained two dissenting votes: from Justices [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[John Paul Stevens]].

=== Foundation of the Creative Commons ===
In 2001, Lessig initiated [[Creative Commons]], an alternative "some rights reserved" licensing system to the default "all rights reserved" copyright system. Lessig focuses on a [[fair use|fair]] balance between the interest of the public to use and participate into released creative works and the need of protection for a creator's work, which still enables a "read-write" [[remix culture]].&lt;ref name="lessig2007"/&gt;

The term “free culture” was originally used since 2003 during the [[World Summit on Information Society]]&lt;ref name="WSIS PCT events"&gt;WSIS (2001). [http://muguet.com/www.wsis-pct.org/pct-events.html "PCT WORKING GROUP EVENT"]&lt;/ref&gt; to present the first free license for artistic creation at large, initiated by the Copyleft attitude team in France since 2001 (named [[free art license]]). It was then developed in Lawrence Lessig's book [[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Quart"&gt;Quart, Alissa (2009). [http://www.cjr.org/feature/expensive_gifts.php "Expensive Gifts"], ''Columbia Journalism Review'', 48(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003 the [[Open Content Project]], a 1998 Creative Commons precursor by [[David A. Wiley]], announced the Creative Commons as successor project and Wiley joined as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=2003-08-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/|url=http://opencontent.org/ |title=OpenContent is officially closed.

=== "Free Cultural Works" Definition ===

== Organizations ==
[[File:Cc.logo.circle.svg|thumb|150px|[[Creative Commons]] logo]]
The organization commonly associated with free culture is Creative Commons (CC), founded by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. CC promotes sharing creative works and diffusing ideas to produce cultural vibrance, scientific progress and business innovation.

[[File:Free_Culture_dot_org_logo.png|thumb|150px|Student organization [[FreeCulture.org]], inspired by Lessig and founded 2003. The [[Building block]]s are a symbol for reuse and remixing of creative works, used also as symbol of the [[Remix culture]].]]

[http://questioncopyright.org QuestionCopyright.org] is another organization whose stated mission is "to highlight the economic, artistic, and social harm caused by distribution monopolies, and to demonstrate how freedom-based distribution is better for artists and audiences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://questioncopyright.org/ A Clearinghouse For New Ideas About Copyright].

Retrieved on 2011-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The web site of the organization has a number of resources, publications, and other references related to various copyright, patent, and trademark issues.

The student organization Students for Free Culture is sometimes confusingly called "the Free Culture Movement," but that is not its official name. The organization is a subset of the greater movement. The first chapter was founded in 1998 at Swarthmore College, and by 2008, the organization had twenty-six chapters.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Christopher (2009). [http://www.thenation.com/article/mr-lessig-goes-washington "Mr. Lessig Goes to Washington"], ''[[The Nation]]'', June 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The free-culture movement takes the ideals of the [[free and open-source software]] movement and extends them from the field of [[Computer software|software]] to all [[Culture|cultural]] and creative works. Early in Creative Commons' life, [[Richard Stallman]] (the founder of the [[Free Software Foundation]] and the [[free software]] movement) supported the organization. He withdrew his support due to the introduction of several licenses including a developing nations and the sampling licenses&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060222104211/http://www.linuxp2p.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=10771 interview for LinuxP2P] (6 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and later restored some support when Creative Commons retired those licenses.

The [[free music]] movement, a subset of the free-culture movement, started out just as the Web rose in popularity with the Free Music Philosophy&lt;ref name="Samudrala"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp.html#what_it_is|title = The Free Music Philosophy |accessdate = 2008-10-26|last = Samudrala |first = Ram |authorlink =Ram Samudrala|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ram Samudrala]] in early 1994. It was also based on the idea of free software by Richard Stallman and coincided with nascent open art and open information movements (referred to here as collectively as the "free-culture movement"). The Free Music Philosophy used a three pronged approach to voluntarily encourage the spread of unrestricted copying, based on the fact that copies of recordings and compositions could be made and distributed with complete accuracy and ease via the Internet.  The subsequent free music movement was reported on by diverse media outlets including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'',&lt;ref name="billboard_jul181998"/&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'',&lt;ref name="forbes_jul111997"/&gt; ''Levi's Original Music Magazine'',&lt;ref name="levi_nov192008"/&gt; ''[[Free Radical (magazine)|The Free Radical]]'',&lt;ref name="free_radical_2001"/&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;ref name="wired_jun101997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired_jun121998"/&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt_dec161998"/&gt; Along with the [[Dotcom bubble|explosion of the Web]] driven by [[open source software]] and [[Linux]], the rise of [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] and [[lossy compression]], and despite the efforts of the music industry, free music became largely a reality in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="troelsjust"/&gt; Organizations such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and Creative Commons with free information champions like Lawrence Lessig were devising numerous licenses that offered different flavors of copyright and copyleft. The question was no longer why and how music should be free, but rather how creativity would flourish while musicians developed models to generate revenue in the Internet era.&lt;ref name="schulman_1999a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music_future"/&gt;&lt;ref name="napster_compendium"/&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Skepticism from the FSF ===
Initially, [[Free Software Foundation]] founder Richard Stallman did not see the importance of free works beyond software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp/free-software-philosophy.html|title=Philosophies of Free Software and Intellectual Property |author=Brett Watson |date=1999-02-10 |accessdate=2016-02-24|quote=Is Software special? [...] So restricting modification is not necessarily evil when it comes to "articles and books"? Or does he just mean that we aren't obliged to let others misrepresent us? Alas, no mention of restricting verbatim duplication. Even Stallman's story on "The Right to Read" does not address the issue directly, despite being about IPR issues other than software. It extrapolates a dystopian future from our current position and acts as a warning about current trends, but offers no comment on the status quo. [...] There is a striking lack of discussion from the usual leaders with regards to the application of copyright in areas other than software. Raymond is mute, and Stallman mumbles. They both seem to view software as a special case: Raymond tacitly, and Stallman explicitly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance for manuals and books Stallman stated in the 1990s: {{quote|As a general rule, I don't believe that it is essential for people to have permission to modify all sorts of articles and books. The issues for writings are not necessarily the same as those for software. For example, I don't think you or I are obliged to give permission to modify articles like this one, which describe our actions and our views.}} Similarly, in 1999 Stallman said that he sees "no social imperative for free hardware designs like the imperative for free software".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/1999062200505NWLF Richard Stallman -- On "Free Hardware"] on linuxtoday.com "I see no social imperative for free hardware designs like the imperative for free software." (Jun 22, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors, such as [[Joshua Pearce]], have argued that there is an ethical imperative for [[open-source hardware]], specifically with respect to [[open-source-appropriate technology]] for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua M. Pearce, "[https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology]", ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'', '''14''', pp. 425-431 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Stallman changed his position slightly and advocated for free sharing of information in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stallman.org/articles/end-war-on-sharing.html |title=Ending the War on Sharing |first=Richard |last=Stallman |authorlink=Richard Stallman |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in 2011 Stallman commented on the [[Megaupload]] founder's arrest, "I think all works meant for practical uses must be free, but that does not apply to music, since music is meant for appreciation, not for practical use."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/jan/30/google-facebook-antiphishing-megaupload Boot up: Google and Facebook work on antiphishing tool, Richard Stallman on MegaUpload arrests, and more] on [[The Guardian]] (January 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow up Stallman differentiated three classes: Works of practical use should be free, Works representing points of view should be shareable but not changeable and works of art or entertainment should be copyrighted (but only for 10 years).&lt;ref&gt;[https://stallman.org/articles/guardian-correction.html Correcting The Guardian's paraphrase] by Richard Stallman (Jan 22, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay in 2012 Stallman argued that [[video game]]s as software should be free but not their artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonfree-games.en.html Nonfree DRM'd Games on GNU/Linux: Good or Bad?] on fsf.org by [[Richard Stallman]] "Nonfree game programs (like other nonfree programs) are unethical because they deny freedom to their users. (Game art is a different issue, because it isn't software." (May 31, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Stallman advocated for [[free hardware]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/03/richard-stallman-how-to-make-hardware-designs-free/ Hardware Designs Should Be Free. Here’s How to Do It] by [[Richard Stallman]] on [[wired.com]] (03.18.2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright proponents===
Vocal criticism against the free-culture movement comes from copyright proponents.

Prominent technologist and musician [[Jaron Lanier]] discusses this perspective of Free Culture in his 2010 book ''[[You Are Not a Gadget]]''. Lanier's concerns include the depersonalization of crowd-sourced anonymous media (such as Wikipedia) and the economic dignity of middle-class creative artists.

[[Andrew Keen]], a critic of [[Web 2.0]], criticizes some of the Free Culture ideas in his book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]],'' describing Lessig as an "intellectual property communist."&lt;ref name="keen2.0"&gt;Keen, Andrew (May 16, 2006). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/714fjczq.asp  Web 2.0; The second generation of the Internet has arrived. It's worse than you think.] ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of  news media industry's market share is blamed on free culture but scholars like [[Clay Shirky]] claim that the market itself, not free culture, is what's killing the journalism industry.&lt;ref name="Quart"/&gt;

The '''people of Fuzhou''' ({{zh|c=福州人}}; [[Foochow Romanized]]: ''Hók-ciŭ-nè̤ng''), also known as '''Fuzhounese''', '''Foochowese''', '''Hokchew''', '''Hokchia''', '''Hokchiu''', '''Hujiu sei-ay people''' ({{lang|zh|福州十邑人}}), '''Eastern Min''' or '''Mindong''' usually refers to people who originate from [[Fuzhou]] region and the [[Mindong region]], adjacent [[Gutian County]], [[Pingnan County, Fujian|Pingnan County]], in [[Fujian province]] and in the adjacent [[Matsu Islands]]. Fuzhounese are [[Han Chinese]] people and are a part of [[Min Chinese|Min]]-speaking group, who speaks [[Eastern Min]] or specifically [[Fuzhou dialect]]. There is also a significant overseas Foochowese population, particularly distributed in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[United States]] ([[Fuzhou Americans]]), [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |script-title=zh:福州市志(第八册) | publisher = 方志出版社 |date=December 2000  | isbn= 7-80122-605-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their small population size, Fuzhounese people have produced a large number of achievements in borh academic and science fields, there has been 17 Fuzhounese [[Zhuangyuan]]s (scholar who is ranked first in the imperial examinations), and famous mathematicians and scientists such as [[Zhang Yuzhe]] (the father of modern Chinese astronomy), [[Guo Kexin]] (the main pioneer of electron microscopy of China), [[Chih-Tang Sah]], [[Hsien Wu]], [[Guo Kexin]] and [[Min Zhuo]] are Fuzhounese.

[[File:ChinaFujianFuzhou.png|right|upright|thumb|Native location of Fuzhounese people (includes [[Gutian County]] and [[Pingnan County, Fujian|Pingnan County]] which are unrepresented in this map.]]

==Language==
{{Main page|Fuzhou dialect}}
[[Fuzhou dialect]] is a [[tonal language]] that has extensive [[sandhi]] rules in the [[Syllable onset|initials]], [[Syllable rime|rimes]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. These complicated rules make Fuzhou dialect one of the most difficult [[Chinese varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pioneers of Modern China: Understanding the Inscrutable Chinese |author=Khoon Choy Lee |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=98-127-0090-0 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], some Japanese scholars became passionate about studying Fuzhou dialect, believing that it could be beneficial to the rule of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. One of their most famous works was the Japanese-Chinese Translation: Fuzhou Dialect ({{lang|zh-hant|日華對譯: 福州語}}) published in 1940 in Taipei, in which katakana was used to represent Fuzhou pronunciation.

Many non-speakers have noticed on the 'cuteness' of Fuzhou dialect when they listened to it.

==Emigration and diaspora==
[[File:THE MA-QUI.jpg|thumb|left|A native [[Fuzhou]] detective, 1898.]]

===History===
Fuzhou's history of emigration began since the [[Ming dynasty]] with [[Zheng He]]'s voyages overseas. As the result of immigration of Fuzhouese to [[southeast Asia]], Fuzhou dialect is found in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. The city of [[Sibu]] of [[Malaysia]] is called "new Fuzhou" due to a large wave of Fuzhounese immigration in the early 1900s. They are referred to as "Hockchiu" or "Hokchew" in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Overseas: Comparative Cultural Issues |authorlink= Chee Beng Tan |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
The Hockchius and Hockchias migrated to [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]] (South-East Asia) in smaller numbers compared to the [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[hakkas]] and [[Hainanese people|Hainanese]] but achieved remarkable success. Amongst others, [[Robert Kuok]] (Hockchiu) rose to become the "Sugar King" of [[Malaysia]] and is currently ranked the richest man in south-east Asia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Suryadinata|title=Southeast Asia's Chinese Businesses in an Era of Globalization: Coping with the Rise of China|year=2006|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=98-123-0401-0|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Liem Sioe Liong ([[Sudono Salim]]) who was of Hockchia origin, was once the richest man in [[Indonesia]], controlling a vast empire in the industry of flour, cement and food manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Brook &amp; Hy V. Luong|title=Culture and Economy: The Shaping of Capitalism in Eastern Asia|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=04-720-8598-0|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]], [[Chin Peng]] was also Hockchia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessieca Leo|title=Global Hakka: Hakka Identity in the Remaking|year=2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-043-0027-9|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Fuzhounese Americans}}
Fuzhounese people first started immigrating to America during the late [[Qing dynasty]]. Some of these immigrants were students who, after completing their studies returned to back to their fatherland (Fuzhou).

After the lifting of emigration restriction from the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1980s, a small wave of Fuzhounese settled in America. These new Fuzhounese immigrants set up their own separated communities such as "[[Little Fuzhou]]" in [[Manhattan]], away from other non-linguistically related Chinese people.

The '''Haagse Kunstkring''' (English '''The Hague Art Circle''') is an association in [[The Hague]] for artists and art lovers. Among the members are visual artists, architects, writers, recitation artists, photographers, musicians and designers.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila D. Muller (2013). ''Art Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia.'' p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was founded in 1891, among others, by artist [[Théophile de Bock]] and architect [[:w:Paul du Rieu|Paul du Rieu]]. The art society settled on the [[:nl:Herengracht (Den Haag)|Heerengracht]] in The Hague and later moved to the [[:nl:Denneweg|Denneweg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haagsekunstkring.nl/index.php/hkk-algemeen/geschiedenis Historie] at haagsekunstkring.nl, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, [[Jan Toorop]] organized the first retrospective exhibition of [[Vincent van Gogh]], although at that time this work was still unknown and most controversial.

In 1923, [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]] in the Kunstkring held the first Dada-meeting in the Netherlands, which was of great influence on the renewal of art in the Netherlands.

From 1926 to 1932 the artist [[Albert Vogel, Sr.]] (1874-1933) served as chairman of the art circle.

To mark the 100th anniversary of the Hague Art Circle, the society was awarded the Medal of the City of The Hague.

== Famous members ==
* [[Cor Alons]], industrial designer
* [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], architect
* [[Leonora van Bijsterveld]] ; her inheritance (1957) allows the Kunstkring could buy a building at the Denneweg. The Art Society is still there.

'''Hebbar''' (Hebbar:  {{lang|tcy-Knda|ಹೆಬ್ಬಾರ್&amp;nbsp;ಭಾಷೆ}} {{lang|tcy-Latn|Hebbar Bhāshe}})
spoken mainly in the southern part of the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]. The native speakers of Hebbar Language are referred to as [[Hebbar Iyengar]].

Hebbar is the primary spoken language of the Hebbar Iyengar Community in the districts of [[Bengaluru]], [[Mysuru]], [[Mandya]], [[Tumkur]], [[Hassan district|Hassan]], [[Chikkamagaluru]], [[Shivamogga]], [[Chikkaballapura]], [[Kolar]] and [[Chamarajanagar]] districts of Southern Karnataka. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebbarsabha.org/about_us.html|title=Welcome to The Hebbar Sreevaishnava Sabha, Bangalore - India|website=Hebbarsabha.org|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main|Dravidian languages}}
Hebbar Language belongs to the southern branch of the family of [[Dravidian languages]]. It descends from [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and derives considerable Loan words from [[Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]] Vocabulary. The Hebbar language originates in the southern part of Karnataka, India. &lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Hebbar is a Kannada word which is a combination of Hiriya Haruva meaning elderly Brahmins in Kannada. Sri Ramanuja Referred his new disciples who converted to Sri Vaishnavism as Hebbar and the language they learnt by mixing Kannada and Tamil developed in to the current Hebbar Language.

==Official status==
Hebbar Language is not currently an official language of India or any other country. Efforts are being made to create Dictionary and document the linguistic features of the Hebbar language by linguist Arvind S Iyengar and few others who are interested to save their distinct language to future generations and also to get official recognition to it. &lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

==History==
During 12th Century Sri Ramanujacharya fled Tamilnadu escaping persecution of Vaishnavas by the Chola King who wanted to kill him. He came and settled in the Hoysala Kingdom. When he was in Tondanur (Tonnur) near Melukote, a group of elderly Kannada Brahmins from Ramanathapura, Saligrama came to Tondanur and heard Sri Ramanujacharyas discourses on Srivaishnava Philosophy. Impressed by the preaching of Ramanuja they offered to convert to Srivaishnava Religion and they became followers of Ramanuja. Sri Ramanuja affectionately called this group of Elderly Brahmins who became his disciples as Hebbar. Hebbar is a Kannada word which is a combination of Hiriya Haruva, which means elderly Brahmins in Kannada. Thus the sect called Hebbar Iyengar originated in the erstwhile Hoysala Kingdom of 12th Century. 
Since they had to learn Alwar's Divya Prabandham as part of there new religion they started learning Tamil and a new variant influenced by Kannada orinated and became the Lingua Franca of the Hebbar Iyengar Sect whih is differnt from the other Iyengar Tamil spoken in Karnataka and Tamilnadu. 

==Geographic distribution==
After converting elderly Kannada Brahmins to Sri Vaishnavism, Sri Ramanujacharya asked them to settle in Ashta Gramas or eight villages, namely:  Bindiganavile, Kadaba, Nuggehalli, Nonavinakere, Shantigrama etc., in the Hoysala Kingdom. The Southern Karnataka region is now called Hale Mysuru.  Later they spread to various places across the region.  Now they are found in most districts of the Hale Mysuru region of Karnataka and also in major cities in different states of India.  A significant number of the diaspora of Hebbar language speakers are found in USA, UK, Singapore, Australia and other foreign countries.

==Writing system==
As of now Hebbar Language doesn't have its own script but many are trying to document and standardize Hebbar Language script using the Roman Script as some of the Diaspora are not familiar with Kannada Script. The most notable work is done by Arvind Iyengar of University of New England (Australia) who has written as research paper  '''A Phonological Overview of the Hebbar Iyengar Language''' &lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;. Few writers resident in Karnataka are writing the language in the [[Kannada]] Script which they learn in Karnataka in their blogs and social media. 

===Phonology===
Vowel length is phonemic in Hebbar, as is attested by the following (near) minimal pairs –
/ʋid i/ ‘fate’ /ʋiːd i/ ‘street’
/kuɽʉ/ ‘give (imp.)’ /kuːɽʉ/ ‘call (imp.)’
/pennʉ/ ‘pen’ /peːn(ʉ)/ ‘louse’
/ʉ/ does not occur in the first syllable of a word. Also, an unstressed word-medial /i/ may manifest as [ɨ] or [ʉ]—depending on whether the vowels in the surrounding syllables are front or back—or even as a highly unstressed [ə], as in LT &lt;vayiṟu&gt; /ʋɐjirʉ/  H [ʋəj(ə)rʉ].
This is also attested by Meenakshisundaran (1965, pp. 122-124) as a systematic change in Tamil as far back as the 11th to 13th centuries.
/ʊ/ only occurs word-finally, and is the only vowel that undergoes phonemic nasalisation.  Although nasalised vowels may occur in borrowed Kannada colloquialisms such as /ɦ ː/ ‘yes’ and / ɦ ː/ ‘no’ (Sridhar 2007, p. 299), they are unproductive and do not Word-initial /e(ː)/ and /o(ː)/ are pronounced with a palatal and labial onset respectively – [ʲe(ː)] and [ʷo(ː)]. Vowels in brackets denote non-native vowels. The vowel /æː/ occurs only in one native
Hebbar word – /pæːrʊ/ ‘grandson’ (cf. LT &lt;peyaraṉ&gt;). Otherwise, it occurs only in loan words.

If one goes by the Indian grammatical tradition, the vowel-semivowel combinations /əj/ and /əw/ would have to be classified as diphthongs, and formally included under vowels. However, apart from these two combinations, [ə] only occurs as a word-medial unstressed allophone of the short vowels /ɐ/, /i/ and /ʉ/.

Affricates include /ʨ/ and /ʥ/ and their aspirated counterparts /ʨʰ/ and /ʥʱ/. /w/ occurs only in the aforementioned ‘diphthong’ /əw/ and as an allophone of /ʋʉ/. [ɽ] is an intervocalic allophone of /ɖ/, while [ɽ] is an intervocalic allophone of /ɳ/. /ŋ/ occurs phonemically only in rare cases, such as in the Sanskrit-origin word /ʋɑːŋməjʊ/ ‘literature’. therwise, [ŋ] and [n ] are allophones of /n/ immediately before a velar and dental stop respectively. The palatal nasal /ɲ/, which is at least nominally a part of the Tamil, Kannada7 and Sanskrit phonemic inventories, does not occur at all in Hebbar, whether independently or in combination with other consonants. For instance, Skt. /pəɲcəmiː/ ‘fifthlunar day’ is realised as H /pɐnʨəmi/. Similarly, the Sanskrit consonant combination /ɟɲ/, such as in Skt. /ɟɲaːpəkə/ ‘remembrance’, is realised in Hebbar as /ɡj/  H /ɡjɑːpəkʊ/ (cf.ST [ɲɑːbəɡ
], K /ɡɲɑːpəkɐ/).

Hebbar’s phonemic inventory is thus identical to that of Kannada, with the exception of the vowel /ʉ/ and the palatal nasal /ɲ/. Hebbar includes aspirated stops, affricates and the fricatives /ɕ/ and /ɦ/ 8 , all of which are absent in Tamil. On the other hand, one notable Tamil phoneme absent from Hebbar is the retroflex approximant /ɻ/, which in Hebbar has merged with the retroflex lateral /ɭ/. Also, without going too much into the realm of phonetics, while
many varieties of spoken Tamil tend to have the mid-low short vowels [ɛ] and [ɔ], Hebbar tends to display the higher /e/ and /o/. This is likely due to influence from Kannada, which also features such (slightly) higher vowels. In spoken Tamil, all words nominally end in a vowel (Schiffman, 1999, p. 5), even if orthographically consonant-final. This also holds true in Hebbar, including for loan words from other languages. Words in the source language that end either phonetically or orthographically in consonants (other than glides) have an epenthetic /ʉ/ suffixed to them.
&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

==Oral traditions==
There are few attempts done by some Hebbar Iyengar singers to sing songs in Hebbar Language.

Both were Americans who, allegedly, worked for [[NKVD|Soviet intelligence]] during [[World War II]].  The Koral's headed the "Art" or "Berg" group of Soviet spies.  The Berg group acted as couriers for various Soviet contacts, including the [[FBI Silvermaster File|Silvermaster ring]]. Helen Koral received a regular stipend of $100 per month from the KGB and work closely with [[Helen Lowry]], the wife of [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], the KGB [[Illegal Rezident]] during World War II.  Her code name in the Soviet intelligence according to materials from the [[Venona project]] was "Miranda", and later changed to "Art".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63839">{{Sociology}}
[[Sociology]] as a scholarly discipline emerged primarily out of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, shortly after the [[French Revolution]], as a [[positivist]] ''[[science]] of [[society]]''. Its genesis owed to various key movements in the [[philosophy of science]] and the [[philosophy of knowledge]]. Social analysis in a broader sense, however, has origins in the common stock of philosophy and necessarily pre-dates the field. Modern academic sociology arose as a reaction to [[modernity]], [[capitalism]], [[urbanization]], [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], [[secularization]], [[colonization]] and [[imperialism]]. Late-19th-century sociology demonstrated a particularly strong interest in the emergence of the modern [[nation state]]; its constituent [[institution]]s, its units of [[socialization]], and its means of [[surveillance]]. An emphasis on the concept of modernity, rather than [[the Enlightenment]], often distinguishes sociological discourse from that of classical [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Harriss, John.

Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' in Allen, T. and Thomas, Alan (eds) ''Poverty and Development in the 21st Century', Oxford University Press, Oxford. p325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various quantitative [[social research]] techniques have become common tools for governments, businesses, and organizations, and have also found use in the other social sciences. Divorced from theoretical explanations of social dynamics, this has given [[social research]] a degree of autonomy from the discipline of sociology. Similarly, ''"[[social science]]"'' has come to be appropriated as an umbrella term to refer to various disciplines which study humans, interaction, society or culture.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Randall|title=The Discovery of Society|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States|isbn=9780070118836|pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==

===Ancient times===

The sociological reasoning may be traced back at least as far as the [[ancient Greeks]] (cf. [[Xenophanes]]′ remark: "''If horses would adore gods, these gods would resemble horses''"). Proto-sociological observations are to be found in the founding texts of Western philosophy ([[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Plato]], [[Polybius]] and so on), as well as in the non-European thought of figures such as [[Confucius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|author2=Plummer, Ken|year=2005|title=Sociology. A Global Introduction|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|edition=3rd|page=12|isbn=0-13-128746-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic trends in the sociological thinking of the ancient Greeks can be traced back to their social environment.  Because there was rarely any extensive or highly centralized political organization within states this allowed the tribal spirit of localism and provincialism to have free play. This tribal spirit of localism and provincialism pervaded most of the Greek thinking upon social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Harry E.|year=1948|title=An Introduction to the History of Sociology|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location= Chicago, Illinois|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]] can be traced back to the [[Domesday Book]] ordered by king [[William I of England|William I]] in 1086.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Halsey(2004),''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell(1970),''A new dictionary of sociology'', p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, [[Ma Tuan-Lin]], a Chinese historian, first recognized patterns of ''social dynamics'' as an underlying component of historical development in his seminal encyclopedia, [[Wenxian Tongkao]] or "''Comprehensive Examination of Literature''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnx.org/content/m42794/latest/?collection=col11407/1.7|title=OpenStax CNX|author=|date=|website=cnx.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ibn Khaldun (14th century)====

There is evidence of [[early Muslim sociology]] from the 14th century. Some consider [[Ibn Khaldun]], a 14th-century Tunisian, [[Arab]], [[Islamic]] scholar from North Africa, to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology; his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on [[social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]].&lt;ref name="Akhtar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z | last1 = Haque | first1 = Amber | year = 2004 | title = Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists | url = | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 357–377 [375] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Autonomous, the Universal and the Future of Sociology"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alatas|first=S.

Concerning the discipline of sociology, he conceived a dynamic theory of history that involved conceptualizations of social conflict and social change. He developed the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the concept of a "generation", and the inevitable loss of power that occurs when desert warriors conquer a city. Following a contemporary Arab scholar, Sati' al-Husri, the Muqaddimah may be read as a sociological work: six books of general sociology. Topics dealt with in this work include politics, urban life, economics, and knowledge. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of 'asabiyyah, which has been translated as "social cohesion", "group solidarity", or "tribalism". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion.

==Classical origins==

The term ("''sociologie''") was first coined by the French essayist [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836),&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773-1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007 See also and Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie : du mot à la chose, in Revue d’histoire des sciences humaines'', Numéro 15, novembre 2006 : Naissances de la science sociale.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Latin: ''socius'', "companion"; and the suffix ''-ology'', "the study of", from Greek λόγος, ''lógos'', "knowledge".&lt;ref name="comte"&gt;"Comte, Auguste" A Dictionary of Sociology (3rd Ed), John Scott &amp; Gordon Marshall (eds), Oxford University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-860986-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-860986-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sociology" in ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', Craig Calhoun (ed), Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-512371-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, the French-thinker Auguste Comte (1798–1857) ultimately gave sociology the definition that it holds today.&lt;ref name="comte" /&gt; Comte had earlier expressed his work as "social physics", but that term had been appropriated by others, such as Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796–1874).

===The Enlightenment and positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|left|thumb|140px|The Positivist temple in Porto Alegre]]

====Henri de Saint-Simon====

[[Henri de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] published ''Physiologie sociale'' in 1813 and devoted much of his time to the prospect that human society could be steered toward progress if scientists would form an international assembly to influence its course. He argued that scientists could distract groups from war and strife, by focusing their attention to generally improving their societies living conditions. In turn, this would bring multiple cultures and societies together and prevent conflict. Saint-Simon took the idea that everyone had encouraged from the Enlightenment, which was the belief in science, and spun it to be more practical and hands-on for the society. Saint-Simon's main idea was that industrialism would create a new launch in history. He saw that people had been seeing progress as an approach for science, but he wanted them to see it as an approach to all aspects of life. Society was making a crucial change at the time since it was growing out of a declining feudalism. This new path could provide the basis for solving all the old problems society had previously encountered. He was more concerned with the participation of man in the workforce instead of which workforce man choose. His slogan became "All men must work&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; ” and from this, the slogan of communism was evolved "Each according to his capacity.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; "

====Auguste Comte====

Writing after the original Enlightenment and influenced by the work of Saint-Simon, [[List of political philosophers|political philosopher]] of [[social contract]], [[Auguste Comte]] hoped to unify all studies of humankind through the scientific understanding of the social realm. His own sociological scheme was typical of the 19th-century humanists; he believed all human life passed through distinct historical stages and that, if one could grasp this progress, one could prescribe the remedies for social ills. Sociology was to be the "queen science" in Comte's schema; all basic physical sciences had to arrive first, leading to the most fundamentally difficult science of human society itself.&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; Comte has thus come to be viewed as the "Father of Sociology".&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; Comte delineated his broader philosophy of science in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' [1830–1842], whereas his [[A General View of Positivism]] (1865) emphasized the particular goals of sociology.

Auguste Comte was so impressed with his theory of positivism that he referred to it as "the great discovery of the year 1822.” Comte's system is based on the principles of knowledge, as seen in 3 states. This law states any kind of knowledge always begins in theological form. Here the knowledge can be explained by a superior supernatural power such as animism, spirits, or gods. It then passes to the metaphysical form where the knowledge is explained by abstract philosophical speculation. Finally, the knowledge becomes positive after being explained scientifically through observation, experiment, and comparison. The order of the laws was created in order of increasing difficulty.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; Comte's description of the development of society is parallel to Karl Marx's own theory historical progression from capitalism to communism. They both were influenced by various Utopian-socialist thinkers of the day and agreed that some form of communism would be the climax of societal development.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

In later life, Auguste Comte developed a 'religion of humanity' to give positivist societies the unity and cohesiveness found through the traditional worship people were used to.  In this new "religion" he referred to society as the "Great Being." Comte promoted a universal love and harmony taught through the teachings of his industrial system theory.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourdeau|first=Michel|title=Auguste Comte|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/comte/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011|editor=Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]].

[[File:KarlMarx Tomb.JPG|thumb|120px|right|Karl Marx rejected the positivist sociology of Comte but was of central influence in founding structural social science.]]

===Industrial revolution and the Darwinian revolution===

====Historical materialism====

Both Comte and Marx intended to develop a new scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularization]]. Marx, in the tradition of [[Hegelianism]], rejected the positivist method and was in turn rejected by the self-proclaimed sociologists of his day. However, in attempting to develop a comprehensive ''science of society'' Marx nevertheless became recognized as a founder of sociology by the mid 20th century. [[Isaiah Berlin]] described Marx as the "true father" of modern sociology, "in so far as anyone can claim the title."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah. 1967. ''Karl Marx''. Time Inc Book Division, New York. pp130&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|To have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principal achievement of Marx's theory ... The sociological treatment of historical and moral problems, which Comte and after him, Spencer and [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]], had discussed and mapped, became a precise and concrete study only when the attack of militant Marxism made its conclusions a burning issue, and so made the search for evidence more zealous and the attention to method more intense.|[[Isaiah Berlin]] ''Karl Marx'' 1967|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |year=1967 |title=Karl Marx |publisher=Time Inc Book Division |location=New York |pages=13–14, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1830s, Karl Marx was part of the [[Young Hegelians]] in [[Berlin]], which discussed and wrote about the legacy of the philosopher, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) (whose seminal tome, ''[[Science of Logic]]'' was published in 1816). Although, at first sympathetic with the groups strategy of attacking Christianity to undermine the Prussian establishment, he later formed divergent ideas and broke with the Young Hegelians, attacking their views in works such as ''[[The German Ideology]]''.  Witnessing the struggles of the laborers during the [[Industrial Revolution]], Marx concluded that religion (or the "ideal") is not the basis of the establishment's power, but rather ownership of capital (or the "material")- processes that employ technologies, land, money and especially human labor-power to create surplus-value&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1967. ''Capital: A critical analysis of capitalist production''. ed. F. Engels. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; — lie at the heart of the establishment's power. This "stood Hegel on his head" as he theorized that, at its core, the engine of history and the structure of society was fundamentally material rather than ideal. He theorized that both the realm of cultural production and political power created ideologies that perpetuated the oppression of the working class and the concentration of wealth within the capitalist class: the owners of the means of production. Marx predicted that the capitalist class would feel compelled to reduce wages or replace laborers with technology, which would ultimately increase wealth among the capitalists. However, as the workers were also the primary consumers of the goods produced, reducing their wages would result in an inevitable collapse in capitalism as a mode of economic production.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

====Social Darwinism====

[[File:Spencer-detail.png|upright|thumb|right|[[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903)]]
[[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), the English philosopher, was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the [[Darwinian revolution]] in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] published anything on the subject.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal

In the 1900 edition of the journal ''[[International Monthly]]'',&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; [[Franklin H. Giddings]] (1855–1931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that "first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest"&lt;ref name="http://www.jstor.org/stable/986404"/&gt; in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States, [[Charles Horton Cooley]], stated in a 1920 article that ''The Study of Sociology'' "probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since."&lt;ref name="http://www.jstor.org/stable/986404"/&gt; It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th-century thinkers, including [[Émile Durkheim]], defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim’s ''[[Division of Labour in Society]]'' is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively.&lt;ref name="Émile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1995.tb00465.x | last1 = Perrin | first1 = Robert G. | year = 1995| title = Émile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 791–808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a notable [[biologist]], Spencer coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]" as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a [[laissez-faire]] style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the [[United States]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=De5sdTFRt5YC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=commager+the+american+mind|title= The American mind: an interpretation of American thought and character since 1880s|isbn= 978-0-300-00046-7|author1= Commager, Henry Steele|date= 1959-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.&lt;ref name="Collins1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Randall |title=Theoretical Sociology |year=1988 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |isbn=978-0-15-591474-2 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary of Spencer, [[Lester Frank Ward]] is often described as a father of American sociology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=W0050|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana - Ward, Lester F.|author=|date=|website=www.brown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as the first president of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1905 and served as such until 1907. He published ''Dynamic Sociology'' in 1883; ''Outlines of Sociology'' in 1898; ''Pure Sociology'' in 1903; and ''Applied Sociology'' in 1906. Also in 1906, at the age of 65 he was appointed to professor of sociology at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635784/Lester-Frank-Ward|title=Lester Frank Ward - American sociologist|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ward as president of the American Sociological Association was [[William Graham Sumner]] from 1908 to 1909. He also held the first professorship of sociology at [[Yale College]], and in 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course entitled "sociology" in the English-speaking world. His course focused predominantly on the work of [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. He was ideologically opposed to the sociology of Ward as he felt that society could not be steered by scientific intervention, and famously stated the alternative to "survival of the fittest" was the "survival of the unfittest." However, he also opposed the grand theorizing of Spencer. During the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States, social Darwinism became a contentious topic and Sumner and his course at [[Yale College]] was criticized for including Spencerian ideas. This almost led to Sumner's expulsion from teaching. His most famous sociological works are ''What Social Classes Owe to Each Other'' in 1883 and ''Folkways: a study of the sociological importance of usages, manners, customs, mores, and morals'' in 1906.

===Other precursors===
Many other philosophers and academics were influential in the development of sociology, not least the Enlightenment theorists of [[social contract]], and historians such as [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816). For his theory on [[social interaction]], Ferguson has himself been described as "the father of modern sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = William Bradford | last = Willcox |author2=Arnstein, Walter L. | edition=Sixth Edition, 1992 | title = The Age of Aristocracy, 1688 to 1830 | others=Volume III of A History of England, edited by Lacey Baldwin Smith | page = 133 | location=[[Lexington, MA]] | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-669-24459-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early works to appropriate the term 'sociology' included ''A Treatise on Sociology, Theoretical and Practical'' by the North American lawyer Henry Hughes and ''Sociology for the South, or the Failure of Free Society''&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/fitzhughsoc/fitzhugh.html Sociology For The South Or The Failure of Free Society]&lt;/ref&gt; by the American lawyer [[George Fitzhugh]]. Both books were published in 1854, in the context of the debate over slavery in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] US. [[Harriet Martineau]], a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] social theorist and the English translator of many of Comte's works, has been cited as the first female sociologist.

Various other early social historians and economists have gained recognition as classical sociologists, including [[Robert Michels]] (1876–1936), [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (1805–1859), [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923) and [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from [[political philosophy]] in the attempt to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or [[dialectic]]al, rather than purely moral, [[normative]] or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.

== Foundation of the academic discipline ==

Formal institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline began when Emile Durkheim founded the first French department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]''.

A course entitled "sociology" was taught for the first time in the United States in 1875 by [[William Graham Sumner]], drawing upon the thought of Comte and [[Herbert Spencer]] rather than the work of Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O119-Sociology.html|title=sociology facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about sociology|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the [[University of Kansas]], lectured by [[Frank Blackmar]]. The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.edu/%7Esocdept/about/ About Us - Sociology department],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.ku.edu/2005/June/June15/sociology.shtml KU News Release],&lt;/ref&gt; and the first full-fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Albion W. Small]] (1854–1926), who in 1895 founded the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJS/home.html|title=University of Chicago Press - Cookie absent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology. [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Charles H. Cooley]] were influential in the development of [[symbolic interactionism]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]] at the University of Chicago, while [[Lester Ward]] emphasized the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of ''Dynamic Sociology'' in 1883.

The University of Chicago developed the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even gave them a hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, a third of all sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago was very good at not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class room than studying the society around them.  This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual’s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small was the head of the sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the ''American Journal of Sociology''.  Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program’s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend.

In 1920 a department was set up in [[Poland]] by [[Florian Znaniecki]] (1882–1958). William I. Thomas was an early graduate from the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago. He built upon his education and his work changed sociology in many ways. In 1918, William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki gave the world the publication of "The Polish Peasant" in Europe and America. This publication combined sociological theory with in depth experiential research and thus launching methodical sociological research as a whole. This changed sociologist’s methods and enabled them to see new patterns and connect new theories. This publication also gave sociologists a new way to found their research and prove it on a new level. All their research would be more solid, and harder for society to not pay attention to it. In 1920, Znaniecki developed a sociology department in Poland to expand research and teachings there.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

With the lack of sociological theory being taught at the University of Chicago paired with the new foundations of statistical methods, the student’s ability to make any real predictions was nonexistent. This was a major factor in the downfall of the Chicago school.&lt;ref name="Cort" /&gt;

The first sociology department in the United Kingdom was founded at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] by Max Weber, who had established a new [[antipositivist]] sociology.  The "Institute for Social Research" at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the "Frankfurt School" of critical theory) was founded in 1923.[29] Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after WW2, influencing literary theory and the "Birmingham School" of cultural studies.

The University of Frankfurt’s advances along with the close proximity to the research institute for sociology made Germany a powerful force in leading sociology at that time. In 1918, Frankfurt received the funding to create sociology’s first department chair. The Germany’s groundbreaking work influenced its government to add the position of Minister of Culture to advance the country as a whole. The remarkable collection of men who were contributing to the sociology department at Frankfurt were soon getting worldwide attention and began being referred to as the “Frankfurt school.” Here they studied new perspectives of Marx theories, and went into depth of the works of Weber and Freud. Most of this men would soon be forced out of Germany by the Nazis and arrive in America, influencing social research there. This forced relocation of sociologists enabled sociology in America to bring up to the standards of European studies of sociology by planting some of Europe’s greatest sociologists in America.&lt;ref name=Lud&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedeburg |first=Ludwig |title=History of the Institute of Social Research |url=http://www.ifs.uni-frankfurt.de/english/history.htm |accessdate=March 7, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902023351/http://www.ifs.uni-frankfurt.de/english/history.htm |archivedate=September 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix Weil was one of the students who received their doctorate on the concept of socialization from the University of Frankfurt.  He, along with Max Horkheimer and Kurt Albert Gerlach, developed the Institute of Social Research and it was established in 1923. Kurt Albert Gerlach would serve as the institute’s first director. Their goal in creating the institute was to produce a place that people could discover and be informed of social life as a whole. Weil, Horkheimer, and Gerlach wanted to focus on interactions between economics, politics, legal matters, as well as scholarly interactions in the community and society. The main research that got the institute known was its revival of scientific Marxism. Many benefactors contributed money, supplies, and buildings to keep this area of research going. When Gerlach, became ill and had to step down as director, Max Horkheimer took his place. He encouraged the students of the institute to question everything they studied. If the students studied a theory, he not only wanted them to discover its truth themselves, but also to discover how, and why it is true and the theories relation to society. The National Socialist regime exiled many of the members of the Institute of Social Research. The regime also forced many students and staff from the entire Frankfurt University, and most fled to America. Many people forced from the institute also left the war path, but unlike the university, the institute lost too many people and was forced to close. In 1950, the institute was reopened as a private establishment. From this point on the Institute of Social Research would have a close connection to sociology studies in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lud" /&gt;

International cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when [[René Worms]] (1869–1926) founded the small ''Institut International de Sociologie'', eclipsed by much larger [[International Sociological Association]] from 1949. In 1905 the [[American Sociological Association]], the world's largest [[Voluntary association|association]] of professional sociologists, was founded, and Lester F. Ward was selected to serve as the first President of the new society.

=== The canon: Durkheim, Marx, Weber ===
[[File:Vilfredo Pareto 1870s2.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Vilfredo Pareto]]]]
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are typically cited as the three principal architects of modern social science. The sociological "canon of classics" with Durkheim and Weber at the top owes in part to [[Talcott Parsons]], who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences.&lt;ref name="camic"&gt;Camic, Charles. 1992. "Reputation and Predecessor Selection: Parsons and the Institutionalists", American Sociological Review, Vol. 57, No. 4 (Aug., 1992), pp. 421–445&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons' ''[[Action theory (sociology)|Structure of Social Action]]'' (1937) consolidated the American sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. In Parsons' canon, however, [[Vilfredo Pareto]] holds greater significance than either Marx or Simmel. His canon was guided by a desire to "unify the divergent [[social theory|theoretical traditions]] in sociology behind a single theoretical scheme, one that could in fact be justified by purely scientific developments in the discipline during the previous half century."&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;Levine, Donald.  1991.  "Simmel and Parsons Reconsidered". The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 96, No. 5 (Mar., 1991), pp. 1097–1116&lt;/ref&gt; While the secondary role Marx plays in early American sociology may be attributed to Parsons,&lt;ref name="levine"/&gt; as well as to broader political trends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dominance of [[Marxism]] in European sociological thought had long since secured the rank of Marx alongside Durkheim and Weber as one of the three "classical" sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Ken. 2006 (2nd ed.) "Marx, Durkheim, Weber", Sage, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th century: from positivism to antipositivism ==
The methodological approach toward sociology by early theorists was to treat the discipline in broadly the same manner as [[natural science]]. An emphasis on [[empiricism]] and the [[scientific method]] was sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields such as [[philosophy]].
This perspective, termed positivism, was first developed by theorist Auguste Comte. Positivism was founded on the theory that the only true, factual knowledge is scientific knowledge. Comte had very vigorous guidelines for a theory to be considered positivism. He thought that this authentic knowledge can only be derived from positive confirmation of theories through strict continuously tested methods, that are not only scientifically but also quantitatively based.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] was a major proponent of theoretically grounded empirical research,&lt;ref name="Classical Statements10"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |page=94|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking correlations to reveal structural laws, or "[[social fact]]s".  Durkheim proved that concepts that had been attributed to the individual were actually socially determined. These occurrences are things such as suicide, crime, moral outrage, a person’s personality, time, space, and God. He brought to light that society had influence on all aspects of a person, far more than had been previously believed.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; For him, sociology could be described as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim endeavoured to apply sociological findings in the pursuit of political reform and social [[solidarity]].  Today, scholarly accounts of Durkheim's positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and oversimplification: Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in the same way as noble science, whereas Durkheim acknowledged in greater detail the fundamental [[epistemological]] limitations.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fish, Jonathan S 2005"&gt;Fish, Jonathan S. 2005. 'Defending the Durkheimian Tradition. Religion, Emotion and Morality' Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions against positivism began when German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |page=169 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]]'s methodology borrowed from Hegel [[dialectic]]ism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of "facts" with the elimination of illusions.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements2"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=202–203 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Marx nonetheless endeavoured to produce a ''science of society'' grounded in the [[economic determinism]] of [[historical materialism]].&lt;ref name="Classical Statements2"/&gt; Other philosophers, including [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) and [[Heinrich Rickert]] (1863–1936) argued that the natural world differs from the [[Social reality|social world]] because of those unique aspects of human society (meanings, signs, and so on) which inform human cultures.

At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological [[antipositivism]], proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], symbols, and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships&amp;mdash;especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] presented [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]] (sometimes translated as ''community'' and ''society'') as the two [[normal type]]s of human association, a distinction that was developed further by [[Max Weber]]. Tönnies drew a sharp line between the realm of conceptuality and the reality of [[social action]]: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ('pure' sociology), whereas the second empirically and in an inductive way ('applied' sociology). Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the [[Verstehen]] (or 'interpretative') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point-of-view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[Existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; His sociology engaged in a [[neo-Kantian]] critique of the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Italian context, French positivism and English evolutionism of the nineteenth century are opposed to tradition. The results that come from science are  criticized by philosophical idealism. There is an alliance between philosophy and theology. Above all in relation to the foundation of sociology. Sociology is pseudo-conceptual science, as the philosopher Benedetto Croce notes. Its revolutionary force breaks against speculative philosophy. Authors such as Vilfredo Pareto, Roberto Ardigò and many others come into contact with idealism and historicism. Their claims of validity clash with the speculative revision (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''La scienza e l’oggetto. Autocritica del sapere strategico'', Milan, Franco Angeli, 2010, II Part, {{ISBN|978-88-568-2487-2}}).
These results affect the history of sociology. This develops in antithetical direction to the history of science in Europe. The failure to link the Italian story with the epistemological history must be recorded, which instead characterizes the history of disciplines such as physics, biology, etc. The history of sociology develops in the twentieth century as a history of sociological thought, history of intellectuals, history of the civilization, and not as history of science. The historicist matrix remains in modern thought. Sociology becomes an academic science (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Una epistemologia senza storia'', Rome, New Culture, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-6812-222-5}}).

== 20th century: critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revival ==
In the early 20th century, sociology expanded in the U.S., including developments in both [[macrosociology]], concerned with the [[evolution of societies]], and [[microsociology]], concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] social psychology of [[George Herbert Mead]] (1863–1931), [[Herbert Blumer]] (1900–1987) and, later, the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]], sociologists developed [[symbolic interactionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject|title=Robert Throop and Lloyd Gordon Ward: Mead Project 2.0|author=|date=|website=www.brocku.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, [[György Lukács]] released ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923), while a number of works by Durkheim and Weber were published posthumously. In the 1930s, [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) developed [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]], integrating the study of social order with the structural and voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro factors, while placing the discussion within a higher explanatory context of [[systems theory#Sociology and Sociocybernetics|system theory]] and [[cybernetics]]. In Austria and later the U.S., [[Alfred Schütz]] (1899–1959) developed social [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which would later inform [[social constructionism]]. During the same period members of the [[Frankfurt school]], such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (1903–1969) and [[Max Horkheimer]] (1895–1973), developed [[critical theory]], integrating the historical materialistic elements of Marxism with the insights of Weber, Freud and [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]—in theory, if not always in name—often characterizing capitalist modernity as a move away from the central tenets of the Enlightenment.

During the [[Interwar period]], sociology was undermined by totalitarian governments for reasons of ostensible political control. After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], sociology was gradually "politicized, Bolshevisized and eventually, Stalinized" until it virtually [[sociology in the Soviet Union|ceased to exist]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=eaw8-9&gt;Elizabeth Ann Weinberg, ''The Development of Sociology in the Soviet Union'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7100-7876-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RXwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;vq=sociology+disappeared&amp;dq=sociology+%22Soviet+Union%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.8-9]&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the discipline [[sociology in China|was banned]] with [[semiotics]], [[comparative linguistics]] and [[cybernetics]] as "[[Bourgeois pseudoscience]]" in 1952, not to return until 1979.&lt;ref name=wu&gt;Xiaogang Wu, ''[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/intl_0509.html Between Public and Professional: Chinese Sociology and the Construction of a Harmonious Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111425/http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/intl_0509.html |date=2015-04-02 }}'', ASA Footnotes, May–June 2009 Issue • Volume 37 • Issue 5&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, however, sociology was also undermined by conservative universities in the West. This was due, in part, to perceptions of the subject as possessing an inherent tendency, through its own aims and remit, toward [[social liberalism|liberal]] or [[left wing]] thought. Given that the subject was founded by structural functionalists; concerned with organic cohesion and social solidarity, this view was somewhat groundless (though it was Parsons who had introduced Durkheim to American audiences, and his interpretation has been criticized for a latent conservatism).&lt;ref name="Fish, Jonathan S 2005"/&gt;

In the mid-20th century there was a general—but not universal—trend for U.S.-American sociology to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence at that time of action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. [[Robert K. Merton]] released his ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] founded [[Columbia University]]'s [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]], where he exerted a tremendous influence over the techniques and the organization of [[social research]]. His many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the "founder of modern empirical sociology".&lt;ref name="Hynek"&gt;Jeábek, Hynek. ''Paul Lazarsfeld — The Founder of Modern Empirical Sociology: A Research Biography.'' International Journal of Public Opinion Research 13:229-244 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lazarsfeld made great strides in [[statistical survey]] analysis, panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis.&lt;ref name="Hynek"/&gt;  He is also considered a co-founder of [[mathematical sociology]]. Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident.&lt;ref name="Hynek"/&gt;

In 1959, [[Erving Goffman]] published ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'' and introduced the theory of dramaturgical analysis which asserts that all individuals aim to create a specific impression of themselves in the minds of other people. [[C. Wright Mills]] presented ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]'', encouraging humanistic discourse and a rejection of abstracted empiricism and grand theory. Parallel with the rise of various [[social movement]]s in the 1960s, particularly in Britain, the [[cultural turn]] saw a rise in [[conflict theories]] emphasizing social struggle, such as [[neo-Marxism]] and [[second-wave feminism]].&lt;ref name="Holborn"&gt;Haralambos &amp; Holborn. 'Sociology: Themes and perspectives' (2004) 6th ed, Collins Educational. {{ISBN|978-0-00-715447-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] and [[Ralph Miliband]] presented pioneering theory on class conflict and industrialized nation states. The [[sociology of religion]] saw a renaissance in the decade with new debates on [[secularization|secularisation thesis]], globalization, and the very definition of religious practise. Theorists such as [[Gerhard Lenski|Lenski]] and [[John Milton Yinger|Yinger]] formulated 'functional' definitions of religion; enquiring as to what a religion ''does'' rather than what ''it is'' in familiar terms. Thus, various new social institutions and movements could be examined for their religious role. Marxist theorists continued to scrutinize consumerism and capitalist ideology in analogous terms. [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s ''Selections from the [[Prison Notebooks]]'' [1929–1935] was finally published in English during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/books/archive/prison_notebooks.html|title=Books|author=|date=|website=lwbooks.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s so-called [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theory, drawing upon [[structuralism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as much as classical social science, made a considerable impact on frames of sociological enquiry.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Often understood simply as a cultural style 'after-[[Modernism]]' marked by [[intertextuality]], [[pastiche]] and [[irony]], sociological analyses of postmodernity have presented a distinct ''era'' relating to (1) the dissolution of [[metanarrative]]s (particularly in the work of [[Lyotard]]), and (2) [[commodity fetishism]] and the 'mirroring' of identity with consumption in late capitalist society ([[Guy Debord|Debord]]; [[Baudrillard]]; [[Fredric Jameson|Jameson]]).&lt;ref&gt;'Cultural Studies: Theory and Practise'. By: Barker, Chris. Sage Publications, 2005. p446.&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism has also been associated with the rejection of enlightenment conceptions of the human subject by thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and, to a lesser extent, in [[Louis Althusser]]'s attempt to reconcile Marxism with [[anti-humanism]]. Most theorists associated with the movement actively refused the label, preferring to accept postmodernity as a historical phenomenon rather than a method of analysis, if at all. Nevertheless, self-consciously postmodern pieces continue to emerge within the social and political sciences in general.

In the 1980s, theorists outside France tended to focus on [[globalization]], [[communication]], and [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] in terms of a 'second' phase of modernity, rather than a distinct new era ''per se''. [[Jürgen Habermas]] established [[communicative action]] as a reaction to postmodern challenges to the discourse of modernity, informed both by [[critical theory]] and [[American pragmatism]]. Fellow German sociologist, [[Ulrich Beck]], presented ''The [[Risk Society]]'' (1992) as an account of the manner in which the modern nation state has become organized. In Britain, [[Anthony Giddens]] set out to reconcile recurrent theoretical dichotomies through [[structuration theory]]. During the 1990s, Giddens developed work on the challenges of "high modernity", as well as a new '[[Third Way (centrism)|third way]]' politics that would greatly influence [[New Labour]] in U.K. and the [[Clinton administration]] in the U.S. Leading Polish sociologist, [[Zygmunt Bauman]], wrote extensively on the concepts of modernity and postmodernity, particularly with regard to [[the Holocaust]] and [[consumerism]] as historical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, Zygmunt. ''Postmodernity and its discontents.'' New York: New York University Press. 1997. {{ISBN|0-7456-1791-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Pierre Bourdieu]] gained significant critical acclaim for his continued work on [[cultural capital]],&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2002&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,640396,00.html Bourdieu ''The Guardian'' obituary, Douglas Johnson 28 January 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; certain French sociologists, particularly [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Michel Maffesoli]], were criticised for perceived [[obfuscation]] and [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Christopher.

Functionalist systems theorists such as [[Niklas Luhmann]] remained dominant forces in sociology up to the end of the century. In 1994, [[Robert K. Merton]] won the [[National Medal of Science]] for his contributions to the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociology of science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|title=Columbia News ::: Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K.

By: Gartrell, C. David, Gartrell, John W., British Journal of Sociology, 00071315, Dec2002, Vol. 53, Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline's two most [[Impact factor|widely cited]] American journals, the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' and the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'', primarily publish research in the positivist tradition, with ASR exhibiting greater diversity (the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'', on the other hand, publishes primarily non-positivist articles).&lt;ref name="pos_bjs"/&gt;  The twentieth century saw improvements to the quantitative methodologies employed in sociology.  The development of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] that follow the same population over the course of years or decades enabled researchers to study long-term phenomena and increased the researchers' ability to infer [[causality]]. The increase in the size of data sets produced by the new survey methods was followed by the invention of new statistical techniques for analyzing this data. Analysis of this sort is usually performed with statistical software packages such as [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[Stata]], or [[SPSS]].

[[Social network]] analysis is an example of a new paradigm in the positivist tradition. The influence of social network analysis is pervasive in many sociological sub fields such as [[economic sociology]] (see the work of [[J. Clyde Mitchell]], [[Harrison White]], or [[Mark Granovetter]], for example), [[organizational behavior]], [[historical sociology]], [[political sociology]], or the [[sociology of education]]. There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of [[C. Wright Mills]], and his studies of the [[Power Elite]] in the United States of America, according to [[Stanley Aronowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logosjournal.com/aronowitz.htm |title=Stanley Aronowitz |publisher=Logosjournal.com |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kiribati]] is a source country for girls subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]], specifically [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|commercial sexual exploitation]]. Crew members on Korean and perhaps other foreign fishing vessels in Kiribati or in its territorial waters exploit [[Prostitution of children|prostituted children]] aboard their ships. Some girls are also forced into [[prostitution]] in bars frequented by crew members. Local I-Kiribati, sometimes family members but also taxi drivers and owners of small boats, knowingly facilitate trafficking by transporting underage girls to the boats for the purposes of prostitution. The girls generally received cash, food, or goods in exchange for [[sexual services]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[Government of Kiribati]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, the government has not proactively identified victims, investigated or prosecuted suspected [[human trafficker|trafficking offenders]], or educated the public on the dangers of human trafficking; therefore, Kiribati is placed on Tier 2 Watch List. While the government acknowledges that the prostitution of girls is a problem in Kiribati, it has taken no steps to protect victims of [[sex trafficking]], investigate and [[prosecution|prosecute]] foreign crewmen for the commercial [[sexual exploitation]] of children within its territory, proactively identify child victims of sex trafficking, or educate the public about the dangers of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Kiribati". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The [[Government of Kiribati]] made no discernible [[law enforcement]] efforts to combat human trafficking during the reporting period. No trafficking offenders were investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or convicted in the past year, although information about particular victims in trafficking situations was available. Kiribati’s 2005 comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation criminalizes all forms of trafficking, but does not include specific definitions of trafficking for [[Labor trafficking|labor]] or sexual exploitation. The law prescribes sufficiently stringent punishments of up to 15 years’ [[imprisonment]], which are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as [[rape]]. The 2005 law also provides protection and rights for victims of trafficking. The lack of a legal definition of [[sex]] or labor trafficking which identifies the essential elements of a trafficking crime prevents [[law enforcement officer]]s from rescuing victims or arresting trafficking offenders on trafficking charges. The government provided no training to law enforcement and [[Judiciary of Kiribati|court personnel]] on identifying trafficking victims and prosecuting trafficking offenders. As members of Pacific Island international law enforcement groups, mechanisms exist to allow the country to work in partnership with other governments on trafficking cases, though these have not been used. There is no evidence of officials’ [[complicity]] in human trafficking activity.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Government of Kiribati did not make discernible progress in ensuring trafficking victims’ access to protective services during the year. [[Law enforcement]] and [[social services]] personnel do not have a formal system of proactively identifying victims of trafficking among high-risk persons with whom they come in contact; they identified no victims during the reporting period. The government does not have any formal arrangements or mechanisms in place to provide trafficking victims with access to [[legal services|legal]], [[health care|medical]], or [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|psychological services]], and no plans to develop the capacity to do so. The Kiribati government has not developed or implemented a referral process to transfer victims detained, [[arrest]]ed, or placed in [[protective custody]] by law enforcement authorities to institutions that provide short or long-term care. It has a limited capacity to protect victims of trafficking or victims of other crimes, and relies on [[NGO]]'s and international organizations to provide most victim services. Kiribati does not have victim care facilities specifically to care for trafficking victims. The law in Kiribati generally protects rights of victims of [[violent crime]], which would include victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made no discernible efforts to prevent trafficking or raise public awareness of the dangers of trafficking. An inter-agency [[Transnational efforts to prevent human trafficking|transnational crime task force]] made up of law enforcement officials from the [[police]], the Attorney General’s office, and the [[immigration]], [[customs]], and finance ministries met monthly and included trafficking in persons as one of its responsibilities. The government did not provide any specialized training for government or law enforcement officials on how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking. It took no action to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex]] acts during the reporting period. There is no evidence that citizens of Kiribati are involved in international [[sex tourism]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''[[The Bahamas]]''' is a destination country for men and some [[trafficking in women|women]] from [[Haiti]] and other [[Caribbean Countries|Caribbean countries]] who are subjected to [[trafficking in persons]], specifically [[forced labor]], and, to a lesser extent, women from [[Human trafficking in Jamaica|Jamaica]] and other countries who are in [[forced prostitution]]. Haitian trafficking victims are most likely to [[human migration|migrate]] to The Bahamas voluntarily, but subsequently be subjected to forced labor in agriculture, [[domestic servant|domestic service]], or forced prostitution. Some employers coerce [[migrant worker]]s – legal and [[undocumented immigrant|illegal]] – to work longer hours, at lower pay, and in conditions not permitted under local labor law by changing the terms of employment contracts, withholding travel documents, refusing transportation back home, threatening to withdraw the employer-specific and employer-held permits, or threatening to have the employee [[deported]] through other means. Traffickers reportedly lure Jamaican and other foreign women to the Bahamas with offers of employment in the tourism and entertainment fields and subject the women to forced prostitution after their arrival. The Ministry of Education is investigating allegations that some high school girls in [[Eleuthera]] may be involved in a [[prostitution ring]]. This report is the only indication that Bahamian citizens may be victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"The Bahamas". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. government, the [[Government of the Bahamas]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the year, the government began some investigations into suspected cases of trafficking but did not proactively identify victims among vulnerable populations, such as women and [[child prostitution|girls engaged in prostitution]], and it continued to deport undocumented migrants without first determining whether they may be victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 1"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of The Bahamas demonstrated minimal anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. It continued to face relevant resource and capacity constraints, and confronted multiple competing law enforcement priorities. All forms of trafficking are prohibited through the Trafficking in Persons Prevention and Suppression Act of 2008. Penalties prescribed by the Act for trafficking in persons offenses range from three years to life imprisonment, and are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The government did not arrest or prosecute any trafficking offenders, despite reports of the presence of trafficking victims in The Bahamas since at least 2005. During the reporting period, the government began investigating one suspected trafficking case in cooperation with another government. The Ministry of Education formed a [[task force]] to investigate allegations of a student prostitution ring at a high school in Eleuthera. [[NGO]]s, in partnership with the Bahamian government, provided immigration, labor, social services, and [[Royal Bahamas Police Force|law enforcement personnel]] with anti-trafficking training. Historically, government personnel have conflated human trafficking and [[human smuggling]], leading to the routine deportation of foreigners in vulnerable populations without determining whether they may be trafficking victims. Although the practice continued to some extent, automatic deportations have decreased as official awareness of trafficking as a form of transnational crime has increased. Anecdotal reports indicate that during 2009 some [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force|military personnel]] may have been involved in assisting with the illegal entry of trafficking victims into the country. There is no evidence of government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The Bahamian government showed minimal efforts to protect victims of trafficking over the last year. Although the Ministry of Labor and Social Development’s Bureau of Women’s Affairs became the lead agency for anti-trafficking training and assistance to victims, the government continued to rely on NGOs and international organizations to identify and provide most services to victims. No specialized shelters for trafficking victims were available in The Bahamas. Shelter services, counseling, and law enforcement referrals were accessible to women and child trafficking victims through the Crisis Centre, which focuses on assisting victims of [[sexual abuse|sexual]] and [[domestic abuse]]. The [[Red Cross]], the [[Salvation Army]], and local church groups which provide assistance to illegal migrants could assist foreign men who may be victims of labor trafficking. Assistance providers did not knowingly assist any trafficking victims during the reporting period. Officials followed no formal procedures for screening or referring victims to service providers. The government developed but has not yet implemented a plan to refer victims to the Bureau of Women’s Affairs, the Crisis Centre, and the Eugene Dupuch Law School. During the year, the government arranged for the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) to conduct victim assistance training for immigration, labor, [[social services]], law enforcement and NGO participants. The [[Minister (government)|ministers]] responsible for [[Ministry of National Security (Bahamas)|national security]] and social services, however, did not develop or implement a plan to provide appropriate services to victims in cooperation with NGOs, as required by the anti-trafficking law of 2008. Although the government ensured that victims brought to its attention were not inappropriately penalized for immigration violations and any unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, some victims were not properly identified. No formal procedures exist that allow law enforcement officers time to investigate whether foreign women found engaging in prostitution may be victims of [[sex trafficking]] before the law requires that they be deported. As more immigration and police officers received training in trafficking issues throughout the year, however, the number of officers who first attempted to determine whether foreign women found engaging in prostitution could be victims of trafficking before considering them eligible for deportation increased. The Bahamas’ law encourages victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders, and includes provisions for victims’ [[immunity from prosecution]], the protection of victims and witnesses with special considerations for the age and extent of [[psychological trauma|trauma]] suffered by the victim, and relief from the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution regardless of their participation in the investigation or prosecution of their traffickers. Under this law, traffickers are required to [[restitution|financially compensate]] their victims.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government demonstrated some efforts to prevent trafficking over the reporting period. The government participated in information and education campaigns conducted in partnership with organizations such as IOM. An ad hoc governmental working group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Immigration, the Ministry of Labor and Social Development’s Bureau of Women’s Affairs, and NGO representatives met periodically to address and coordinate trafficking issues among the various government ministries. This group shifted its focus from immigration enforcement to an emphasis on victim outreach and punishment of perpetrators over the last year. To address the vulnerability of some migrant workers to labor exploitation, the government expedited the processing of immigration claims and granted citizenship to certain long-time residents. The government made no visible effort to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex]] acts.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The '''IT interaction model''' is a [[holistic]] view of [[Management Information Systems]] in the context of the organization. According to [[Mark S. Silver]], the model addresses the interaction of an information system's features with five elements of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

#Its external environment
#Its strategy
#Its structure and culture
#Its business processes
#Its IT infrastructure.

The model considers the consequences of this interaction for system use, for organizational performance, for the organization's personnel, and for the firm's future flexibility. Moreover, the model relates various aspects of the interaction process to the phases of the development and implementation lifecycles.

Tools such as [[Porter's five forces]], value chain analysis and [[SWOT analysis]] can be used to analyze a company's strategy. Information flow diagrams can be used to analyze a company's business processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16309">'''The Imatra Society''' was a society of [[Finnish Americans|Finnish immigrants]] located in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The society was founded by John A. Koski, a building engineer. A preliminary meeting was held on December 6, 1890 and was followed by the founding meeting held on December 14, 1890.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Imatra Society Centennial Celebration Souvenir Journal'' (published in September 1991). p. 8-9, 30-32, 34, 36-40, 42, 45, 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the beginning: a workers' association==

[[File:John A. Koski.jpg|thumb|The chairman of Imatra Society, John A. Koski]]At the beginning the society operated as a workers' association with the name of '''Workers' Association Imatra'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women were participating in the activities from the beginning. As a first act in the business the society established its own [[brass band]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition a chorus and a theater group were formed.

In October 1892 the chairman Koski informed the meeting of the society with the following: "A failure of [[crop]]s has taken place in our native country [[Finland]] and a [[famine]] is imminent there, so it should be our duty, as we are in these better circumstances, to begin a kind of relief for the hunger."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This statement was unanimously approved.

In February 1903 the Society founded an Imatra League which was a Finnish American workers' union consisting of about 40 subdivisions across the United States and Canada. The total membership in the league was approximately 2,000 members. The league published its own newspaper called ''Työväen Album'' (the worker's album). The Imatra League was abolished in February 1917.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 10, 1906 Imatra Society began to publish its own newspaper, the ''New Yorkin Uutiset''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1906 Imatra Society consisted of the following units: a discussion club, a theater group, a women's club, a brass band, an entertainment committee, a library, and a reading-room.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Minutes of Imatra Society: minutes of 1906, 1907, 1910, 1911, 1921, 1923-1925, 1946, 1949, 1960, 1971, 1986, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 1907 the society began to collect money for the crofters of the estate Laukko in Finland "who had got into distress because they were fired out from their crofts."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Imatra Hall ==
[[File:Imatra Hall.jpg|thumb|The premises of Imatra Society was located in the address of 740 40th Street / Finlandia Street, Brooklyn, New York.]]The society built its own house for their activities and moved into it on November 1, 1908. Opening celebration was held on November 18 and 19. They also supplied to their new house a generator to produce electricity. "This was a historical event in the Finntown hill and caused a lot of talk in the neighbourhood since it was the Imatra Society that brought the first electric lights to the buck hill." (the [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] area).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This house, later called Imatra Hall, was most important place for the activities of the society and became well known and very popular among the Finnish people.

In December 1908 the society maintained a cause of temperance. No alcoholic drinks were allowed to be brought to the hall and nobody was allowed to appear under the influence of alcohol. Also smoking was absolutely forbidden in the restaurant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imatra Society established an employment agency by the proposal of Matti Kurikka. The agency began its operation on December 1, 1910. In a year the agency exchanged a job to about 50-60 men and 135 women. In service occupations for women there were much more open vacancies than there were applicants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1912 the agency exchanged 242 jobs.

In 1910 the theater group of the society performed several plays in Imatra Hall, such as Pimeyden valta (the power of darkness), Charleyn Tähti (the star of Charley), Jeppe Niilonpoika (Jeppe the Nilsson), Tukkijoella (on the log river), Roinilan Talossa (in the house of Roinila), and Viimeinen Ponnistus (the last effort). As special performances they performed Kristitty (the Christian) and Kun piiat ovat lakossa (when the hired girls are on strike).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Aid society and national society ==
In the annual meeting of the society on January 20, 1918 new clauses were made for the bylaw of the society such as: Clause 8 - The society tries to do its best to make Finnish people well known in the United States. Clause 9 - Officially the society is known as the Finnish Aid Society Imatra. Clause 22 - If the society dissolves or its operation becomes so weak that there is a fear for withdrawal of the society, do not move or sell the property of the society without a special permit from the Senate of Finland. This clause must not be changed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Originally the society was a workers' association, then it became an aid society, and in July 1921 it was named as Kansallisseura Imatra (National Society Imatra).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

May 13. 1923 the Imatra Society sends a group of seven people to [[Ellis Island]] to help the Finnish immigrants in the landing process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Visitors from Finland ==
Visitors from Finland, such as artists and others, have been an important part in the activities of the Imatra Hall. Many Finnish artists have performed a concert at Imatra Hall including such famous artists as: [[Uuno Klami]] on October 27, 1917, Alfred Tanner on May 29, 1924, [[Robert Kajanus]] on January 11, 1925, Lea Piltti on April 24, 1949, [[Tapio Rautavaara]] on October 22, 1959, Henry Theel on February 2, 1973, and [[Heimo Haitto]] on January 24, 1984.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other important persons who have visited in Imatra Hall include such as [[Paavo Nurmi]] on February 19, 1966, Anne Pohtamo on February 5, 1978,  the minister of education Kaarina Suonio with her delegation on September 13, 1982, the President of Finland [[Mauno Koivisto]] and Mrs. [[Tellervo Koivisto]] with their delegation on October 25, 1985, and the minister of education Christoffer Taxell with his delegation on April 10, 1988.

Imatra Society held a festival on December 8, 1935 to celebrate [[Sibelius]] on his birthday. The festival was a great success. Minister Järnefelt also attended it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For the first 50 years the society operated as a temperance society but now it decided to obtain a liquor licence and the bar of the Imatra Hall began its operation on August 27, 1941.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Juho Rissanen, a famous painter visited Imatra Hall on October 1, 1946 and was asking if the society would order a wallpainting from him for the Imatra Hall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On January 23, 1949 it is informed that Imatra society had sent to Finland a number of packages to institutions of poor people and to seven families and furthermore will be tried to help the poor and the orphans of Finland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A survey for the situation of the society in 1959: "As you remember this year began with very difficult circumstances since we were nearly losing our house to the tumult of the foreign stuff and occasionally it was very difficult for our own members to get in. It was really needed to take the matter with iron hands since a real cleaning had to be bring about. We succeeded rather well with this and already the peacefulness and order began to return…" Within the society there were many times discussed whether or not non Finns are accepted to become members of the Imatra Society. Now it was finally clear they are not accepted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Imatra Society began to arrange Miss Finlandia beauty contests. The first was held on October 6, 1968. Since 1970 [[Finnair]] donated to the winner a return flight ticket to Finland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Miss Finlandia 1986 was selected at Imatra Hall'', p. 6. New Yorkin Uutiset, October 14, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Miss Finlandia 1990 was selected at Imatra Hall,'' p. 9. Amerikan Uutiset, October 9, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of actors from the [[Finnish National Theatre|National Theater of Finland]] led by [[Sakari Jurkka]] performed a comedy Myöhästynyt hääyö (the delayed wedding night) at Imatra Hall on June 2, 1971. The performance was a great success and therefore it was rerun at Imatra Hall on June 27.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:The sign of the Finlandia Street.jpg|thumb|The 40th Street in front of the Imatra Hall was co-named as Finlandia Street]]

For the first 95 years the language of the society was [[Finnish (language)|Finnish]] but since the annual meeting on February 16, 1986 the language has been [[English (language)|English]] because there were non Finnish members in the society who did not understand Finnish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1987 the society was planning to establish an annual music festival at Imatra Hall where Finnish and American artists could perform. This was a big plan and therefore an inquiry was made to music festivals in Finland if they can come along and participate in organizing the festival in New York. Many of them responded favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Music festival in New York, a letter from SATA-HÄME SOI festival in Finland on October 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a concert at Imatra Hall on March 7, 1991 in which two police choruses performed, one was the west coast police chorus from Finland with 60 singers and the other the New York City police chorus with 40 male and female singers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 100 anniversary celebration of the society lasted for four days and was held on September 19–22, 1991. In connection with the celebration the 40th Street in front of the Imatra Hall was co-named as Finlandia Street. In the occasion the [[Finlandia Hymn|Finlandia hymn]] of Sibelius was performed by the Male Singers of Järvenpää from Finland. After this a flag procession with national costumes led the people to the Imatra Hall, where the main event was held.&lt;ref&gt;''Heikki Sarmanto to opening celebration Imatra´s anniversary is beginning,'' p. 4. New Yorkin Uutiset, December 25, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Finlandia Street Honors Imatra Hall Finnish Aid Society Celebrates Centennial'', p. 16-17. Home Reporter and Sunset News, February 8, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hundred years old Imatra Society celebrates in New York'', p. A4. Helsingin Sanomat, August 6, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imatra Society firar 100-årsjubileum med Finlandia Street dop'', p. 6. Norden, September 19, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Finland could learn from Finnish-Americans Keijo Korhonen thanked the immigrants in Imatra celebration…'', p. 9. Aamulehti, September 23, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imatra celebrated its 100 anniversary - New York got Finlandia Street'', p. 1 (front page). New Yorkin Uutiset, September 24, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imatra celebrated for four days'', p. 5-12.

Only a few years after the 100 anniversary celebration the Imatra Society had come into financial difficulties and in fall 1995 it was so much involved in debt that it was no more able to recover. Imatra Hall was sold and then Imatra Foundation was established with the remaining property. The Imatra Society was suppressed on April 26, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;''The rocking of Finnish cradle is ceasing in the United States - Imatra is dropping,'' p. 13. Satakunnan Kansa, December 14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joint custody''' is a form of [[child custody]] pursuant to which custody rights are awarded to both parents.&lt;ref name = "Arizona State Legislature 25-402"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|author= Arizona State Legislature|title=25-402|url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00402.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS|year=2011|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia Code Section 19-9-6"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Georgia Code Title 19.

* [[joint physical custody]]: the child's legal place of residence is recognized as the homes of both parents.
* [[joint legal custody]]: both parents share decision-making rights for important decisions affecting their child; and
In joint custody both parents are [[custodial parent]]s and neither parent is a [[non-custodial parent]], or, in other words, the child has two custodial parents.&lt;ref name="Georgia Code Section 19-9-6" /&gt;

==History of joint custody==
In [[England]], prior to the nineteenth century, [[common law]] considered children to be the property of their father.&lt;ref name="Joint Custody and Shared Parenting"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Folberg|title=Joint Custody and Shared Parenting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrrsVQWYPb8C&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=18 October 2011|date=23 August 1991|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-0-89862-481-6|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Divorce Decisions Workbook: A Planning and Action Guide to the Practical Side of Divorce"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margorie Louise Engel|author2=Diana Delhi Gould|title=Divorce Decisions Workbook: A Planning and Action Guide to the Practical Side of Divorce|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMiE_TtnmgsC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=19 October 2011|date=1 January 1992|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-019571-4|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the economic and social changes that occurred during the nineteenth century led to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the [[family]].&lt;ref name="Joint Custody and Shared Parenting"/&gt; [[Industrialization]] separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family.&lt;ref name="Joint Custody and Shared Parenting"/&gt; Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children.&lt;ref name="Joint Custody and Shared Parenting"/&gt; Important social changes such as [[women's suffrage]] and [[child development]] theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.&lt;ref name="Joint Custody and Shared Parenting" /&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Joint custody (United States)}}
In the [[United States]], many states recognize two forms of joint custody, which include [[joint physical custody]] and [[joint legal custody]].&lt;ref name="Georgia Code Section 19-9-6" /&gt;

In joint physical custody, the child's [[Domicile_(law)|legal residence]] is with both parents.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaplan PMBR|title=Kaplan PMBR FINALS: Family Law: Core Concepts and Key Questions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzevfXoDc4MC|accessdate=15 October 2011|date=7 July 2009|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|isbn=978-1-60714-098-6|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other custody cases, the custody court issues a parenting time schedule that defines the time the parent will spend with each child.&lt;ref name = "Oregon Laws"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|author= Oregon State Legislature|url=https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/107.102|title=ORS 107.102 Parenting plan|year=1997|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint physical custody does not necessarily result in an equal division of parenting time.&lt;ref name="al"/&gt;

In joint legal custody, both parents share decision-making rights with regard to matters that may have a significant impact on their children's lives, such as where a child should attend school, the choice of a primary care physician or therapist for the child, and non-emergency medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Basics of Custody &amp; Visitation Orders|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/17975.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents also have the ability right access to their children's records, such as educational records, health records, and other records.&lt;ref name="Marriage, Divorce, and Children's Adjustment"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Emery|title=Marriage, Divorce, and Children's Adjustment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_O6ZReudfQC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=2 November 2011|year=1999|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-7619-0252-2|pages=79–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Índios Caingangue.tif|thumb|right|290px|Caingangue Indians (1910).]]
The '''Kaingang''' (also spelled ''caingangue'' in [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] or ''kanhgág'' in the [[Kaingang language]]) people are a [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Native American]] [[ethnic group]] spread out over the three southern [[Brazil]]ian states of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and the southeastern state of  [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. They are also called Caingang and Aweikoma, though the Kaingang and Aweikoma ([[Xokleng people|Xokleng]]) are now considered separate groups. The Kaigang people were the original first inhabitants of the province of Misiones in Argentina. Their language and culture is quite distinct from the neighboring [[Guarani people|Guaraní]].

It has been stated that the Kaingang rarely live long in one place causing them to move a lot, but some sources, such as Juracilda Veiga&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Veiga|first=Juracilda|contribution=''Kaingang''|editor-first=William M|editor-last=Clements|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife|volume=4:North and South America|place=Westport/London|publisher=Greenwood Press|pages=193–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethnographic registers (José Francisco Tomás do Nascimento 1886, Telêmaco Borba 1908 etc.), indicate that Kaingang groups have a crucial relation with the land where they were born and their ancestors were buried.

The [[Kaingang language]] is a member of the [[Gê languages|Gê]] family.

==Copel agreement==
In November 2006 [[Brazil]]'s state-owned power company, [[Copel]], agreed to compensate the group 6.5 million dollars for operating a [[small hydro]] plant in the [[Apucaraninha Reservation]]. The company finally gave in to a settlement after the natives carried two barrels full of fuel into the plant's machine room and threatened to destroy the plant.

This is part of a larger trend of indigenous groups challenging energy projects according to [[Platts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5303">'''Khawaja Shaikh''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  خواجه شيخ}}}}) are prominent branch of [[Khawaja]] in [[South Asia]].

==Name==
'''Khawaja or Khwaja''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: خواجة khawājah, [[Persian language|Persian]]: خواجه pronounced khâje) is a title used in [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]], and [[Central Asia]]. Khawaja is a Persian word . It means lord or master.

Khawaja is also used as family name in South Asia. In South Asia they are chisti and the [[Chishti Order]] is explained in detail below: A number of Chishti family members are now living in different parts of South Asia especially in northern Punjab province of Pakistan and also in Indian state of Gujarat. They often bear the surname "Khwaja" and it is claimed that they are [[Sayyid]].

==Marriage customs==
'''Khawaja''' people usually marry within their own social affiliation that is '''"Sayyid or Khawaja"'''. They marry regardless of status wealth or class discrimination. Depending on circumstances a group (clan) may be as small as few hundred families and as large as few thousand families. For example, in the [[Bhat (surname)|Bhat]] clan's definition, their clan system is to be an entire group having very few sub-groups, whereas Khawajas are branched into a dozen or two sub-groups. For the Bhat clan (a Kashmiri clan) a group, by and large, usually shares an ancestral village in Kashmir as a reference point.
Marriage into a family other than Khawaja family and between first cousins was discouraged in the past. Marriages to men outside the social group, i.e. the Khawaja clan (e.g. marrying outside such as Muslim Punjabi families), is now welcomed and accepted by a few Khawaja families, although some community elders may still discourage it.
Although most of the departed Group of families who are out of the '''Family clan system''' ([[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradari]]) are not following the antique family traditions.

==People using the name Khawaja Sheikh==
Significant figures with the name, or using the title Khawaja in South Asia include:

*[[Moinuddin Chishti|Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty]], also known as Khwaja Gharib Nawaz was a [[Sunni]] Muslim and is the most famous [[Sufi]] saint of the [[Chishti Order]] of South Asia. He was born in 536 A.H./1141 CE, in [[Sajistan]], a famous city in [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] province (other accounts say [[Isfahan]]) in [[Persia]]. He is also known as "Sultan-e-Hind." Descendants of [[Sufi]] saints also use this as a [[pronominal]],  He was born in a [[sayed]] family of Iran.
*[[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] Khawaja Farid (Punjabi/Saraiki: خواجہ فرید)he was a great Sufi his shrine is located in the city of Pakpattan, otherwise Pākpattan Sharīf.
*[[Khwaja Nizamuddin]]
*[[Khwaja]] [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]](born 1173-died 1235) was a renowned Muslim Sufi mystic, saint and scholar of the Chishti Order from Delhi, India.
*[[Khwaja]] [[Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari]] was a prominent "Suhrawardiyya" Sufi saint and missionary. Bukhari was called Surkh-posh ("Red-clad") on account of the red mantle he often wore.
*[[Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi]]
*[[Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan]], 
*[[Maudood Chishti]], 
*[[Khwaja Wali Kirani]]
*[[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]]
*[[Khawaja Amar Saleem]]

== Khatris ==
When Khatri people from the western districts of the Punjab like [[Sargodha District|Sargodha]], [[Jhang District|Jhang]], [[Jhelum District|Jehlum]], [[Chakwal District|Chakwal]], [[Faisalabad District|Faisalabad]] accepted Islam called themselves [[Khawaja]] and adopted [[Shaikh]] as title. They are thus called ''Khawaja Sheikh''. Some of them have also adopted [[Mian (surname)|Mian]] as title. In recent years traders from a small town of [[Chiniot]], in the [[Chiniot District]], became prominent due to their contribution in the industries of [[Pakistan]]. These traders are known as [[Chiniotis]] or ''[[Chinioti Shaikh]]s''. The famous trading family of [[Sahgal]]s, Sahgal Khatris of [[Chakwal District|Chakwal]], are known simply as ''Punjabi Shaikh'' instead of ''Khawaja Shaikh''. They use Mian as title.  



The first censuses of the Punjab were conducted by [[Denzil Ibbetson]] and [[Edward Maclagan]] in 1883 and 1892. According to their reports, the Khawajas of Bhera in Shahpur, [[Sargodha District]]  were converted from Khatris, and those from [[Jhang]] were said to be converted from [[Arora]]. At [[Chiniot]] in [[Jhang District]], Majority of the Khawajas are Khatris, while some are Arora. They reported the following sections ([[gotra]]s) of Khatris from Chiniot:

''[[Adal (gotra)|Adal]], [[Behrara]] [[Maggun]] (or Maghoon), [[Sahgal]], Wihara, [[Talwar]], [[Puri]], [[Topra]]''.

The sections of Khawajas from Bhera were reported as follows:

''[[Vohra]], [[Sahgal]], [[Duggal]], [[Nanda]], [[Magun]], [[Mehndru]], [[Motali]].'' These are all [[Khatri]] sections.

The sections of Khawajas from Pindi Bhattian were reported as follows:
''[[Sahgal]] and [[Wadhaun]].'' These are all [[Khatri]] sections.

The '''LGBTI Health Summits''' are an opportunity for individuals working for the health of [[intersex]], [[transgender|trans]], [[bisexual]], [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] people to meet and share ideas. Attendees are mostly health activists, a mix of medical care professionals, alternative and complementary health providers, outreach workers, volunteers, and other interested parties.

The LGBTI Health Summits grew out of a resurgence in queer health movements which looked beyond a victim deficit based model of disease, using an asset based approach.

The LGBTI Health Summits grew out of the first [[Gay Men's Health Summit]], held in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Scarce. (2000). The second wave of the gay men's health movement: medicalization and cooptation as pitfalls of progress. ''J Gay Lesbian Med Assoc'' 4(1):3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The first National LGBTI Health Summit was held in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 2002. The second was held in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 2004. The third was held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The fourth was held in [[Chicago, Illinois]] August 14–18, 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The fifth summit with take place in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] July 16–19, 2011 .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationallgbtihealthsummit.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155358/http://www.nationallgbtihealthsummit.com/ |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Keralahistory}}
{{Dravidian}} 
The '''Malayali people''' or '''Keralite people''' (also spelt '''Malayalee''', [[Malayalam script]]: മലയാളി and കേരളീയർ) are a Dravidian [[ethnic group]] originating from the present-day state of [[Kerala]], India. They are identified as native speakers of the [[Malayalam]] language, which is classified as part of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian family of languages]]. As they primarily live in Kerala, the word '''Keralite''' is used as an alternative to Malayali.

According to the Indian census of 2011, there are approximately 33 million Malayalis in Kerala,&lt;ref name = "Censusedia"/&gt; making up 96.7% of the total population of the state. Malayali minorities are also found in the neighboring state of [[Tamil Nadu]], mainly in Kanyakumari district and also in other [[List of metropolitan areas in India|metropolitan areas]] of India. Over the course of the later half of the 20th century, significant Malayali communities have emerged in [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Persian Gulf]] countries, including  the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and [[Kuwait]], and to a lesser extent, other developed nations with a primarily immigrant background such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]]. As of 2013, there were an estimated 1.6 million ethnic Malayali [[expatriates]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="MOFAT"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|publication-place=South Korea|year=2015|accessdate=2014-03-30|url=http://www.index.go.kr/potal/main/EachDtlPageDetail.do?idx_cd=1682|title=재외동포현황 총계(2015)/Total number of overseas Koreans (2015)|ref=CITEREFMOFAT2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma]], Malayalam was the name of the place, before it became the name of the language spoken by the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varma|first=A.R. Rajaraja|title=Keralapanineeyam|publisher=D C Books|year=2005|location=Kottayam|page=|isbn=81-7130-672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Malayalam, the native language of Malayalis, has its origin from the words ''mala'' meaning mountain and ''alam'' meaning land or locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/|title=kerala.gov.in|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118031516/http://www.kerala.gov.in/|archivedate=18 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&amp;nbsp;– go to the website and click the link&amp;nbsp;– language &amp; literature to retrieve the information&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term ''Malayali'' refers to the people from the mountains who lived beyond the [[Western Ghats]], and Malayalam the language that was spoken there. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
The ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' mentions the ecclesiastical office of the [[Thachudaya Kaimal]] who is referred to as ''Manikkam Keralar'' (The Ruby King of Kerala), synonymous with the deity of the [[Koodalmanikyam]] temple.&lt;ref&gt;See Sahyadri Kanda Chapter 7 in Skanda Purana.  Rocher, Ludo (1986). The Puranas. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag. {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Madras 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term Keralar seem to precede the usage of the word Malayala/Malayalam.

==Geographic distribution and population==
{{See also|Kerala Gulf diaspora}}
According to the Indian census of 2001, there were 30,803,747 speakers of Malayalam in Kerala, making up 93.2% of the total number of Malayalam speakers in India, and 96.7% of the total population of the state. There were a further 701,673 (2.1% of the total number) in [[Karnataka]], 557,705 (1.7%) in [[Tamil Nadu]] and 406,358 (1.2%) in [[Maharashtra]].   The number of Malayalam speakers in [[Lakshadweep]] is 51,100, which is only 0.15% of the total number, but is as much as about 84% of the population of Lakshadweep. In all, Malayalis made up 3.22% of the total Indian population in 2001. Of the total 33,066,392 Malayalam speakers in India in 2001, 33,015,420 spoke the standard dialects, 19,643 spoke the ''Yerava'' dialect and 31,329 spoke non-standard regional variations like ''Eranadan''.&lt;ref name = "Censusedia"&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/data_on_language.html], ''censusindia.net''&lt;/ref&gt; As per the 1991 census data, 28.85% of all Malayalam speakers in India spoke a second language and 19.64% of the total knew three or more languages.

Just before independence, [[British Malaya|Malaya]] attracted a large number of Malaylis. Large numbers of Malayalis have settled in [[Bangalore]], [[Mangalore]], [[Delhi]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[Ahmedabad]], [[Pune]], and [[Chennai]] (Madras). A large number of Malayalis have also emigrated to the [[Middle East]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]]. Accessed November 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; including a large number of [[professional]]s. There were 7,093 Malayalam speakers in [[Australia]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="IMMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/immigration-update/people-australia-2013-statistics.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131850/http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/immigration-update/people-australia-2013-statistics.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 [[Canadian census]] reported 7,070 people who listed Malayalam as their mother tongue, mostly in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and [[Southern Ontario]]. In 2010, the Census of Population of Singapore reported that there were 26,348 Malayalees in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962741080|title=From Kerala to Singapore : Voices from the Singapore Malayalee community|last=Pillai|first=Anitha Devi|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Pte Ltd.|others=Puva Arumugam,|year=|isbn=9789814721837|location=Singapore|pages=|oclc=962741080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[New Zealand]] census reported 2,139 speakers.&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006%20Census%20reports/QuickStats%20About%20A%20Subject/QuickStats%20About%20Culture%20and%20Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.ashx Statistics New Zealand:Language spoken (total responses) for the 1996–2006 censuses (Table 16)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309170841/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006%20Census%20reports/QuickStats%20About%20A%20Subject/QuickStats%20About%20Culture%20and%20Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.ashx |date=9 March 2013 }}, ''stats.govt.nz''&lt;/ref&gt; 134 Malayalam speaking households were reported in 1956 in [[Fiji]]. There is also a considerable Malayali population in the [[Persian Gulf]] regions, especially in [[Bahrain]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Kuwait]] and  [[Europe|European]] region mainly in [[London]].

==History and culture==
{{Main|History of Kerala}}
Malayali cultural genesis can be traced to their membership in a well-defined historical region known as ''[[ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]]'', encompassing the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]], [[Chola]], and [[Pandya]] kingdoms and southern coastal [[Karnataka]].

The Malayali live in an historic area known as the [[Malabar coast]], which for thousands of years has been a major centre of the international spice trade, operating at least from the [[Roman era]] with [[Ptolemy]] documenting it on [[Ptolemy's world map|his map of the world]] in 150AD. For that reason, a highly distinct culture was created among the Malayali due to centuries of contact with foreign cultures through the [[spice trade]]. The arrival of the [[Cochin Jews]], and the rise of [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in particular were very significant in shaping modern day Malayali culture. Later, Portuguese [[Latin Christians]], [[Dutch Malabar]], French [[Mahé district|Mahe]], British [[Anglo Indian|English]], and [[Muslim Mappila|Arabian Muslim]] communities which arrived after 1498 left their mark as well making Kerala even more colourful, vibrant, and diverse.

Malayalis can now be seen in all the countries of the world with the excellence of adaptation to any culture, food habits, language.

In 2017, a detailed study of the evolution of the Singapore Malayalee community over a period of more than 100 years was published as a book: From Kerala to Singapore: Voices of the Singapore Malayalee Community. It is believed to be the first in-depth study of the presence of a NRI Malayalee community outside of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962741080|title=From Kerala to Singapore : voices from the Singapore Malayalee community|last=Pillai|first=Anitha Devi|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|others=Puva Arumugam,|year=2017|isbn=9789814721837|location=Singapore|pages=|oclc=962741080}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Language and literature===
Malayalam is the language spoken by the Malayalis. Malayalam is derived from old [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and Sanskrit in the 6th century. For cultural purposes Malayalam and Sanskrit formed a language known as [[Manipravalam]], where both languages were used in an alternating style. Malayalam is the only language among the major [[Dravidian languages]] without [[diglossia]]. This means, that the Malayalam which is spoken does not differ from the written variant. Malayalam is written using the [[Malayalam script]].

[[Malayalam literature]] is ancient in origin. The oldest literature works in [[Malayalam]], distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated between the 9th century and 11th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hRNTAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR24 ''Malayalam''], R.

In 19th century Chavara Kuriakose Elias, the founder of Carmelites of Mary Immaculate and Congregation of Mother of Carmel congregations, contribute different streams in the Malayalam Literature.  All his works are written between 1829 and 1870.

Kerala remains a fascinating riddle for the Indian diaspora, especially the younger generations - World Malayali Council with its sister organisation,  International Institute for Scientific and Academic Collaboration (IISAC) has come out with a comprehensive book on Kerala titled ‘Introduction to Kerala Studies,’ specially intended for the Malayali diaspora across the globe. J.V. Vilanilam, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala; Sunny Luke, medical scientist and former professor of Medical Biotechnology at Adelphi University, New York; and Antony Palackal, professor of Sociology at the Loyola College of Social Sciences in Thiruvananthapuram, have edited the book, besides making other contributions to it.

===Tharavadu===
{{Main|Taravadu}}

Tharavadu is a system of joint family practised by Malayalis, especially castes [[Nairs]], [[Ezhava]], Thiyyas and other prominent religious groups. Each Tharavadu has a unique name. The Tharavadu was administered by the ''Karanavar'', the oldest male member of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Malayali+tharavadu+system#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Tharavadu system}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would be the eldest maternal uncle of the family as well. The members of the Tharavadu consisted of mother, daughters, sons, sisters and brothers. The fathers and husbands had very minimal role to play in the affairs of the Tharavadu. It was a true matrilineal affair. The Karanavar took all major decisions. He was usually autocratic. However, the consent of the eldest female member of the family was taken before implementing the decisions. This eldest female member would be his maternal grandmother, own mother, mother's sister, his own sister or a sister through his maternal lineage. Since the lineage was through the female members, the birth of a daughter was always welcomed. Each Tharavadu also has a ''Para Devatha'' (clan deity) revered by those in the particular Tharavadu. Temples were built to honor these deities.

Kerala's society is less patriarchical than the rest of India.&lt;ref name="McKibben_2006"&gt;{{Harvnb|McKibben|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindberg_2004_18-19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lindberg|2004|pp=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Hindu communities such as the Nairs, some [[Ezhava]] families in [[Travancore]] and [[Cochin]], Thiyyas in north [[Kerala]] and Muslims around [[Kannur]], [[Varkala]] and [[Edava]]  in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as ''[[marumakkathayam]]'' which has in the recent years (post Indian independence) ceased to exist. Christians, Muslims, and some Hindu castes such as the Namboothiris and some Ezhavas follow ''makkathayam'', a patrilineal system.&lt;ref name="GOK_2002b"&gt;{{Harvnb|Government of Kerala|2002b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kerala's gender relations are among the most equitable in India and the Majority World.&lt;ref name="GOK_2004r_366"&gt;{{Harvnb|Government of Kerala|2004r|p=366}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindberg_2004_1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lindberg|2004|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Kerala}}
[[File:Paliam naalukettu.jpg|thumb| A typical [[Nalukettu]] structure.]]
Kerala, the native land of Malayalis has a tropical climate with excessive rains and intensive solar radiation.&lt;ref name="Kerala architecture"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/keralaarchitecture.htm|title=Kerala architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of this region has evolved  to meet these climatic conditions by having the form of buildings with low walls, sloping roof and projecting caves.&lt;ref name="Kerala architecture"/&gt; The setting of the building in the open garden plot was again necessitated by the requirement of wind for giving comfort in the humid climate.&lt;ref name="Kerala architecture"/&gt;

Timber is the prime structural material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala. Perhaps the skilful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly and delicate carving of wood work for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Malayali architecture.&lt;ref name="Kerala architecture"/&gt; From the limitations of the materials, a mixed mode of construction was evolved in Malayali architecture. The stone work was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples.&lt;ref name="Kerala architecture"/&gt; The ''Kerala murals'' are paintings with vegetable dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Malayali style of architecture.&lt;ref name="Kerala architecture"/&gt;

====Nalukettu====
[[File:British Residency in Asramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Residency]] in [[Kollam]], a two-storeyed Palace built by [[John Munro, 9th of Teaninich|Col. John Munro]] between 1811 and 1819, with a blend of [[Europe]]an-[[India]]n-[[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] architectural styles]]
Nalukettu was a housing style in Kerala. [[Nalukettu]] is a quadrangular building constructed after following the ''Tachu Sastra'' (Science of [[Carpentry]]). It was a typical house which was flanked by out-houses and utility structures. The large house-Nalukettu is constructed within a large compound. It was called Nalukettu because it consisted of four wings around a central [[courtyard]] called ''Nadumuttom''. The house has a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in the center. The quadrangle is in every way the center of life in the house and very useful for the performance of rituals. The layout of these homes was simple, and catered to the dwelling of a large number of people, usually part of a [[tharavadu]]. ''Ettukettu'' (eight halled with two central courtyards) or ''Pathinarukettu'' (sixteen halled with four central courtyards) are the more elaborate forms of the same architecture.

An example of a Nalukettu structure is ''[[Mattancherry Palace]]''.&lt;ref name="Nalukettu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/culture/cultureofkerala/kerala.html|title=Nalukettu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704045022/http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/culture/cultureofkerala/kerala.html|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}-Malayalam Resource Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performing arts and music===
[[File:Kathakali IMG 0281 by Joseph Lazer.JPG|thumb|[[Kathakali]]]]
[[File:Mohiniyattam.png|thumb|[[Mohiniyattam]]]]
[[File:Rooster Posture or Kukkuta Vadivu.jpg|thumb|[[Kalaripayattu]] posture]]
Malayalis use two words to denote dance, which is ''attom'' and ''thullal''.&lt;ref name="Kerala dance forms"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waWQ8mAUrC8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Kerala+dance#v=onepage&amp;q=Kerala%20dance&amp;f=false|title=Kerala dance forms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art forms of Malayalis are classified into three types. They are (i)''Religious'' like [[Theyyam]], Bhagavatipattu etc., (ii)''Semi religious'' like Sanghakali, Krishnanattom etc., and (iii)''Secular'' like [[Kathakali]], [[Mohiniyattam]], Thullal etc.&lt;ref name="Kerala dance forms"/&gt; ''Kathakali'' and ''Mohiniyattam'' are the two [[Indian classical dance|classical dance]] forms from Kerala.&lt;ref name="Classical dance forms of India"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dances.indobase.com/classical-dances/index.html|title=Classical dance forms of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathakali is actually a ''dance-drama''. Mohiniyattam is a very sensual and graceful dance form that is performed both solo and in a group by women.&lt;ref name="Classical dance forms of India"/&gt; [[Kutiyattam]] is a traditional performing art form from Kerala, which is recognised by [[UNESCO]] and given the status ''Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDhuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Koodiyattam+UNESCO&amp;dq=Koodiyattam+UNESCO|title=Koodiyattam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ottamthullal]] is another performing art, which is also known as the ''poor man's Kathakali'', which was created by the poet [[Kunchan Nambiar]] as an alternative to ''[[Chakiarkooth]]'' (another performing art), which was open only for higher castes to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8bExoV6GL8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Ottamthullal#v=onepage&amp;q=Ottamthullal&amp;f=false|title=Ottamthullal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theyyam]] is a ritualistic art form of Malayalis, which is thought to predate [[hinduism]] and to have developed from folk dances performed in conjunction with harvest celebrations. [[Theyyam]] is performed as an offering to gods so as to get rid of poverty and illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC&amp;pg=PA928&amp;dq=Theyyam#v=onepage&amp;q=Theyyam&amp;f=false|title=Theyyam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velakali is another ritualistic art form, mainly performed at temples in the festival time. [[Kolkali]] is a folk art in which dance performers move in a circle, striking small sticks and keeping rhythm with special steps.

Many ancient Malayali family houses in Kerala have special snake shrines called ''Kavu''. Sarpam Thullal is usually performed in the courtyard of houses having snake shrines. This is a votive offering for family wealth and happiness.Kerala Natanam ( കേരള നടനം ) ([[Kerala]] Dance) is a new style of dance that is now recognised as a distinct classical art form evolved from [[Kathakali]]. The Indian dancer [[Guru Gopinath]] (  ഗുരു ഗോപിനാഥ്‌ ) a well-trained Kathakali artist and his wife Thankamani Gopinath developed this unique form of dance.

Performing arts in Kerala is not limited to a single religion of the Malayali society. [[Muslim Mappila]]s, [[Saint Thomas Christians|Nasranis]] and Latin Christians have their own unique performing art forms. [[Duff Muttu]], also known as ''Dubh Muttu/Aravanamuttu''&lt;ref name="Duffmuttu"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYfRBcLdTNYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=duffmuttu#v=onepage&amp;q=duffmuttu&amp;f=false|title=Duffmuttu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a performing art form prevalent among the Muslim community. It is a group performance, staged as a social event during festivals and nuptial ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Duffmuttu"/&gt;

[[Oppana]] is a popular form of social entertainment among the Muslim community. It is a form accompanied by clapping of hands, in which both men and women participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zh6z0nuIjAgC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=Oppana#v=onepage&amp;q=Oppana&amp;f=false|title=Oppana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margamkali]] is a performing art which is popular among the [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. It combines both devotion and entertainment, and was performed by men in groups.&lt;ref name="Christian art foms"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA945&amp;dq=Margamkali#v=onepage&amp;q=Margamkali&amp;f=false|title=Christian art foms}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980's women also have found groups. The dancers themselves sing the ''margamkali songs'' in unison call and response form.&lt;ref name="Christian art foms"/&gt;''[[Parichamuttukali]]'' is another performing art which is popular among [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. This is an artistic adaptation of the martial art of Kerala, [[Kalaripayattu]].&lt;ref name="Christian art foms"/&gt; ''[[Chavittu nadakom]]'' is a theatrical art form observed mainly by Kerala Latin Christians, dating back to the second half of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Christian art foms"/&gt;

However, many of these native art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among ordinary Keralites. Thus, more contemporary forms&amp;nbsp;– including those heavily based on the use of often risqué and [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] [[mimicry]] and [[parody]]&amp;nbsp;– have gained considerable mass appeal in recent years. Indeed, contemporary artists often use such modes to mock socioeconomic elites. Since 1930 when the first Malayalam film [[Vigathakumaran]] was released and over the following decade or two, [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam cinema]] had grown to become one of the popular means of expression for both works of fiction and social issues, and it remains so.

Music formed a major part of early [[Malayalam literature]], which is believed to have started developing by 9th century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kerala Charithram |last=Sreedhara Menon|first=A.  |authorlink=A. Sreedhara Menon |publisher=D.C. Books |location=Kottayam, Kerala |isbn= |page=494 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of music in the [[culture of Kerala]] can be established just by the fact that in Malayalam language, musical poetry was developed long before [[prose]]. [[Kerala]] is musically known for [[Sopanam]].  Sopanam is religious in nature, and developed through singing invocatory songs at the [[Kalam]] of [[Kali]], and later inside temples. Sopanam came to prominence in the wake of the increasing popularity of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva]]'s [[Gita Govinda]] or [[Ashtapadis]]. Sopana ''sangeetham'' (music), as the very name suggests, is sung by the side of the ''holy steps'' (sopanam) leading to the [[sanctum sanctorum]] of a [[shrine]]. It is sung, typically employing plain notes, to the accompaniment of the small, hourglass-shaped ethnic drum called ''[[idakka]]'', besides the chengila or the handy metallic gong to sound the beats.

Sopanam is traditionally sung by men of the [[Marar]] and [[Pothuval]] community, who are [[Ambalavasi]] (semi-Brahmin) castes engaged to do it as their hereditary profession. Kerala is also home of [[Carnatic music]]. Legends like [[Swati Tirunal]], Shadkala Govinda Maarar, Sangitha Vidwan Gopala Pillai Bhagavathar, Chertala Gopalan Nair, [[M. D. Ramanathan]], [[T.V.Gopalakrishnan]], [[M.S. Gopalakrishnan]], L. Subramaniam  [[T.N. Krishnan]] &amp; [[K. J. Yesudas]] are Malayali musicians. Also among the younger generations with wide acclaim and promise is Child Prodigy Violinist [[L. Athira Krishna]] etc., who are looked upon as maestros of tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ritual Music and Hindu Rituals of Kerala |last=Rolf |first=Killius |year=2006 |publisher=BR Rhythms |location=New Delhi |isbn=81-88827-07-X |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerala also has a significant presence of [[Hindustani music]] as well.&lt;ref name="Music"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keral.com/movies/music.htm |title=Music |accessdate=2 January 2009 |publisher=Keral.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802081714/http://www.keral.com/movies/music.htm |archivedate=2 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The king of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal patronaged and contributed much to the Hindustani Music. The [[pulluvar]] of Kerala are closely connected to the serpent worship. One group among these people consider the snake gods as their presiding deity and perform certain sacrifices and sing songs. This is called ''Pulluvan Pattu''. The song conducted by the pulluvar in serpent temples and snake groves is called Sarppapaattu, Naagam Paattu, Sarpam Thullal, Sarppolsavam, Paambum Thullal or Paambum Kalam. [[Mappila Songs|Mappila Paattukal]] or ''Mappila Songs'' are folklore Muslim devotional songs in the Malayalam language. Mappila songs are composed in colloquial Malayalam and are sung in a distinctive tune. They are composed in a mixture of Malayalam and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

[[Film music]], which refers to [[playback singing]] in the context of [[Music of India|Indian music]], forms the most important canon of popular music in India. Film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state.&lt;ref name="Music"/&gt;

===Vallam Kali===
[[File:Nehru Trophy Boat Race 11-08-2012 1-44-16 PM.JPG|thumb|[[Vallamkali]]-[[Nehru Trophy Boat Race]]]]
[[Vallam Kali]], is the race of country made boats. It is mainly conducted during the season of the harvest festival Onam in Autumn. Vallam Kali include races of many kinds of traditional boats of Kerala. The race of [[Chundan Vallam]] (snake boat) is the major item. Hence Vallam Kali is also known in English as Snake Boat Race and a major tourist attraction. Other types of boats which do participate in various events in the race are ''Churulan Vallam'', ''Iruttukuthy Vallam'', ''Odi Vallam'', ''Veppu Vallam (Vaipu Vallam)'', ''Vadakkanody Vallam'', and ''Kochu Vallam''. [[Nehru Trophy Boat Race]] is one the famous Vallam Kali held in [[Punnamada Lake]] in [[Alappuzha district]] of Kerala. [[Champakulam Moolam Boat Race]] is the oldest and most popular Vallam Kali in Kerala. The race is held on [[Pamba River|river Pamba]] on the moolam day (according to the [[Malayalam calendar|Malayalam Era]]) of the Malayalam month Midhunam, the day of the installation of the deity at the [[Ambalappuzha]] Sree Krishna Temple. The [[Aranmula Boat Race]] takes place at [[Aranmula]], near a temple dedicated to [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]]. The President's Trophy Boat Race is a popular event conducted in Ashtamudi Lake in Kollam.

Thousands of people gather on the banks of the river Pamba to watch the snake boat races. Nearly 50 snake boats or chundan vallams participate in the festival. [[Payippadu Vallam Kali|Payippad Jalotsavam]] is a three-day water festival. It is conducted in Payippad Lake which is 35&amp;nbsp;km from Alappuzha district of Kerala state. There is a close relation between this Payippad boat race and Subramanya Swamy Temple in [[Haripad]]. [[Indira Gandhi Boat Race]] is a boat race festival celebrated in the last week of December in the backwaters of [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], a city in Kerala. This boat race is one of the most popular Vallam Kali in Kerala. This festival is conducted to promote [[Tourism in Kerala|Kerala tourism]].

===Festivals===
[[File:Onam pukolam.jpg|thumb|[[Onam]] pookkalam/floral carpet]]
Malayalis celebrate a variety of festivals, namely [[Onam]], [[Christmas]], [[Vishu]], [[Easter]], Deepavali, [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid al-Adha|Bakrid]].

===Cuisine===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
{{Main|Cuisine of Kerala}}
[[File:Sadhya DSW.jpg|thumb|Typical [[Sadya|Kerala Sadya]]]]
Malayali cuisine is not homogeneous and regional variations are visible throughout. Spices form an important ingredient in almost all curries. Kerala is known for its traditional sadhyas, a vegetarian meal served with boiled rice and a host of side-dishes. The sadhya is complemented by payasam, a sweet milk dessert native to Kerala. The sadhya is, as per custom, served on a banana leaf. Traditional dishes include sambar, aviyal, kaalan, theeyal, thoran, injipully, pulisherry, appam, kappa (tapioca), puttu (steamed rice powder), and puzhukku. [[Coconut]] is an essential ingredient in most of the food items and is liberally used.

Puttu is a culinary specialty in Kerala. It is a steamed rice cake which is a favourite breakfast of most Malayalis. It is served with either brown chickpeas cooked in a spicy gravy, papadams and boiled small green lentils, or tiny ripe yellow Kerala plantains. In the highlands there is also a variety of puttu served with paani (the boiled-down syrup from [[Palm wine|sweet palm toddy]]) and sweet boiled bananas. to steam the puttu, there is a special utensil called "Puttu Kutti". It consists of two sections. The lower bulkier portion is where the water for steaming is stored. The upper detachable leaner portion is separated from lower portion by perforated lids so as to allow the steam to pass through and bake the rice powder.

[[Appam]] is a pancake made of fermented batter. The batter is made of rice flour and fermented using either yeast or toddy, the local spirit. It is fried using a special frying pan called appa-chatti and is served with egg curry, chicken curry, mutton stew, vegetable curry and chick pea curry.

===Martial arts===
[[File:Kalaripayattu weapons.jpg|thumb|Common Weapons used as part of Kalaripayatt]]
{{See also|Kalaripayattu}}
Malayalis have their own form of martial arts called [[Kalaripayattu]]. This type of martial arts was used as defensive mechanism against intruders. In ancient times, disputes between nobles (''naaduvazhis'' or ''Vazhunors'') were also settled by the outcome of a Kalaripayattu tournament. This ancient martial art is claimed as ''the mother of all martial arts''. The word "[[kalari]]" can be traced to ancient [[Sangam literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Suresh, P. R. (2005). ''[http://www.palmlandtours.net/kerala/tours/kalari/kalaripayatte/kalari.htm Kalari Payatte&amp;nbsp;– The martial art of Kerala.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829143736/http://www.palmlandtours.net/kerala/tours/kalari/kalaripayatte/kalari.htm |date=29 August 2009 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists estimate that Kalarippayattu dates back to at least the 12th century CE.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1&gt;Zarrilli, Phillip B. [http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/power.html A South Indian Martial Art and the Yoga and Ayurvedic Paradigms.] [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai attributes the birth of Kalaripayattu to an extended period of warfare between the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]] and the [[Cholas]] in the 11th century CE.&lt;ref name="Zarrilli1"/&gt; What eventually crystallized into this style is thought to have been a product of existing South Indian styles of combat, combined with techniques brought by other cultures.&lt;ref name="Zarrilli1"/&gt; Kalaripayattu may be one of the oldest martial arts in existence.&lt;ref name="discoverychannelasia.com"&gt;[http://www.yourdiscovery.com/martialarts/southasia/kalaripayatta/index.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest western reference to Kalaripayattu is a 16th-century travelogue of [[Duarte Barbosa]], a Portuguese explorer. The Southern style, which stresses importance of hand-to-hand combat is slightly different than Kalari in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip B. Zarrilli, When the Body Becomes All Eyes&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin''' "'''Buggsy'''" '''Goldstein''' (c. 1905 &amp;ndash; June 12, 1941) was a member of a gang of [[hitmen]], operating out of [[Brooklyn]], New York in the 1930s, known as [[Murder, Inc.]]

Born '''Meyer Goldstein''', Goldstein grew up in [[East New York, Brooklyn]], New York, and initially led the crime syndicate Murder, Inc. together with [[Abe Reles|Abe "Kid Twist" Reles]]. Goldstein later committed murders under the orders of [[Louis Buchalter|Louis "Lepke" Buchalter]] and [[Albert Anastasia|Albert "Mad Hatter" Anastasia]].

The end of Murder, Inc. and Martin Goldstein came when Reles, trying to avoid a death sentence, testified against many of his former associates.  Both Goldstein and [[Harry Strauss|Harry "Pittsburgh Phil" Strauss]] were convicted of the murder of [[Irving "Puggy" Feinstein]], a small-time gambler whose death had been ordered by [[Albert Anastasia]] as a favor to the boss of the crime family Anastasia belonged to, [[Vincent Mangano]]. When given the opportunity to address the court before sentencing, Goldstein, ever the joker, said "Judge, I would like to pee on your leg."  Both men were sentenced to death.

Around midnight on June 12, 1941, Goldstein and Strauss were executed by [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing]] Prison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15488">The '''McLaren Report''' ({{lang-ru|Доклад Макларена}}) is the name given to an independent report released in two parts by professor [[Richard McLaren (academic)|Richard McLaren]] into allegations and evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia. It was commissioned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)]] in May 2016.
In July 2016, [[Richard McLaren (academic)|McLaren]] presented Part 1 of the report, indicating systematic state-sponsored subversion of the drug testing processes by the [[government of Russia]] during and subsequent to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdlive.co.za/sport/othersport/2016/07/18/wada-russian-sports-ministry-oversaw-doping-cover-ups-during-sochi-olympics "WADA: Russian sports ministry oversaw doping cover-ups during Sochi Olympics"]. ''Business Day Live'', July 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, he published the second part of the report on [[doping in Russia]].&lt;ref name=EDP&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ipevidencedisclosurepackage.net/ |title= Electronic Documentary Package of the IP Professor Richard H.

==July 2016 report (part 1)==
On 18 July 2016, [[Richard McLaren (academic)|Richard McLaren]], a Canadian attorney retained by WADA to investigate [[Grigory Rodchenkov]]'s allegations, published a 97-page report covering significant state-sponsored doping in Russia.&lt;ref name=WADA160718&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/doping-control-process/mclaren-independent-investigations-report-into-sochi-allegations |title= McLaren Independent Investigations Report into Sochi Allegations |publisher= WADA |date= 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although limited by a 57-day time frame, the investigation found corroborating evidence after conducting witness interviews, reviewing thousands of documents, cyber analysis of hard drives, forensic analysis of urine sample collection bottles, and laboratory analysis of individual athlete samples, with "more evidence becoming available by the day."&lt;ref name=WADA160718/&gt;

The report concluded that it was shown "beyond a reasonable doubt" that Russia's [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Ministry of Sport]], the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia, the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB), and the WADA-accredited laboratory in Moscow had "operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes" within a "state-directed failsafe system" using "the disappearing positive [test] methodology."&lt;ref name=WADA160718/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT160718&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/sports/report-confirms-state-sponsored-doping-by-russia-at-olympics.html |title= Russia May Face Olympics Ban as Doping Scheme Is Confirmed |first= Rebecca R. |last= Ruiz |work= The New York Times |date= 18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/17100024/takeaways-mclaren-report-confusion-corruption-cynicism|title=Takeaways from McLaren report?

At the Olympics, urine samples are stored in security bottles named the "BEREG-KIT", which must be broken open after being closed; the investigation, however, found that using a specific tool, the bottles were possible to open, and found scratch marks on the inside normally invisible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/38261608|title=Russian doping: McLaren report says more than 1,000 athletes implicated|date=9 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official producer of BEREG-KIT security bottles used for anti-doping tests, Berlinger Group, stated, "We have no knowledge of the specifications, the methods or the procedures involved in the tests and experiments conducted by the McLaren Commission."&lt;ref name=Berlinger&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.berlinger.com/drug-and-doping-control/media/media-release-detail/mclarenwada-investigation-of-sochi-2014-allegations/ |title=McLaren/WADA investigation of Sochi 2014 allegations |publisher= Berlinger |date= 18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the McLaren report, the Disappearing Positive Methodology (DPM) operated from "at least late 2011 to August 2015."&lt;ref name=WADA160718/&gt; It was used on 643 positive samples, a number that the authors consider "only a minimum" due to limited access to Russian records.&lt;ref name=WADA160718/&gt;

==December 2016 report (part 2)==
On 9 December 2016, McLaren published the second part of his independent report.

=== July 2016 report ===
* Russia was suspended from all international athletic competitions by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], including the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russia-banned-2016-olympic-games-rio-de-janeiro-after-iaaf-uphold-suspension-1566096|title=Russia athletes banned from 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after IAAF uphold suspension|first=Tony|last=Mogan|date=17 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/russian-weightlifters-banned-rio-olympics-doping|title=Russian weightlifters banned from Rio Olympics for doping|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Originally Russia submitted a list of 389 athletes for the Rio Olympics competition.

In September 2016, Russia was awarded hosting rights for the [[Biathlon World Championships 2021|2021 World Biathlon Championships]] because the IOC's recommendation did not apply to events that had already been awarded or planned bids from the country.&lt;ref name=ITG160906&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1041329/exclusive-international-biathlon-union-vice-president-claims-credibility-of-ioc-undermined-after-russia-awarded-2021-world-championships |title= Exclusive: International Biathlon Union vice-president claims credibility of IOC undermined after Russia awarded 2021 World Championships |first= Liam |last= Morgan |work= Inside the Games |date= 6 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15744">{{main| Women in the French Revolution}}In pre-revolutionary France, women had no part in affairs outside the house. Before the [[French Revolution|revolution]] and the advent of feminism in France, women's roles in society consisted of providing heirs for their husbands and tending to household duties. Even in the upper classes, women were dismissed as simpletons, unable to understand or give a meaningful contribution to the philosophical or political conversations of the day. However, with the emergence of  ideas such as liberté, égalité, and fraternité, the women of France joined their voices to the chaos of the early revolution. This was the beginning of feminism in France. With demonstrations such as [[Women's March on Versailles]], and the [[Demonstration of 20 June 1792]], women displayed their commitment to the Revolution. Both the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] and the creation of the [[Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]] further conveyed their message of women's rights as a necessity to the new order of the revolution.

== Inequality During Revolution ==
During the revolution, doctors and scientists played a significant role in the way society viewed women. Many doctors hypothesized that women could not partake in politics and other aspects of the government since their physiology and anatomy was so different than the physiology and anatomy of men. Scientists, doctors, and people of related professions stated that those with compacted skulls could not practice or follow the sciences (Nature's Body 7). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iAVNB_1Dth0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=feminism+in+french+revolution&amp;ots=Hg42N9eyYg&amp;sig=BBwTel2QRa1icFdeLXH26OiN1pQ#v=onepage&amp;q=feminism%20in%20french%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism|last=Beckstrand|first=Lisa|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=9780838641927|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's participation in politics was considered useless since men were to keep their wive's, daughter's, sister's, and loved one's values and needs in mind.

Women were thought to have the same beliefs, ideals, and desires for France as the men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fChW-fyfmGUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=women+protests+french+revolution&amp;ots=Y-FizKpoHE&amp;sig=WTmostUxik6Jlgo9u9Ay4xBB4cs#v=snippet&amp;q=women&amp;f=false|title=Women, Equality, and the French Revolution|last=Proctor|first=Candice E.|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313272455|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Women's March to Versailles ==
{{Main|Women's March on Versailles}}

The Women's March to Versailles is one example of [[protofeminist]] militant activism during the [[French Revolution]]. Though the march was overwhelmingly made up women by all accounts, they did not make explicitly feminist demands. In the years preceding the Revolution, there was a food shortage in France. People all over the country grew agitated and called for a guarantee of food, with insufficient response from the [[monarchy]]. In October 1789, women in the market place of Paris began marching to Versailles, spurred on by revolutionists. As they marched, they drew a large gathering, culminating in the siege of the palace and the royal family being transported to the [[Tuileries Palace]]. 

Though the crowd was led by men such as [[Stanislas-Marie Maillard]], the women's call for bread and their persistence to see their demands met, set the tone for the subsequent events led by women in the Revolution. Their resolve is exemplified by an account of a woman participating in the march, the woman Cheret. "The honorable members of the National Assembly, coming to understand that the women were absolutely committed to persist until there was something definite for always, accorded to our twelve deputies."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Cheret: The Event of Paris and Versailles, by One of the Ladies Who Had the Honor to Be in the Deputation to the General Assembly|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1789|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=|translator-last=Mason|translator-first=Laura|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the march was not an inherently feminist event, the women of the march recalled the victory of "our citizenesses clothed in glory, returned by carriage at his majesty's expense, to the city hall in Paris."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The women of the march were remembered by posterity of the French Revolution as "Mothers of the Nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427855469|title=A history of the French Revolution. V. 1-2 V. 1-2|last=Stephens|first=H. Morse|date=1897-01-01|publisher=Longmans, Green|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Demanding arms ==
Pauline Léon, on March 6, 1791, submitted a petition signed by 319 women to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] requesting permission to form a ''[[Garde Nationale|garde national]]'' in order to defend Paris in case of military invasion.&lt;ref name="Limits 23-24"&gt;''Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution'' by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Léon requested permission be granted to women to arm themselves with pikes, pistols, sabers and rifles, as well as the privilege of drilling under the French Guards. Her request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Daughters'' by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1792, [[Theroigne de Mericourt|Théroigne de Méricourt]] made a call for the creation of "legions of amazons" in order to protect the revolution. As part of her call, she claimed that the [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] would transform women into citizens.&lt;ref name="Limits 23-24" /&gt;

== Participation in demonstrations ==
On October 5, 1789, over eight hundred women overtook the Hotel de Ville. The women burned all of the papers and files that they found since none of the papers and files had any benefit towards their rights as French citizens. They also searched the hotel for arms and ammunition. The women did not find any ammunition. They did, however, find pikes and two cannons. They took the pikes and cannons and were then followed by Lafayette's national guard. The national guard was sent to subdue the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=uK6JVxh92QUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=feminism++%22french+revolution%22&amp;ots=EVuHSl2l8V&amp;sig=tfj60Q-C5b89445cKBW58EQJo44#v=onepage&amp;q=women&amp;f=false|title=Women and the Limits of Citizenship in the French Revolution|last=Hufton|first=Olwen H.|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802068378|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20 of 1792, a number of armed women took part in a procession that "passed through the halls of the [[Legislative Assembly]], into the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries Gardens]], and then through the King's residence."&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Daughters'' by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Militant women also assumed a special role in the funeral of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], following his murder on July 13, 1793. As part of the [[funeral procession]], they carried the bathtub in which Marat had been murdered as well as a shirt stained with Marat's blood.&lt;ref&gt;''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on May 20, 1795, women were at the fore of a crowd that demanded "bread and the [[Constitution of 1793]]."&lt;ref name="Society 24"&gt;''Gender, Society and Politics: France and Women 1789-1914'' by James H. McMillan pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; When their protest went unnoticed, the women went on a rampage, "sacking shops, seizing grain and kidnapping officials."&lt;ref name="Society 24" /&gt;

== Women's Role in Society ==
Although most people in society believed that women should not partake in politics and should stay at home and raise the children, some women did play an important role in politics. This is not focusing on the protests that many women in France were a part of. Those protests shaped the political scene in France during the Revolution. During the French Revolution, women were able to write and publish political journals. The ''Tribune des femmes'' and ''Foi nouvelle: Livre des actes'' were political journals that were mainly written and published by women. The companies that published these journals had to pay a stamp tax that was only needed when a political journal was being published, therefore, making these two journals political. After the ''Gazette des femmes'' was published, the government stepped in and banned women's ability to publish daily political journals specifically. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iAVNB_1Dth0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=feminism+in+french+revolution&amp;ots=Hg42N9eyYg&amp;sig=BBwTel2QRa1icFdeLXH26OiN1pQ#v=onepage&amp;q=feminism%20in%20french%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism|last=Beckstrand|first=Lisa|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=9780838641927|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declaration of the Rights of Women and Female Citizens ==
{{Main|Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen}}

While largely ignored in their endeavors to increase the rights of citizens in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], activists such as [[Pauline Léon]] and [[Théroigne de Méricourt]] agitated for full citizenship for women.&lt;ref name="Daughters 79"&gt;''Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution'' Edited by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Limits 23-24"/&gt; Yet, women were "denied political rights of '[[active citizenship]]' (1791) and democratic citizenship (1793)."&lt;ref name="Daughters 79"/&gt; In 1791, [[Olympe de Gouges]] published a vital document of the Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen. In it, de Gouges replicated the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but altered the language to reflect the concerns of women's rights within France. She addressed her declaration to the Queen, [[Marie Antoinette]], pleading with her to "work for the restoration of morals, to give to your sex all the credit it is due."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Declaration of the Rights of Women and the Female Citizen|last=de Gouges|first=Olympe|publisher=|year=1791|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=204-210|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this document did not have extensive social repercussions within France during the time of the Revolution, de Gouges revealed the depths of misogynistic culture by the reaction to her work. Following her publication, she was tried as having "royalist tendencies", further evidenced by her political pamphlets and discovery of her half-written play, ''La France sauvée ou le tyran détrondé.'' Though according to de Gouges, the accusation was based on a misunderstanding of her texts as anti-revolutionary, feminist historian Janie Vanpée took the stance that her trial was "not one of holding opinions from the wrong side of the political spectrum, but rather of articulating political opinions at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literate Women of the French Revolution|last=Venee|first=Janie|publisher=Summa Publication|year=1994|isbn=|location=Birmingham, Alabama|pages=56|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gouges' execution in 1793, one of only three women to be executed in the Reign of Terror, solidified her appraisal of men within the Revolution as "pretend[ing] to enjoy the Revolution and reclaim his rights to equality only to say nothing more about it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Society of Revolutionary Republican Women ==
{{Main|Society of Revolutionary Republican Women}}

The most radical militant feminist activism was practiced by the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women which was founded by Léon and her colleague [[Claire Lacombe]] on May 10, 1793.&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Daughters'' by Sara E Melzer and Leslie W. Rabine pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the club was "to deliberate on the means of frustrating the projects of the enemies of the Republic." Up to 180 women attended the meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;''Deviant Women of the French Revolution and the Rise of Feminism'' by Lisa Beckstrand pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Of special interest to the Society was "combating [[hoarding]] [of grain and other staples] and [[inflation]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Women and the Limits of Citizenship'' by Olwen W. Hufton pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==
[[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]] was a strong advocate for women's rights. He believed that by not allowing women to partake in politics, it would deny them rights that men were entitled to, and it would deny rights to the legislators who vote to fill political positions. The legislators would not be able to vote for a woman to hold a position in the government even if they believed she was fit for the position. According to Condorcet, women were just as capable as men, except when it came to war. He believed that women were not as capable as men in war because of the differences in body structure, physique, and the need to take a leave of absence when their child is born. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fChW-fyfmGUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=women+protests+french+revolution&amp;ots=Y-FizKpoHE&amp;sig=WTmostUxik6Jlgo9u9Ay4xBB4cs#v=snippet&amp;q=women&amp;f=false|title=Women, Equality, and the French Revolution|last=Proctor|first=Candice E.|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313272455|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their actions. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Théroigne de Méricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline Léon and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for "conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic."&lt;ref&gt;''Deviant Women'' by Beckstrand pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
These are but a few examples of the militant protofeminism that was prevalent during the French Revolution. While little progress was made toward [[gender equality]] during the Revolution, the activism of French women and protofeminists was bold and particularly significant in Paris. Though French culture during the time of the Revolution was largely misogynistic, leading women such as Madame Roland, Olympe de Gouges, and [[Charlotte Corday]] went against the traditional roles of gender and fought the mindset of a woman as passive, uneducated, and politically ignorant. According to author and historian Catherine R. Montfort, "a woman is always a woman biologically, but the ways in which she can be one are constructed by her culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literate Women of the French Revolution|last=Monfort|first=Catherine R.|publisher=Summa Publications|year=1994|isbn=978-1883479077|location=Birmingham, AL|pages=6|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects on women's rights of the French Revolution is debated among historians. For some, the French Revolution eroded women's right by decreasing the role of women in public life due to the repressive measures that were brought into place by the [[Jacobin|Jacobins]]. However, for others, the change in psyche that allowed women to establish a gender-based consciousness and the reforms to marriage, divorce and property rendered a significant and ground breaking change to feminist identities and the future of the feminist movement.

'''Monroe's motivated sequence''' is a technique for organizing [[persuasion|persuasive]] [[Public speaking|speeches]] that inspire people to take action. It was developed in the mid-1930s by Alan H. Monroe at [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Changing Minds|url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/general/overall/monroe_sequence.htm|title=Monroe's Motivated Sequence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps==
Monroe's motivated sequence states that on the first step is to state the problem the customer is having, then explain it if one cannot solidify the need and give a representation of the situation that may occur.
;Attention: Get the attention of your audience using a detailed story, shocking example, dramatic statistic, [[quotation]]s, etc.
;Need: Show how the topic applies to the psychological need of the audience members. The premise here is that audience needs are what motivates action. Go beyond establishing that there is a significant problem. There are many problems that are not particularly relevant to your audience. Show that the need will not go away by itself. Use [[statistics]], examples, etc. Convince your audience that they each have a personal need to take action.
;Satisfaction: You need to solve the issue. Provide specific and viable solutions that individuals or communities can implement to solve the problem.
;Visualization: Tell the audience what will happen if the solution is implemented or does not take place. Be visual and detailed.
;Action: Tell the audience what action they can take personally to solve the problem. 

There are many descriptions of Monroe's motivated sequence. Here is an example description by Dominic Spencer, an instructor at the University of Central Florida in 2011:

#'''Attention''': Hey! Listen to me, you have a PROBLEM!
#'''Need''': Let me EXPLAIN the problem.
#'''Satisfaction''': But, I have a SOLUTION!
#'''Visualization''': If we IMPLEMENT my solution, this is what will happen. Or, if we don't implement my solution, this is what will happen.
#'''Action''': You can help me in this specific way. Will you help me?

==Benefits==
The advantage of Monroe's motivated sequence is that it emphasizes what the audience can do. Too often the audience feels like a situation is hopeless; Monroe's motivated sequence emphasizes the action the audience can take. It also helps the audience feel like the speaker knows the problem at hand and is listening to them instead of just tuning them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehninger, D.|author2=Monroe, A.H.|author3=Gronbeck, B.E.|year=1978| title=Principles and Types of Speech Communication|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=German, K.

The '''Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation''' (officially the '''"Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters"''') is a judicial [[Commission of investigation (Ireland)|commission of investigation]], established in 2015 by an order of the [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]].  It was set up in the wake of claims that the bodies of up to 800 babies and children may have been interred in an unmarked mass grave in the [[Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home]], located in [[Tuam]], County Galway, but its remit also covers investigation into the records of and the practices at an additional thirteen Mother and Baby Homes.  The members of the three-person Commission are Judge [[Yvonne Murphy]] (chairperson), Dr William Duncan and Professor [[Mary E. Daly]].

Originally scheduled to issue its final report by February 2018, the Commission was granted a one-year extension and will now report by February 2019.&lt;ref name="RTÉ20171205"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/1205/925222-mother-and-baby/|title=One-year extension for mother and baby home probe|publisher=RTÉ|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following widespread news reports in 2014 that the bodies of 796 babies and children may have been interred in an unrecorded mass grave at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway, there were calls both nationally and internationally for an investigation of the site, and for an inquiry into all such Mother and Baby Homes.&lt;ref name="irish-examiner-call-for-inquiry"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/call-for-inquiry-into-mother-and-baby-home-deaths-632129.html|title=Call for inquiry into mother-and-baby home deaths|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
On 4 June 2014, the Irish government announced it was bringing together representatives from various government departments to investigate the deaths at the Bon Secours home and to propose how to address the issue.&lt;ref name="GovernmentInvestigation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishsun.com/index.php/sid/222647361/scat/aba4168066a10b8d/ht/40-years-after-becoming-common-knowledge-Irish-government-to-investigate-mass-graves|title=40 years after becoming common knowledge, Irish government to investigate mass graves| accessdate=5 June 2014|publisher=Irish Sun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then [[Minister for Children and Youth Affairs]], [[Charles Flanagan|Charlie Flanagan]], said any government inquiry would not be confined to the home in Tuam and that officials would advise the Government on the best form of inquiry before the end of June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/mother-and-baby-inquiry-to-go-beyond-tuam-flanagan-1.1821947|title=Mother and baby inquiry to go beyond Tuam &amp;ndash; Flanagan|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=McGarry|first=Patsy|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2014, the government announced that Judge Yvonne Murphy would chair a Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby homes, including Tuam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/judge-yvonne-murphy-to-head-mother-and-baby-inquiry-1.1868303|title=Judge Yvonne Murphy to head mother-and-baby inquiry|newspaper=The Irish Times|last=Kelly|first=Fiach|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2014, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], announced that the draft terms of reference for the inquiry had been circulated to government departments for comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/draft-mother-and-baby-homes-inquiry-terms-circulated-1.1952453|title=Draft mother and baby homes inquiry terms circulated|work=The Irish Times|last=Healy|first=Alison|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 2015, Reilly announced that the terms of reference had been agreed at Cabinet for an "independent commission, which has a three-year deadline and which will cost approximately €21 million, following the signing by the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} of a Government Order at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FMotherandBabyInfoPage.htm |title=Minister Reilly announces the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters |publisher=[[Department of Children and Youth Affairs]] |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412113000/http://dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FMotherandBabyInfoPage.htm |archivedate=12 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/mother-and-baby-homes-commission-to-begin-work-1.2110150 |title=Mother and baby homes commission to begin work |work=[[The Irish Times]] |last=Duncan |first=Pamela |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412113654/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/mother-and-baby-homes-commission-to-begin-work-1.2110150 |archivedate=12 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30741337|title=Irish mother and baby homes: Terms of three-year inquiry published|work=[[BBC]]|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The three-person Commission comprises Judge Yvonne Murphy as Chairperson, with international legal expert on child protection and [[adoption]], Doctor William Duncan, and historian Professor Mary E. Daly, appointed as Commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FMotherandBabyInfoPage.htm|title=Commission of Investigation – Mother and Baby Homes: Minister Reilly announces the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters|date=19 February 2015|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ol start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The circumstances for the entry of single women into Mother and Baby Homes and the exit pathways on leaving, including the extent of their participation in relevant decisions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The living conditions and care arrangements experienced by residents during their period of accommodation, including by reference to the literature on the living conditions and care experienced by mothers and children generally during the period;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mortality among mothers and children residing in the institutions (to determine the general causes, circumstances, and rates of mortality), compared to mortality among women and children generally;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-mortem practices and procedures in respect of children or mothers who died while resident, including the reporting of deaths, burial arrangements and transfer of remains to educational institutions for the purpose of anatomical examination;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extent of compliance with relevant regulatory and ethical standards of the time of systemic vaccine trials found by the Commission to have been conducted on children resident in one or more of the institutions (including, ''inter alia'', vaccine trials conducted using vaccines manufactured by Burroughs Welcome in 1960/61, 1970 or 1973);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrangements for the entry of children into the institutions in circumstances when their mother was not also resident at the time of their entry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For children who did not remain in the care of their parents, to examine exit pathways on leaving the institutions so as to establish patterns of referral or relevant relationships with other entities, and in particular to identify:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;&lt;li&gt;the extent to which the child's welfare and protection were considered in practices relating to their placement in Ireland or abroad;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the extent of participation of mothers in relevant decisions, including&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;&lt;li&gt;the procedures that were in place to obtain consent from mothers in respect of [[adoption]], and&lt;/li&gt;

* St Kevin's Institution (Dublin Union)
* Stranorlar County Home, Co Donegal (St Joseph's)
* Cork City County Home (St Finbarr's)
* Thomastown County Home, Co Kilkenny (St Columba's)

Several of the named homes - principally Bessboro House (Cork), Bon Secours (Galway), Manor House (Westmeath), Sean Ross Abbey (Tipperary) and St. Patrick's (Dublin) - had previously been highlighted as sources for illegal domestic and foreign adoptions, with many of the children being trafficked to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Banished Babies|last=Milotte|first=Mike|publisher=New Island Books|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="examiner334315"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/special-investigation-fears-over-trafficking-of-children-to-the-us-334315.html|title=SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: Fears over ‘trafficking’ of children to the US|last=Ó Fátharta|first=Conall|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="examiner334260"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/special-investigation-government-already-knew-of-baby-deaths-334260.html|title=SPECIAL INVESTIGATION: Government already knew of baby deaths|last=Ó Fátharta|first=Conall|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=3 June 2015|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
In tandem with carrying out the investigations outlined in the Terms of Reference, the  Commission was also empowered to establish a "Confidential Committee", with the aim of providing a forum for former residents and staff of the named institutions to provide accounts of their experiences.  Such accounts may be used to inform relevant investigations, and the Confidential Committee is to publish a report on the accounts received.&lt;ref name="TOR" /&gt;

The Commission also includes a literature-based academic social history module, in order to establish an objective and comprehensive historical analysis of significant relevant matters. The Commission is to rely on this analysis as evidence to inform its investigations and to assist it in framing its findings and conclusions within the wider social and historical context of the relevant period under investigation.&lt;ref name="TOR" /&gt;

==Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home==
{{main|Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home}}
The Commission was brought into being following extensive worldwide media coverage of claims that the remains of up to 800 children had been interred in an unmarked mass grave, believed to be a disused septic tank, on the grounds of the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway.  In 2014, a local amateur historian, [[Catherine Corless]], had published an article documenting the deaths of 796 babies and toddlers at the Home during its decades of operation. There were death certificates for 796 infants, but no burial records, which raised fears of a mass grave.&lt;ref name=beeb23oc18/&gt; The report noted that the most commonly recorded causes of death among the infants were congenital debilities, infectious diseases and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan|first1=Pamela|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/file-contains-details-of-babies-born-in-institutions-1.1868407|title=File contains details of babies born in institutions|accessdate=31 March 2017|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article claimed that the bodies were buried in a site at the Home and that there was a high death rate of its residents.&lt;ref name="explainer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Explainer: What is happening with the possible mass grave of children found in Tuam?|url=http://jrnl.ie/1502773|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/baby-deaths-now-gardai-probe-the-tuam-mass-grave-30337463.html|title=Baby deaths: now Gardai probe the Tuam 'mass grave'|publisher=Sunday Independent|date=8 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research led her to conclude that almost all had been buried in an unmarked and unregistered site at the Home, with Corless believing that the site was also the location of a [[septic tank]] when overlaid with maps of the period of use as a workhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/catherine-corless-tuam-mother-and-baby-home-3268501-Mar2017/|title=She was right: How Catherine Corless uncovered what happened in Tuam|last=Bohan|first=Christine|publisher=TheJournal.ie|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/mass-grave-of-796-babies-found-in-septic-tank-at-catholic-orphanage-in-tuam-galway-30327483.html|title=Mass grave of 796 babies found in septic tank at Catholic orphanage in Tuam, Galway|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Almost 800 infants buried in unmarked graves in Tuam, County Galway|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27681076|work=[[BBC]]|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/13/a-survivor-recalls-the-mother-and-baby-home-at-tuam-in-ireland-where-friends-just-disappeared-one-after-the-other/|title=The 'mother and baby home' at Tuam, Ireland, where friends just 'disappeared, one after the other'|last=Barbash|first=Fred|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]] came under pressure to launch an investigation, which eventually resulted in the establishment of the Commission in February 2015.&lt;ref name="CBC News 3 June 2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/796-irish-orphans-buried-in-mass-grave-near-catholic-orphanage-historian-1.2663895|title= 796 Irish orphans buried in mass grave near Catholic orphanage: historian|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=3 June 2014|accessdate=6 June 2014|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith-Spark|first=Laura|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/04/world/europe/ireland-children-bodies-tuam|title=Anger grows over reported mass grave of children from Irish unwed mothers home|date=5 June 2014|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/ireland-tuam-babies-mass-grave-allegations-must-spark-urgent-investigation-2014-06-05|title=Ireland: 'Tuam babies' mass grave allegations must spark urgent investigation|date=5 June 2014|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excavations===
As part of its investigations, the Commission ordered excavations of the suspected burial site in Tuam to be carried out.  On 3 March 2017, the Commission announced that multiple human remains had been found during excavations carried out between November 2016 and February 2017 at the site. Tests conducted on some of the remains indicated they had been aged between 35 foetal weeks and 2–3 years.  The announcement confirmed that the deceased died during the period of time that the property was used by the Mother and Baby Home, not from an earlier period, as most of the bodies dated from the 1920s to the 1950s.  The remains were found in an "underground structure divided into 20 chambers."  The Commission said "it had not yet determined what the purpose of this structure was but it appeared to be a sewage tank. The commission had also not yet determined if it was ever used for this purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mbhcoi.ie/MBH.nsf/page/index-en|title=Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation |work=Mother and Baby Home Commission|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/tuam-babies-significant-quantities-of-human-remains-found-at-former-home-1.2996599|title=Tuam babies: 'Significant' quantities of human remains found at former home|last=Edwards|first=Elaine|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/world/europe/ireland-tuam-mother-and-baby-home.html|title=Infant and Fetus Remains Are Found at Ex-Home for Unwed Mothers in Ireland|last=O’Shea|first=Sinead|work=[[New York Times]]|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission stated that it was continuing its investigation into who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way, and that it had notified the coroner.

====Reactions to excavation find====
In 2017 Minister for Children [[Katherine Zappone]] said that the coroner's results would determine the direction of the investigation and that the Commission would determine if other sites needed to be excavated, including another part of the Tuam site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/tuam-mother-and-baby-home-remains-3268601-Mar2017/|title=Tuam babies: Next steps in finding the truth behind their deaths|last=Barry|first=Aoife|publisher=TheJournal.ie|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adoption Rights Alliance and Justice for Magdalenes Research campaign groups demanded that Zappone publish a five-month-old report from the Commission on the issue of broadening the probe's terms of reference beyond the original 18 institutions included, and said the state must ensure that all human remains buried in unmarked graves at institutions in Ireland are identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0303/857084-mother-and-baby-homes-report/|title=Zappone urged to publish mother and baby homes report|publisher=RTÉ|date=3 March 2017|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The report was published in April 2017; the delay, according to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, was due to the report being referred to the Attorney General for advice on the report's recommendations on the issue of redress.)&lt;ref name="DCYA4179" /&gt;

[[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] described the find as "truly appalling", saying "the babies of single mothers involved had been treated like some kind of sub-species." He commended the work of Catherine Corless in bringing the issue to light.&lt;ref name="RTE20170306"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0306/857599-tuam-mother-and-baby-home/|title=Kenny says find of human remains at Tuam site 'truly appalling'|publisher=RTÉ|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the find in [[Dáil Éireann]], in response to requests to widen the terms of reference of the Commission, he described the Mother and Baby Home as "a chamber of horrors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/tuam-mother-and-baby-home-was-chamber-of-horrors-taoiseach-tells-the-dil-35509711.html|title=Tuam Mother and Baby home was 'chamber of horrors' – Taoiseach tells the Dáil|last=Downing|first=John|publisher=Irish Independent|date=7 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We gave them up maybe to spare them the savagery of gossip, the wink and the elbow language of delight in which the holier than thous were particularly fluent. We gave them up because of our perverse, in fact, morbid relationship with what is called respectability. Indeed, for a while it seemed as if in Ireland our women had the amazing capacity to self-impregnate.

In the same debate, [[Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit|AAA-PBP]] T.D. [[Bríd Smith]] called for the Bon Secours order of nuns to be disbanded. She said "its hospital empire, the biggest private hospital group in the State, was built on the bones of the dead Tuam babies."  Smith said "everyone was not responsible for what happened in Tuam. It was paid for by the state, which knew exactly what was going on, and there were 'headage payments' of up to [[US$]]3,000 for each child sent to the United States."&lt;ref name="IT20170307" /&gt;

The Taoiseach's speech was criticised by some. In the Dáil, [[Catherine Connolly]] directly addressed the speech, stating: 
{{Quote|text=A shocking discovery, according to everyone, and particularly to yourself Taoiseach. But this is something that Galway has been aware of for a long time, highlighted by Catherine Corless back in 2014, in her painstaking and self-funded research. By the witnesses, the many, many women who went before the commission of inquiry into child abuse which culminated in the Ryan Report, as far back as 2009. They told their stories about their experience in Mother and Baby Homes. It was brought to the attention of [[Martin McAleese]] when he concluded his report on the Magdalene laundries. So none of this is shocking to the survivors. What is shocking to the survivors, and to me, is the carefully crafted words that you’ve come into the chamber with. And, in particular, that you say 'no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children', 'we gave them up to what we convinced ourselves was the nuns' care' and so on. I don’t doubt your bona fides, a thaoisigh, but I certainly doubt your judgement in reading that out, a carefully crafted speech with a sentence like that in these circumstances. My question: please answer. Where is the interim report that has sat with the minister since September last year?

Leader of [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Micheál Martin]] T.D., called for a state apology for the infants, a commemoration to be held for them, and for the expansion of the Commission of Inquiry to include other institutions and sites.&lt;ref name="IE20170308"/&gt;

The Minister for Justice, [[Frances Fitzgerald (politician)|Frances Fitzgerald]], stated that "the discovery is an infinitely sad reminder of an Ireland that was a very harsh, harsh place for women and their babies" and that "it shows the tortured relationship the State and church had with pregnant women—it is a tragedy that we are now facing in its entirety."&lt;ref name="RTE20170306" /&gt;

The Catholic Archbishop of Tuam, [[Michael Neary (bishop)|Michael Neary]], said that he was horrified by the confirmation that significant quantities of human remains were buried on the site of a former mother and baby home in the town. Describing the news as "a body blow", he said he had been "greatly shocked to learn of the scale of the practice during the time in which the Bon Secours ran the mother and baby home in Tuam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0305/857331-tuam-mother-and-baby-home/|title=Archbishop of Tuam 'horrified' by discovery at mother and baby home|publisher=RTÉ|date=5 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference]] apologised for the hurt caused by its part in the system, which they said also involved adoptions. They also urged parishes to ensure that the burial sites of former residents were appropriately marked, and said that "the appalling story of life, death and adoptions related to the Mother and Baby Homes has shocked everyone in Ireland and beyond."&lt;ref name="RTÉ20170308"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0308/858071-tuam-mother-and-baby-home-survivor/|title=Tuam blows open locked doors of hidden Ireland - President Higgins|publisher=RTÉ|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="II20170309"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mother-and-baby-homes-probe-under-pressure-to-test-for-further-remains-35514866.html|title=Mother and Baby homes probe under pressure to test for further remains|last=O'Regan|first=Eilish|publisher=Irish Independent|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Ireland]], [[Michael D. Higgins]], speaking about the find at an [[International Women's Day]] reception, said there "are dark shadows that hang over our meeting, shadows that require us all to summon up yet again a light that might dispel the darkness to which so many women and their children were condemned, and the questions left unanswered as we moved on." President Higgins described Catherine Corless' work as "another necessary step in blowing open the locked doors of a hidden Ireland."&lt;ref name="RTÉ20170308" /&gt;

===Investigation team===
In June 2017, Minister Zappone announced the appointment of a team of international experts, comprising an Irish-based forensic archaeologist, a US-based forensic anthropologist and a UK-based forensic scientist, to investigate the burial site.  Zappone also said that she was considering broadening the terms of reference for the Commission, in order to "help to answer some of the questions which have been raised again in public debate."  The team is led by Dr. Niamh McCullagh, who previously worked with the [[Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains]] in Northern Ireland and the [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command|Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Command]] that aimed to locate the bodies of war dead.

Zappone stated that McCullagh will identify options for government, looking at the possibility of exhuming the remains and identifying if there are any further remains on the site that have yet to be discovered.&lt;ref name="jrnl170601"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/zappone-tuam-team-3420934-Jun2017/|title='Today is about Tuam': Catherine Corless commends Zappone for appointing experts to investigate burial site|last=Murray|first=Sean|publisher=The Journal.ie|date=1 June 2017|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is due to complete its final report in September 2017.&lt;ref name="DCYA20170707"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/MotherandBabyInfoPage.htm|title=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|publisher=[[Department of Children and Youth Affairs]]|date=7 July 2017|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the team conducted an extensive geophysical survey on the site. This consisted of data collection through a variety of non-invasive techniques, over the course of 5 days.  The team liaised with the Coroner for North Galway, An Garda Síochána, the National Monuments Services and Forensic Science Ireland, and advice was received from the International Committee for the Red Cross.&lt;ref name="DCYA_Rep_1708"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/MonthlyUpdateonIssuesrelatingtoMotherandBabyHomesAugust2017.pdf|title=Monthly Update on Issues relating to Mother and Baby Homes - August 2017|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=4 August 2017|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Pope Francis]] visited Ireland in August 2018, Zappone raised the issue of the Tuam home in a meeting with him, and told him "I hope the Church will make reparation for its part in this shameful chapter,"&lt;ref name=beeb23oc18/&gt;

In October 2018 Zappone announced that the remains of children buried in unmarked graves were to be exhumed, identified forensically, and reburied respectfully. The operation would not be straightforward, and presented "unprecedented technical and legal issues".&lt;ref name=beeb23oc18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45956512 |title=Tuam babies: Remains of children to be exhumed from mass grave|website=BBC News|date=23 October 2018  |author= |accessdate= 23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional issues==
In May 2018, Tusla (the Child and Family Agency) referred 126 files to the Commission regarding births that had been falsely registered by the Saint Patrick's Guild adoption agency.  In a press release, Minister Zappone said: "We have known about the practice of incorrect registrations for many years, but it has been extremely difficult to identify and prove in individual cases because of the deliberate failure of those involved to keep records. However, Tusla has found clear evidence in the case of some records previously held by St Patrick’s Guild."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/20180605Mother&amp;BabyHomeJuneEzine.pdf|title=Monthly Update on Issues Relating to Mother and Baby Homes, June 2018|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=June 2018|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
===Commission reports===
The Commission was originally due to issue a final report by February 2018, but was given a one-year extension in December 2017.&lt;ref name="RTÉ20171205" /&gt;  The report may include recommendations, including recommendations relating to "relevant matters that it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest."&lt;ref name="TOR" /&gt;  It had been due to issue an interim report in 2016, but when published, this report consisted solely of a request for a time extension to 2018 due to the large number of people wanting to make submissions to the Confidential Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/mother-and-baby-homes-commission-granted-extension-412807.html|title=Mother and Baby Homes Commission granted externsion|last=Ó Fátharta|first=Conall|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=28 July 2016|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A second interim report was issued to the Minister in September 2016 and was published in April 2017.  The delay, according to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, was due to the report being referred to the Attorney General for advice on the report's recommendations on the issue of redress.&lt;ref name="DCYA4179"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/docs/Commission_on_Mother_and_Baby_Homes_Second_Interim_Report_published/4179.htm|title=Commission on Mother and Baby Homes: Second Interim Report published today|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third interim report was published in December 2017.&lt;ref name="DCYA20171205"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=4501|title=Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes: Third Interim Report; Statement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr Katherine Zappone TD|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=6 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206102517/https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=4501|archivedate=6 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the report and announcing the time extension for its final report, Minister Zappone said:

{{Quote|text=When I recently met with the Commission I was again reassured by their absolute commitment to establish the full facts of what happened to women and children in these institutions. It is important that we do not underestimate the complexity of this task and we must not compromise the process of establishing the truth by leaving any stone uncovered or taking any shortcuts. |author=Katerine Zappone&lt;ref name="DCYA20171205" /&gt;}}

The third interim report reveals that legally enforceable discovery orders relating to the records of Catholic religious congregations that ran most of the homes have been issued but the Commission states that "some have very little material available while others have provided extensive material."  Government Departments, local authorities and the HSE have also been issued with discovery orders.

The issues raised in the Commission's third report include:

* the time-consuming nature of investigations: "in particular, the Commission has spent considerable time trying to establish the burial practices in the mother and baby home in Tuam (Co Galway)"; and the electronic scanning of records held by the [[Tusla|Child and Family Agency [Tusla]]].

* "There are significant gaps" in the material available on institutions "and further searches have to be made to try to fill these gaps. For example, the records of some of the various health authorities are proving difficult to find. It is not clear if they have been lost or destroyed or simply that no one knows where they are. This may be due to the changes in structures over the years - from local authorities/Board of Guardians/Boards of Public Assistance to Health Boards and then to the HSE and, in some cases, to the Child and Family Agency. The Commission is continuing its efforts to find this material."

* "While there are detailed death records available, there are significant gaps in the information available about the burials of babies who died in a number of the institutions under investigation. The Commission is continuing to make inquiries about burials and burial records but it appears that this is an area in which it will be difficult to establish the facts.

* "The Commission has heard evidence from 140 individuals about conditions in the institutions. These include former residents, workers and representatives of the authorities who ran the institutions. This process is not yet complete and, particularly in respect of the authorities who ran the institutions, cannot be completed until all the documentary evidence has been analysed."&lt;ref name="RTÉ20171205JL"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/1205/925261-mother-and-baby/|title=Mother and baby home Commission facing challenges|last=Little|first=Joe|publisher=RTÉ|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departmental reports===
In July 2017, Minister Zappone announced that in addition to the Commission progressing its independent investigations, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would separately report each month on the measures being progressed across Government to respond to the issues which have emerged so far from the work of the Commission.&lt;ref name="DCYA20170707" /&gt;

The first such monthly report was published on 7 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/mother_and_baby_homes/20170707MonthlyUpdateonIssuesRelatingtoMotherandBabyHomesJuly2017.pdf|title=Monthly Update on Issues relating to Mother and Baby Homes - July 2017|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=7 July 2017|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second report was published on 4 August 2017.&lt;ref name="DCYA_Rep_1708" /&gt;

The third report was published on 1 September 2017, and announced that the Expert Technical Group was working with, among others, the [[Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team]], who are world leaders in humanitarian forensic action and best practices in relation to community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/mother_and_baby_homes/20170901MonthlyUpdateIssuesMotherBabyHomes.PDF|title=Monthly Update on Issues relating to Mother and Baby Homes - September 2017|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=1 September 2017|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expert Technical Group report====
In December 2017, the Expert Technical Group reported to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, outlining five possible courses of action on the Tuam site.&lt;ref name="ETGFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/mother_and_baby_homes/20171212FAQsTuam.pdf|title=Government publishes the final Report of the Expert Technical Group on the Options and Appropriate Courses of Action available at the Tuam Mother and Baby Home|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=12 December 2017|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DCYA20171212"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FMotherandBabyInfoPage.htm|title=Minister Zappone publishes Expert Technical Group Report on the site of the former Tuam Mother and Baby Home - Public consultation will inform decisions on the future of the site|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=12 December 2017|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are:
* '''Memorialisation''': No further investigative work; Return the site to being managed as a memorial; Make site safe for public access.
* '''Exhume known human remains''': Recover human remains interred in the chambered structure identified to date and reinter elsewhere; No further forensic analysis of remains.
* '''Forensic excavation and recovery of known human remains''': Complete forensic archaeological excavation, recovery and analysis of human remains from the chambers identified to date.
* '''Forensic excavation and recovery, and further evaluation/ excavation of other areas of potential burial/ interest''': Complete forensic excavation and recovery of all human remains in memorial garden and any other targeted area, following geophysical survey, assessment of witness statements, historical records, etc.
* '''Forensic excavation of total available area''': Full forensic and archaeological excavation of all available ground formerly occupied by the M&amp;B Home. A total of 0.4 hectares, comprising memorial garden, playground, car park etc. Excludes private built areas (houses and gardens etc. subsequently built on the former site).&lt;ref name="ETGtech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/mother_and_baby_homes/20171212TechnicalOptionsTuam.pdf|title=Expert Team: Options for Tuam Site|publisher=Department of Children and Youth Affairs|date=12 December 2017|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappone said that before any decision was taken on the option to be used, she first wanted to consult with the local community in Tuam and other affected parties, such as relatives of those who were resident in the home. She said the consultation process, which would be undertaken by Galway County Council, would take three months.&lt;ref name="IT20180105"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/tuam-survivors-we-want-that-site-fully-excavated-1.3345910|title=Tuam survivors: "We want that site fully excavated"|last=Edwards|first=Elaine|publisher=The Irish Times|date=5 January 2018|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tuam Home Survivors Network said its members had given careful consideration to the Expert Technical Group's report and that the only appropriate action was "a complete excavation of the Tuam site to ensure the recovery of all human remains contained there." The Network are also seeking postmortems in respect of each set of human remains and cataloguing of DNA from all remains in order to create the most complete database possible.&lt;ref name="IT20180105" /&gt;

The Technical Group also identified a number of human rights issues which were outside its terms of reference. Zappone has appointed human rights expert and Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Professor Geoffrey Shannon, to examine these issues and to report to her on his findings.&lt;ref name="IT20180105" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
The scope of the Investigation and in particular its restriction to just a limited number of named homes has been criticised by, among others, the United Nations [[UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW).&lt;ref name="IT_CEDAW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/mother-and-baby-homes-investigation-too-narrow-says-un-1.3000124|title=Mother and baby homes investigation too narrow, says UN|last=Holland|first=Kitty|publisher=The Irish Times|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 report, it stated that the Commission of Investigation "is narrow such that it does not cover all homes and analogous institutions [and] therefore may not address the whole spectrum of abuses perpetrated against women and girls."&lt;ref name="IT_CEDAW" /&gt;
{{Quote|text=The committee therefore urges the State party to conduct prompt, independent and thorough investigations, in line with international human rights standards, into all allegations of abuse in Magdalene laundries, children's institutions, Mother and Baby homes, and symphysiotomy in order to prosecute and punish the perpetrators of those involved in violations of women's rights. All victims/survivors of such abuse obtain an effective remedy including appropriate compensation, official apologies, restitution, satisfaction and rehabilitative services. |author=UN CEDAW&lt;ref name="IT_CEDAW" /&gt;}}

The delay in publishing a final report and the fact that redress for victims of the homes will not be considered until the final report has been published has been criticised by survivors, including the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors (CMABS). Paul Redmond, chairperson of CMABS, said that many survivors are now elderly and have already died since the revelations about Tuam first emerged, and that "This is yet another delaying tactic by the Government to deny survivors truth and justice. The current inquiry is already too limited and excludes many survivors and this delay will now ensure that thousands more survivors are denied justice by death."&lt;ref name="RTÉ20171205" /&gt;

Only in [[Baku]] there are more than 20 associations of [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Kurds]], [[Lacquer]]s, [[Lezgins]], [[Slavs]], [[Tatars]], [[Georgians]], [[Ingiloy people]], [[Talysh people]], [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]], [[Meskhetian Turks]], [[European Jews|Europeans]] and [[Mountain Jews]], [[Georgian Jews]], [[Germans]] and [[Greeks]]. Generally, there are such associations that live in a compact form in all regions.

== Minor nations ==

There are more than ten places where minor nations such as mountain Jews- [[Qırmızı Qəsəbə|Red Town]] (Qırmızı Qəsəbə which is well known Krasnaya Sloboda), [[İvanovka|Molokan Village Ivanovka]], Village of [[Udi people|Udin people -]] [[Nij, Azerbaijan|Nij]], [[Khinalug people|Khinalugs]] with their famous language,  specific customs and traditions are living in [[Azerbaijan]]. There are some ethnic minorities, also [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgian]], [[Tat people (Caucasus)|tat]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]] and other minor nations that are represented by their members in the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|National Assembly]].

== Qırmızı Qəsəbə (Krasnaya Sloboda) ==
{{Main|Qırmızı Qəsəbə}}
Qırmızı Qəsəbə people speak in 3 languages: [[Judeo-Tat]] which mountain Jews speak in daily life, the Russian and Azerbaijani language. All lessons are conducted in one of two schools in Russian language and in another one in Azerbaijani language. But at the same time, Hebrew language which is the native language of Jews is taught at both schools. Also, school books in their own language are prepared for them in [[Azerbaijan]]. Today, around 4-5 thousand Jews live in [[Qırmızı Qəsəbə|Krasnaya Sloboda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advantour.com/azerbaijan/quba/red-village.htm|title=Red Village – Settlement of Mountain Jews|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/112/504c92fb/|title=JEWS IN AZERBAIJAN: A HISTORY SPANNING THREE MILLENNIA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kitabi Dede Gorgud.jpg|thumb|165x165px]]

The history of multiculturalism in Azerbaijan nation is not only described in the current tolerant lifestyle of people, but also in the created documents related to the literary, scientific-philosophical and political-legal sources. Multiculturalism and propagation of universal values can be encountered in the literature from epos ‘’[[Book of Dede Korkut|Kitabi-dede Gorgud]]’’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aton.ttu.edu/turkishlist.asp|title=Kitabi-dede Gorgud|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the newest ones and in Medieval Azerbaijani poetry respectively. The creator of artistic creativity examples and well known [[Nizami Ganjavi]] can be especially highlighted. He wrote ‘’Yeddi Gozel’’ ([[The Seven Beauties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar|title=HAFT PEYKAR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that included seven different cultures in the 12th century.

==History and origin==

The community derives its name from the word nata, which means widow remarriage in [[Hindi]]. This practice, initially adopted by a group of [[Chauhan]] [[Rajput]]s in [[Marwar]], and this led to their separation from the wider [[Rajput]] community, which disallows widow remarriage. The community also include a small number [[Parmara|Panwar]], [[Parihar]] and [[Rathore]].  The Natrayat are distributed in the transitional zone between [[Mewar]] and [[Marwar]], occupying several villages in this hilly region.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D.

'''Neo-Victorianism''' is an [[aesthetic]] movement which amalgamates [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] aesthetic sensibilities with modern principles and technologies. A large number of magazines and websites are devoted to Neo-Victorian ideas in [[dress]], [[family]] life, [[interior decoration]], [[morals]], and other topics.

A large number of neo-Victorian novels have reinterpreted, reproduced and rewritten Victorian culture. Significant texts include ''The French Lieutenant’s Woman'' ([[John Fowles]], 1969), ''Possession'' ([[A. S. Byatt]], 1990), ''Arthur and George'' ([[Julian Barnes]], 2005), ''Dorian, An Imitation'' ([[Will Self]], 2002) ''[[Jack Maggs]]'' ([[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], 1997), ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' ([[Jean Rhys]], 1966).
Recent neo-Victorian novels have often been adapted to the screen, from ''The French Lieutenant’s Woman'' (Karel Reisz, 1981) to the television adaptations of [[Sarah Waters]] (''[[Tipping the Velvet (TV series)|Tipping the Velvet]]'', BBC2, 2002, ''[[Fingersmith (TV serial)|Fingersmith]] '', BBC1, 2005, ''[[Affinity (film)|Affinity]] '' ITV, 2008) and [[Michel Faber]] (''[[The Crimson Petal and the White (miniseries)|The Crimson Petal and the White]]'', BBC 1, 2011). These narratives may indicate a 'sexsation' of neo-Victorianism [http://inter-disciplinary.net/ci/transformations/sexualities/s3/Kohlke%20paper.pdf (Kohlke)] and have been called 'in-yer-face' neo-Victorianism (Voigts-Virchow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voigts-Virchow|first1=Eckart|title='In-yer-Victorian-face: A Subcultural Hermeneutics of  Neo-Victorianism|journal=LIT: Literature Interpretation Theory|date=2009|volume=20|issue=1–2|pages=108–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent productions of neo-Victorianism on screen include [[Guy Ritchie]]’s [[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]] films, the BBC’s ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' (2010-), ''[[Ripper Street]]'' (2012-16), ITV’s ''[[Whitechapel (TV series)|Whitechapel]] '' (2009–13) or the Showtime series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014-2016). The neo-Victorian formula can be expanded to include Edwardian consumer culture (''[[Downton Abbey]]'', ITV 2010-2015, ''[[The Paradise (TV series)|The Paradise]]'', BBC 2012-2013) and ''[[Mr Selfridge]]'' (ITV 2013-2016).

In September 2007, [[Exeter University]] explored the phenomenon in a major international conference titled ''Neo-Victorianism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Appropriation''.&lt;ref&gt;https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/31784&lt;/ref&gt; Academic studies include ''Neo-Victorianism: The Victorians in the Twenty-First Century, 1999–2009''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heilmann|first=Ann|title=Neo-Victorianism : the Victorians in the twenty-first century, 1999-2009|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-230-24113-8|author2=Llewellyn, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other foundational texts of neo-Victorian criticism are Kucich and Sadoff (2000), Kaplan (2007), Kohlke (2008-), Munford and Young (2009), Mitchell (2010), Davies (2012), Whelehan (2012), Kleinecke-Bates (2014), Böhm-Schnitker and Gruss (2014) and others.

==In arts and crafts==
Examples of crafts made in this style would include push-button [[cordless telephone]]s made to look like antique wall-mounted phones, [[CD player]]s resembling old time radios, Victorianesque furniture, and [[Victorian era]]-style clothing.

In [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] and fantasy art one can often see the elements of Victorian aesthetic values.  There is also a strongly emerging genre of [[steampunk]] art. [[McDermott &amp; McGough]] are a couple of contemporary artists whose work is all about a recreation of life in the nineteenth century: they only use the ultimate technology available, and since they are supposed to live anachronistically, this means the use of earlier photographic processes, and maintaining the illusion of a life stuck in the ways of a forgotten era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=David|title=&amp; :A History of Photography|year=1998|publisher=Arena Editions|location=Santa Fe|isbn=978-0965728027|edition=1st|author2=McGough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In dress and behaviour==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
Many who have adopted Neo-Victorian style have also adopted Victorian behavioural affectations, seeking to imitate standards of Victorian conduct, pronunciation, interpersonal interaction. Some even go so far as to embrace certain Victorian habits such as shaving with [[straight razors]], riding [[penny farthing]]s, exchanging [[visiting card|calling cards]], and using [[fountain pen]]s to write letters in [[Purple prose|florid prose]] sealed by wax. [[Gothic fashion]] sometimes incorporates Neo-Victorian style.

Neo-Victorianism is embraced in, but also quite distinguished from, the [[Lolita fashion|Lolita]], [[Aristocrat (fashion)|Aristocrat]] and [[Madam (fashion)|Madam]] fashions popular in Japan, and which are becoming more noticeable in Europe.

==Social conservatives==

Neo-Victorian [[aesthetic]]s are also popular in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] among [[cultural conservatives]] and  [[social conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladiesagainstfeminism.com/artman/publish/LAF_Theme_Articles_13/Is_This_a_Victorian_Site_41004.shtml |title=Is This a "Victorian" Site? |publisher=Ladiesagainstfeminism.com |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Books such as ''The Benevolence of Manners: Recapturing the Lost Art of Gracious Victorian Living'' call for a return to [[Victorian morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichter|first=Linda S.|title=The Benevolence of Manners: Recapturing the Lost Art of Gracious Victorian Living|year=1999|publisher=ReganBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0060987459|edition=1st ReganBooks/Harper Perennial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Neo-Victorian is also commonly used in a derogatory way towards social conservatives.

The cultural social attitudes and conventions that many associate with the Victorian era are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rambles.net/sweet_victorians.html |author=Nicky Rossiter |title=Matthew Sweet: Inventing the Victorians |publisher=Rambles.net |date=2003-03-08 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many of the things that seem commonplace in modern life began in the Victorian era, such as sponsorship, sensational journalism and popular merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweet|first=Matthew|title=Inventing the Victorians|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0312283261|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture and literature==
Neo-Victorianism can also be seen in the growing [[steampunk]] genre of [[speculative fiction]] and in music performers such as [[Emilie Autumn]]. Neo-Victorianism is also popular with, and in many ways prefigured by, those who are interested in [[Victoriana]] and [[historical reenactment]].

Neo-Victorian details appear in ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=Neal|title=The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer|year=2003|publisher=Bamtam Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0553380965|edition=Bantam trade pbk. reissue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Neo-Victorians are one of the main groups of protagonists.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:French words and phrases]]}}
'''''Première dame d'honneur''''' ('First lady of honour'), or simply ''dame d'honneur'' ('lady of honour'), was an office at the royal court of France. It existed in nearly all French courts from the 16th-century onward. Though the tasks of the post shifted, the dame d'honneur was normally the first or second rank of all ladies-in-waiting. The dame d'honneur was selected from the members of the highest [[French nobility]].

==History==
The office was created in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline zum Kolk, "The Household of the Queen of France in the Sixteenth Century", in: ''The Court Historian''; vol. 14, number 1, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The task of the dame d'honneur was to supervise the female courtiers, control the budget, order necessary purchases, and organize the annual account and staff list; she supervised the daily routine, and attended both ordinary and ceremonial court functions, as well as escorting and introducing those seeking audience with the queen.&lt;ref name= Akkerman &gt;Nadine Akkerman &amp; Birgit Houben, eds. ''The Politics of Female Households: Ladies-in-waiting across Early Modern Europe''.  Leiden: Brill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She had the keys to the queen's personal rooms in her possession.&lt;ref name = Akkerman/&gt; 

When the dame d'honneur was absent, she was replaced by the ''[[dame d'atour]]'', who normally had the responsibility of overseeing the queen's wardrobe and jewelry in addition to dressing the queen.&lt;ref name = Akkerman/&gt; 

In 1619, the office of the ''[[Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine]]'', or simply ''surintendante'', was created.&lt;ref name = Akkerman/&gt; The surintendante had roughly the same tasks as the dame d'honneur -- receiving the oath of the female personnel before they took office, supervising the daily routine of the staff and the queen, organizing the accounts and staff list -- but she was placed in rank above the dame d'honneur.&lt;ref name = Akkerman /&gt; Whenever the surintendante was absent, she was replaced by the dame d'honneur.&lt;ref name = Akkerman /&gt; The post of surintendante could be left vacant for long periods, such as between the death of [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1697–1741)|Marie Anne de Bourbon]] in 1741 and the appointment of [[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy]] in 1775.

The term dame d'honneur has also been used as a general term for a French lady-in-waiting. From 1523, the group of ladies-in-waiting attending the court as companions of the queen had the title dame d'honneur ('Lady of Honour', commonly only 'dame'), hence the title 'Première dame d'honneur' ('First lady of honur') to distinguish between the chief lady-in-waiting and the remaining (married) ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline zum Kolk, "The Household of the Queen of France in the Sixteenth Century", in: ''The Court Historian'', vol. 14, number 1, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674, however, a reform replaced the positions of both the common married dame d'honneur as well as the unmarried fille d'honneur ('maid of honour') with the ''dame de palais''.&lt;ref name=duindam&gt;Jeroen Frans Jozef Duindam: Vienna and Versailles: The Courts of Europe's Dynastic Rivals, 1550-1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of dame d'honneur was revived during the First Empire, when the principal lady-in-waiting to the empress held the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mansel: ''The Eagle in Splendour: Inside the Court of Napoleon''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second Empire, the dame d'honneur had the same position as before, but was now formally ranked second below a surintendante with the title ''Grande-Maîtresse''.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, Desmond: ''Eugénie. An empress and her empire''. {{ISBN|0-7509-2979-0}} (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and activities==

Founded by [[Michael Karlan]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]] formerly with [[Covington &amp; Burling]], PNC hosts events showcasing its host cities’ diverse offerings, including their nightlife, arts, cultural and sporting events, and unique neighborhoods.

Many of their events have a [[matchmaking]] focus, such as four-minute [[speed dating]]. Pros in the City also hosts various local [[dating coach]]es who give seminars on general principles of dating and attraction as well as specific topics such as body language.

In July 2009, Professionals in the City released a marketing video featuring its speed dating events, further emphasizing the group's increasing focus on singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CCSBAl_qS0  |title=Professionals in the City Speed Dating |accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the dating seminars, they offer many other self-improvement or educationally geared classes, including Spanish lessons, cooking for one, etc. as well as some that border on the risque such as cardio [[striptease]] and [[pole dancing]].

'''Sasoli''' ({{lang-bal| ساسولی }}) is a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribe in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]]. It is considered to be either a clan of the [[Zehri]] tribe and also a part of [[Burfat]] or Bulmat [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribe.&lt;ref name="Quddus 1990"&gt;{{cite book | title=The tribal Baluchistan| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBwrAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sasoli&amp;dq=sasoli| last=Quddus| first=Syed Abdul| year=1990| page=107| publisher=Ferozsons| isbn=9690100475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasoli is a very famous tribe of Baloch nation. The great forefather of Sasoli are Sardar Mir Sirajuddin Sasoli, Sardar Nasrullah Khan the Chief of Sasoli tribe, Sardar Allah Gul Khan Sasoli and Mir Meerka Khan Sasoli. The present Chief of the Sasoli tribe is Sardar Nasrullah Khan Sasoli and other Sardar Muhammad Gul Khan Sasoli. The Sasoli tribe native are settled in large number in Balochistan province. The Sasoli are bilingual speaking [[Balochi language|Balochi]] and [[Brahui language|Brahui]] languages. [[Urdu language|Urdu]] is also widely spoken. The Sasoli are also present in [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] provinces of Pakistan. According to the tribal traditions, the Sasoli tribe migrated from [[Aleppo]], in modern [[Syria]], along with other [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribes,. The Baloch people are also settled in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]].

}}

The '''South Halmahera–West New Guinea''' (SHWNG) languages are a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], found in the islands and along the shores of the [[Halmahera Sea]] in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[North Maluku]] and of [[Cenderawasih Bay]] in the provinces of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. 

The unity of the South Halmahera–West New Guinea subgroup is well supported by lexical and phonological evidence. Blust (1978) has proposed that they are most closely related to the [[Oceanic languages]], but this classification is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Blust, R. (1978). [https://dx.doi.org/10.15144/PL-C61.181 "Eastern Malayo-Polynesian: A Subgrouping Argument".] In Wurm, S.A. &amp; Carrington, L. (eds.) ''Second International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics: Proceedings'', pp. 181-234. Canberra: Australian National University. (Pacific Linguistics C-61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the languages are only known from short word lists, but [[Buli language (Indonesia)|Buli]] on Halmahera, and [[Biak language|Biak]] and [[Waropen language|Waropen]] in Cenderawasih Bay, are fairly well attested.

==Classification==
The traditional classification of the languages is into two geographic groups:
*South Halmahera languages (along the southeastern coast of [[Halmahera]], plus one language in the east of the [[Bomberai Peninsula]]). 
*West New Guinea languages (on the [[Raja Ampat Islands]] west of New Guinea, and the islands and shoreline of [[Cenderawasih Bay]]). 

However, the unity of the South Halmahera and Raja Ampat languages is supported by phonological changes noted in Blust 1978 and by Bert Remijsen, the principal researcher of the Raja Ampat languages.  This results in the following structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{glotto|raja1255|Raja Ampat–South Halmahera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Cenderawasih languages|Cenderawasih Bay]]'''
*'''[[Halmahera Sea languages|Halmahera Sea]]''' (South Halmahera, in the sea between Halmahera and New Guinea, and Raja Ampat off the western tip of New Guinea)

David Kamholz (2014) brings in or separates a few more languages as additional branches:
*Irarutu–Nabi: [[Irarutu language|Irarutu]], [[Kuri language (Austronesian)|Kuri]] (Nabi)
*Bedoanas–Erokwanas: [[Arguni language|Arguni]], [[Bedoanas language|Bedoanas]], [[Erokwanas language|Erokwanas]]
*[[Lower Mamberamo languages|Lower Mamberamo]] (if they are not Papuan)
*[[Mor language (Austronesian)|Mor]]
*[[Tandia language|Tandia]]
*[[Waropen language|Waropen]]

'''Thermal pollution''' is the degradation of [[water quality]] by any process that changes ambient water [[temperature]]. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the sudden change in temperature decreases [[oxygen]] supply and affects [[ecosystem]] composition. Fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by an abrupt change in water temperature (either a rapid increase or decrease) known as "Thermal shock."

[[Urban runoff]]—[[stormwater]] discharged to surface waters from [[road]]s and [[parking lot]]s—can also be a source of elevated water temperatures.

==Ecological effects==
[[File:Unit 3 - Potrero Power Plant.jpg|thumb|[[Potrero Generating Station]] discharged heated water into [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Selna, Robert (2009). [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/01/BAAS151F1U.DTL&amp;tsp=1 "Power plant has no plans to stop killing fish."] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]],'' January 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was closed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. [http://www.pge.com/about/environment/taking-responsibility/mgp/Potrero/site-overview.shtml "Potrero Power Plant: Site Overview."] Accessed 2012-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Warm water ===
Elevated temperature typically decreases the level of [[dissolved oxygen]] of water, as gases are less soluble in hotter liquids. This can harm aquatic animals such as fish, [[amphibians]] and other aquatic organisms. Thermal pollution may also increase the [[metabolic]] rate of aquatic animals, as [[enzyme]] activity, resulting in these organisms consuming more food in a shorter time than if their environment were not changed.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Pollution - Causes, Effects and Control |last=Goel |first=P.K. |year=2006 |publisher=New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-224-1839-2 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}} An increased metabolic rate may result in fewer resources; the more adapted organisms moving in may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperature. As a result, [[food chain]]s of the old and new environments may be compromised. Some fish species will avoid stream segments or coastal areas adjacent to a thermal discharge. [[Biodiversity]] can be decreased as a result.&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology of Estuaries&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Anthropogenic Effects |last=Kennish |first=Michael J. |series=Marine Science Series |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |isbn=978-0-8493-8041-9 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|415–17}}&lt;ref name="Laws"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aquatic Pollution: An Introductory Text |last=Laws |first=Edward A. |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-34875-7 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

High temperature limits oxygen dispersion into deeper waters, contributing to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions. This can lead to increased [[bacteria]] levels when there is ample food supply. Many aquatic species will fail to reproduce at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="Goel" /&gt;{{rp|179–80}}

[[Primary producer]]s (e.g. plants, [[cyanobacteria]]) are affected by warm water because higher water temperature increases plant growth rates, resulting in a shorter lifespan and species [[overpopulation]]. This can cause an [[algae bloom]] which reduces oxygen levels.

Temperature changes of even one to two degrees [[Celsius]] can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse [[cellular biology]] effects.  Principal adverse changes can include rendering cell walls less permeable to necessary [[osmosis]], coagulation of cell [[protein]]s, and alteration of [[enzyme]] [[metabolism]].  These cellular level effects can adversely affect [[death|mortality]] and [[reproduction]].

A large increase in temperature can lead to the denaturing of life-supporting enzymes by breaking down [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen]]- and [[disulphide bond]]s within the quaternary structure of the enzymes. Decreased enzyme activity in aquatic organisms can cause problems such as the inability to break down [[lipids]], which leads to [[malnutrition]].

In limited cases, warm water has little deleterious effect and may even lead to improved function of the receiving aquatic ecosystem. This phenomenon is seen especially in seasonal waters and is known as '''thermal enrichment.''' An extreme case is derived from the aggregational habits of the [[manatee]], which often uses power plant discharge sites during winter. Projections suggest that manatee populations would decline upon the removal of these discharges.

=== Cold water ===
Releases of unnaturally cold water from [[reservoir]]s can dramatically change the fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of rivers, and reduce river productivity. In [[Australia]], where many rivers have warmer temperature regimes, native fish species have been eliminated, and macroinvertebrate fauna have been drastically altered.  This may be mitigated by designing the dam to release warmer surface waters instead of the colder water at the bottom of the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mollyo|first1=Fran|title=A happier environment for fish|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-09-happier-environment-fish.html|accessdate=15 September 2015|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal shock ===
When a power plant first opens or shuts down for repair or other causes, fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by the abrupt change in water temperature, either an increase or decrease, known as "thermal shock".&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;ref name="Chiras"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |date=2012 |title=Environmental Science |location=Burlington, MA |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn=9781449614867}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|478}}

==Sources and control of thermal pollution==
[[File:Coal power plant Knepper 1.jpg|thumb|[[Cooling tower]] at [[Gustav Knepper Power Station]], [[Dortmund, Germany]]]]
 
=== Industrial wastewater ===
In the [[United States]], about 75 to 82 percent of thermal pollution is generated by power plants.&lt;ref name="Laws" /&gt;{{rp|335}} The remainder is from industrial sources such as [[petroleum refining|petroleum refineries]], [[pulp and paper mill]]s, [[chemical plant]]s, [[steel mill]]s and [[smelter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Washington, D.C. (May 2014). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/cooling-water_phase-4_tdd_2014.pdf "Technical Development Document for the Final Section 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule."] Document No. EPA 821-R-14-002. p 4-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (June 2006).

Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Heated water from these sources may be controlled with:
*[[Cooling pond]]s, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]
*[[cooling tower]]s, which transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through evaporation and/or [[heat transfer]]
*[[cogeneration]], a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic and/or industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/assistance/sectors/notebooks/fossil.html |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |author=EPA |date=1997 |series=Office of Compliance, Sector Notebook Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203095518/http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/assistance/sectors/notebooks/fossilsn.pdf |archive-date=2011-02-03 |page=24}} Document No. EPA/310-R-97-007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some facilities use '''once-through cooling''' (OTC) systems which do not reduce temperature as effectively as the above systems. For example, the [[Potrero Generating Station]] in [[San Francisco]] (closed in 2011), used OTC and discharged water to [[San Francisco Bay]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;°C (20&amp;nbsp;°F) above the ambient bay temperature.&lt;ref&gt;California Environmental Protection Agency.

[[File:Emeryville California Stormwater Curb Extension.jpg|thumb|A [[bioretention]] cell for treating urban runoff in California]]

=== Urban runoff ===
During warm weather, urban runoff can have significant thermal impacts on small streams, as storm water passes over hot parking lots, roads and sidewalks. Storm water management facilities that absorb runoff or direct it into [[groundwater]], such as [[bioretention]] systems and [[infiltration basin]]s, can reduce these thermal effects. These and related systems for managing runoff are components of an expanding [[urban design]] approach commonly called [[green infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/what-green-infrastructure |title=What is Green Infrastructure? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Retention basin]]s (stormwater ponds) tend to be less effective at reducing runoff temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (August 1999). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/urban-stormwater-bmps_preliminary-study_1999.pdf "Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices."] Document No. EPA-821-R-99-012. p. 5-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''urbarium''' ({{lang-de|Urbar}}, English: ''urbarium'', also ''rental'' or ''rent-roll'', {{lang-sk|urbár}}, {{lang-hu|urbárium}}), is a register of [[fief]] ownership and includes the rights and benefits that the fief holder has over his [[serf]]s and peasants.  It is an important economic and legal source of [[medieval]] and early modern [[feudalism]].

Urbaria were also used to record land rent and stock. Depending on the region and writing materials for these lists they are also called ''Salbuch'', ''Berain'', ''Heberegister'', ''Erdbuch'' ([[census]] book) ''Zins-Rödel'' or ''Rodel''.

The term is from the [[Old High German]] ''ur-beran'' or the [[Middle High German]] ''erbern'' for  "bring", "create" or "an income derived".  It was used for economic, administrative or legal purposes as a directory of real estate, taxation, and the services owed a land holder (such as a monastery or noble)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/urbariummariatheresa.html |title=Maria Theresa's Urbarium |last=Votruba |first=Martin |work=Slovak Studies Program |publisher=University of Pittsburgh }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands.  The panels of an urbarium, which may be recopied several times to create a clean copy, were either stored as a scroll ({{lang-de|Rödel}}) or the strips of parchment were sewn together to create a [[codex]],&lt;ref&gt;see Alfons Schäfer: ''Die ältesten Zinsrödel im Badischen Generallandesarchiv (Karlsruhe). Rödel als Vorläufer und Vorstufen der Urbare'', in: [[Zeitschrift für die Geschichte des Oberrheins]] (ZGO) 112 (1964), S. 297-372 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or were handwritten on preprinted forms in more recent centuries, as Empress [[Maria Theresa]]'s urbarial survey of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18792">'''William Frend''' (22 November 1757 – 21 February 1841) was an English clergyman (later Unitarian), social reformer and writer. After a high-profile university trial in Cambridge, which deprived him of his residency rights as fellow of his college, he became a leading figure in London radical circles.

==Early life==

He was born on 22 November 1757 at [[Canterbury]], the second son of George Frend, a tradesmen, [[alderman]], and twice [[Mayors of Canterbury (Kent)|its mayor]]. His mother was buried in the cloister yard on 7 February 1763, and his father married at [[Canterbury Cathedral|the cathedral]], on 25 September 1764, Jane Kirby. Frend was educated at [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]] until 1771; among his companions were his cousin [[Herbert Marsh]], and [[Charles Abbott, 1st Baron Tenterden|Charles Abbott]]. His father intended him for business, and he was sent to [[Saint-Omer]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] to learn French, and then to a mercantile house (trading company) in [[Quebec]], where he remained for a few weeks. During his time there he served as a volunteer at the beginning of the troubles with the American colonies.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Frend, William|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At Cambridge==
On his return home Frend expressed a wish to train for the ministry within the [[Church of England]], and on the recommendation of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Moore (archbishop of Canterbury)|John Moore]] he entered [[Christ's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=FRNT775W|name=Frend, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 December 1775, where [[William Paley]] was one of the college tutors. After gaining various college prizes he took the degree of B.A. in 1780, being [[second wrangler]] and winning [[Smith's Prize]]. Having gained the notice of [[Lynford Caryl]], Master of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], he migrated there, becoming a Fellow and tutor in 1781.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt;

At the end of 1780 he was admitted deacon in the Church of England, and advanced to the priesthood in 1783, when he was presented to the living of [[Madingley]], near Cambridge, where he officiated zealously until June 1787. During this period of his life the post of tutor to the Archduke Alexander of Russia was offered to him, but he declined it.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1787 Frend left the [[Church of England]], in which he had been ordained, to become a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. At that time, candidates for the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] had to "subscribe to" (state their belief in&amp;mdash;the literal meaning is "sign below") the [[Thirty-nine Articles]], the historically defining statements of doctrines of the Church of England with respect to the controversies of the [[English Reformation]]. Frend published his ‘Address to the Inhabitants of Cambridge’ in favour of his new creed, and he supported vigorously a proposal introduced into [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|the senate house]] (i.e. the governing body of the university) on 11 December 1787 that would render this statement of belief no longer necessary.

Frend was removed by [[Richard Beadon]] from the office of tutor by an order dated 27 September 1788, and his appeal was dismissed by [[Visitor|the visitor]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], by a decree dated 29 December 1788.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He took, in company with an old schoolfellow called Richard Tylden, a lengthy tour in France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, and Switzerland. When he returned home he resumed the study of Hebrew. [[Joseph Priestley]] devised in 1789 a plan for a new translation of the scriptures, with Frend, [[Michael Dodson]] and [[Theophilus Lindsey]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Priestley, Joseph|volume=46|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through 1790 Frend was engaged on translating the historical books of the Old Testament. He also became close to the Baptist [[Robert Robinson (Baptist)|Robert Robinson]], who died in 1790, and he corrected Robinson's posthumous volume of ''Ecclesiastical Researches''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Trial and aftermath==
In 1793 Frend wrote a tract entitled ''Peace and Union recommended to the Associated Bodies of Republicans and Anti-republicans'', in which he denounced abuses and condemned much of the [[liturgy]] of the church of England. On 4 March certain members of the senate met on the invitation of the vice-chancellor, Dr. [[Isaac Milner]], and resolved that Frend should be prosecuted in the vice-chancellor's court. They deputed a committee of five to conduct the proceedings, one of the leaders being [[Thomas Kipling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=15641|title=Kipling, Thomas|first=Robert|last=Hole}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April a summons was issued by that official requiring Frend's presence in the law schools on 3 May to answer the charge of having violated the laws and statutes of the university by publishing the pamphlet. After several sittings and a long defence by Frend, the vice-chancellor and heads gave their decision on 28 May that the authorship had been proved and that Frend had offended against the statute ‘de concionibus.’&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Frend was ordered to retract and confess his error, and as he declined was ‘banished from the university’ (30 May). An appeal against the sentence followed, and the university counsel including the barrister [[Simon Le Blanc]] became involved;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Le Blanc, Simon|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was unanimously affirmed by the delegates on 29 June, and on 26 November 1795 the [[Court of King's Bench]] discharged a rule which Frend had obtained for restoring him to the franchises of a resident M.A. The master and fellows of Jesus College decided, on 3 April 1793, that in consequence of this pamphlet he should not be allowed to reside in the college until he could produce satisfactory proofs of good behaviour. He thereupon appealed to the visitor, but on 13 July that appeal was dismissed. In spite of all these proceedings he enjoyed the emoluments of his fellowship until his marriage, and remained, while he lived, a member of his college and of the senate of the university.

==Accounts of the trial==
The proceedings attracted wide attention. One of Frend's supporters was [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], then an undergraduate. [[Henry Gunning]], in his ''Reminiscences'' (i. 280–309), reprints an account of the trial, and, while condemning the tone of the pamphlet, describes the proceedings as a party move and vindicates the tract from the accusation of sedition. He adds that the vice-chancellor was biased against the accused, and that the undergraduates, among whom Coleridge was conspicuous, were unanimous in his favour. [[Augustus De Morgan]] wrote that chalked graffiti "Frend for ever" appeared; bishop-to-be [[Herbert Marsh]] was apprehended, while two other future establishment pillars, [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|John Singleton Copley]] and [[William Rough]] escaped.&lt;ref name=Budget&gt;{{cite wikisource|wslink=Budget of Paradoxes/F|first=Augustus |last=De Morgan|author-link=Augustus De Morgan|title=A Budget of Paradoxes|date=1872|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner later wrote identifying Frend and his "party" in the university as "Jacobinical", and commenting that the trial had been a turning point for them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], ''Coleridge: Early Visions'' (1990), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial was described by Frend himself in 'An Account of the Proceedings in the University of Cambridge against William Frend,' 1793, and in 'A Sequel to the Account &amp;c.', which dealt with the application to the court of king's bench in 1795. [[John Beverley (administrator)|John Beverley]] also published accounts of the proceedings in 1793. Two letters from [[Richard Farmer]] to [[Samuel Parr]] on this trial are in Parr's ''Works'',&lt;ref&gt;Parr, Works, vol.i., pp.447–8&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same set&lt;ref&gt;Parr, Works, vol.viii., pp.30–2&lt;/ref&gt; is a long letter from Frend on the treatment which [[Thomas Fyshe Palmer]], another reformer, had just received.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Many years later, in 1837, Frend gave [[Henry Crabb Robinson]] some anecdotes about his trial; and said that the promoters wished to expel him from the university, but that he had demanded a sight of the university roll, and on reference to the original document it was discovered that an informality existed which made his expulsion invalid.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Later life==
On leaving Cambridge he came to London. He maintained himself by teaching and writing, to supplement his continuing fellowship stipend.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; It was at Frend's house that [[William Wordsworth]] met [[William Godwin]], on 27 February 1795. The company there that evening included [[George Dyer (poet)|George Dyer]], [[Thomas Holcroft]], [[James Losh]], and [[John Tweddell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Juliet Barker]], ''Wordsworth: A Life'' (2001, abridged), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Frend was one of the orators in the mass meetings called by the [[London Corresponding Society]] in late 1795, with [[John Ashley (radical)|John Ashley]], Matthew Brown, Richard Hodgson, [[John Gale Jones]], [[John Richter (radical)|John Richter]], and [[John Thelwall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ehrman]], ''The Younger Pitt'' Vol. II (1983), p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of this circle was [[Mary Hays]]; an attachment to Frend ended in an unsatisfactory fashion, Frend claiming that marriage was not possible on financial grounds; and she wrote autobiographically about the relationship in her first novel, ''Memoirs of Emma Courtney'' (1796).&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37525|title=Hays, Mary|first=Marilyn L.|last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frend was one of the group of reformers who supported at this time the early activities of the [[Royal Literary Fund|Literary Fund]] set up by [[David Williams (philosopher)|David Williams]]. There he worked alongside [[Thomas Christie]], [[Alexander Jardine (British Army officer)|Alexander Jardine]], [[James Martin (UK politician)|James Martin]], and [[John Hurford Stone]]. Their views, however, did not have it all their own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=29494|title=Williams, David|first=Damian Walford|last=Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806 he took part in the formation of the [[Rock Life Assurance Company]], to which he was appointed as [[actuary]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He continued in radical activities, participating around 1810 in a fundraising committee,  with [[Timothy Brown (radical)|Timothy Brown]], [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|John Cartwright]], [[William Cobbett]], and [[Robert Waithman]], to support [[Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=74221|title=Brown, Timothy|first=Michael T.|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe illness in 1826 compelled him to offer his resignation, which was accepted in 1827 when an annuity was given to him. His health subsequently recovered, and he resumed an active life. Frend and [[Joshua Milne]], another actuary, were consulted by the statistician [[John Rickman]] about the 1831 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000107/http://histpop.org.uk/ohpr/servlet/View?path=Browse/Essays%20%28by%20geography%29/England%20and%20Wales/General&amp;active=yes&amp;mno=2060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 he was attacked by paralysis. He lingered with almost total loss of speech and motion, though mentally alert. He died at his house, [[Tavistock Square]], London, on 21 February 1841.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Associations, influence and views==
In 1808 Frend married a daughter of the Rev. Francis Blackburne,{{efn|the son of [[Francis Blackburne (priest)]]}} vicar of [[Brignall]] in Yorkshire, and granddaughter of Archdeacon [[Francis Blackburne (priest)|Francis Blackburne]]. They had seven children, and their eldest daughter, [[Sophia Elizabeth De Morgan|Sophia Elizabeth]], married in the autumn of 1837 [[Augustus De Morgan]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Among Frend's pupils were [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], [[Ada Lovelace]], [[John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst|John Singleton Copley]], and [[Robert Malthus]]; he was himself the last of "the learned anti-Newtonians and a noted oppugner of all that distinguishes Algebra from Arithmetic."&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Budget/&gt; In Cambridge the leading intellectual dissenters formed a circle including George Dyer, [[Benjamin Flower]], [[Robert Hall (minister)|Robert Hall]] and [[Robert Tyrwhitt]], as well as Frend and Robert Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8347|title=Dyer, George|first=Nicholas|last=Roe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frend was a Unitarian and a Whig by conviction. Reformers such as [[Francis Burdett]] and [[John Horne Tooke]] were his friends, and he maintained correspondence with supporters of radicalism.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; [[Francis Place]] acknowledged an intellectual debt to Frend.&lt;ref name=Budget/&gt; Frend's Unitarian network, as well as the group round Priestley, included [[James Gifford the elder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=10662|title=Gifford, James|first=M. J.|last=Mercer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Hibbert (Anti-Trinitarian)|Robert Hibbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=13196|title=Hibbert, Robert|first=Alan|last=Ruston}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to Godwin, Frend like others had difficulties with his [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'' (1989), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was frequently consulted by [[John Palmer (postal innovator)|John Palmer]] in support of his claim for a public grant for his services in improving the transmission of letters. Frend thought that the rate of postage should be reduced to a fixed charge of one or two pennies, and drew up a statement to that effect. It reached a member of [[Robert Peel]]'s cabinet, but nothing came of it at that time.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Works==
Frend's works dealt with many subjects. His publications were:

* ''An Address to the Inhabitants of Cambridge and its Neighbourhood ... to turn from the false Worship of Three Persons to the Worship of the One True God'' (St. Ives, 1788). The second edition was entitled ''An Address to the Members of the Church of England and to Protestant Trinitarians in General'', and it was followed by ''A Second Address to the Members of the Church of England''. These were reprinted in ''Six Tracts in Vindication of the Worship of One God'', and in other unitarian publications, and were answered by the Rev. [[Henry William Coulthurst]], by George Townsend of Ramsgate in two tracts (1789), and by [[Alexander Pirie]] in a volume issued at Perth (1792). Frend responded in ''Thoughts on Subscription to religious tests ... in a letter to the Rev. H. W. Coulthurst'', and in ''Mr. Coulthurst's blunders exposed, or a review of his several texts''. For these pamphlets Frend was expelled from the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (''An Account of some late Proceedings of the Society'' (1789).
*''Peace and Union Recommended to the Associated Bodies of Republicans and Anti-Republicans'' (1793)
* ''Peace and Union recommended'', &amp;c., 1793; (2nd ed. 1793), in which he described the evils of the then parliamentary system and of the game and poor laws, and explained the necessity for numerous reforms. The offending passages are set out in the second edition in single inverted commas.
* ''Scarcity of Bread: a plan for reducing its high price'' (1795), two editions. He urged subscriptions by the rich for the relief of the poor.
* ''Principles of Algebra'' (1796) (with a very long appendix by [[Francis Maseres]]) (pt.ii. 1799). Frend rejected the use of negative quantities.
* ''A Letter to the Vice-chancellor of Cambridge, by Wm. Frend, candidate for the Lucasian Professorship''(1798).
* ''Principles of Taxation'' (1799), advocating a graduated system of income-tax.
* ''Animadversions on Bishop Pretyman's Elements of Christian Theology'' (1800); to which [[Joshua Toulmin]] replied in a preface to his ''Four Discourses on Baptism''.
* ''The Effect of Paper Money on the Price of Provisions'', (1801), which was provoked by the controversy between [[Sir Francis Baring]] and [[Walter Boyd (financier)|Walter Boyd]].
* ''[[The Gentleman's Monthly Miscellany]]'', which lived for a few months of 1803, and was edited in whole or in part by Frend.
* ''Evening Amusements, or the Beauty of the Heavens Displayed'' (1804 to 1822), "an astronomical elementary work of a new character, which had great success; the earlier numbers went through several editions".
* ''Patriotism: an Essay dedicated to the Volunteers''(1804)
* ''Tangible Arithmetic, or the Art of Numbering made Easy by means of an Arithmetical Toy''(1805). 
* ''A Letter on the Slave Trade'' (1816)
* ''The National Debt in its True Colours'' (1817). Reprinted in the ''Pamphleteer'', ix. 415-32. He advocated its extinction by an annual sinking fund.
* ''Memoirs of a Goldfinch'', a poem, with notes and illustrations on natural history and natural philosophy (anon.) (1819).
* ''Is it Impossible to Free the Atmosphere of London in a very considerable degree from Smoke?''. A few copies only for friends, but it was reproduced in the ''Pamphleteer'' (1819, vol. xv. 61-5)
* ''A Plan of Universal Education'' (1832). A fragment of a volume, ''Letters on a hitherto Undescribed Country'', "written some years before but never published".

Frend, besides contributing two articles to ''Tracts on the Resolution of Affected Algebraick Equations'', edited by Francis Maseres in 1800, and one tract to the same editor's ''Scriptores Logarithmici'' (vol. vi. 1807), suggested other matters to him in the same publications. Maseres in his ''Tracts on the Resolution of Cubick and Biquadratick Equations'', published supplements to his appendix to Frend's ''Principles of Algebra''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
