== Studies and early work ==
Born in [[Zemun]], [[Yugoslavia]], Bošković studied [[philosophy]] in Belgrade between 1982 and 1990. During his studies, he was mostly interested in the work of [[Ernst Cassirer]] (1874–1945), but at this time he also "discovered" [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994), who will be a lasting influence. Aleksandar spent some years in the so-called "pro-democracy" [[journalism]] in Yugoslavia (1983–1990), in the process working as foreign politics editor and member of the Editorial Board of the Belgrade weekly magazine ''Student'' (1984/1985) and writing for almost all of the major (mostly Belgrade-based) Yugoslav magazines between 1984 and 1990. Aleksandar's journalistic texts and interviews dealt with political issues (he interviewed some of the former [[Praxis School]] philosophers – including [[Gajo Petrović]], [[Svetozar Stojanović]], and [[Mihailo Marković]]), foreign affairs, but also with cultural issues, [[comics]] and [[science fiction]].

His early scholarly publications were influenced by the interest in the study of [[myth]] and [[religion]], especially through the perspectives offered by [[Joseph Campbell]] (1904–1987) and [[Mircea Eliade]] (1907–1986). As a conclusion of the several decades of interest in the study of [[myth]], he edited the ''Dictionary of Deities and Mythic Beings of the World'' (in Serbo-Croatian; co-edited with Milan Vukomanović and Zoran Jovanović), a single-volume reference work with 14 contributors, covering ''Non-classical [[Mythology]]''. Bošković contributed over 150 entries himself, including all on [[Australia]], [[Mesoamerica]], [[Africa]], [[Celts]], and some on [[Middle East]] and [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Baal]], [[Gilgamesh]], Ziusudra), and [[India]] ([[Ganesha]], [[Parvati]], [[Rudra]], [[Shiva]]).

Some of his early texts focused on ancient Mesoamerican religions (especially [[Maya religion|Maya]] and Mexican/ [[Aztec]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40461682|title=The Meaning of Maya Myths|publisher=www.anthropos.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Bošković went to [[Tulane University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu |title=Tulane University |publisher=Tulane.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Orleans]] to study [[anthropology]] with [[Munro S. Edmonson]] [1924–2002]. Fieldwork in Guatemala in 1991 was inspired by the interest in Classic [[Maya ceramics]], but this interest gradually waned, mostly due to Bošković's dissatisfaction with the then-dominant "direct historical approach" in Mesoamerican studies and the tendency by some anthropologists to use material from looted sites. However, he continued to occasionally review books on this topic, especially for the journal ''Anthropos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropos.eu/anthropos/ |title=Anthropos |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He kept in touch with several prominent Maya archaeologists, like Richard E. W. Adams (1931–2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/obituaries/article/Renowned-archaeologist-Adams-studied-Mayan-culture-6324139.php |title=Richard E. W. Adams obituary |accessdate=2016-09-18|date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American archaeologist who taught at the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]], who influenced Bošković with his general perspective and methodological rigor; and also with the leading French Mayanist at the time, [[Claude-François Baudez]] (1932–2013), from the CNRS ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isabelle-bonzom.org/en/Claude%20Baudez%20Mayanist.html |title=A tribute to Claude François Baudez from Le Monde |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in Mesoamerica was revisited in a book published by [[Archaeopress]] in 2017, ''Mesoamerican Religions and Archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/displayProductDetail.asp?id={EA0546FE-FF59-4007-AEC6-663E9AA74AD4} |title=Mesoamerican Religions and Archaeology |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes a number of review essays, including chapters on The Meaning of Maya Myths,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Aztec Great Goddesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://journals.iai.spk-berlin.de/index.php/indiana/article/download/1801/1439 | title=Aztec Great Goddesses| accessdate=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ways of interpreting the [[Codex Borbonicus]] (or Codex [[Cihuacoatl]]).

Bošković defended the M.A. thesis (supervised by [[Munro S. Edmonson]]), "[[William Robertson Smith]] and the Anthropological Study of [[Myth]]," at [[Tulane University]] in April 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dan.unb.br/images/pdf/anuario_antropologico/Separatas1999/anuario99_aleksandarboskovic.pdf|format=PDF |title=ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MYTH|publisher=www.dan.unb.br |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[New Orleans]] he went to do Ph.D. at the [[University of St Andrews]] in [[Scotland]]. This move was motivated by the interest in contemporary anthropology, combined with the interpretive approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0048.xml/ |title=Interpretive Anthropology |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which he came through the influence of [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926–2006). In St. Andrews, he was first supervised by [[Ladislav Holy]] (1933–1997). Holy proved to be a major influence on Bošković's research with his version of [[methodological individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge and behaviour|publisher=www.qub.ac.uk |date= |isbn = 978-0853891079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Holy's illness, Bošković was supervised by Nigel J. Rapport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/nigel-julian-rapport(851ccecb-00ea-469c-bbab-a3452500653e).html |title=Nigel Julian Rapport |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defended his Ph.D. thesis (''Constructing Gender in Contemporary Anthropology'') on 1 November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.st-andrews.ac.uk/record=b1284665~S5 |title=Constructing Gender in Contemporary Anthropology|publisher=www.st-andrews.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-12-26|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnographic part of the thesis focused on the feminist groups in Slovenia. Methodologically, some of the conclusions were influenced by [[Ladislav Holy]]'s critical interpretative approach, as well as by [[Marilyn Strathern]]'s and [[Henrietta L. Moore]]'s anthropology of gender – especially considering gender as a social and cultural construct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discoveranthropology.org.uk/about-anthropology/specialist-areas/anthropology-of-gender.html |title=Anthropology of Gender |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in St Andrews, Bošković met a brilliant linguist in the Department of Social Anthropology, Sándor Hervey (1942–1997) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12310873.Dr_Sandor_Hervey/ |date= |accessdate=2018-04-24|title= Dr Sandor Hervey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and read critical editions of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s (1857–1913) ''Cours de linguistique générale''. Saussure's concept of the linguistic sign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=[[Sign (linguistics)]] |title=Linguistic sign |accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proved to be a major influence in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inscricoes.iuaes2018.org/trabalho/view?ID_TRABALHO=59 |title=OP 154|publisher=www.iuaes2018.org |date=|accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Bošković taught his first academic course at the [[University of St Andrews]] in the Martinmas Term of 1994 ("Mesoamerican Pre-Columbian Civilisations", at the Honours’ level), and began teaching part-time at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the [[University of Ljubljana]] in 2000 (courses "Contemporary [[Anthropology]]" and "[[Anthropology]] and [[Feminism]]", at the M.A. level). However, his most important teaching experience was when he moved to the Department of Anthropology of the [[University of Brasília]], where he was influenced by Mariza Peirano's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marizapeirano.com.br/ |title=Mariza Peirano |date=|accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roberto Cardoso de Oliveira's (1928–2006) concept of a horizontally-structured anthropology. (This will later influence his interest in "World Anthropologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40466803|title=World Anthropologies |publisher=Anthropos.eu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) In Brasília, Bošković taught courses on gender, [[myth]], anthropological theory, Latin America, but also started to develop some interest in the concept of [[Europe]], as he was actually hired as "Visiting Professor of European [[Ethnology]]." His monograph on [[Mesoamerica]] (''Mesoamerican [[Religion]]s and [[Archaeology]]: Essays in Pre-Columbian Civilizations'') was published by [[Archaeopress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/defaultAll.asp?intro=Home&amp;PublishedDateGT=20+Jun+2015 |title=Archaeopress |publisher=Archaeopress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/displayProductDetail.asp?id={EA0546FE-FF59-4007-AEC6-663E9AA74AD4}|title=Mesoamerican Religions |date=|accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the invitation of Robert J. Thornton, in February 2001 Bošković moved to the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] ([[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]) on the Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship. There he also taught courses on [[religion]], [[myth]], and [[ethnicity]]. While in Johannesburg, he was fortunate enough to meet (and have opportunity to discuss anthropology with) W.D. Hammond-Tooke (1926–2004), the last of the great 20th century South African anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249376164 |title=Obituary: W.D. Hammond-Tooke |publisher=Anthropology Today |date= |accessdate=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Bošković was hired as [[Senior lecturer]] at the Department of Anthropology of [[Rhodes University]], a department that Hammond-Tooke helped establish during the 1960s. At Rhodes, Bošković further developed his interests in the history and theory of anthropology. This Department provided a brilliant academic setting, with colleagues like Chris de Wet, Robin Palmer, Penny Bernard, among others. Furthermore, his interest in history and theory of anthropology resulted in publication of several books. His book ''Myth, Politics, Ideology'' was published in late 2006 in Belgrade, and it covered different theoretical aspects of the study of myths, understood (in [[Raymond Aron]]'s sense) as part of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/law-ideology/ |title=Law and Ideology (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also included several chapters on different aspects of [[Mesoamerican religion]]s – some in revised versions from their original publications, and some previously unpublished. This also coincided with Bošković's interest in the study of ethnicity and nationalism, and his overall view that multiculturalism is an essential component of all human societies. Some of these aspects were discussed while he was a guest at the [[University of Oslo]] in 2007, following the invitation of a friend and colleague, [[Thomas Hylland Eriksen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyllanderiksen.net/ |title=Thomas Hylland Eriksen |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2007/06/alle-nasjoner-er-multikulturelle.html/ |title=Alle nasjoner er multikulturelle |publisher=uniforum.uio.no |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksandar Bošković was invited to teach in the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy in 2009. He began teaching courses related to history and theory in anthropology, mostly due to the favorable reception of his introductory book in anthropology, published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slglasnik.com/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%83%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BE/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%83%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BE-%E2%80%94-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B0/%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D1%83-%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%98%D1%83 |title=A Brief Introduction to Anthropology |publisher=www.slglasnik.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Senate of the University of Belgrade elected him as a full Professor, so he teaches full-time in the Department from 1 January 2013.

==Involvement with human rights==
In 2006, Aleksandar Bošković briefly worked as Program Director (in charge of [[transitional justice]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recom.link/reconciliation-and-justice-for-victims-as-a-universal-value/ |title=RECOM |accessdate=2016-09-18|date=2015-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Humanitarian Law Center in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlc-rdc.org/?lang=de |title=Home - Fond za humanitarno pravo/Humanitarian Law Center/Fondi për të Drejtën Humanitare &amp;#124; Fond za humanitarno pravo/Humanitarian Law Center/Fondi për të Drejtën Humanitare |publisher=Hlc-rdc.org |date=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in [[human rights]] followed on his criticism of [[nationalism]] and violence and led to his continuing collaboration with other [[human rights]] organizations in Serbia in the 1990s (like the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights). Bošković also worked for the UNDP in Belgrade on several short-term contracts, again on topics related to [[transitional justice]]. Throughout this period he has been an outspoken critic of [[nationalism]], as well as of all other totalitarian and discriminatory practices and tendencies within Serbian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.arhiv.rs/Develop/vesti.nsf/feaee540dc011162c1256e7d0032cb98/a6d8fb05fe335adfc1257a62004163dd?OpenDocument&amp;Click= |title=Home - NIN |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1990s Bošković used the then-emerging concept of [[Virtual Reality]] to refer to the ways in which the political elites of Serbia (as well as other post-Yugoslav societies) understood the reality and the world among them. Several of his article on this topic were published in the ''Canadian Journal for Political Theory'' and widely read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/search/search?simpleQuery=Aleksandar+Boskovic&amp;searchField=query |title=Aleksandar Boskovic - CTheory |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion made in his writings was that the foreign observers and diplomats trying to communicate with Serbian leaders would be much more successful if they were aware of the concept of virtual reality, as the reality that the local political leaders believed in had no connection with what is ordinary considered as ''real''.

Following his emerging interest in [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/definition.html |title=What is psychoanalysis? |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bošković used [[Christopher Bollas]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychoanalysis.org.uk/our-authors-and-theorists/christopher-bollas |title=Christopher Bollas |accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept of the "fascist state of mind" to elaborate on the political and social situation in Serbia, in an essay published in the Belgrade weekly ''Novi magazin'', on 15 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nm-tekstovi.blogspot.rs/2017/06/o-fasistickom-stanju-duha.html?spref=fb |title=O fašističkom stanju duha |accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering wider implications of the persuasiveness of nationalist-inspired thinking and ideas, he organized a round table debate dedicated to [[Benedict Anderson]] (1936–2015), at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154633067767625&amp;set=a.10150226930347625.345571.679147624&amp;type=3&amp;theater |title=The Legacy of Benedict Anderson |accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at least in part due to the influence that [[Bruce Kapferer]]'s ideas had on him. Bošković also published a paper on anthropological studies of myths and nationalism in 2013, in the oldest anthropology journal in the world, ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'' - as a review article of Kapferer's major book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gape.org/sasa/Boskovic_Kapferer_ZfE.pdf |format=PDF |editor=Bruce Kapferer |title=Legends of People, Myths of State. Violence, Intolerance, and Political Culture in Sri Lanka and Australia |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-85745-436-2 |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more recent published contributions, there is also a chapter that deals with Serbia's troubled relationship with her own past, and the inability of the country's elites to come to terms with its nationalistic past. This paper is based on a presentation from the conference held at Landskronna (Sweden), in early June 2012. The chapter's title is "Serbia and the Surplus of History: Being Small, Large, and Small Again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15669.html |editors=Ulf Hannerz and Andre Gingrich |title=Small Countries: Structures and Sensibilities |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |date=2017 |isbn=978-0-81224-893-7 |accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the political attitude that presupposes rejection of all forms of discrimination and intolerance, and following up on his research on gender for his PhD thesis, Bošković also contributed an entry "Images of Gender and Sexuality in Southern Africa" for ''The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405196947.html |title=Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as (with his colleague from the Institute of Social Sciences, Suzana Ignjatović) on "Gender equality in Serbia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Equality in a Global Perspective |isbn = 978-1138193246|last1 = Örtenblad|first1 = Anders|last2 = Marling|first2 = Raili|last3 = Vasiljevic|first3 = Snjezana|year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=European Journal of Women's Studies |journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=425–440 |doi=10.1177/1350506813478409 |year=2013 |last1=Ignjatović |first1=Suzana |last2=Bošković |first2=Aleksandar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching and research==
Since August 2008, Aleksandar is Director of Research or Research Professor (French ''Directeur d'études''; in Serbo-Croatian ''Naučni savetnik'') and between May 2009 and February 2017 he was Head of the Center for Political Research and [[Public Opinion]] in the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade (Serbia). He has been employed full time in this Institute since 1 July 2003. In October 2009, Bošković started teaching in the Department of [[Ethnology]] and [[Anthropology]] of the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]], and was formally awarded full Professorship by the Senate of the [[University of Belgrade]] in November 2012. He was formally hired (tenure, full time) by the Faculty of Philosophy from 1 January 2013. He teaches Ethnological and Anthropological Theories and [[Comparative Religion]] (second-year course) on the undergraduate level, [[Methodology]] on Master's level, and [[History of Anthropology]] at the Doctoral level. In 2017, Bošković started teaching [[Anthropology]] at the newly established Faculty of Applied Science of the University of Donja Gorica (UDG) in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udg.edu.me/predavaci/spisak-svih-predavaca |title=Spisak predavača - UDG |date= |accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bošković edited a volume ''Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins'' (New York and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2008; paperback edition in 2010), a book that received good reviews, and is being used as a reference work on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=BoskovicOther |title=Other People's Anthropologies : BERGHAHN BOOKS : Oxford, New York : Celebrating 21 Years of Independent Publishing! |publisher=Berghahn Books |date= |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book presented an important contribution to the growing field of "World Anthropologies," as it dealt with different national/regional anthropological traditions (including Russian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Kenyan, Argentinian, Turkish, Cameroonian, Japanese, Yugoslav, Norwegian, and Brazilian), all of them located outside of the so-called "central (or dominant) anthropological traditions" (Anglo-American, French and German). However, better known in Serbo-Croatian (and in the former Yugoslav region) is his book ''Kratak uvod u antropologiju'' [A Brief Introduction to Anthropology], published in late 2010 by the Jesenski i Turk in Zagreb (Croatia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesenski-turk.hr/?active=knjiga&amp;book=51604 |title=KRATAK UVOD U ANTROPOLOGIJU - aleksandar bošković |publisher=Jesenski-turk.hr |date= |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian edition of the book was published in April 2010, based on a series of lectures delivered at the Rex Cultural Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Kultura/t46407.lt.html/ |title=Antropologija kao jaka kritička teorija društva |publisher=www.politika.rs |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he published a book in Serbia on Anthropological perspectives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idn.org.rs/download/Antropoloske_perspektive.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aleksandar Bošković : ANTROPOLOŠKE PERSPEKTIVE |publisher=idn.org.rs |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his long-standing collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/2169/en |title=Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology |accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aleksandar Bošković also co-edited a volume on the development of anthropologies/ ethnologies in Southeastern Europe between 1945 and 1991, with [[Chris Hann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anthropological Field on the Margins of Europe,1945-1991 (Halle Studies in the Anthropology of Eurasia) (9783643905079): Aleksandar Boskovic, Chris Hann: Books |isbn = 978-3643905079|last1 = Boskovic|first1 = Aleksandar|last2= Hann|first2= Chris|year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he also contributed a Postscript. He also published a review essay on the uses of rational choice in anthropology in ''Ethnos'' in 2012 (with Suzana Ignjatović).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00141844.2011.644314#.VCSFnudjjoA |format=PDF |journal=Ethnos: Journal of Anthropology |volume=77 |issue=2 |date=2012 |title=Special Issue: Learning Possession |accessdate=2015-05-27 |doi=10.1080/00141844.2011.644314 |pages=290–296|last1=Bošković |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Ignjatovic´ |first2=Suzana }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in rationality also resulted in the process of helping Suzana Ignjatović organize a Symposium about [[Individualism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lukes |first=Steven M. |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286303/individualism |title=individualism &amp;#124; politics and philosophy &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, on 20 October 2017. The Symposium resulted in the edited volume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idn.org.rs/kalendar/Individualizam12.pdf |title=Individualizam |date= |accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with international contributors including [[Walter Block]], Veselin Vukotić,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canu.me/clanovi/veselin-vukotic |title=Veselin Vukotić at the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences &amp; Arts |accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Patrick Laviolette. This event also received attention (and formed a major part in the leading story) in one of the leading Serbian news magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idn.org.rs/dokumenti_vesti/novi-magazin-individualizam.pdf |title=Jeretička priča, Mijat Lakićević |date= |accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guest lectures and invited seminars==
Since 1986, Aleksandar gave more than 220 guest lectures or seminars and six short courses in 27 countries. He delivered these lectures and seminars at, among other places, [[University of Oslo]], [[University of Bergen]], [[Goldsmiths College]], [[Vanderbilt University]], [[College of William and Mary]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of St. Andrews]], [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s School of Philosophy and Religions, and [[University of Hamburg]]. In recent years, he also spoke about topics such as [[rationality]] (both at the IUAES Congress in Manchester in 2013, and at the Inter-Congress in Chiba, Japan in 2014), [[Identity (social science)|identity]] (at the meeting of the Croatian Ethnological Society in Zagreb in 2013), [[Giambattista Vico]] (at the ASA Decennial Conference in Edinburgh, 2014), [[ethnicity]]  (in the Masters’ seminar at the [[University of Leipzig]], 2014) and [[anthropology]] in Belgrade (at the Institute of Social Anthropology, Wilhelms [[University of Münster]] (Germany),&lt;ref name="uni-muenster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/ethnologie|author=Westf&amp;auml;lische Wilhelms-Universit&amp;auml;t M&amp;uuml;nster, Institut für Ethnologie|title=Institut für Ethnologie der Universität Münster &amp;#124; Home|website=uni-muenster.de|accessdate=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014). In late April 2017, Bošković lectured at the Department of Social Anthropology at the [[Panteion University]] in [[Athens]], as part of the ERASMUS exchange.

He co-organized (with Salma Siddique) a panel on "[[Anthropology]] and [[psychotherapy]]" at the ASA conference in Exeter in April 2015, and presented a seminar on [[Edvard Munch]] at the Comparative Sociology Department of the [[University of Leiden]]. With Professor Günther Schlee, he organized a Workshop commemorating 75th anniversary of the ''African Political Systems'' at the [[Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology]], 10–11 September 2015.&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/en/events|title=Events &amp;#124; Max Planck Institut für ethnologische Forschung|website=eth.mpg.de|accessdate=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With David Shankland, he co-convened the workshop ''Themes in the history of anthropology'' at the 2016 EASA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easaonline.org/conferences/easa2016/index.shtml |title=14th EASA Biennial Conference |publisher=www.easaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Thomas Hylland Eriksen]], the workshop ''Clashing scales of infrastructural development'' at the 2017 SIEF Congress in Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siefhome.org/congresses/sief2017// |title=SIEF 13th Congress |date= |accessdate=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, following the invitation of Salma Siddique, he spent six weeks as a Visiting Researcher at the [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ |title=University of Aberdeen |date= |accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Bošković gave two talks about The Meaning of Maya Myths (unrelated to the 1989 article), at [[King's College, Aberdeen]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thisisthetcson.wordpress.com// |title=Traditional Cosmology Society |date= |accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a lecture on Anthropology and Psychoanalysis, in the School of Education. In the early June, he gave a talk on Classic Maya myths and politics at the 12th Annual International Conference on Comparative Mythology at [[Tohoku University]] in Sendai, Japan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compmyth.org/static/IACM_Sendai_2018_program_FINAL.pdf |title=IACM conference |date= |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AllTrials''' (sometimes called '''All Trials''' or '''AllTrials.net''') is a project advocating that [[clinical research]] adopt the principles of [[open research]]. The project summarizes itself as "All trials registered, all results reported": that is, all [[clinical trials]] should be listed in a [[clinical trials registry]], and their results should always be shared as [[open data]].

At the center of the organisation is a petition signed by over 85,000 individuals and
599 organisations (as of August 2015):

{{quotation | 
Thousands of clinical trials have not reported their results; some have not even been registered.

Information on what was done and what was found in these trials could be lost forever to doctors and researchers, leading to bad treatment decisions, missed opportunities for good medicine, and trials being repeated.

All trials past and present should be registered, and the full methods and the results reported.

We call on governments, regulators and research bodies to implement measures to achieve this.

==Issues addressed==
The project is a reaction to under-reporting of research.&lt;ref name=pmid23303893&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.f105 |pmid=23303893 |title=All trials must be registered and the results published |journal=BMJ |volume=346 |pages=f105 |year=2013 |last1=Chalmers |first1=I |last2=Glasziou |first2=P |last3=Godlee |first3=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/feb/08/all-trials-reform-science |title=All Trials: working with the public to reform science |first=Alice |last=Bell |work=theguardian.com |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theconversation.com/register-all-trials-report-all-results-its-long-overdue-11603 |title=Register all trials, report all results – it's long overdue |first=Paul |last=Glasziou |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=15 January 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24108030&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/502154a |pmid=24108030 |title=Secrets of trial data revealed |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7470 |pages=154–5 |year=2013 |last1=Cressey |first1=Daniel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial proportion (estimates range from one-third to one-half) of medical research goes unpublished.&lt;ref name=pmid24169943&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.f6104 |pmid=24169943 |pmc=3812466 |laysummary=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2013/10/ethical-failure-leaves-one-quarter-of-all-clinical-trials-unpublished.html |laysource=Nature newsblog |laydate=October 29, 2013 |title=Non-publication of large randomized clinical trials: Cross sectional analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=347 |pages=f6104 |year=2013 |last1=Jones |first1=C.

F }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that negative findings are [[publication bias|less likely to be published]] than positive ones, even in the absence of conflicts of interest.

Much medical research is done by the pharmaceutical industry, which have a conflict of interest reporting results which may hurt sales of their products.&lt;ref name=pmid11556304&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMed010093 |pmid=11556304 |title=Sponsorship, Authorship, and Accountability |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=345 |issue=11 |pages=825–6; discussion 826–7 |year=2001 |author1=Davidoff |first1=F |last2=Deangelis |first2=C.

C |last12=Van Der Weyden |first12=M. B |last13=Wilkes |first13=M. S |pmc=1071574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a measurable [[funding bias]] in reporting; studies have shown that published drug studies funded by pharmaceutical companies are much more likely to support the use of the tested drug than studies with other funding. Industry-funded trials are also less likely to be published.&lt;ref name=pmid24169943/&gt;&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/as-drug-industrys-influence-over-research-grows-so-does-the-potential-for-bias/2012/11/24/bb64d596-1264-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html|title=As drug industry’s influence over research grows, so does the potential for bias|first=Peter|last=Whoriskey|date=24 November 2012|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the statistical methods used to analyse the trial are not chosen before the study it started, there is a danger that researchers will intentionally or unintentionally pick the method that gives the results they expect, or which gives the most significant results. This makes the analysis [[Analytical bias|statistically invalid]]&lt;!---Some material from [[Experimenter's bias]] could be used---&gt;.

Not publishing trials which fail to find a clear effect exposes trial volunteers to pointless risk&lt;ref name=pmid12876095&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.290.4.516 |pmid=12876095 |title=Registering Clinical Trials |journal=JAMA |volume=290 |issue=4 |pages=516–23 |year=2003 |last1=Dickersin |first1=Kay |last2=Rennie |first2=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wastes research effort (as the same trial is repeated over and over). It also biases the medical literature, making it report effects where none exist (since, given enough trials, eventually one will find a difference by pure chance).&lt;ref name=Sterling&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01621459.1959.10501497 |jstor=2282137 |title=Publication Decisions and their Possible Effects on Inferences Drawn from Tests of Significance—or Vice Versa |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=54 |issue=285 |pages=30–4 |year=1959 |last1=Sterling |first1=Theodore D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical trials registry|Pre-trial registration]] makes non-publication and changes in analysis methods obvious to medical reviewers. It also enables authors of meta-studies to track down and analyse missing data. Finally, it lets doctors and patients know when a trial is looking for volunteers.&lt;ref name=pmid12876095/&gt;

There are other sources of bias, such as the conditions sometimes attached to funding by funding agencies with a financial interest in the trial's outcome. Medical researchers may be asked to agree to allow the funding agency to censor results. Some funding agencies may also refuse to give the medical researcher access to the raw data, giving them only the finished analysis, or even a draft paper, and asking them to put their name to it. This is not acceptable academic practice, and some academic journals require that authors sign a statement that they have not entered into such agreements.&lt;ref name=pmid11556304/&gt;&lt;ref name=washpost/&gt;

[[Ben Goldacre]], a physician and spokesperson for the campaign, would like to address the systematic flaws in clinical research which cause data to be lost after it is gathered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/ClinicalTrials/37506 |title=Is Evidence-Based Medicine Only an Illusion? |first=Kristina |last=Fiore  |work=[[MedPage Today]] |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.libdemvoice.org/opinion-alltrialsnet-a-crucial-campaign-on-data-transparency-that-will-save-lives-32575.html |title=Opinion: AllTrials.net – a crucial campaign on data transparency that will save lives |first=Prateek |last=Buch |work=[[Liberal Democrat Voice]] |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/biome/international-clinical-trials-day-a-qa-with-ben-goldacre/ |title=Ben Goldacre on Clinical Trials |author=''Biome'' staff |work=biomedcentral.com |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185524/http://www.biomedcentral.com/biome/international-clinical-trials-day-a-qa-with-ben-goldacre/ |archive-date=2013-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/opinion/health-cares-trick-coin.html?_r=0 |title=Health Care's Trick Coin |first=Ben |last=Goldacre |authorlink=Ben Goldacre |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 February 2013 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-14/lifestyle/sns-rt-us-surgery-clinical-trialbre92d0y6-20130314_1_clinical-trials-medical-journal-editors-reuters-health |title=Surgery clinical trial results selectively reported |first=Kathryn |last=Doyle |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.bnn.ca/article?itemId=Bad-Pharmas-bitter-pill-to-swallow&amp;feedId=322 |title=Bad Pharma's bitter pill to swallow |first=Zena |last=Olijnyk  |work=m.bnn.ca |publisher=[[Business News Network]] |date=22 Feb 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/bad_pharma_interview_with_ben_goldacre |title=Bad Pharma – Interview with Ben Goldacre |first=Kylie |last=Stugess |work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |date=27 February 2013 |accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==

The campaign has been widely covered, and supported, in the academic press. The [[British Medical Journal]] and [[PLOS]] are founding members. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref name=pmid24409508&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/505131a |pmid=24409508 |title=Data sharing will pay dividends |journal=Nature |volume=505 |issue=7482 |pages=131 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Lancet]]&lt;ref name=pmid24411647&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62228-X |pmid=24411647 |title=Reducing waste from incomplete or unusable reports of biomedical research |journal=The Lancet |volume=383 |issue=9913 |pages=267–76 |year=2014 |last1=Glasziou |first1=Paul |last2=Altman |first2=Douglas G |last3=Bossuyt |first3=Patrick |last4=Boutron |first4=Isabelle |last5=Clarke |first5=Mike |last6=Julious |first6=Steven |last7=Michie |first7=Susan |last8=Moher |first8=David |last9=Wager |first9=Elizabeth }}&lt;/ref&gt; both published supportive articles in January 2014.

There has also been mainstream media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/opinion/full-disclosure-needed-for-clinical-drug-data.html|title=Opinion - Full Disclosure Needed for Clinical Drug Data|first=The Editorial|last=Board|date=4 July 2013|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

There has been criticism from the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), with senior vice-president Matt Bennett saying that trial data disclosure measures which AllTrials has recommended to the [[European Medicines Agency]]  "could risk patient privacy, lead to fewer clinical trials, and result in fewer new medicines to meet patient needs and improve health.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/21/big-pharma-secret-drugs-trials|title=Big pharma mobilising patients in battle over drugs trials data|first=Ian|last=Sample|date=21 July 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AllTrials have published a detailed statement&lt;ref name=ATstatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alltrials.net/2013/all-trials-registered-and-results-reported/|title=All trials registered and results reported|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of exactly what they want to see published, which states "The AllTrials campaign is not calling for individual patient data to be made publicly available".

A 2012 editorial published by senior regulators from the European Medicines agency&lt;ref name=pmid22505851/&gt; largely agreed with AllTrials, saying "We consider it neither desirable nor realistic to maintain the status quo of limited availability of regulatory trials data". They were also of the opinion that adequate standards for protection of personal data could be written. However, they warned that third party reanalysis was neither a guarantee of quality nor of lack of conflict of interest, which, in the worst case, could lead to negative public health consequences.

{{quotation | 
"We do not dispute that financial conflicts of interests (CoIs) may render analyses and conclusions "vulnerable to distortion". However, surrounding the ongoing debate over sponsor-independent analyses is an implicit assumption that "analysis by independent groups" is somehow free from CoIs. We beg to differ. Personal advancement in academia, confirmation of previously defended positions, or simply raising one's own visibility within the scientific community may be powerful motivators.... We submit that analyses by sponsor-independent scientists are not generated in a CoI-free zone and, more often than not, ego trumps money. Independent analyses may therefore also be "vulnerable to distortion". We are concerned that unrestricted availability of full datasets may in some cases facilitate the publication of papers containing misleading results, which in turn lead to urgent calls for regulatory action. In a worst case, this would give rise to unfounded health scares with negative public health consequences 
such as patients refusing vaccinations or discontinuing drug treatment'"}}

They suggested that reanalyses should therefore be subject to the same regulations as sponsor analyses, such as registering analysis plans. They argued against completely unrestricted access to data, but in favour of broader access.&lt;ref name=pmid22505851&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001202 |pmid=22505851 |pmc=3323505 |title=Open Clinical Trial Data for All?

Historians disagree over the time period during which the expansion took place, but estimate it occurred roughly between 1550 and 1850.

Amerindian peoples of the pampas, such as the [[Puelche]], [[Pehuenche]], and [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]], adopted the [[Mapudungun]] language as their main language (both of their names are in Mapudungun). Together with [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]], and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], Mapudungun was among the few Amerindian languages that expanded in use on the continents after the beginning of European colonization. This area of the Patagonia was generally isolated from European settlement until late in the 19th century.

The Mapuche who migrated to Patagonia lived often as nomads. As European settlers established frontier settlements, the Mapuche raided them for cattle or looted their produce. They drove off the cattle stolen in the incursions (''[[Malón|malones]]'') and took them to Chile through the mountain passes to trade for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called [[Camino de los chilenos]] and ran a length of about {{convert|1000|km|sigfig=1}} from [[Buenos Aires Province]] to the [[mountain pass]]es of [[Neuquén Province]].

The ''[[lonco]]'' [[Calfucurá]] crossed the [[Andes]] from Chile to the [[Pampas]] around 1830 to aid the indigenous people, after [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], the governor of [[Buenos Aires]], started to fight the [[Boreanos]] tribe. However, other sources directly contradict this statement, saying that de Rosas contacted the leader in Chile for help fighting against the Boreanos tribe. In 1859 Calfucurá attacked [[Bahía Blanca]] in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. Many other bands of Mapuche also became involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until the [[Conquest of the Desert]]. To counter the cattle raids (and the native peoples on horseback), in the 1870s Argentina constructed a deep trench, called [[Zanja de Alsina]], to prevent cattle from being driven west and establish a boundary to the raiding tribes in the pampas.

Argentine authorities were worried that strong connections between the Araucanized tribes and Chile would give Chile influence over the [[pampa]]s.&lt;ref name="Argentina and Chile"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=981291 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/981291?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102089575223 |title=Argentina and Chile: The Struggle for Patagonia 1843-1881 |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 June 2013 |volume=36 |pages=347–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Argentina and Chile claimed the [[Patagonia]]. The Argentine government feared that in case of war, the natives would side with the Chileans, who would be able to carry the war all the way to the vicinity of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="Argentina and Chile"/&gt;

In 1872 [[Cufulcurá]] and his 6,000 followers went across the pampas to attack the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]] and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]], resulting in the deaths of 300 settlers and the loss of 200,000 head of cattle, which the Mapuche drove back to Chile. After this, Argentina organized its forces to launch what it called the [[Conquest of the Desert]] and attacked indigenous people for years. It is estimated that more than 5000 native peoples were killed or captured in that major assault, which was facilitated by the new Remington weapon arming the 6,000 Argentine soldiers (as stated by Gen. Ignacio Fotheringham) [Bodley p. 63, 72]. However, the losses to the Army were minimal, with only 13 soldiers killed;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; the lop-sided 'victory' was taken as proof of European superiority and celebrated in art. The 100 peso bill of Argentina has a picture honoring the Conquest of the Desert on one side.

{{italic title}}
'''''Ars Poetica,''''' or "'''The Art of Poetry'''", is a poem written by [[Horace]] c. 19 [[Before Christ|BC]],&lt;ref&gt;The dating of the poem is uncertain. Different sources give various dates ranging from 19–10 BC. The date 19 BC is given by ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,'' p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he advises poets on the art of writing poetry and drama. The ''Ars Poetica'' has "exercised a great influence in later ages on European literature, notably on French drama"&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, M.C. ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature,'' 3rd ed. Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and has inspired poets and authors since it was written.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the Ars Poetica and related poems, see: Poets.org – http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20035&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had been familiar since the [[Middle Ages]], it is used in [[literary criticism]] since the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: Volume 3, The Renaissance|last=Norton|first=Glyn|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0521300088|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The poem was written in [[hexameter]] verse as an Epistle (or Letter) to [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons, and is sometimes referred to as the ''Epistula Ad Pisones'', or "Epistle to the Pisos". The first mention of its name as the ''"Ars Poetica"'' was c. 95 by the classical literary critic [[Quintilian]] in his ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Institutio Oratoria'' 8.60 (Also known as ''Institutes of Oratory'' in its Dedication to Trypho). See: ''Horace: Epistles Book II and Epistle to the Pisones (Ars Poetica),'' ed. by [[Niall Rudd]]. Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and since then it has been known by that name. The translations of the original epistle are typically in the form of prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69381/ars-poetica|title=Ars Poetica by Horace|date=2018-11-23|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Written, like Horace's other epistles of this period, in a loose conversational frame, ''Ars poetica'' consists of 476 lines containing nearly 30 maxims for young poets."&lt;ref&gt;Article on ''Ars Poetica.'' Encyclopædia Britannica Academic Edition, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;   But ''Ars Poetica'' is not a systematic treatise of theory, and it wasn't intended to be. It is an inviting and lively poetic letter, composed for friends who appreciate poetic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Horace. Rudd, Niall, editor. ''Horace: Epistles Book II and Ars Poetica''. Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics. Cambridge University Press. (January 26, 1990). {{ISBN|978-0521312929}} page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace approaches poetry from a practical standpoint—as a craft, or ''ars''—rather than the theoretical approach of his predecessors, Aristotle and the philosopher [[Plato]]. He also holds the poet in high regard, as opposed, for instance, to Plato, who distrusts ''[[mimesis]]'' and who has philosopher [[Socrates]] say in Book 10 of the ''Republic'' that he would banish poets from the ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' ed. by Vincent B. Leitch et al. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2001, p. 121 and p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The following is a brief outline of the main subjects of the work:&lt;ref&gt;This summary is taken from: ''Horace: Satires; Epistles and Ars Poetica,'' translated and edited by H.R. Fairclough. Harvard: Loeb Classical Library, 1926, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

::(a) A poem demands unity, to be secured by harmony and proportion, as well as a wise choice of subject and good [[diction]]. Meter and style must be appropriate to theme and to character. A good model will always be found in Homer (ll, 1–152).
::(b) Dramatic poetry calls for special care – as to character drawing, propriety of representation, length of a play, number of actors, use of the chorus and its music, special features for the satyric type, verse-forms, and employment of Greek models (ll. 153–294).
::(c) A poet's qualifications include common sense, knowledge of character, adherence to high ideals, combination of the ''dulce'' with the ''utile,'' intellectual superiority, appreciation of the noble history and lofty mission of poetry, and above all a willingness to listen to and profit by impartial criticism (ll. 295–476).

:''(For a more detailed summary of Horace's '''Ars Poetica''', see the article on [[Epistles (Horace)|Horace's ''Epistles'']] – Epistle II.3).''

== Literary phrases ==
"Many of...[the] apt phrases [of the Ars Poetica]...have passed into common literary parlance."&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four quotations in particular are associated with the work:

* "''[[in medias res]]'' (l. 148)", or "into the middle of things". This describes a narrative technique of starting the story from its middle point. According to Horace, this entices the audience into the plot by making everyone curious about the characters' previous paths and their future destinies. The technique appeared frequently in ancient epics, and remains popular in modern narratives.
* "''[[ab ovo]]'' (l. 147)", or "from the beginning". As Homer did not initiate his epics about the Trojan War from the conception (thus, the egg – "ovo" in Latin) of Helen, poets and other story tellers should do something likewise: in other words, starting a story from its commencement will bore and fatigue audiences that may not be interested in a plot that is tediously inclusive. For another explanation of this mention of an egg, see [[Leda (mythology)]].
* "''quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus'' (l. 359)" or "sometimes even good Homer nods off". Today this expression is used to indicate that 1. even the most skilled poet can make continuity errors and 2. long works, usually epics (such as the [[Iliad]] or the [[Odyssey]]), may have their faults without that detracting significantly from their general quality. In context, however, Horace even censures Homer for such lapses. It reads "et idem | indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus"; (I even castigate the good Homer for the same [fault of technical errors] whenever he nods off). 
* "''[[ut pictura poesis]]'' (l. 361)", or "as is painting so is poetry", by which Horace meant that poetry, in its widest sense meaning "imaginative texts", merits the same careful interpretation that was in his day reserved for painting.

:(The latter two phrases occur one after the other near the end of the poem).

== Key concepts ==
The work is also known for its discussion of the principle of [[decorum]] (the use of appropriate vocabulary and diction in each style of writing) (l.81–106), and for Horace's criticisms of [[purple prose]] ''(purpureus pannus,'' l.15–16), a term coined by him to mean the use of flowery language.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is considered a core component of Horatian poetics as it principally aimed to achieve verisimilitude in artistic representation, guiding everything from the choice of genre to diction, dramatic characterization, meter, poetic invention, and the intended effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poetics of Conduct: Oral Narrative and Moral Being in a South Indian Town|last=Prasad|first=Leela|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2007|isbn=0231139203|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cited that decorum enforces subordination such as of parts to whole, woman to man, desire to reason, and individual to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horace: Odes and Epodes|last=Lowrie|first=Michele|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199207695|location=Oxford|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line 191, Horace warns against ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the practice of resolving a convoluted plot by having an [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian god]] appear and set things right. Horace writes "Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus": "That a god not intervene, unless a knot show up that be worthy of such an untangler".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.emory.edu/DRAMA/ArsPoetica.html Ars Poetica, line 191] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209203746/http://www.english.emory.edu/DRAMA/ArsPoetica.html |date=February 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps it can even be said that the quotability of Horace's ''Ars Poetica'' is what has given it a distinguished place in literary criticism: ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'' says: 
::It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of Horace's ''Ars Poetica (Art of Poetry)'' for the subsequent history of literary criticism. Since its composition in the first century BCE, this epigrammatic and sometimes enigmatic critical poem has exerted an almost continual influence over poets and literary critics alike – perhaps because its dicta, phrased in verse form, are so eminently quotable. Horace's injunction that poetry should both "instruct and delight" has been repeated so often that it has come to be known as the Horatian platitude.&lt;ref&gt;''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism,'' p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horatian platitude is usually given as "instruct ''and'' delight", but sometimes as "instruct ''or'' delight".  The first reading implies that all literature must be instructive. A related ambiguity is that "instruct" might be better translated as "help", "advise", or "warn". Horace repeats this maxim in different wordings: "Aut prodesse uolunt aut delectare poetae aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere uitae" (The poet wishes to benefit or please, or to be pleasant and helpful at the same time), "miscuit utile dulci" (a mix of useful and sweet), and "delectando pariterque monendo" (delighting and advising).

The ''Ars Poetica'' was first translated into English in [[1566 in poetry|1566]] by [[Thomas Drant]].&lt;ref&gt;See the article on Thomas Drant by Fred Schurink in ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature, Vol.1.'' Blackwell Publishing, 2012, pp.290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; A translation by [[Ben Jonson]] was published posthumously in [[1640 in poetry|1640]].

'''Aso ebi''' is a [[uniform]] dress that is traditionally worn in Nigeria and some West African cultures as an indicator of cooperation and solidarity during ceremonies and festive periods.&lt;ref name=Ayo&gt;Olukoju, A.. (1992). Maritime Trade in Lagos in the Aftermath of the First World War. African Economic History, (20), 119–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of wearing the dress can be to serve as self-identification with age mates, relatives or friends during social occasions or funerals. Affordability of fabrics such as [[African waxprints|Ankara]] has contributed to the popularity of uniform dressing for social occasions in [[Nigeria]].

==Origins==
The word aso in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] means cloth and ebi denotes family, so Aso ebi can be described as a family cloth usually worn during funerals or family ceremonies. However, the practice is now beyond family dressing because strangers of a celebrant can wear the Aso ebi.

Ayodele Olukoju, a Nigerian economic historian believes Aso ebi became a novelty in 1920 during a period of post [[World War I]] economic boom &lt;ref name="Ayo"/&gt; triggered by the higher prices for produce products such as [[Oil palm]]. However, [[William Bascom]] traced the origin to an earlier period when members of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[age grade]]s wear uniform dressing to mark fraternal bonds.&lt;ref name=Nwafor&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nwafor, O.|year=2011|title=The spectacle of aso ebi in Lagos, 1990–2008|journal=Postcolonial Studies|volume=14|issue=1|pages=45–62|doi=10.1080/13688790.2011.542114|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13688790.2011.542114|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ajani&gt;{{cite journal|author=O.A. Ajani|year=2012|title=Aso Ebi: The Dynamics of Fashion and Cultural Commodification in Nigeria |journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|volume=5|issue=6 |pages=108–18|url=http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol5no6/5.7-AAso%20Ebi.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171229173454/http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol5no6/5.7-AAso%20Ebi.pdf|archive-date=December 29, 2017 |ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, members of women organizations or egbes turn out to ceremonies and anniversaries of relatives in the same  style of dress, sandals, [[Wrapper (clothing)|lappa]], smock, necklace, the culture signifies close friendship. The uniform dressing can also be a measure of personal affluence, because Aso ebi involves rivalry between various egbes or groups with each group competing to outshine each other in terms of quality, originality and richness of the uniform&lt;ref&gt;Little, Kenneth. (1974). African Women in Towns: An Aspect of Africa's Social Revolution. Cambridge University Press. P. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aso ebi in Nigerian society==
From the mid 1960s to the late 1970s, imported [[lace]] and george were incorporated into Nigerian fabrics and they became popular items used for Aso ebi. Increased demand for handcrafted traditional dresses such as [[Agbada]] led to a resurgence of tailors and fashion designers specialized in making native attires. The tailors strived to meet the increasing demand and designs of uniform dressing, sometimes with the aid of the fashion pages of magazines to make style choices. The rise of Aso ebi also coincided with an intense market of fashion and lifestyles magazines in Lagos whereby tailors look at designs for inspiration and their patrons buy the magazines to see whether they or their friends are pictured in it.

Aso ebi in recent times has become a city phenomenon that has diffused to other West African cultures.&lt;ref name="Nwafor"/&gt; Dealers of imported and local textile materials have also benefited from the boom in demand for uniform dressing. Some textile dealers offer consultation services and bulk rates for the choice and cost of the dress and fabrics. While the price of fabrics in sewing the traditional attire is affordable, the aso ebi practice is still sometimes used as an identification with affluence, some wear expensive embroidery and extra layers of cloth, whereas others, who could not afford a whole outfit, added only matching tops and head coverings.&lt;ref name="Nwafor"/&gt;

== Mission ==

The Centre focuses on improving [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and reporting through a four-step process of [[research]], [[Academic publishing|publication]], development and [[training]]. These processes provide the framework for strategic planning by the Centre and guide the Centre's core business as well as its link to the University's mission. Research that leads to change, strategically affects change, or sets up the basis for change and improvement in assessment, forms the focus of the Centre's work.&lt;ref&gt;Assessment Research Centre. (2010). 2007/2008 Annual Report. Melbourne: Assessment Research Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

* Research
:The Centre focuses on research either in or using assessment. All activities and projects have a research focus and emphasise assessment or evaluation models based on assessment. The Centre's research program is its basic tool for educational change. Assessment research is regarded as a way of testing ideas, of checking the theoretical and practical nature of theories, new approaches and ideas.

* Publications
:Through publishing the research outcomes in a variety of media to cater for a wide variety of audiences, the Centre is able to disseminate its ideas and procedures to assess the change process.

* Development
:The development strategies employed by the Centre translate research outcomes into materials that practitioners can evaluate and use. The end user is one who can judge the practicality of research outcomes and their application potential. This is the basis of the change and improvement practices. Therefore, the development of materials is also given priority in each project.

* Training
: Each project at the development stage incorporates plans for a series of seminars, workshops, publications and other means of dissemination. The Centre conducts a series of short course training programs in assessment research and related fields. Graduate supervision and teaching of award and non-award courses complements the Centre’s research program by having graduates actively participating in components of the Centre’s research agenda.

'''Bharat Matā''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]], from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] '''Bhāratāmbā'''  {{lang|sa|भारताम्बा}}; अम्बा ''ambā'' means 'mother') is the [[national personification]] of [[India]] as a [[mother goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/805247/history-lessons-how-bharat-mata-became-the-code-word-for-a-theocratic-hindu-state|title=History lesson: How 'Bharat Mata' became the code word for a theocratic Hindu state}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an amalgam of all the goddesses of Indian culture and more significantly of goddess [[Durga]].  She is usually depicted as a woman clad in a [[Saffron (color)|saffron]] [[sari]] holding the [[Flag of India|Indian national flag]], and sometimes accompanied by a [[Asiatic Lion|lion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cMJMNvvpEuYC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=Haridwar+temple+of+Bharat+Mata&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t_L8TbW9GNDyrQfv4-XiDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Bharat%20Mata%2C%20contemporary%20picture%22&amp;f=false Visualizing space in Banaras: images, maps, and the practice of representation], Martin Gaenszle, Jörg Gengnagel, illustrated, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-447-05187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic perspective==
The image of Bhāratmātā formed with the [[Indian independence movement]] of the late 19th century. A play by [[Kiran Chandra Bannerjee]], ''Bhārat Mātā'', was first performed in 1873. The play set in 1770 Bengal famine depicted a woman and her husband who went to forest and encounters rebels. The priest takes them to temple where they were shown Bharat Mata. Thus they are inspired and led rebellion which result in defeat of the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/805990/far-from-being-eternal-bharat-mata-is-only-a-little-more-than-100-years-old|title=Far from being eternal, Bharat Mata is only a little more than 100 years old}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manushi'' magazine story traces origin to a satirical work ''Unabimsa Purana'' or ''The Nineteenth Purana'' by Bhudeb Mukhopadhyay which was first published anonymously in 1866.&lt;ref name="Roche 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Roche | first=Elizabeth | title=The origins of Bharat Mata | website=livemint.com/ | date=17 March 2016 | url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/lSOX1BWMcgypBUV8mUb8cJ/The-origins-of-Bharat-Mata.html | accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]] in 1882 wrote a novel ''[[Anandamath]]'' and introduced the hymn "[[Vande Mātaram]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/a-mothers-worship-why-some-muslims-find-it-difficult-to-say-bharat-mata-ki-jai/|title=A Mother’s worship: Why some Muslims find it difficult to say ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley, David.

Motilal Banarsidass, New Delhi, India. {{ISBN|81-208-0379-5}}. pp. 181-182.&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became the song of the emerging freedom movement in India. As the British Raj created cartographic shape of India through the [[Geological Survey of India]], the Indian nationalist developed it into an icon of nationalism. In 1920s, it became more political image sometimes including images of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Bhagat Singh]]. The [[Tiranga]] flag was also started being included during this period. In 1930s, the image entered in religious practice. The Bharat Mata temple was built in [[Benaras]] in 1936 by Shiv Prashad Gupt and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi. This temple does not have any statuary but only a marble relief of the map of India.&lt;ref name="Roche 2016"/&gt;

[[Bipin Chandra Pal]] elaborated its meaning in idealizing and idealist terms, along with Hindu philosophical traditions and devotional practices. It represented an archaic spiritual essence, a transcendental idea of Universe as well as expressing Universal Hinduism and nationhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s71oeW6SxzQC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=Haridwar+temple+of+Bharat+Mata&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t_L8TbW9GNDyrQfv4-XiDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEYQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=archaic%20spiritual%20essence&amp;f=false Producing India], Manu Goswami, Orient Blackswan, 2004, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-107-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abanindranath Tagore]] portrayed Bhārat Mātā as a four-armed [[Hindu goddess]] wearing saffron-colored robes, holding the manuscripts, sheaves of rice, a [[Hindu prayer beads|mala]], and a white cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ipajdspYL00C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20future%20of%20the%20British%20Policy%22&amp;f=false Specters of Mother India: the global restructuring of an empire], Mrinalini Sinha, Zubaan, 2006, {{ISBN|978-81-89884-00-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Bharatmata was an icon to create nationalist feeling in Indians during the freedom struggle. [[Sister Nivedita]], an admirer of the painting, opined that the picture was refined and imaginative, with Bharatmata standing on green earth and blue sky behind her; feet with four lotuses, four arms meaning divine power; white halo and sincere eyes; and gifts Shiksha-Diksha-Anna-Bastra of the [[motherland]] to her children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OWfcoMnHU8gC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Haridwar+temple+of+Bharat+Mata&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t_L8TbW9GNDyrQfv4-XiDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEsQuwUwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Shiksha-diksha-anna-bastra&amp;f=false The Goddess and the Nation: Mapping Mother India], Sumathi Ramaswamy, Duke University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-4610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Independence activist [[Subramania Bharati]] saw Bharat Mata as the land of [[Ganga]]. He identified Bharat Mata as [[Parashakti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvk.org/2010/0810/31.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310070153/http://www.hvk.org/2010/0810/31.html |archivedate=2016-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also says that he has got the [[Darśana]] of Bharat Mata during his visit with his guru [[Sister Nivedita]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Significance==
In the book ''Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India'', Kalyani Devaki Menon argues that "the vision of India as Bharat Mata has profound implications for the politics of Hindu nationalism" and that the depiction of India as a Hindu goddess implies that it is not just the patriotic but also the religious duty of all Hindus to participate in the nationalist struggle to defend the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Kalyani Devaki Menon, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSnn_kDUI6AC Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India: The Ethnography of Political Violence]'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-8122-4196-9}}, p. 89f.&lt;/ref&gt; This association with Hinduism has caused controversy with India's religious minorities, especially its [[Islam in India|Muslim population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patriotism in India: Oh mother: A nationalist slogan sends sectarian sparks|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21696537-nationalist-slogan-sends-sectarian-sparks-oh-mother|accessdate=9 April 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto ''Bharat Mata ki Jai’'' ("Victory for Mother India") is used by the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vinay Kumar|title=It is Jai Hind for Army personnel|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/it-is-jai-hind-for-army-personnel/article3958180.ece|accessdate=8 October 2012|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bharat Mata temples==

===At Varanasi===
[[File:Bharat Mata Temple map.jpg|thumb|right|x216px| text|The relief map of India as Bharatmata, carved out of [[marble]] at [[Bharat Mata Mandir]], [[Varanasi]]]]

The Temple, a gift from the nationalists [[Shiv Prasad Gupta]] and Durga Prasad Khatri, was inaugurated by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=BHARAT-MATA-TEMPLE/&gt; Mahatma Gandhi said, "I hope this temple, which will serve as a cosmopolitan platform for people of all religions, castes, and creeds including [[Harijan]]s, will go a great way in promoting religious unity, peace, and love in the country."&lt;ref name="Eck2012"&gt;{{citation|last=Eck|first=Diana L|title=India: A Sacred Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNlJOSf__xYC&amp;pg=PA100|date=27 March 2012|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=978-0-385-53191-7|pages=100–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At Haridwar===
The temple was founded by [[Swami Satyamitranand]] Giri on the banks of the [[Ganges]] in [[Haridwar]]. It has 8 storeys and is 180 feet tall.&lt;ref name=mapsofIndia.com/&gt; It was inaugurated by [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=mapsofIndia.com/&gt; Floors are dedicated to mythological legends, religious deities, freedom fighters and leaders.&lt;ref name=mapsofIndia.com&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/haridwar/tourism/bharat-mata-temple.html Bharat Mata Temple], [http://www.mapsofindia.com/haridwar/tourism/bharat-mata-temple.html mapsofIndia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Kolkata ===
The temple is located in Michael Nagar on Jessore Road, barely 2&amp;nbsp;km away from the Kolkata Airport. Here, Bharat Mata (the Mother Land)  is portrayed through the image of 'Jagattarini Durga'. This was inaugurated on October 19, 2015 (Mahashashti Day of Durga Puja that year)&lt;ref name=worldhindunews.com&gt;[http://www.worldhindunews.com/2015/08/14/46796/invitation-at-jatiya-shaktipeeth-inaugural-ceremony/ Bharat Mata Mandir]&lt;/ref&gt; by Shri [[Keshari Nath Tripathi]], the [[Governor of West Bengal]]. The initiative to build the temple, which has been named 'Jatiya Shaktipeeth', was taken by the Spiritual Society of India in order to mark the 140th Anniversary of 'Vande Mataram', the hymn to the Mother Land.

Bootees for babies are usually thick and knitted, to keep the baby's feet warm. [[Dog booties]] for dogs such as [[sledge dog]]s in very cold [[Arctic]] conditions (see [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]]) protect the animal from the cold. Booties worn over the shoes in cold-weather biking similarly protect cyclists. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realcyclist.com/cycling-booties-and-shoe-covers Cycling booties and shoe covers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disposable socks, such as those worn for hygiene by surgical teams, are also called bootees.

The '''''Christ as the Suffering Redeemer'''''  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Andrea Mantegna]], dated to c. 1488-1500 and housed in the [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Copenhagen, Denmark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==History==
The work is generally assigned to Mantegna's stay in Rome, due to stylistic similarities with the ''[[Madonna of the Quarry]]'', although other art historians considered it from the 1490s.

The painting appears in an inventory of the [[Gonzaga family]] from 1627, and it belonged to cardinal [[Silvio Valenti Gonzaga]] in 1763 when it became part of the Danish Royal, having been acquired by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] to make his collection equal to those of other European reigning families.

==Description==
The painting is signed on the edge of the marble base and his an original version of the traditional ''[[Pietà]]'' theme. Christ, portrayed with open hands to show all the wounds of the crucifixion, is raised on finely sculpted ancient sarcophagus.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

His body is wrapped in a metallic white drape, and his supported by two kneeling angels (a [[seraphim]] and a [[cherubim]]). On the left the tomb's cover is visible, while the background is occupied by a far landscape under the sunset light. On the right is the [[Calvary]] and a quarry in which two men are working a slab, a column and a statue. Two further workers can be seen in a grotto, illuminated by an internal source of light.  Finally, on the left are fields with shepherds and cattle and a walled city, [[Jerusalem]], at the feet of a rocky spur. Two pious women run a path to reach Jesus' tomb.

Fictional cloaking devices have been used as [[plot device]]s in various media for many years.

Developments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one [[wavelength]] of EM emissions. Scientists already use artificial materials called [[metamaterial]]s to bend light around an object.&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, Gary. "Going Where No One Has Gone Before", ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' #3. {{ISSN|1793-5725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual origins==
''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' screenwriter [[Paul Schneider (writer)|Paul Schneider]], inspired in part by the 1958 film ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]],'' and in part by ''[[The Enemy Below]],'' which in turn had been released the previous year, 1957, imagined cloaking as a space-travel analog of a [[submarine]] submerging, and employed it in the 1966 ''Star Trek'' episode "[[Balance of Terror]]", in which he introduced the [[Romulan]] species. (He likewise predicted, in the same episode, that invisibility, "selective bending of light" as described above, would have an enormous power requirement.) Another ''Star Trek'' screenwriter, [[D.C. Fontana]], coined the term ''"cloaking device"'' for the 1968 episode "[[The Enterprise Incident|The ''Enterprise'' Incident]]", which also featured Romulans.

Writers and game designers have since incorporated cloaking devices into many other science-fiction narratives, including &lt;!-- Please don't add more pop-culture examples of cloaking devices. This article is about the real-world development, not a crufty list comprising every game they've ever appeared in! A link to this article doesn't necessitate a reciprocal link. --&gt;''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', and ''[[Stargate]]''.

==Scientific experimentation==
An operational, [[non-fiction]]al cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually [[infrared]]), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but is more properly referred to as "[[active camouflage]]". Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation pass freely around the 'cloaked' object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Robert F. |last1=Service | first2= Adrian |last2= Cho |title= Strange New Tricks With Light |journal= Science |pages= 1622 |volume= 330 |date= 17 December 2010|bibcode = 2010Sci...330.1622S |doi=10.1126/science.330.6011.1622 |issue=6011 |pmid=21163994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metamaterial research===
{{main|Metamaterial cloaking}}
Optical [[metamaterial]]s have featured in several recent proposals for invisibility schemes. "Metamaterials" refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using [[transformation optics]] it is possible to design the optical parameters of a "cloak" so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths.&lt;ref name="pendry2006controlling"&gt;

These spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using [[metamaterials]]. There are several [[theories of cloaking]], giving rise to different types of invisibility.&lt;ref name="inami2003optical"&gt;

In 2014, scientists demonstrated good cloaking performance in murky water, demonstrating that an object shrouded in fog can disappear completely when appropriately coated with metamaterial.  This is due to the random scattering of light, such as that which occurs in clouds, fog, milk, frosted glass, etc., combined with the properties of the metamaterial coating.  When light is diffused, a thin coat of metamaterial around an object can make it essentially invisible under a range of lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, David R. |title= A cloaking coating for murky media |journal=Science|pages= 384–385 |volume= 345 |date= 25 July 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1256753|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..384S |pmid=25061192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schittny, Robert et cl. |title= Invisibility cloaking in a diffuse light scattering medium |journal=Science|pages= 427–429 |volume= 345 |date= 25 July 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1254524|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..427S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Active camouflage ===

''[[Active camouflage]]'' (or ''adaptive camouflage'') is a group of [[camouflage]] technologies which would allow an object (usually military in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection.

''Optical camouflage'' is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the 'fabric' catches up with the object's motion.  The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible.

It has been reported that the [[British Army]] has tested an invisible tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490669/Army-tests-James-Bond-style-tank-invisible.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Army tests James Bond style tank that is 'invisible' | date=30 October 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724063741/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490669/Army-tests-James-Bond-style-tank-invisible.html | archivedate=24 July 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Josh.

===Plasma stealth===
{{Main|Plasma stealth}}
[[plasma (physics)|Plasma]] at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible. However, generating plasma in air is too expensive and a feasible alternative is generating plasma between thin membranes instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990sri..reptQ....V Plasma cloaking: Air chemistry, broadband absorption, and plasma generation] [http://www.stormingmedia.us/44/4402/A440222.html backup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802184503/http://www.stormingmedia.us/44/4402/A440222.html |date=2009-08-02 }}, February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defense Technical Information Center]] is also following up research on plasma reducing [[Radar cross-section|RCS]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Gregoire, D.

===Metascreen===
A prototype Metascreen is a claimed cloaking device, which is just few [[micrometers]] thick and to a limited extent can hide [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects from microwaves in their natural environment, in their natural positions, in all directions, and from all of the observer's positions. It was prepared at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] by Professor [[Andrea Alù]].&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2298863/Invisibility-cloaks-reality-scientists-invent-ultra-material-hides-objects.html|work=Daily Mail|date=25 March 2013|title=Invisibility cloaks are almost a reality after scientists invent ultra-thin material that hides objects from microwaves|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505004438/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2298863/Invisibility-cloaks-reality-scientists-invent-ultra-material-hides-objects.html|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/28/ultrathin-metascreen-forms-latest-invisibility-cloak|work=PhysicsWorld.com|date=28 March 2013|title=Ultrathin "metascreen" forms latest invisibility cloak|author=Tim Wogan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817232220/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/28/ultrathin-metascreen-forms-latest-invisibility-cloak|archivedate=17 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metascreen consisted of a 66 micrometre thick polycarbonate film supporting an arrangement of 20 micrometer thick copper strips that resembled a [[fishing net]].  In the experiment, when the metascreen was hit by 3.6&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves, it re-radiated microwaves of the same frequency that were out of phase, thus cancelling out reflections from the object being hidden.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com/&gt;  The device only cancelled out the scattering of microwaves in the first order.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com/&gt; The same researchers published a paper on "[[Theories of cloaking#Plasmonic cover|plasmonic cloaking]]" the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630 New Journal of Physics, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Howell/Choi cloaking device ===
University of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi have announced a scalable cloaking device which uses common optical lenses to achieve visible light cloaking on the macroscopic scale, known as the "[[Rochester Cloak]]". The device consists of a series of four lenses which direct light rays around objects which would otherwise occlude the optical pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first =| authorlink =| title = Cloaking' device uses ordinary lenses to hide objects across range of angles| work = Science Daily| publisher = Science Daily| date = 29 September 2014| url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140929085221.htm| doi =| accessdate = 29 September 2014| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141001000527/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140929085221.htm| dead-url =yes| archivedate =2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloaking in mechanics===
The concepts of cloaking are not limited to optics but can also be transferred to other fields of physics. For example, it was possible to cloak acoustics for certain frequencies as well as touching in mechanics. This renders an object "invisible" to sound or even hides it from touching.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bückmann | first = Tiemo | year = 2014 | title = An elasto-mechanical unfeelability cloak made of pentamode metamaterials | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 5 | issue = 4130 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms5130 | url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140619/ncomms5130/full/ncomms5130.html | bibcode = 2014NatCo...5E4130B | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160202133647/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140619/ncomms5130/full/ncomms5130.html | archivedate = 2016-02-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural critic''' is a [[critic]] of a given [[culture]], usually as a whole and typically on a radical basis.{{cn|date=April 2012}} There is significant overlap with [[social theory|social]] and [[cultural theory]].

==Terminology ==
Contemporary usage has tended to include all types of [[criticism]] directed at [[culture]].

The term ''cultural criticism'' itself has been claimed by [[Jacques Barzun]]: ''No such thing was recognized or in favour when we [i.e. Barzun and Trilling] began&amp;mdash;more by intuition than design&amp;mdash;in the autumn of 1934''.&lt;ref&gt;''Remembering [[Lionel Trilling]]'', (1976), reprinted in ''The Jacques Barzun Reader'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casey Nelson Blake, a professor at [[Columbia University]] where Barzun and Trilling were, uses the term in the 1990 book title ''Beloved Community: The Cultural Criticism of [[Randolph Bourne]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Waldo Frank]], and [[Lewis Mumford]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a work such as [[Richard Wolin]]'s 1995 ''The Terms of Cultural Criticism: The Frankfurt School, Existentialism, Poststructuralism'' (1995) uses it as a broad-brush description.

==Victorian sages as critics==
Cultural critics came to the scene in the nineteenth century. [[Matthew Arnold]]&lt;ref&gt;His much-cited ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' was subtitled ''An Essay in Political and Social Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are leading examples of a cultural critic of the [[Victorian age]]; in Arnold there is also a concern for religion. [[John Ruskin]] was another.  Because of an equation made between ugliness of material surroundings and an impoverished life, [[aesthete]]s and others might be considered implicitly to be engaging in cultural criticism, but the actual articulation is what makes a critic. In France, [[Charles Baudelaire]] was a cultural critic, as was [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in Denmark and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in Germany.

==Twentieth century==
{{See|Critical theory|Frankfurt School|Theodor W. Adorno|Culture industry}}
In the twentieth century [[Irving Babbitt]] on the right, and [[Walter Benjamin]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Richard Wolin]], ''Walter Benjamin: An Aesthetic of Redemption'' (1994), series ''Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; on the left, might be considered major cultural critics. The field of play has changed considerably, in that the [[humanities]] have broadened to include [[cultural studies]] of all kinds, which are grounded in [[critical theory]].

==Characters==

===Vanessa Cleveland===

A blonde Daughter of the Moon and Daughter of Pandora, who stars in ''Goddess of the Night'' (Book #1), ''Moon Demon'' (Book #7) where she finds out that she started to fall in love with what Jimena's grandmother called the devil, and ''The Final Eclipse'' (Book #13).  As a Daughter of the Moon, she is able to expand her molecules and become invisible. Occasionally, she can move objects while she is invisible, but it takes a lot of concentration. Originally, Vanessa was cautious about using her power, which caused her to have very poor control over it. However, throughout the series, she becomes more comfortable using it although she is still affected by strong emotions, such as fear. She lives with her mother, a Hollywood costume designer. Her father was a stunt coordinator who died when she was five in an accident. Vanessa is portrayed as being intelligent and always trying to see the best of people, such as Morgan Page who is consistently rude to Vanessa's other friends. Her best friend is Catty Turner, whom she has known since they were both children. She dates Michael Saratoga on and off throughout the series. In book 4, she starts to date Toby, a Regulator, who wants the Secret Scroll destroyed but he endangers all of the girls, including Vanessa. Fortunately, he is ultimately killed in the end. In book 7, Vanessa starts to date a mysterious guy named Hector, who later turns out to be a moon demon. He tries to marry her so she can live with him for eternity, but she frees him from his bonds to the Atrox, causing his death. In the same book, Vanessa reveals a talent for singing and joins Michael's band. Also her birthday is revealed to be November 14. In book 13, Vanessa returns from Nefandus after being held prisoner there for many months and discovers her 17th birthday is a few days away. After she helps to defeat the Atrox she is faced with the choice of becoming a guardian spirit or losing her memories of what she is and her powers. She makes the choice of losing her memories and her powers.

===Serena Killingsworth===
Serena has long dark hair with red tips in the beginning of the series then she goes her natural dark brown. She has green eyes, and 3 piercings; one in her tongue, one in her nose, and one in her belly button. She is a Daughter of both Selene and Hekate resulting in her being a goddess of the moon and a goddess of the dark. She lives with her brother, Collin Killingsworth. Her best friend is Jimena, a fellow goddess. She stars in Into the Cold Fire (Book #2), and Possession (Book #8). She is the only Daughter to have the choice to become a goddess of the dark because she is the key to the balance of good or evil. She has the ability to read and cloud minds, powers similar to the Atrox's. She also has the ability to open and close portals. Serena continues to pursue an on and off relationship with Stanton, a Follower of the Atrox who later becomes the Prince of Night. Stanton is constantly worried because being with Serena can get them both killed by the Regulators. In the end, after she helps to defeat the Atrox, Serena has to make the choice of losing her memories of what she is and her powers, becoming a guardian spirit, or becoming the goddess of the dark. Stanton asks Serena to rule by his side and become the goddess of the dark and she accepts his offer. She stays in Nefandus with Stanton to make it a world of light.

===Jimena Castillo===

Daughter of the Moon and former member of an [[Los Angeles|LA]] gang. She is Mexican and holds the power of premonition, seeing into the future. She lives with her grandmother in an apartment. Jimena used to be an incredibly tough hood rat with a gang from her neighborhood, Ninth Street, or el Nueve, until she learned of her destiny. Her old gang name Risky is tattooed on her hip. She was sentenced to Youth Camp twice, and has two tear mark tattoos, one for each time. She also has a three dots on the webbing of her thumb from when she joined her gang. Later in the series, Jimena has Catty give her another tattoo of a moon and star on her arm. After facing Followers together and seeing that Serena would always have her back, she and Jimena become best friends. In book 3 she begins dating Collin Killingsworth, Serena's older brother. As the series goes on, it is revealed that Jimena is actually a year older than her friends, so she is the forced to be the first to make the choice of losing her memories of what she is and her powers, or becoming a guardian spirit. Eventually she chooses to stay mortal because she both saw a premonition of her death and realized how much of the world she had yet to experience. Maggie, the Daughters' mentor, explains that Jimena's premonition was not of her death, but of the end of her time as a Daughter. On her last day as a Daughter, she was given the Medusa stone to protect her from enchantment and evil spirits. She then becomes a mortal and completely forgets her life as a Daughter. However, later in the series, it is established that she is the reincarnation of the moon goddess [[Pandia]] who was Maggie's and the other early daughters' mentor. She now serves as the new mentor for her friends after Maggie's death and to other future daughters.

===Catty Turner===

Daughter of the Moon and heiress to the Secret Scroll, starring in ''The Secret Scroll'' (Book #4) and ''The Prophecy'' (Book #11). Catty has the power to travel back and forth through time (''chronokinesis''). She was abandoned by her birth mother, Zoe Reese, who was a Daughter of the Moon with the powers of telekinesis. She was picked up by Kendra Turner on the side of the road. Kendra originally thought because of Catty's power, that Catty was an alien so she adopted her as her own, to protect her. Kendra is very lax with Catty and does not mind when Catty misses class in order to "hop" time. Catty's best friend is Vanessa and unlike her, she is not shy about using her power. Much to Vanessa's chagrin, Catty often uses it in public places and does not care about how her time hops affect people. Unlike Vanessa who tries to be cautious and cool, Catty is often wild and impulsive.

An ambition of Catty's is to find her biological mother and she manages to do so in ''The Secret Scroll''. There, she finds out that her mother became Follower of the Atrox and that her biological father is a member of the Atrox's inner circle. Later, it is revealed that Catty's birth name is Atertra Adamantis, which means "black diamond". From her mother, Catty inherits the Secret Scroll and finds it is her destiny to destroy the Atrox with it. Chris (also known as Chriysippus), the Keeper of the Secret Scroll and Catty's ex-boyfriend, helps her find the Scroll but almost loses his life, because it was intertwined with the scroll which Catty ultimately destroys in one of the later books.

In ''Prophecy'', Catty meets her father who offers her a place with the Atrox. She declines. She also begins to date, Kyle Ormond, who was once enslaved in Nefandus. By the Barbarian (Sons of the Dark !), they had broken up cause Catty discovers that their destinies are intertwined. She is spared by the Atrox after Tianna rebinds it to it's shadow cause her father convinced the Atrox that Catty would join them. Catty accepts and gains new powers from her father and the Atrox, much to the shock of her friends but is revealed she is actually planning to destroy the Atrox from the inside. She lies to the Atrox and pretends to have captured the Sons of the Dark, gaining a place in the Inner Circle. She ultimately succeeds in destroying the Atrox but sacrifices her life in the process.

===Tianna Moore===

A girl with the powers of [[telekinesis]] who can also use that power to go into other dimensions, she first shows up in ''The Lost One'' (Book #6) and in ''The Becoming'' (Book #12). She becomes a Daughter of the Moon after she helps Catty get out of Nefandus, the realm of the Atrox. When she first shows up ''The Lost One'', she has no memory of who she is or where she came from. Ultimately, she pieces together the facts: she grew up in foster homes all over LA because her parents and little sister, Jamie, were killed by Followers when she was a child. She also begins to date a boy named Derek who knows the Daughters secrets. Their relationship last until ''The Becoming''. The foster mother she lives with is discovered to be a failed creation by the Atrox. Tianna was created by the Atrox and thus was born without a soul, but Selene kidnapped her when she was a baby and gave her to a Daughter. Her mother gave her moon dew so that Tianna would have a soul and become as human as possible. Her evil destiny is to become the wife of the Atrox and give birth to its child. Her good destiny, created with the help of Selene and her mother, is to rebind the Atrox to it's shadow. In book 12, Tianna re-binds the Atrox, which was in its most powerful form as a human, to its shadow form. In doing so, she destroys herself. Before the Atrox could get her soul, Selene saves her soul.

===Stanton===

An L.A. Follower who becomes the Prince of the Night who stars in the book ''The Sacrifice'' (Book #5). He was an invitus, someone who unwillingly came to the Atrox in the 13th Century. His father, a prince, was hunting the Atrox, leaving Stanton at home. Unfortunately, while the prince was away, the Atrox took Stanton to scare his father from ever attempting to destroy it again. In ''Goddess of the Night''(Book #1), he shows Vanessa his memory of his kidnapping. In his memory, she attempts to free him and for that act of kindness, he can never hurt her. He is in love with Serena, even though their love for each other is forbidden. In ''The Sacrifice'', he becomes free as a Follower at last, but chooses to go back to the Atrox in order to save Serena. In doing this, he is able to trap Lambert in his memory, and is awarded the status of Prince of the Night. With that status, he can order the Regulators not to hurt Serena and occasionally, her friends. He helps the Daughters throughout the series because of his devotion to Serena. He gave Tianna the sword to bind the Atrox to its shadow, helped in the disguise of monk so that Kyle escape, and visited Serena and Vanessa while they were held captive in Nefandus. Stanton helps Vanessa and Catty destroy the Atrox and save Serena. After the Atrox is destroyed, he becomes the new leader in Nefandus with Serena by his side. He also helped Vanessa in  the 7th book by warning her about Hector and sending her a protector/follower that looked like Michael.

===Maggie Craven===

She was the Daughters' mentor and taught them how to control their respective powers. In ''The Talisman'' (Book #10), we find more about her past. Maggie was born in Athens, Greece as Penelope. She is an illegitimate child of Zeus and grew up with her adoptive father and sister, Taemestra. As Penelope grew devoted to Selene, her sister became a follower of the Atrox. She fell in love with a young, handsome soldier named Hector, who later became captured by the Atrox and became the moon demon who tried to marry Vanessa in book 7. Maggie managed to bind the Atrox to its shadow form for the first time, Tianna being the second. Also near the end of ''The Talisman'', Maggie discovers she is pregnant with Hectors child. 

Angered by her sister's choice and Hector's transformation, she asked Selene to live long enough to see the Atrox destroyed. However, before Selene could grant her wish, the Atrox overheard and granted it. Unfortunately for Maggie, she had forgotten to ask for perpetual youth, but Selene gave her an elixir that would keep her young. When the Atrox visited her, she said an incantation to destroy it but it backfired to destroy her instead, as it was not her destiny to destroy the Atrox. Before she can warn the Daughters and contact Jimena, who is the next mentor to the Daughters, her body is destroyed by the incantation and her soul moves on.

===Atrox===

The Atrox is the enemy of The Daughters of the Moon. It wants to unleash diseases, terror and other horrible things. But to unleash these terrible things it must destroy the Daughters of the Moon. It created Tianna Moore, and protected Vanessa Cleveland. In the End the Atrox ends up being defeated by Catty Turner.

==Minor characters==

===Morgan Page===
Morgan is introduced in "Goddess of the Night" as a wealthy, narrow-minded, and snobbish socialite friend of Vanessa's. Catty, Jimena, and Serena dislike her, mostly due to the fact that her mind seems encompassed around nothing but boys and clothes although Vanessa once noticed that Morgan is deliberately trying to be care free to cover up her own insecurities. However, she is snide and rude, criticizing Serena Killingsworth, on her unique fashion sense although Serena once penetrated her mind and saw that Morgan was jealous of Serena's talent on the cello.  She meets Stanton at Planet Bang, and begins dating him, unaware of his status as a Follower. He and the other Followers ultimately steals her hope, and Vanessa brings her to Maggie Craven, the mentor of the Daughters, who restores Morgan's dwindling hope.

Morgan, normal once more and just as cold-hearted, pursues Collin Killingsworth, Serena's older brother, in "Into the Cold Fire". Serena enacts vengeance on Morgan for criticizing her [Serena] behind her back, by manipulating Morgan's thought during a pep rally speech. Morgan delivers a humorous, off the topic speech about how she stuffed her bra during a party. Enraged and somehow knowing Serena was behind it, she confronts Serena. Later on, they stumble into each other, and in the end of the book, is seen fleeing with Followers, implying she's one of them (as Zahi, an Immortal Follower, had been courting her, too).

In Night Shade, Morgan is a part of a scheme by Cassandra in which she, Morgan, and Karyl plot to destroy the Daughters, focusing mainly on Jimena Castillo. She is the one who lures Veto into placing Jimena in their trap. When everything fails for the three Followers, Cassandra is made an outcast, and nothing is heard of about Morgan and Karyl.

Morgan comes into play once more in Possession. She is fearful of something that the Daughters don't know of, to the point where she purchases a charm to ward off evil. Serena somehow can't access her mind, too. She's later revealed to have been possessed by Aura, and is finally released from this possession after Serena fends off the Infidi (those loyal to Lambert and Aura).

===Chris===

He was Catty's boyfriend and the keeper of the Secret Scroll. His real name is Chryssipus and is from ancient Greece. He met Maggie on her way to destroy the Atrox and helped her bind it to its shadow. Throughout the centuries, he was the keeper of the secret scroll, which he later gives to Catty. He fell in love with her in ''The Secret Scroll'' (Book #4).  He disappears, but comes back to help Jimena in ''The Choice'' (Book #9). In ''The Prophecy'' (Book #11), he is held prisoner by Catty's father. He tells Catty that his life is bound to the scroll so that when Catty destroys the scroll, he is destroyed as well.

===Cassandra===

A Follower, she was once madly in love with Stanton. She is described as having long maroon hair and icy blue eyes, and has the letters S-T-A carved into her chest with a razor blade.In the third book, she is given an opportunity to destroy the Daughters and gets into the Inner Circle for a little while. Unfortunately for her, she fails the Atrox and becomes an Outcast. She is seen on and off throughout the books, causing trouble and such, in an attempt to win Stanton.

===Kyle Ormond===
Kyle is Catty's boyfriend during ''The Prophecy'' (Book #11) and ''The Becoming'' (Book #12). He is first described as a gorgeous high school boy who attracts girls despite his reputation as a magnet for trouble. It is later revealed that he is a ''servus'', a slave in Nefandus. As a ''servus'', Kyle has the ability to read minds. He is also under a curse that forces him to kill any non-resident of Nefandus that he tries to kiss by slowly absorbing her power. He first stepped into Nefandus to save a friend who had been lured into the realm with promises of learning magic, only to become captured and enslaved himself. Kyle escaped with the help of a monk (Stanton in disguise) who showed him the portals and told him the myth of a black diamond that could set him free. In pursuit of this jewel and his freedom, he is tricked by Adamantis into bringing Catty into Nefandus, inadvertently putting her in danger. Realizing his mistake, he eventually saves Catty and the two begin a relationship after Catty accepts her evil heritage. In ''The Final Eclipse'' (Book #13), Kyle sacrifices his life so that Catty could infiltrate the Inner Circle and destroy the Atrox.

===Justin and Mason===

They are two Followers who killed Tianna's parents and sister. They went back in time to kill Tianna, not aware that she was created by the Atrox. In book 12, they become Outcasts and want Tianna to go to the Atrox to ask it to let them back in.

===Hector===

Maggie's old lover. He fell in love with Maggie and wanted to marry her, but she could not accept because she promised herself to Selene until the Atrox was destroyed. As a result, he challenged the Atrox for Maggie, but it tricked him and he became the moon demon. In book 7, the Atrox summons him to destroy the Daughters but he falls in love with Vanessa. He tries to marry her and have her rule with him but in the end, Vanessa frees him and he peacefully dies.

===Lambert Malmaris===

A member of the Inner Circle and allowed to wear the Phoenix Crest, which makes him very powerful. Lambert first appeared in ''The Sacrifice'' (Book #5), where he joined forces with Cassandra to destroy the Atrox and take over. In the end, Stanton destroys his body but he shows up again in ''Possession'' (Book #8). Stanton imprisoned him in his memories of the Atrox but Aura, Lambert's lover, possessed Serena to get close to Stanton and use Serena's powers to free Lambert. After Stanton destroyed him in book 5, he becomes a sphere of light that can possess anyone. He is also known as Darius.

===Aura Triton===

Aura Triton is Lambert's lover. She was born in A.D. 1223 to a peasant father, with a jewel clutched in her hands, which subsequently disappeared. Her fate was thus sealed: all good would slip through her fingers. Aura, known then as Ursula, became renowned for her unearthly beauty, attracting even the Atrox, who offered her father great treasures if she would betroth it. Seeing her father's poverty, Ursula agreed to the marriage and pledged her devotion for all of eternity, asking only that her beauty should last forever. Yet when Lambert, a follower, came to bring her to the underworld, he fell desperately in love with her, and she with him. Despite attempts to hide their love, the Atrox saw through her deception. When she stepped into the cold fire to receive immortality, the flames destroyed her flesh and bones, reducing her to a wind spirit. Using a potion that Lambert procures from the ancient enchantress Circe, she then lives on by possessing other people and switching bodies whenever the one she possesses becomes old. Aura appears in ''Possession'' (Book #8), when she begins taking over Serena's body in an attempt to use her powers to free Lambert from Stanton's memories. Other individuals that Aura has possessed include the starlet Ann Anderson and ex-follower Morgan Page.

===Tymmie and Karyl===

Tymmie and Karyl are two of the first Followers that the Daughters encounter in the series. They were once apprenticed to Stanton but since Stanton's appointment as Prince of the Night, Karyl has not been mentioned. However, Tymmie joins Lambert. In ''Goddess of the Night'' he is blond with black roots but in the 7th book he shaves his head and tattoos "Atrox" on it. In book 13, he reunites with Karyl to work for Catty's father.

===Adamantis===

One of the members of the Inner Circle of the Atrox and Catty's father, he is trying to overthrow the Atrox. Despite being on the same side of the Daughters, he never loved Catty and tried to have Stanton destroyed. Vanessa fights him and defeats him. He leaves Nefandus but it is unknown whether or not he is in Earth's Realm.His goal is to stay with Catty.

===Zoe Reese===

Zoe is Catty's biological mother and a former Daughter of the Moon with the power of telekinesis. She became frightened of her impending metamorphosis and turned to the Atrox, who promised her the gift of immortality. However, the Atrox sensed that her commitment was made out of fear and tricked her. Zoe had failed to ask for perpetual youth. From the moment she turned immortal, she was condemned to age for all of eternity. She first blamed Maggie for her misfortune but eventually comes to accept that her fate was due to her own lack of courage. As a follower, Zoe falls in love with Adamantis and gives birth to his child Atertra, later known as Catty. In order to protect her daughter from Regulators and from her destiny as heiress to the Secret Scroll, she abandons Catty on the side of a deserted highway after having Stanton remove her childhood memories. She then settles near Catty and watches over her without daring to reveal her presence, for fear that she would put her daughter in danger. Because she has done so much to protect Catty, Selene visits her in her dreams and welcomes her soul, offering her a second chance. Zoe accepts this offer after she has a discussion with Catty and leaves her body behind to become a spirit.

The '''Diploma Supplement''' is a document accompanying a [[Europe|European]] higher education diploma, providing a standardised description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies completed by its holder.

==Overview==
The Diploma Supplement is designed to provide a description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies that were successfully completed by the individual named on the original qualification to which the supplement is appended. It should be free from any [[value-judgement]]s, equivalence statements or suggestions about recognition. The Diploma Supplement provides a common structure to translate qualifications across the EU. It is a flexible, non-prescriptive tool which has been shown to save time, money and workload by an EU [[working party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.lv/ENIC/ds/wpreport.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Diploma Supplements were gradually implemented at European universities as part of the Bologna Process, since approximately 1999. Students graduating from European Universities since this date, and depending on what year the country in which their university is located became signatory to his Process, typically will have received a Diploma Supplement. However, even as late as 2013 there were still some European universities, who despite their country's years-old membership of the Bologna Process, had not yet finished the necessary procedures for issuing Diploma Supplements to their graduates. 

It is important for countries and educational institutions located outside of the European Higher Education Area to realize that Diploma Supplements cannot be retroactively issued, hence why students who graduated before their institution's country became signatory to the Bologna Convention cannot possibly have a diploma supplement for that degree. Consequently, requesting a Diploma Supplement from a student who graduated from a European university in 1995 or earlier is nonsensical since the Bologna Process was not even in place before that date.

'''''Epiphany Jones''''' is the [[debut novel]] by [[Michael Grothaus]] published in June 2016. The novel is a literary thriller, social [[satire]], and [[dark comedy]] about America's obsession with sex, celebrity, and the internet, which explores a [[pornography addict]]’s unwilling relationship with a woman who thinks she can speak to God and their entanglement with sex traffickers that cater to the Hollywood elite. Grothaus has stated that his personal experiences at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and his disillusionment with the Hollywood [[film industry]] were strong inspiration for the novel.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Robin|title=Audible Interview With Michael Grothaus: Audible Sessions|url=http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Arts-Entertainment/FREE-Audible-Interview-With-Michael-Grothaus-Audiobook/B01K4TTVKG|publisher=Audible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

The novel’s protagonist is Jerry Dresden an employee at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] who suffers from a [[Pornography addiction|porn addiction]] as well as [[psychotic depression]]. Both are the result of the tragic deaths of his little sister and high-flying Hollywood father years earlier. As a result of his psychotic depression, Jerry suffers from psychotic delusions which make him see people who don’t really exist—people Jerry calls "figments". His mundane but stable life is interrupted one day when his colleague at the museum is murdered and a famous painting by [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]] (''Self-Portrait'', Spring 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-05|title=Portraits of Vincent van Gogh|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portraits_of_Vincent_van_Gogh&amp;oldid=768701711|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is stolen. Returning from work that night Jerry finds the stolen painting in his apartment and the next day he discovers that a woman who he thought was just one of his figments his entire life turns out to be a real person.

This former figment tells Jerry her name is Epiphany Jones and admits she stole the painting and killed Jerry’s colleague in order to frame him and blackmails him into helping her find someone she is looking for. Left with no choice, Jerry flees with her to Mexico, then Portugal, and finally to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France as Epiphany, which says the voice of God is speaking to her and telling her what to do, tracks down a sex trafficking ring that caters to the Hollywood elite. Along the way, Jerry discovers Epiphany is not all she seems to be as their journey grows increasingly fraught with danger and he discovers secrets about both their pasts that will change his life forever.

== Reception ==

{{Eschatology |width=18.75em}}

'''Eschatology''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-eschatology.ogg|ˌ|ɛ|s|k|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} is a part of [[theology]] concerned with the final events of [[history of the world| history]], or the ultimate [[destiny]] of humanity. This concept is commonly referred to as the "[[end of the world (civilization) |end of the world]]" or "[[end time]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/endtimes_1.shtml |title= BBC - Religions - Christianity: End Times |publisher= [[BBC Online]] |date= 2011-07-19 |accessdate= 2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word arises from the [[Ancient Greek| Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἔσχατος|ἔσχατος]]}} ''eschatos'' meaning "last" and ''[[-logy]]'' meaning "the study of", and first appeared in English around 1844.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eschatology Dictionary – Definition of Eschatology]. [[Webster's Online Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines eschatology as "the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind".&lt;ref&gt;"Eschatology, ''n.''", def. a, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 2016-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[mysticism]], the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary [[reality]] and to reunion with [[the Divine]]. Many{{quantify|date=November 2018}} [[religion]]s treat eschatology as a future event [[prophecy|prophesied]] in [[sacred text]]s or in [[folklore]].

History is often divided{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} into "ages" ([[aeons]]), which are time periods each with certain commonalities. One age comes to an end and a new age or [[world to come]], where different realities are present, begins. When such transitions from one age to another are the subject of eschatological discussion, the phrase, "end of the world", is replaced by "end of the age", "end of an era", or "end of life as we know it". Much [[apocalyptic fiction]] does not deal with the "end of time" but rather with the end of a certain period, the end of [[life ]]as it is now, and the beginning of a new period. It is usually a crisis that brings an end to current reality and ushers in a new way of living, thinking, or being.{{cn|date=November 2018}} This crisis may take the form of the intervention of a deity in history, a war, a change in the environment, or the reaching of a new [[Level of consciousness (Esotericism) | level of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Sofroniou |first= Andreas |title= Philosophy and Science of Eschatology |url= https://books.google.com/?id=7Vc1DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year= 2017 |publisher= [[Lulu.com]] |isbn= 9780244632243 |page= [https://books.google.com/?id=7Vc1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22+of+the+intervention+of+a+deity+in+history,+a+war,+a+change+in+the+environment,+or+the+reaching+of+a+new+level+of+consciousness%22 77]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most{{quantify|date=November 2018}} modern eschatology and [[apocalypticism]], both religious and secular, involve the violent disruption or destruction of the world; whereas Christian and Jewish eschatologies view the end times as the consummation or perfection of God's creation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Williams |first= Sean |title= The Big Picture. Making Sense Out of Life and Religion |url= https://books.google.com/?id=QYyIAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date= 2009 |publisher= Lulu.com |isbn= 9780578015231 |page= [https://books.google.com/?id=QYyIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22Christian+and+Jewish+eschatologies+view+the+end+times+as+the+consummation+or+perfection+of+God's+creation+of+the+world%22 91]}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit with violent overtures, such as the [[Great Tribulation]]. For example, according to some ancient Hebrew worldviews, reality unfolds along a linear path (or rather, a spiral path, with cyclical components that nonetheless have a linear trajectory); the world began with God and is ultimately headed toward God's final goal for creation, the world to come.&lt;ref&gt;
Sofroniou, Andreas (2017). p. [https://books.google.com/?id=7Vc1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22For+example,+according+to+some+ancient+Hebrew+worldviews,+reality+unfolds+along+a+linear+path+(or+rather,+a+spiral+path,+with+cyclical+components+that+nonetheless+have+a+linear+trajectory)%22 77].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Eschatologies vary as to their degree of optimism or pessimism about the future. In some eschatologies, conditions are better for some and worse for others, e.g. "heaven and hell". They also vary as to [[time frame]]s. Groups claiming ''imminent'' eschatology are also referred to as [[Doomsday cults]].

== Religion ==
=== Bahá'í ===
{{See also|Bahá'í Faith on life after death|Bahá'í teachings}}

In [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] belief, creation has neither a beginning nor an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |url=https://books.google.com/?id=z7zdDFTzNr0C&amp;printsec=frontcover|year=2008 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=z7zdDFTzNr0C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22the+physical+universe+asa+totality+has+always+existed+in+some+form,+having+neither+beginning+nor+end.%22 112]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the eschatology of other religions is viewed as symbolic.

{{Main|Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological views}}
Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the Old and New Testament.

Christian eschatology looks to study and discuss matters such as death and the [[afterlife]], [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]] and [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]], the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Jesus]], the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Rapture]], the [[Tribulation]], [[Millennialism]], the end of the world, the [[Last Judgment]], and the New Heaven and [[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]] in the [[world to come]].

Eschatological passages are found in many places in the Bible, both in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]s. In the Old Testament, apocalyptic eschatology can be found notably in [[Isaiah]] 24–27, Isaiah 56–66, [[Book of Joel|Joel]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9–14 as well as closing chapters of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]].&lt;ref name=NBD&gt;Bauckham, R. J. (1996). Apocalyptic. In D. R. W. Wood, I. H. Marshall, A. R. Millard, J. I. Packer, &amp; D. J. Wiseman (Eds.), New Bible Dictionary (3rd ed., p. 53). Leicester, England; Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, applicable passages include [[Matthew 24]], [[Mark 13]], the [[parable]] of "[[The Sheep and the Goats]]" and in the [[Book of Revelation]]—although Revelation often occupies a central place in Christian eschatology.

The [[Second Coming]] of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology within the broader context of the fullness of the [[Kingdom_of_God_(Christianity)|Kingdom of God]]. Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ's return. There are, however, various views concerning the order and significance of other eschatological events.

The Book of Revelation is at the core of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or [[hermeneutic]]s. In the [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurist]] approach, Revelation is treated mostly as unfulfilled prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future. In the [[Preterism|Preterist]] approach, Revelation is chiefly interpreted as having prophetic fulfillment in the past. , principally, the events of the first century CE. 

In the [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] approach, Revelation provides a broad view of history, and passages in Revelation are identified with major historical people and events. This is view the Jewish scholars held, along with the early Christian church, and it was prevalent in Wycliffe's writings,&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale, William, ''Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008)at pages 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; and other Reformers such as Martin Luther, &lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin, ″Sermon for the Twenty-Fifth Sunday after Trinity; Matthew 24:15-28″, ''Church Postil'', 1525&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Merle D’aubigne’s  History of the Reformation of the Sixteen Century  , book vi, chapter xii, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; John Calvin, &lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John, ″Lecture Fifty-Second", ''Commentary on Daniel'', Volume&lt;/ref&gt; 
John Wesley, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/wesley/mat024.htm|title=Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible: Matthew: Matthew Chapter 24|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir Isaac Newton, &lt;ref&gt;All Roads Lead to Rome,  by Michael de Semlyen. Dorchestor House Publications, p. 205. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gregg, "Revelation: Four Views," Nashville: Thomas Nelson Pub, 1997, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealist]] approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.

==== Messianic Judaism ====
{{Main|Messianic Jewish theology#Eschatology}}

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|Hindu eschatology}}
Contemporary Hindu eschatology is linked in the [[Vaishnavite]] tradition to the figure of [[Kalki]], the tenth and last [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] before the age draws to a close who will reincarnate as [[Shiva]] and simultaneously dissolve and regenerate the universe.

Most Hindus believe that the current period is the [[Kali Yuga]], the last of four ''Yuga'' that make up the current age. Each period has seen successive degeneration in the moral order, to the point that in the Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are the norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or "[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]". Each kalpa lasts 4.1 – 8.2 billion years, which is one full day and night for [[Brahma]], who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of [[Brahma|birth]], [[Vishnu|growth]], [[Shiva|decay]], and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavite belief. Some Shaivites hold the view that Shiva is incessantly destroying and creating the world.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islamic eschatology}}
[[Islamic eschatology]] is documented in the [[Hadith|sayings]] of the [[Prophet of Islam|Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], regarding the Signs of the Day of Judgement. The Prophet's sayings on the subject have been traditionally divided into Major and Minor Signs. He spoke about several Minor Signs of the approach of the Day of Judgment, including:
* [[Abu Hurairah]] reported that [[Muhammad]] said: "If you survive for a time you would certainly see people who would have whips in their hands like the tail of an ox. They would get up in the morning under the wrath of God and they would go into the evening with the anger of God."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* [[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said, "When honesty is lost, then wait for the Day of Judgment." It was asked, "How will honesty be lost, O Messenger of God?" He said, "When authority is given to those who do not deserve it, then wait for the Day of Judgment."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], in a long narration, relating to the questions of the angel [[Gabriel#Islamic references|Gabriel]], reported: "Inform me when the Day of Judgment will be." He [the Prophet Muhammad] remarked: "The one who is being asked knows no more than the inquirer." He [the inquirer] said: "Tell me about its indications." He [the Prophet Muhammad] said: "That the slave-girl gives birth to her mistress and master, and that you would find barefooted, destitute shepherds of goats vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* "Before the Day of Judgment there will be great liars, so beware of them."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* "When the most wicked member of a tribe becomes its ruler, and the most worthless member of a community becomes its leader, and a man is respected through fear of the evil he may do, and leadership is given to people who are unworthy of it, expect the Day of Judgment."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Regarding the Major Signs, a [[Sahaba|Companion of the Prophet]] narrated: "Once we were sitting together and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us what it was we were discussing. We said it was the Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, [[Dajjal]] (the [[Antichrist]]), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the [[Second Coming#Islam|Second Coming]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], the emergence of [[Gog and Magog#Qur'an|Gog and Magog]], and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].'" (note: the previous events were not listed in the chronological order of appearance){{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish eschatology}}
Jewish eschatology is concerned with events that will happen in the [[End time|end of days]], according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] and Jewish thought. This includes the ingathering of the exiled [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the coming of the [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah]], [[afterlife]], and the [[Techiyat hamaysim|revival of the dead Tzadikim]].

In Judaism, the end times are usually called the "end of days" (''aḥarit ha-yamim'', אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the [[Tanakh]]. The idea of a [[messianic age]] has a prominent place in Jewish thought and is incorporated as part of the end of days.

[[Judaism]] addresses the [[end time]]s in the [[Book of Daniel]] and numerous other prophetic passages in the Hebrew scriptures, and also in the [[Talmud]], particularly Tractate [[Avodah Zarah]].

=== Zoroastrianism ===
{{Main|Frashokereti}}
Frashokereti is the [[Zoroastrian]] doctrine of a final renovation of the universe when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will then be in perfect unity with God ([[Ahura Mazda]]). The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this." Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1979|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-415-23902-8|pages=27–29|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fasolada''', '''fasoulada''' or sometimes '''fasolia''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: فاصوليا), ({{lang-el|φασολάδα, φασουλάδα or φασόλια}}) is a [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], Levantine, and [[Cypriot cuisine|Cypriot]] [[soup]] of [[Common bean|dry white beans]], [[olive oil]], and vegetables, sometimes called the "national food of the [[Greeks]]".&lt;ref&gt;Λεξικό της κοινής Νεοελληνικής, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Its counterpart in [[Turkish cuisine]] is called '''[[kuru fasulye]]'''. The [[Arab cuisine|Arabic]] version is called '''fasoulia''' ({{lang-ar|فاصوليا}}) and is found in [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]].

Fasolada is made by simmering beans with tomatoes and other vegetables such as [[carrots]], [[onion]], [[parsley]], [[celery]], and [[bay leaf]]. [[Lima beans]] are sometimes used instead of white beans. Recipes vary considerably.

It is often enriched with [[olive oil]] either in the kitchen or on the table.

Unlike the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] ''fagiolata'', the [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian]] and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] ''[[feijoada]]'', [[Romanian cuisine|Romanian]] ''fasole'' and the [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] ''[[fabada]]'', fasolada does not contain meat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5415">'''Festival of the Dead''' or '''Feast of Ancestors'''&lt;ref Name="Smyth"/&gt; is held by many cultures throughout the world in honor or recognition of deceased members of the community, generally occurring after the harvest in August, September, October, or November. As an example, the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Wag Festival took place in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grajetzki|first1=Wolfram|last2=Quirke|first2=Stephen|title=Festivals in the ancient Egyptian calendar|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/ideology/festivaldates.html|website=Digital Egypt for Universities|publisher=University College London|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]]ese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] custom the festival honoring the departed (deceased) [[spirit]]s of one's [[ancestor]]s is known as the [[Bon Festival]] and is held in July or August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yanagita|title="When" is Obon?|url=http://www.bonodori.net/E/sekai/bonabc3.HTML|website=Spiritual dance in Midsummer Night|publisher=bonodori.net|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This annual festival begins with participants flocking towards the ocean with gifts, messages and lit lanterns for the deceased. All of these gifts are found in small boats which are then released into the water at midnight. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spann|first=Minnie|date=Summer 1906|title=The Bon or Festival of the Dead|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/136053023?accountid=14585|journal=Christian Observer|volume=94|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Hindus the ritual done for the dead ancestors is called [[Pitri Paksha]]. It is based on the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunar calendar]] and the period lasts for 15 days, falling towards the end of September. In [[Nepal]], the popular festival of [[Gai Jatra]] honors the deceased, and is observed in the month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]], the date of which corresponds to the first day of the month of [[Gunla]] in the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar.

The [[Roman Catholic]] church celebrates three days of [[Allhallowtide]] from 31 October to 1 November, marking [[All Saints' Eve]], [[All Saints' Day]] and the second of November as [[All Souls' Day]]. The Mexican holiday celebrated at Hallowtide is called Dia de Los Muertos or [[Day of the Dead]] - prior to the Spanish colonisation and the conversion of local people to Christianity, this festival was celebrated in the summer time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Frances Ann|title=Latina and Latino Voices in Literature|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures a single event, ''Festival of the Dead'', lasting up to 3 days, was held at the end of October and beginning of November; examples include the [[Peruvians]], the [[Pacific Islanders]], the people of the [[Tonga Islands]], the ancient [[Persia]]ns, ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and the northern nations of [[Europe]]. &lt;ref Name="Smyth"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Smyth  | first =Charles Piazzi   | authorlink =Charles Piazzi Smyth   | title =Life and Work at the Great Pyramid During the Months of January  | publisher =Edmonston and Douglas  | year =1867  | location =  | pages =Page 372  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=UYaVfDNsxTEC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=%22Festival+of+the+Dead%22&amp;as_brr=1#PPA372,M1  | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Inca religion]] the entire month of November is '[[Ayamarca]]', which translates to ''Festival of the Dead''. The Chinese and Buddhist festival is called [[Ghost Festival]].

In the 21st century, European traditions mark the celebrations of [[Halloween]].

It has been thought that the three day festival of the dead is a ritualistic remembrance of the [[Flood myth|deluge]] in which the first night, [[Halloween]] depicts the wickedness of the world before flood. The second night then celebrates the saved who survived the deluge and the last night celebrates those who would repopulate the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Olcott | first = William Tyler | authorlink = William Tyler Olcott | title = Star Lore of All Ages | publisher = The Knickerbocker Press | year = 1911 | pages = 413 | url = https://archive.org/details/starloreofallage00olco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''freshman''', '''first year''', or '''frosh''', is a person in the first year at an educational institution, usually a [[secondary school|secondary]] or [[post-secondary school]].

==Arab world==
In much of the [[Arab world]], a first-year is called a "Sanfoor" (Pl. Sanaafir), which is Arabic for [[The Smurfs|Smurf]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alghad.com/m/articles/574454-السنافر-يواجهون-مواقف-مضحكة-في-أول-سنة-جامعة&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
In Brazil, students that pass the [[vestibular]]es and begin studying in a college or university are called "calouros" or more informally "bixos" ("bixetes" for girls), an alternate spelling of "bicho", which means "animal". Calouros are often subject to [[hazing]], which is known as "trote" (lit. "prank") there. The first known hazing episode in Brazil happened 1831 at the Law School of [[Olinda]] and resulted in the death of a student.&lt;ref name=ME&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nadai|first1=Mariana|title=Quais foram os trotes mais cruéis do Brasil?|url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/os-trotes-maiscrueis-do-brasil|website=[[Mundo Estranho]]|publisher=[[Grupo Abril]]|accessdate=17 February 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a [[Chinese Brazilian]] calouro of the [[University of São Paulo]] Medicine School named Edison Tsung Chi Hsueh was found dead at the institution's swimming pool; this has since become one of the most well known episodes of violent hazing and has received extensive national media coverage since that year.&lt;ref name=ME/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toledo|first1=Roberto Pompeu de|title=Tolerância zero, o remédio para o trote|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/210499/p_154.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218163953/http://veja.abril.com.br/210499/p_154.html |archivedate=18 February 2009 |website=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|publisher=[[Grupo Abril]]|accessdate=17 February 2015|language=Portuguese|date=30 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calouro morre afogado em trote na USP|url=http://www.terra.com.br/noticias/infograficos/30-crimes-que-abalaram-o-brasil/30-crimes05.htm|website=[[Terra Networks|Terra]]|accessdate=17 February 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliveira|first1=Mariana|title=STF mantém absolvição de 4 pela morte de calouro da USP em 1999|url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2013/06/stf-mantem-absolvicao-de-4-pela-morte-de-calouro-da-usp-em-1999.html|website=G1|publisher=[[Grupo Globo]]|accessdate=17 February 2015|location=[[Brasília]]|language=Portuguese|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
In [[Scotland]], the first year of compulsory education is Primary 1 (P1). The first year of [[secondary school]] is known as ''S1'' but one can freely use ''first year''.

{{S-end}}

At the [[Universities in Scotland#Middle Ages|four ancient Scottish universities]] the traditional names for the four years at university are [[Bejan]] ("Bejant" at the [[University of St Andrews]])(1st),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bejan|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bejan|journal=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|volume= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semi (2nd), Tertian (3rd) and Magistrand (4th), though all Scottish universities will have a "freshers' week" (as with all British universities) and the term is as widely used with more traditional terms.

==United States==
Freshman is commonly in use as a [[US English]] [[idiom]]atic term to describe a beginner or novice, someone who is naive, a first effort, instance, or a student in the first year of study (generally referring to [[high school]] or university study).&lt;ref name="dict-fresh"&gt;{{cite web | author=Random House, Inc. | year=2006 | title=freshman | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/freshman | work=Dictionary.com | accessdate=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New members of Congress in their first term are referred to as ''freshmen senators'' or ''freshmen congressmen or congresswomen'', no matter how experienced they were in previous government positions.

High school first year students are almost exclusively referred to as freshmen, or in some cases by their grade year, [[9th grade]]rs. Second year students are sophomores, or [[10th grade]]rs, then juniors or [[11th grade]]rs, and finally seniors or [[12th grade]]rs.

At college or university, freshman denotes students in their first year of study. The grade designations of high school are not used, but the terms sophomore, junior, and senior are kept at most schools. Some colleges, including historically women's colleges, do not use the term freshman but use first year, instead.&lt;ref name="Huffpost College"&gt;{{cite web | author=Huffpost College | year=2012 | title= UNC Drops ‘Freshman’ From School Vocabulary In Favor Of ‘First-Year,’ Media Controversy Ensues | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/25/unc-freshman-first-year-sexist_n_2016645.html | accessdate=15 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCF"&gt;{{cite web | author=Student Admissions Representatives | year=2010 | title= Meet Our Student Representatives | url=http://www.ncf.edu/student-admission-representatives | work=New College of Florida | accessdate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the fourth year, students are simply classified as fifth year, sixth year, etc.  Some institutions use the term freshman for specific reporting purposes.&lt;ref name="wisc"&gt;{{cite web | author=Office of the Registrar | year=2006 | title=Glossary of Reporting Terms | url=http://registrar.wisc.edu/students/acadrecords/enrollment_reports/85_er_definitions.php | work=University of Wisconsin–Madison | accessdate=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4660">[[File:Gargee'an in Ahwaz 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Gargee'an celebration in [[Contemporary Arts Museum of Ahvaz]].]]
'''Gargee'an''' ({{lang-ar|قرقيعان}}), sometimes spelled as '''Gerga'oon''' (Arabic: قرقاعون), is a semiannual&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the holiday is only celebrated annually, during the month of Ramadan.&lt;/ref&gt; celebration, observed primarily in [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]), [[Iraq]], and the [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan region]] in [[Iran]]. It takes place on the 15th night of the [[Islamic month]] of [[Sha'ban]] and on the 15th night of [[Ramadan]]. Gargee'an is marked with children dressing in traditional attire and going door-to-door to receive [[sweets]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s from neighbours, whilst also singing traditional songs. The tradition has existed for hundreds of years and deeply rooted in [[Culture of Eastern Arabia|Gulf culture]].&lt;ref name=BNA&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون من أهم الاحتفالات الرمضانية الشعبية في مملكة البحرين|url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/519354|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=[[Bahrain News Agency]]|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the celebration of Gargee'an shares superficial similarities with the [[Halloween]] custom of [[trick-or-treating]], practiced in some western countries, Gargee'an has no connection with horror and no associated origin with Halloween.

== Etymology and Alternative Names ==
The exact origin of the word ''Qarqī'ān'' is unknown though several theories exist; One such theory states that it is derived from ''Qarqa'ah'' ({{lang-ar|قرقعة}}), which means ''click'' or ''snick'', the sound of iron pots carrying the sweets hitting each other while serving the sweets.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt; Another theory says that it could originate from the kids of [[Medina]] singing "Qarrat Al-'Ain, Qarrat Al-'Ain" ([[Arabic]]: قرة العين) which was changed with time to ''Qarqī'ān''.

The holiday is also known by several different names in each region: Majeena or Karkiaan in [[Iraq]], Garangao or Garangaou in [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]], Karkee'aan or Qariqaan in [[Saudi Arabia]], Gargee'aan in [[Kuwait]], Garangashoch, At-Tablah or Qarnakosh in [[Oman]], and Hag Al Leylah in [[the UAE]].

==Religious significance==
Both Gerga'oon nights are significant to both Sunni and [[Shia]] Muslims. Gerga'oon on the 15th of Sha'ban marks the birthday of Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the 12th [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="نسائية سار الرياضي" تقيم مهرجان القرقاعون الأول|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/2170/news/read/162488/1.html|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=Al Wasat|date=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerga'oon on the 15th of Ramadan coincides with the birth of Imam [[Hasan ibn Ali]], the second Imam in [[Shia Islam]]. As a result, the occasion is seen as a time of happiness and festivities by Shia Muslims, particularly in [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name=Wasat&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون: البحرين تحيي ليلة النصف من رمضان|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/75/news/read/122551/1.html|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Al Wasat|date=20 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events during the night include religious sermons conducted by [[mosque]]s, [[carnival]]-like attractions in much of the capital cities of the Persian Gulf region, such as in [[Manama]] and [[Doha]].&lt;ref name=Wasat/&gt;

==Tradition==
Children gather in small [[choir]] groups in front of a home and sing. The song is intended to call on [[Allah|God]] to bless the youngest child of the family, to keep him or her healthy that the mother will remain happy. The more they sing, the more nuts and sweets they receive. The Qarqee'an tradition is intended to spread love, happiness and affection among adults and children.

In modern times, supermarkets, corporates, and malls compete to attract children during this time via advertising in newspapers and on TV, and by offering special promotions and arranging closed Qarqee'an events to market themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="البحرين سيتي سنتر" يحتفل بليلة القرقاعون مساء اليوم|url=http://www.alayam.com/newsdetails.aspx?id=86247|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Al Ayam|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside individual works linked to traditional techniques, the members proposed different concepts and forms of artistic communication, ran a gallery and published the "anti-magazine" ''Gorgona''. In each issue they featured one artist's work such as [[Dieter Roth]] or [[Julije Knifer]]. Works by the Gorgona Group are widely represented in a number of institutions in Croatia including, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]], the [[Filip Trade Collection]] and the [[Marinko Sudac Collection]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">'''Gross Enrollment Ratio''' ('''GER''') or '''Gross Enrollment Index''' ('''GEI''') is a [[statistics|statistical measure]] used in the [[education]] sector, and formerly by the [[UN]] in its [[Education Index]], to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several different grade levels (like elementary, middle school and high school), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students who live in that country to those who qualify for the particular grade level. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), describes ‘Gross Enrolment Ratio’ as the total enrolment within a country ‘in a specific level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group corresponding to this level of education.’&lt;ref&gt;Official UN definition for GER&lt;/ref&gt;

The GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group. For instance, the GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their classmates. This allows the total enrollment to exceed the population that corresponds to that level of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114955-how-can-gross-school-enrollment-ratios-be-over-100|title=How can gross school enrollment ratios be over 100 percent? – World Bank Data Help Desk|website=datahelpdesk.worldbank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst  other measures used in the calculation, the CGER was given one-third weight in assessing the [[knowledge]] component, represented by gross enrolment, while the adult [[literacy]] rate was given two-thirds weight.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/Techinical_notes.pdf page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venus de Milo Louvre Ma399 n4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Venus de Milo]] on display at the [[Louvre]].]]

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of flower arrangement''' dates back to [[ancient Egyptian]] times.

== The Ancient Egyptians ==
The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt.  Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE.  They regularly placed cut flowers in [[vase]]s,&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210629/floral-decoration, Encyclopædia Britannica,  "Floral decoration," retrieved 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations.

Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance.  The [[lotus flower]] or [[Nelumbo|water lily]], for example, was considered sacred to [[Isis]] and was often included in arrangements.  Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and [[garlands]] of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060629-egypt-flowers.html, John Roach, National Geographic News, "Ancient Flowers Found in Egypt Coffin", 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included blue [[scilla]], poppy-flowered [[anemone]], ''[[Iris sibirica]]'', [[delphinium]], [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[palm tree]], [[papyrus]] and [[rose]].&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra’s time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flowermonthclub.com/flower-history|title=History of Flowers - Fresh Flower Facts {{!}} Flower of the Month Club|work=The Fresh Cut Flower of the Month Club|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Ancient Greeks and Romans ==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on [[garlands]] and [[wreaths]]. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used.

The most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were [[acorn]]s, [[oak]] leaves, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], [[ivy]], [[bay]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and [[parsley]]. [[Laurel wreath]]s were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient [[Olympics]]; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes.

The preferred flowers include roses, [[hyacinths]], [[honeysuckle]], [[Violet (plant)|violets]], and [[lilies]].  Other flowers such as [[tulips]], [[Consolida|larkspur]], and [[Tagetes|marigold]]s were also selected for their shape, color, and form.

Wealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers "rained" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it{{vague|date=February 2014}} was known as the "Hour of Rose". 

== Ancient China ==
The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the [[Han Dynasty|Han era of ancient China]].  Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine.

Practitioners of [[Buddhist|Buddhism]], [[Taoist|Taoism]], and [[Confucian]]ism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE.  They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers.  The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory.

Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants.  Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning.  For example, the [[bamboo]], the [[peach]] tree, and the [[pear]] tree symbolized [[longevity]].  The [[wikt:tiger lily|tiger lily]], the [[pomegranate]], and the [[orchid]] symbolized [[fertility]].  The most honored of all flowers was the [[peony]].  Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status.

During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the [[Byzantine Empire]] made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design.  The foliage was placed in [[chalice]]s and [[urn]]s, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit.  Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], lilies, [[cypress]], [[carnations]], and [[pine]].  Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.

== Flower arranging reaches Europe ==
Flower arranging arrived in [[Europe]] around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration.  As [[crusade]]rs came back from the [[Middle East]], they brought with them new and interesting plants.  As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them.

'''MIDDLE AGES (''AD 476–1400'')'''

During this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings.

An important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would “furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian” [12]. Because God “causes herbs to grow,” their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual [13]. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects.

'''RENAISSANCE(''AD 1400–1600'')'''

The flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies.

'''BAROQUE ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1775'')'''

At the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on.{{when|date=February 2014}}

'''DUTCH'''–'''FLEMISH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1750'')'''

The baroque arrangements in the Dutch-Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet.

'''FRENCH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1814'')'''

During the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers.

'''GEORGIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1714–1760'')'''

The designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called [[nosegays]] or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy.

'''VICTORIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1820–1901'')'''

Flowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours  made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including [[marble]], heavy [[Venetian glass]], and [[bronze]].

Flower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element&amp;nbsp;– the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, [[jasmine]], [[pansies]], French marigolds, [[cornflowers]], and [[rosemary]].

The '''horse head mask''' is a latex mask representing a [[horse]] head originally manufactured by novelty purveyor [[Archie McPhee]], and now widely available from other manufacturers. The mask covers the entire head and is typically part of a [[Halloween]] costume, or at other times to be funny, shocking, incongruous, or hip, or to disguise one's identity. It has also become an [[internet meme]].&lt;ref name=dewey&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/07/09/a-very-short-history-of-the-very-weird-horse-mask-meme/ |title=A very short history of the very weird horse mask meme |work=[[Washington Post]] |author=Caitlin Dewey |date=July 9, 2014 |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and meme history==
The horse mask was originally sold by novelty purveyor [[Archie McPhee]] as a Halloween costume since at least 2003.&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; It is marketed under the name "Horse Head Mask" and is made of "realistic brown latex with faux fur mane."&lt;ref name=mcphee&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcphee.com/shop/horse-head-mask.html |title=Horse Head Mask |publisher=[[Archie McPhee]] |author= |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPhee claims "a person wearing a Horse Head Mask looks downright disturbing" and the mask "has become a worldwide phenomenon".&lt;ref name=mcphee/&gt; Other manufacturers have since closely copied the look and design.

It is unclear when the mask transitioned from a novelty item to a meme, but there were a number of "accelerants" according to Caitlin Dewey of ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; In 2003, the Japanese anime ''[[Full Metal Panic?]]'' introduced the character Pony-man, "a horse-headed villain who pursued schoolgirls with a hairbrush".&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; Pony-man resembled someone wearing the McPhee horse mask and since the masks were already being sold "pony-man kept cropping up".&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; In 2005, [[Lonely Planet]] recommended wearing a horse mask while traveling in its ''Guide to Experimental Travel''.&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; Soon after, comedian/actor [[Tom Green]] wore a horse mask for an episode of his Internet talk show, ''Tom Green's House Tonight''.&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; In January 2008, a performance artist named Wotaken filmed himself picking, cooking, and eating [[psychedelic mushroom]]s while completely naked, wearing a horse head mask and dancing to the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' soundtrack "Dancing Mad".&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt; This film was uploaded to YouTube and reached over 2 million viewers and propelled the horse head to a wider audience. It has since been taken down for violating the site's terms of service.&lt;ref name=dewey/&gt;

The principle of '''individuation''', or '''''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}''''',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |pages=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[David Bohm]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manuel De Landa]].

==Usage==
The word ''individuation'' occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.

===In philosophy===
Philosophically, "individuation" expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that "is not something else". This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.

===In Jungian psychology===
In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], also called [[analytical psychology]], individuation is the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] – seen as a developmental [[Psyche (psychology)|psychic process]] during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], and the [[Experience (disambiguation)|experience]]s of the person's life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
{{See also|Analytical psychology#Self-realization and neuroticism}}

===In the media industry===
The media industry has begun using the term ''individuation'' to denote new printing and online technologies that permit [[mass customization]] of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the traditional [[mass-media]] practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.

Communications theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] alluded to this trend{{qn|date=June 2015}} when discussing{{when|date=June 2015}} the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUMoGmujREwC&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=2C5ZRF6d1W&amp;dq=mcluhan%20packaged%20information%20services&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false alluded to this trend], books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===In physics===
Two [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in [[quantum superposition]], e.g., as in [[Schrödinger's cat]] being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] says that [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot both be precisely known - in some sense, they are not individual variables. A ''natural criterion of individuality'' has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=Individuation in Quantum Mechanics|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=299–304|doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|bibcode=2011FoPh...41..299J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthur Schopenhauer==

For Schopenhauer the principium individuationis constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity. In his view, the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with each of the two states having its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. 

This view influenced [[Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ... Einstein regarded his separation principle, descended from Schopenhauer's ''principium individuationis'', as virtually an axiom for any future fundamental physics. ... Schopenhauer stressed the essential structuring role of space and time in individuating physical systems and their evolving states. This view implies that difference of location suffices to make two systems different in the sense that each has its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. For Schopenhauer, the mutual independence of spatially separated systems was a necessary a priori truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schrödinger]] put the Schopenhaurian label on a folder of papers in his files “Collection of Thoughts on the physical Principium individuationis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cosmos of Science: Essays of Exploration|last=John Earman, John D. Norton|first=|publisher=Univ of Pittsburgh Pr|year=1997|isbn=0822939304|location=|pages=131|quote=Schrödinger's biographer, Walter Moore, details the lifelong influence of Schopenhauer on Schrödinger ... or the Schopenhauerian label that Schrödinger put on one folder of papers in his files: "Sammlung der Gedanken über das physikalische Principium individuationis".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carl Jung==
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
According to [[Jungian psychology]], individuation ({{lang-de|Individuation}}) is a process of psychological integration. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G.  ''Psychological Types''.  Collected Works, vol. 6, par. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, [[active imagination]], or [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1962). ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia'' (vol. 2). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation has a [[Holistic health|holistic healing]] effect on the person, both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="jung1"/&gt;

In addition to [[Complex (psychology)|Jung's theory of complexes]], his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] filled with mythic images, a non-sexual [[libido]], the general types of [[extraversion and introversion]], the compensatory and prospective functions of [[dream]]s, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (Shamdasani, S). (2009). ''The Red Book'', p. 208, par. 3. Verona, Italy: Mondadori Printing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], the [[wise old man]] . . . and lastly [[Anima and animus|the anima in man and the animus]] in woman."&lt;ref&gt;Jung quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "There is often a movement from dealing with the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] at the start . . . to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] at the second stage, to the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the [[Self]] as the final stage. Some would interpose the [[Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman|Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman]] as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the [[Self]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John, ''Subpersonalities'' (London 1990) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilbert Simondon==
{{Main|Gilbert Simondon}}
In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation.

Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

==Bernard Stiegler==
{{Main|Bernard Stiegler}}
The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. During a talk given at the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:

*The ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s acknowledge each other’s existence.
*This inheritance is an adoption, in that I can very well, as the French grandson of a German immigrant, recognize myself in a past which was not the past of my ancestors but which I can make my own. This process of adoption is thus structurally factual.
*The ''I'' is essentially a process, not a state, and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation. It is the tendency to ''become one'', that is, to become indivisible.
*This tendency never accomplishes itself because it runs into a counter-tendency with which it forms a [[Metastability|metastable equilibrium]]. (It must be pointed out how closely this conception of the dynamic of individuation is to the Freudian [[Drive theory#Psychoanalysis|theory of drives]] and to the thinking of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Empedocles]].)
*The ''we'' is also such a process (the process of collective individuation). The individuation of the ''I'' is always inscribed in that of the ''we'', whereas the individuation of the ''we'' takes place only through the individuations, polemical in nature, of the ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s which constitute it.
*That which links the individuations of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is a pre-individual system possessing positive conditions of effectiveness that  belong to what Stiegler calls retentional apparatuses. These retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the ''I'' and the ''we'' — the individuation of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system.
*The technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects (this is what [[Gilbert Simondon]] calls the technical group).
*The technical system is also that which founds the possibility of the constitution of retentional apparatuses, springing from the processes of [[Grammar|grammatization]] growing out of the process of individuation of the technical system. And these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the ''I'' and the individuation of the ''we'' in a single process of psychic, collective, and technical individuation composed of three branches, each branching out into process groups.
*This process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as
**the vital individuation of natural organs,
**the technological individuation of artificial organs,
**and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together.
*In the process of individuation, wherein knowledge as such emerges, there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine, ''qua'' specific organizations of what Stiegler calls tertiary retentions, the organization, transmission, and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible.

'''Iranian architecture''' or '''Persian architecture''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:مهرازى ایرانی) is the architecture of [[Iran]] and parts of the rest of [[West Asia]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]]. Its history dates back to at least 5,000 BC with characteristic examples distributed over a vast area from [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]] to [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Zanzibar]]. Persian buildings vary from [[peasant]] [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to [[tea house]]s and [[Persian garden|garden]], [[pavilion]]s to "some of the most majestic structures the world has ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Introducing Persian Architecture''. [[Oxford University Press]]. London. 1971. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to historic gates, palaces, and mosques, the rapid growth of cities such as the capital, [[Tehran]] ([[Architecture of Tehran]]) has brought about a wave of demolition and new construction.

Iranian architecture displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic, from a variety of traditions and experience. Without sudden innovations, and despite the repeated trauma of invasions and cultural shocks, it has achieved "an individuality distinct from that of other Muslim countries".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. [[George Braziller]], [[New York City|New York]], 1965. p.266&lt;/ref&gt; Its paramount virtues are: "a marked feeling for form and scale; structural inventiveness, especially in [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[gonbad|dome]] construction; a genius for decoration with a freedom and success not rivaled in any other architecture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic [[symbol]]ism "by which man is brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader Ardalan]] and [[Laleh Bakhtiar]]. ''Sense of Unity; The Sufi Tradition in Persian Architecture''. 2000. {{ISBN|1-871031-78-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme has not only given unity and continuity to the architecture of Persia, but has been a primary source of its emotional character as well.

According to Persian historian and archaeologist [[Arthur Upham Pope|Arthur Pope]], the supreme Iranian art, in the proper meaning of the word, has always been its architecture. The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Pope]], ''Introducing Persian Architecture''. [[Oxford University Press]]. London. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental principles==
[[File:33pol esfahan.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Si-o-se Pol]], one of the bridges of [[Isfahan]].]]

Traditional Persian architecture has maintained a continuity that, although temporarily distracted by internal political conflicts or foreign invasion, nonetheless has achieved an unmistakable style.

In this architecture, "there are no trivial buildings; even garden pavilions have nobility and dignity, and the humblest [[caravanserai]]s generally have charm. In expressiveness and communicativity, most Persian buildings are lucid - even eloquent. The combination of intensity and simplicity of form provides immediacy, while ornament and, often, subtle proportions reward sustained observation."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization of styles===
[[File:Baghe Eram Shiraz.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Eram Garden|The Eram Garden]] in [[Shiraz]] is an 18th-century building and a legacy of the [[Zand Dynasty]].]]
[[File:Iranians_holding_Eid_al-Fitr_prayer_in_Imamzadeh_Saleh_shrine,_Tehran,_Iran_5.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Congregational prayer before the arched entrance to [[Imamzadeh Saleh, Shemiran|Imamzadeh Saleh Shrine]] interior, Tehran, 2017.]]
Overall, the traditional architecture of the Iranian lands throughout the ages can be categorized into the six following classes or styles ''("sabk")'':&lt;ref&gt;''Sabk Shenasi Mi'mari Irani'' (Study of styles in Iranian architecture), [[Karim Pirnia|M. Karim Pirnia]]. 2005. {{ISBN|964-96113-2-0}} p.24. Page 39 however considers "pre-Parsi" as a distinct style.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Zoroastrian''':
**'''The [[Parsian style]]''' (up until the third century BCE) including:
***[[Pre-Parsian style|Pre-Parsian]] style (up until the eighth century BCE) e.g. [[Chogha Zanbil]],
***[[Median Empire|Median]] style (from the eighth to the sixth century BCE),
***[[Achaemenid architecture|Achaemenid]] style (from the sixth to the fourth century BCE) manifesting in construction of spectacular cities used for governance and inhabitation (such as [[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Ecbatana]]), temples made for worship and social gatherings (such as [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] temples), and [[mausoleums]] erected in honor of fallen kings (such as the [[Tomb of Cyrus the Great]]),
**'''The [[Parthian style]]''' includes designs from the following eras:
***[[Seleucid]] era e.g. [[Anahita Temple]], [[Mahallat|Khorheh]],
***[[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era e.g. [[Hatra]], the royal compounds at [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nysa]],
***[[Sassanid]] era e.g. [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]], the [[Taq-i Kisra]], [[Bishapur]], [[Derbent|Darband]] (Derbent).
*'''Islamic''':
**'''The [[Khorasani style]]''' (from the late 7th until the end of the 10th century CE), e.g. [[Jameh Mosque of Nain]] and [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]],
**'''The [[Razi style]]''' (from the 11th century to the Mongol invasion period) which includes the methods and devices of the following periods:
***[[Samanid]] period, e.g. [[Samanid Mausoleum]],
***[[Ziyarid]] period, e.g. [[Gonbad-e Qabus (tower)|Gonbad-e Qabus]],
***[[Seljukid]] period, e.g. [[Kharraqan towers]],
**'''The [[Azari style]]''' (from the late 13th century to the appearance of the Safavid Dynasty in the 16th century), e.g. [[Soltaniyeh]], [[Arg e Tabriz|Arg-i Alishah]], [[Jameh Mosque of Varamin]], [[Goharshad Mosque]], [[Bibi Khanum mosque]] in [[Samarqand]], tomb of [[Abdas-Samad Esfahani|Abdas-Samad]], [[Gur-e Amir]], [[Jameh mosque of Yazd]]
**'''The [[Isfahani style]]''' spanning through the [[Safavid]], [[Afsharid]], [[Zand dynasty|Zand]], and [[Qajarid]] dynasties starting from the 16th century onward, e.g. [[Chehelsotoon]], [[Ālī Qāpū|Ali Qapu]], [[Agha Bozorg Mosque, Kashan]], [[Shah Mosque]], [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque]] in [[Naqsh-i Jahan Square]].

===Materials===
Available building materials dictate major forms in traditional Iranian architecture. Heavy [[clay]]s, readily available at various places throughout the plateau, have encouraged the development of the most primitive of all building techniques, molded [[mud]], compressed as solidly as possible, and allowed to dry. This technique, used in Iran from ancient times, has never been completely abandoned. The abundance of heavy plastic earth, in conjunction with a tenacious lime [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], also facilitated the development and use of [[brick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Upham Pope]]. ''Persian Architecture''. George Braziller, New York, 1965. p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
Iranian architecture makes use of abundant symbolic geometry, using pure forms such as circles and squares, and plans are based on often symmetrical layouts featuring rectangular courtyards and halls.

===Design===
Certain design elements of Persian architecture have persisted throughout the [[history of Iran]]. The most striking are a marked feeling for [[Measurement|scale]] and a discerning use of simple and massive forms. The consistency of decorative preferences, the high-arched [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] set within a [[Alcove (architecture)|recess]], [[column]]s with bracket capitals, and recurrent types of plan and elevation can also be mentioned. Through the ages these elements have recurred in completely different types of buildings, constructed for various programs and under the patronage of [[List of kings of Persia|a long succession of rulers]].

[[File:Perspolis.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Persian-style column, as seen in Persepolis.]]
The columned [[porch]], or ''[[talar]]'', seen in the rock-cut tombs near [[Persepolis]], reappear in [[Sassanid]] temples, and in late Islamic times it was used as the portico of a palace or mosque, and adapted even to the architecture of roadside tea-houses. Similarly, the [[dome]] on four arches, so characteristic of Sassanid times, is a still to be found in many cemeteries and [[Imamzadeh]]s across [[Iran]] today. The notion of earthly towers reaching up toward the sky to mingle with the divine towers of heaven lasted into the 19th century, while the interior court and pool, the angled entrance and extensive decoration are ancient, but still common, features of Iranian architecture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3000 to 4000 years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-[[Islam]]ic architecture of [[Iran]] in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved [[stucco]], patterned brickwork, floral [[motif (art)|motifs]], and [[calligraphy]].

Iran is recognized by [[UNESCO]] as being one of the [[cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928124326/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that, over the ages, spread far and wide far to other cultures. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.

The [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with [[Susa]] and [[Persepolis]] expressed the authority of ''The King of Kings'', the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.

With the emergence of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s new forms appeared. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the [[Sassanid]] period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.

For example, the roundness of the city of [[Round City of Baghdad|Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid]] era, points to its Persian precedents, such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam Art and Architecture |first=Markus |last=Hattstein |first2=Peter |last2=Delius |year=2000 |page=96 |isbn=3-8290-2558-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Mansur]] hired two designers to plan the city's design: [[Naubakht]], a former [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]] who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city should be astrologically significant, and [[Mashallah ibn Athari]], a former Jew from [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islamic Science and Engineering |first=Donald R. |last=Hill |year=1994 |page=10 |isbn=0-7486-0457-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of [[Persepolis]], [[Ctesiphon]], [[Sialk]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Firouzabad]], and [[Arg-é Bam]] give us a distant glimpse of what contributions Persians made to the art of building. The imposing Sassanid castle built at [[Derbent]], [[Dagestan]] (now a part of Russia) is one of the most extant and living examples of splendid Sassanid Iranian architecture. Since 2003, the Sassanid castle has been listed on Russia's UNESCO World Heritage list.

==Islamic architecture of Persia==
[[File:Teemcheh.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Timcheh-e-Aminoddowleh]]'', Bazaar of [[Kashan]].]]
The fall of the [[Sassanian]] dynasty to the invading Muslim [[Arabs]] led to the adaptation of Persian architectural forms for Islamic religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as calligraphy, stucco work, mirror work and mosaics became closely tied with the architecture of mosques in Persia ''(Iran)''. An example is the round-domed rooftops which originate in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] ''(Ashkanid)'' dynasty of Iran.

Archaeological excavations have provided extensive evidence supporting the impact of Sassanid architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world at large. 

Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th centuries CE to be the pinnacle of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, [[bazaar]]s, bridges and palaces have survived from this period.

[[Safavid]] [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]] is the sixth [[List of city squares by size|largest square]] worldwide), by constructing tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was less compared to those of the 14th and 15th centuries.

Another aspect of this architecture was the harmony with the people, their environment, and the beliefs that it represented. At the same time no strict rules were applied to govern this form of Islamic architecture.

The great mosques of [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Tabriz]] each used local geometry, local materials and local building methods to express, each in their own way, the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. When the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament and great depths of symbolic meaning.

In the words of [[Arthur Pope|Arthur U. Pope]], who carried out extensive studies in ancient Persian and Islamic buildings:

:''"The meaningful Impact of Persian architecture is versatile. Not overwhelming but dignified, magnificent and impressive."''

However, Pope's approach toward Qajar art and architecture is quite negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan Pour|title=The Theoretical Inapplicability of Regionalism to Analysing Architectural Aspects of Islamic Shrines in Iran in the Last Two Centuries|journal=The Collection of articles of the International Congress of Imam's Descendants (Imamzadegan)|year=2013|volume=4|pages=16–32|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/18145|trans-title=کاربست ناپذیری نظری رجینالیسم در تحلیل معماری اسلامی ایران در دو قرن گذشته|publisher=The Charity Organisation|location=Esfahan, Iran|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian domes==
{{main|History of Persian domes}}
{{see also|Gonbad}}
[[File:Ardeshir.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ancient [[Palace of Ardashir]], constructed in 224 during the [[Sassanid Dynasty]]. The building has three large domes, among the oldest examples of such large-scale domes in the World.]]
The [[Sassanid Empire]] initiated the construction of the first large-scale domes in [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), with such royal buildings as the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar|Dezh Dokhtar]]. After the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid Empire, the Persian architectural style became a major influence on Islamic societies and the dome also became a feature of [[Islamic architecture|Muslim architecture]] (see ''[[gonbad]]'').

The [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khanate period]] provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Il-Khanate architecture was reached with the construction of the [[Soltaniyeh|Soltaniyeh Dome]] (1302–1312) in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], Iran, which measures 50 m in height and 25 m in diameter, making it [[List of largest domes in the world#Masonry|the 3rd largest]] and the tallest masonry dome ever erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranreview.org/content/view/2280/51/ ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/domes |title=Encyclopædia Iranica &amp;#124; Articles |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1995-12-15 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the [[Safavid dynasty]], when [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], in 1598, initiated the reconstruction of [[Isfahan]], with the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] as the centerpiece of his new capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Savory |first=Roger |title=Iran under the Safavids |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=155 |year=1980 |isbn=0-521-22483-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally they borrowed heavily from Il-Khanate designs, but artistically they elevated the designs to a new level. 

The distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the use of colourful tiles, with which the exterior of domes are covered much like the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan and the distinct blue shape would dominate the skyline of the city. Reflecting the light of the sun, these domes appeared like glittering [[turquoise|turquoise gem]]s and could be seen from miles away by travelers following the [[Silk road]] through Persia.

This very distinct style of architecture was inherited from the [[Seljuq dynasty]], who for centuries had used it in their mosque building, but it was perfected during the Safavids when they invented the ''haft- rangi'', or seven colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Stephen P. |title=Half the World, The Social Architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590–1722 |location=Costa Mesa |publisher=Mazda |pages=143–144 |isbn=1-56859-087-3 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The colours that the Persians favoured were gold, white and turquoise patterns on a dark-blue background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Canby |first=Sheila R. |title=Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran |location=London |publisher=British Museum Press |page=30 |isbn=978-0-7141-2456-8 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by [[Reza Abbasi|Ali Reza Abbasi]], who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah's court in 1598,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Canby |first=Sheila R. |title=Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran |page=36 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Shaykh Bahai]] oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of Masjed-e Shah (Shah Mosque) would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double-shelled dome, spanning 14 m between the two layers and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hattstein |first=M. |last2=Delius |first2=P. |title=Islam, Art and Architecture |location=Cologne |publisher=Köneman |isbn=3-8290-2558-0 |year=2000 |pages=513–514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Iranian architecture in and outside Iran==

Contemporary architecture in Iran begins with the advent of the first Pahlavi period in the early 1920s. Some designers, such as [[Andre Godard]], created works such as the [[National Museum of Iran]] that were reminiscent of Iran's historical architectural heritage. Others made an effort to merge the traditional elements with modern designs in their works. The [[Tehran University]] main campus is one such example. Others, such as [[Heydar Ghiai]] and [[Houshang Seyhoun]], have tried to create completely original works, independent of prior influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ubc.ca/parsia/files/2008/12/dpc14421.pdf Trends in Modern Iranian Architecture.] By Darab DIBA and Mozayan DEHBASHI.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Dariush Borbor]]'s architecture successfully combined modern architecture with local vernacular&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_X0UAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=borbor |title=Architecture: formes + fonctions |website==Books.google.com |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Michel Ragon, ''Histoire Mondiale de l'Architecture et de l'Urbanisme Modernes'', vol. 2, Casterman, Paris, 1972, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Future architecture in Iran==
[[File:اصفهان سیتی سنتر.JPG|thumb|[[Isfahan City Center]] concept]]
[[File:IsfahanCityCenter outside night.JPG|thumb|[[Isfahan City Center]] at night]]
Major construction projects are underway all around Iran. Iran is developing [[Isfahan City Center]], which is the largest mall in Iran and the largest mall with a museum in the world. It includes a hotel, indoor amusement park, and food court, among other amenities. The [[Flower of the East]] Development Project is another grand project on [[Kish Island]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The project, includes one '7-star' and two '5-star' hotels, three residential areas, villas and apartment complexes, coffee shops, luxury showrooms and stores, sports facilities and a marina.

:''See main articles: [[List of historical Iranian architects]] and [[List of Iranian architects]]''

Persian architects were highly sought in the old days, before the advent of [[Modern Architecture]]. For example, Badreddin Tabrizi built the tomb of [[Rumi]] in [[Konya]] in 1273 AD, while Ostad Isa Shirazi is most often credited as the chief architect (or plan drawer) of the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/taj_mahal/tlevel_2/t3build_design.html See PBS article]&lt;/ref&gt; These artisans were also highly instrumental in the designs of such edifices as [[Baku]], Afghanistan's Minaret of Jam, The [[Soltaniyeh|Sultaniyeh Dome]], or [[Tamerlane]]'s tomb in [[Samarkand]], among many others.

==UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites==

He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the [[University of Toronto]] in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.

== Life and career ==
Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, to Elsie Naomi ([[married and maiden names|née]] Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. "Marshall" was his maternal grandmother's surname. His mother was a [[Baptist]] school teacher who later became an actress; his father was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when [[World War I]] broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian army]]. After a year of service, he contracted [[influenza]] and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending [[Kelvin High School|Kelvin Technical School]] before enrolling in the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to "gratify his soul's hunger for truth and beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edan, Tina (2003). [http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/1977/1/MQ77929.pdf "St Marshall, Mass and the Media: Catholicism, Media Theory and Marshall McLuhan"], p. 10. Retrieved 2010-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; later referring to this stage as [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edan (2003), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying for one year as an engineering student, he changed majors and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1933), winning a University Gold Medal in Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1997), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; He took an [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1934) in [[English studies|English]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1934. He had long desired to pursue graduate studies in [[England]] and was accepted to the [[University of Cambridge]], having failed to secure a [[Rhodes scholarship]] to [[Oxford University|Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

He had already earned a BA and an MA degree at Manitoba, but Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate "affiliated" student, with one year's credit towards a three-year bachelor's degree, before entering any doctoral studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 40; McLuhan later commented  "One advantage we Westerners have is that we're under no illusion we've had an education. That's why I started at the bottom again." Marchand (1990), p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in the autumn of 1934, where he studied under [[I. A. Richards]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] and was influenced by [[New Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reflection years afterward, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the ''training of perception'' and such concepts as Richards' notion of ''[[I. A. Richards#Feedforward|feedforward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies formed an important precursor to his later ideas on technological forms.&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; He received the required bachelor's degree from Cambridge in 1936&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94"&gt;Gordon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered their graduate program. Later, he returned from England to take a job as a teaching assistant at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] that he held for the 1936–37 academic year, being unable to find a suitable job in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a lifelong interest in the number three&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the trivium, the [[Trinity]]) and sometimes said that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] provided intellectual guidance for him.&lt;ref&gt;Associates speculated about his intellectual connection to the Virgin Mary, one saying, "He had a direct connection with the Blessed Virgin Mary.... He alluded to it very briefly once, almost fearfully, in a please-don't-laugh-at-me tone. He didn't say, 'I know this because the Blessed Virgin Mary told me,' but it was clear from what he said that one of the reasons he was so sure about certain things was that the Virgin had certified his understanding of them." (cited in Marchand, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at [[Saint Louis University]] (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on [[Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and tutored and befriended [[Walter J. Ong]], who went on to write his PhD dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940)&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94" /&gt; and began to work on his doctoral dissertation on [[Thomas Nashe]] and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, [[World War II|war]] had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  He next taught at [[Assumption University (Windsor)|Assumption College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] from 1944 to 1946, then moved to [[Toronto]] in 1946 where he joined the faculty of [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], a Catholic college of the [[University of Toronto]]. [[Hugh Kenner]] was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar [[Harold Innis]] was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.  McLuhan wrote in 1964: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of [[writing]] then of [[printing]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall.

This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology|Centre for Culture and Technology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  He published his first major work during this period: ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man|The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951). The work was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] also produced an important journal called ''Explorations'' throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Prins and Bishop 2002&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the [[Toronto School of communication theory]], together with [[Harold Innis]], [[Eric A. Havelock]], and [[Northrop Frye]]. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]] on the subject of [[Wyndham Lewis]]. He remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

McLuhan was named to the [[Albert Schweitzer]] Chair in Humanities at [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx for one year (1967–68).&lt;ref&gt;During the time at Fordham University, his son [[Eric McLuhan]] conducted what came to be known as the [[Fordham Experiment]] about the different effects of "light-on" versus "light-through" media.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, and it was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in [[Wychwood Park]], a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where [[Anatol Rapoport]] was his neighbour.  In 1970, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[University of Dallas]] hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan (n.d.).

Marshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, IBM and AT&amp;T among them.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-winning motion picture ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself; a pompous academic arguing with Allen in a cinema queue is silenced by McLuhan suddenly appearing and saying, "You know nothing of my work."

In September 1979, he suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research centre shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests, most notably by Woody Allen. He never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980.&lt;ref name=nytimesobituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitman|first=Alden|title=Marshall McLuhan, Author, Dies; Declared 'Medium Is the Message'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/home/mcluhan-obit.html|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major works ==
During his years at [[Saint Louis University]] (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral [[doctoral thesis|dissertation]] and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as the book ''The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man'', which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.

McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts ([[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]—collectively known as the [[trivium]]) from the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's doctoral dissertation from 1942 was published by [[Gingko Press]] in March 2006. Gingko Press also plans to publish the complete manuscript of items and essays that McLuhan prepared, only a selection of which were published in his book. With the publication of these two books a more complete picture of McLuhan's arguments and aims is likely to emerge.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the ''trivium'' to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the [[Late Middle Ages]], for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the [[Renaissance]] was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the [[New Criticism]] of Richards and Leavis.&lt;ref&gt;For a nuanced account of McLuhan's thought regarding Richards and Leavis, see McLuhan's "Poetic and Rhetorical Exegesis: The Case for Leavis against Richards and Empson" in the ''Sewanee Review'', volume 52, number 2 (1944): 266–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mechanical Bride'', McLuhan turned his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary [[popular culture]]. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of [[mass media|communication media]] independent of their content. His famous [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'') calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "the medium is the message" may be better understood in light of [[Bernard Lonergan]]'s further articulation of related ideas: at the empirical level of [[consciousness]], the medium is the message, whereas at the intelligent and rational levels of consciousness, the content is the message. This sentence uses Lonergan's terminology from ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' to clarify the meaning of McLuhan's statement that "the medium is the message"; McLuhan read this when it was first published in 1957 and found "much sense" in it—in his letter of September 21, 1957, to his former student and friend, Walter J. Ong, S.J., McLuhan says, "Find much sense in Bern. Lonergan's ''Insight''" (''Letters of Marshall McLuhan'', 1987: 251). Lonergan's ''Insight'' is an extended guide to "making the inward turn": attending ever more carefully to one's own consciousness, reflecting on it ever more carefully, and monitoring one's articulations ever more carefully.  When McLuhan declares that he is more interested in [[percept]]s than [[concept]]s, he is declaring in effect that he is more interested in what Lonergan refers to as the empirical level of consciousness than in what Lonergan refers to as the intelligent level of consciousness in which concepts are formed, which Lonergan distinguishes from the rational level of consciousness in which the adequacy of concepts and of predications is adjudicated. This inward turn to attending to percepts and to the cultural conditioning of the empirical level of consciousness through the effect of communication media sets him apart from more outward-oriented studies of sociological influences and the outward presentation of self carried out by [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]], [[Kenneth Burke]], Hugh Duncan, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan also started the journal ''Explorations'' with anthropologist [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund "Ted" Carpenter]]. In a letter to [[Walter Ong]] dated May 31, 1953, McLuhan reported that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Plummer | first=Kevin | date=May 3, 2014 | title=Historicist: ''Explorations'' at the Vanguard of Communications Studies |  work=[[Torontoist]] | url=http://torontoist.com/2014/05/historicist-explorations-at-the-vanguard-of-communications-studies/ | access-date=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Fordham lecture in 1999, [[Tom Wolfe]] suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the "[[noosphere]]".&lt;ref name="TWolfe"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBPmRPa7ls | title = Tom Wolfe on Media, Advertising, Technology (1999) | accessdate = 23 April 2017 | last = Wolfe | first = Tom | date = December 2015 | publisher = C-SPAN | quote = 45m}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his second published book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): "This externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence."

In his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: "I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies." Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: "The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word ‘evolution’ .... That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community."&lt;ref name="AChrystall"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/778 | title = The New American Vortex (2007)| accessdate = 24 Jun 2018 | last = Chrystall | first = Andrew | date = December 2007 | publisher = Massey University | quote = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mechanical Bride'' (1951) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
McLuhan's first book, ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man]]'' (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as [[popular culture]]. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book ''Culture and Environment'' by [[F. R. Leavis]] and Denys Thompson, and the title ''The Mechanical Bride'' is derived from a piece by the [[Dada]]ist artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]].

Like his 1962 book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', ''The Mechanical Bride'' is composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order—what he styled the "mosaic approach" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.

=== ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962) ===
McLuhan's ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy|The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man]]'' (written in 1961, first published in Canada by [[University of Toronto Press]] in 1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of [[orality|oral culture]], [[print culture]], [[cultural studies]], and [[media ecology]].

Throughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how [[communication technology]] ([[alphabet]]ic writing, the [[printing press]], and the [[electronic media]]) affects [[cognitive]] organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' 1962, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Movable type ====
His episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Global Village ====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] replaces [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm |publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) |title=The source of the term 'global village' |author=Eric McLuhan |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book". If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies".&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented almost thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as  its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Getto |first=Erica |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/jul/15/celebrating-marshall-mcluhans-legacy/ |title=The Medium is the Massage: Celebrating Marshall McLuhan's Legacy |publisher=WNYC.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Levinson | url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 |first=Paul|last=Levinson |title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-19251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Understanding Media'' (1964) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Medeasfhsdl.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Book cover ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' by Marshall McLuhan, 1964. It is the source of the phrase [[The medium is the message]].]] --&gt;

McLuhan's most widely known work, ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964), is a pioneering study in media theory. Dismayed by the way people approached and used new media such as television, McLuhan famously argued that in the modern world "we live mythically and integrally ... but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan proposed that [[Mass media|media]] themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as "the medium is the message". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the [[light bulb]] as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

==== {{anchor|Hot and cool media}}"Hot" and "cool" media ====
In the first part of ''Understanding Media,'' McLuhan also stated that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, like the movies, were "hot"—that is, they enhance one single [[sense]], in this case [[Visual perception|vision]], in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with "cool" TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of the viewer to determine meaning, and [[comics]], which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be "hot", intensifying one single sense "high definition", demanding a viewer's attention, and a comic book to be "cool" and "low definition", requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include [[radio]], as well as [[film]], the [[lecture]], and [[photography]].

Cool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include [[television]], as well as the [[seminar]] and [[cartoons]]. McLuhan describes the term "cool media" as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean "detached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-342-1818/people/mcluhan/clip4 |title=CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cool medium incorporates increased involvement but decreased description while hot medium is the opposite, decreased involvement and increased description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in the streaming of content but not considering the effects of the tool is not allowing an "extension of ourselves." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Playboy Interview|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|date=March 1969|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept appears to force media into binary categories. However, McLuhan's hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

==== Critiques of ''Understanding Media'' ====
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan’s definition and treatment of the word "medium" for being too simplistic.  [[Umberto Eco]], for instance, contends that McLuhan’s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.&lt;ref name="Debray"&gt;{{cite web|last=Debray|first=Regis|title=Media Manifestos|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Debray-MediaManifestos1.pdf|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Media Manifestos'', [[Régis Debray]] also takes issue with McLuhan’s envisioning of the medium.  Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary "public" for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious "mana"; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a homo mass-mediaticus without ties to historical and social context, and so on.&lt;ref name="Debray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, when ''Wired'' interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan "more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst ...  McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joscelyne|first=Andrew|title=Debray on Technology|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdebray1.htm|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Macdonald]], in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his "aphoristic" style of prose, which he believes left ''Understanding Media'' filled with "contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness." &lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullen|first=Megan|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw: Marshall McLuhan’s Understanding Media|url=http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105045526/http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|archivedate=5 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Brian Winston]]’s ''Misunderstanding Media'', published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his [[technological determinism|technologically deterministic]] stances.&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]] and [[James W. Carey]] further this point of contention, claiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory [...] It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism [...] If the medium – whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Carr states that there has been a long line of "academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem," whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Marshall McLuhan: Media Savant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Carr-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 November 2011|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan’s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as "probes" or "mosaics" offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grossweiler, ''The Method is the Message: Rethinking McLuhan through Critical Theory'' (Montreal: Black Rose, 1998), 155-81&lt;/ref&gt; and suitability for virtual space.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levinson, ''Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium'' (New York: Routledge,1999), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Medium Is the Massage:&lt;!-- "MASSAGE" IS CORRECT, EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: "The Medium is the MASSAGE" is the correct title. Please DO NOT change "Massage" to "Message" here --&gt; An Inventory of Effects'' (1967) ===
''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'', published in 1967, was McLuhan's best seller,&lt;ref name="wired saint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/saint.marshal.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= |title=The Wisdom of Saint Marshall, the Holy Fool |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated by [[Quentin Fiore]],&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  McLuhan adopted the term "massage" to denote the effect each medium has on the human [[sensorium]], taking inventory of the "effects" of numerous media in terms of how they "massage" the sensorium.&lt;ref&gt;According to McLuhan biographer W. Terrence Gordon, "by the time it appeared in 1967, McLuhan no doubt recognized that his original saying had become a cliché and welcomed the opportunity to throw it back on the compost heap of language to recycle and revitalize it.  But the new title is more than McLuhan indulging his insatiable taste for puns, more than a clever fusion of self-mockery and self-rescue—the subtitle is 'An Inventory of Effects,' underscoring the lesson compressed into the original saying." (Gordon, p. 175.)

However, the FAQ section on the website maintained by McLuhan's estate says that this interpretation is incomplete and makes its own leap of logic as to why McLuhan left it as is. "Why is the title of the book ''The Medium Is the Massage'' and not ''The Medium is the Message''? Actually, the title was a mistake. When the book came back from the typesetter's, it had on the cover 'Massage' as it still does. The title was supposed to have read ''The Medium is the Message'' but the typesetter had made an error. When McLuhan saw the typo he exclaimed, 'Leave it alone! It's great, and right on target!' Now there are possible four readings for the last word of the title, all of them accurate: ''Message'' and ''Mess Age'', ''Massage'' and ''Mass Age''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page.  The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from "reading" typographic print to "scanning" photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan's overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different "massage" or "effect" on the human sensorium.

In ''The Medium Is the Massage'',&lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt; McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''—that all media are "extensions" of our human senses, bodies and minds.

Finally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. "The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] by typography, while "[t]he technique of the [[suspension of judgement|suspended judgment]] is the discovery of the twentieth century", brought on by the [[bard]] abilities of radio, movies and television.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a [[rear-view mirror]]. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in [[Bonanza]]-land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medium is the Massage'', pp 74,5&lt;/ref&gt;

An audio recording version of McLuhan's famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan ''interrupted'' by other speakers, including people speaking in various [[phonation]]s and [[falsetto]]s, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media.  McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording "the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I wouldn't be seen dead with a living work of art."—'Old man' speaking
:"Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey."—'Middle aged man' speaking

=== ''War and Peace in the Global Village'' (1968) ===
McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves [[portmanteau]]s of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

=== ''From Cliché to Archetype'' (1970) ===
In his 1970 book, ''From Cliché to Archetype'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] [[Wilfred Watson]],&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wilfred-watson/ |title=Watson, Wilfred |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202212727/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008487 |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached the various implications of the verbal [[cliché]] and of the [[archetype]].  One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the ''global theater''.

In McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a "normal" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are "anesthetized" to its effects.

An example of this given by McLuhan is [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s play ''[[The Bald Soprano]]'', whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an [[Assimil]] language book. "Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan's ''archetype'' "is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment." "Environment" would also include the kinds of "awareness" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context [[Carl Jung]] described.

McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the cliché and the archetype, or a "doubleness":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another theme of the Wake [''[[Finnegans Wake]]''] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is 'past time are pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of [[hendiadys]] dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the [[Theatre of the Absurd|Theater of the Absurd]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "languages of the heart", or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.

The satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which "ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term ''global theater''. It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.

=== ''The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century'' (1989) ===
In his 1989 posthumous book, ''The Global Village'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Bruce R. Powers]], provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the [[Shannon–Weaver model]]. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow"&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.

Reading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain is the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. "Comprehensive awareness" results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is too rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory.

McLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novels of [[Philip K. Dick]]. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'', an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: "Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.

==== Beyond existing communication models ====
"All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle's notion of efficient causality.

A third term of ''The Global Village'' that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's Laws of the Media, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrad an analogical, simultaneous four-fold pattern of transformation. "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." &lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.

== Key concepts ==

=== Tetrad of media effects ===
{{Main|Tetrad of media effects}}

In ''Laws of Media'' (1988), published posthumously by his son [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], McLuhan summarized his ideas about [[media studies|media]] in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:

*What does the medium enhance?
*What does the medium make obsolete?
*What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?
*What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?

The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and syntax" of the "language" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor [[Harold Innis]] in suggesting that a medium "overheats", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Visually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the ''Enhancement'' and ''Retrieval'' qualities of the medium, both ''Figure'' qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the ''Obsolescence'' and ''Reversal'' qualities, both ''Ground'' qualities.&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLuhan |first=Eric |title=Electric language: understanding the present |publisher=Stoddart |year=1998 |isbn=0-7737-5972-7}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|right|thumb|250px|A blank tetrad diagram]]

Using the example of radio:

* Enhancement (figure): What the medium amplifies or intensifies. ''Radio amplifies news and music via sound.''
* Obsolescence (ground): What the medium drives out of prominence. ''Radio reduces the importance of print and the visual.''
* Retrieval (figure): What the medium recovers which was previously lost. ''Radio returns the spoken word to the forefront.''
* Reversal (ground): What the medium does when pushed to its limits. ''Acoustic radio flips into audio-visual TV.''

=== Figure and ground ===
{{Main|Figure and ground (media)}}

McLuhan adapted the [[Gestalt psychology]] idea of a ''figure and a ground'', which underpins the meaning of "The medium is the message".&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium  or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

All technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Marshall McLuhan Way Toronto.jpg|thumb|A portion of Toronto's St. Joseph Street is co-named Marshall McLuhan Way]]
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher in the twentieth century and arguably the most controversial.{{According to whom|date=January 2013}} This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, [[Howard Gossage]] and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of "genius scouting."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marchand, pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (1994). ''Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign''. NY: Vintage Books, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', any time he needed it.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a "McLuhan festival" in the offices of Gossage's advertising agency in San Francisco. During this "festival", McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor's office, and editors from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of [[Tom Wolfe]], who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, "What If He Is Right?", published in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' and Wolfe's own ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''. According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan's eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only "probably speeded up the recognition of [McLuhan's] genius by about six months."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. ''Newsweek'' magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in ''Life Magazine'', ''Harper's'', ''Fortune'', ''Esquire'', and others. Cartoons about him appeared in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;  In 1969, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published a lengthy interview with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playboy Interview: Marshall McLuhan |date=March 1969 |work=Playboy |pages=26–27, 45, 55–56, 61, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', the "poet" [[Henry Gibson]] would randomly say, "Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin'?"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan was credited with coining the phrase ''[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]'' by its popularizer, [[Timothy Leary]], in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with [[Neil Strauss]], Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'"&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Neil. ''Everybody Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 337–38&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced [[cultural criticism|cultural critics]], thinkers, and media theorists such as [[Neil Postman]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[William Irwin Thompson]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Hugh Kenner]], and [[John David Ebert]], as well as political leaders such as [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-69-342-1826/life_society/mcluhan/clip8 |title=It's cool not to shave – Marshall McLuhan, the Man and his Message – CBC Archives |accessdate=2007-07-02 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Jerry Brown]]. [[Andy Warhol]] was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous "[[15 minutes of fame]]" quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in [[Angola]], he suggested a massive spread of TV devices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]], interview at [[RAI Radio1]] show ''[http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm Stereonotte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629015942/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm |date=2007-06-29 }}'', July 01 2007 2:00 am. Quote: "McLuhan era uno che al premier canadese che si interrogava su un modo per sedare dei disordini in Angola, McLuhan disse, negli anni 70, 'riempite la nazione di apparecchi televisivi'; ed è quello che venne fatto; e la rivoluzione in Angola cessò." {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character "Brian O'Blivion" in [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1983 film [[Videodrome]] is a "media oracle" based on McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, Elena. ''Marshall McLuhan's Mosaic: Probing the Literary Origins of Media Studies.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, McLuhan was named as the "patron saint" of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired Magazine'']] and a quote of his appeared on the masthead{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} for the first ten years of its publication.&lt;ref name="wired channel" /&gt; He is mentioned by name in a [[Peter Gabriel]]-penned lyric in the song "Broadway Melody of 1974".  This song appears on the [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', from [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].  The lyric is:  "Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand."  McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' entitled "[[House Arrest (The Sopranos episode)|House Arrest]]". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a ''Wired'' mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for ''Wired'' that "if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective."&lt;ref name="wired channel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/channeling.html |title=Channeling McLuhan |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new centre known as the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology]], formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Since 1994, it has been part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] and in 2008 the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology incorporated in the Coach House Institute. The first director was literacy scholar and [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education|OISE]] Professor David R. Olsen. From 1983 until 2008, the McLuhan Program was under the direction of Dr. [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] who was McLuhan's student and translator. From 2008 through 2015 Professor Dominique Scheffel-Dunand of [[York University]] served Director of the Program.
In 2011 at the time of his centenary the Coach House Institute established a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship program in his honor, and each year appoints up to four fellows for a maximum of two years. In May 2016 the Coach House Institute was renamed the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology; its Interim Director was [[Seamus Ross]] (2015–16). Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five-year term as director of the Coach House (2017- ). Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media. Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202736/http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/#|archive-date=2017-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Toronto, [[Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School]] is named after him.

The '''Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program''' is a program to help younger community members learn their language of heritage with fluent elders in the community, typically in the form of a summer program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The program was developed by Leanne Hinton, working with the Native California Network and its subsidiary committee, the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival. The program was developed in collaboration with the speakers of six indigenous California languages: Karuk, Hupa, Yurok, Wintu, Yowlumne, and Mojave.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1997-01-01|title=Survival of Endangered Languages: The California Master-Apprentice Program|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/ijsl.1997.123.177|journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|doi=10.1515/ijsl.1997.123.177|issn=1613-3668}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MALLP ran for the first time in the summer of 1993, and has grown each year since its inception.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1996, only three years after it began, the program funded 26 teams, covering the original six languages, as well as Patwin, Paiute, and Kiliwa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since its creation, the program has been adopted by several other endangered indigenous language groups, including Aboriginal groups in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knut|first=Olawsky,|date=2013-04-12|title=The Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program Down Under: Experience and Adaptation in an Australian Context|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4569|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rnld.org/MALLP|title=Master-Apprentice training {{!}} www.rnld.org|website=www.rnld.org|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Columbia, Canada, where it is now referred to as the Mentor-Apprentice Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fpcc.ca/language/Programs/Master-Apprentice.aspx|title=First Peoples' Cultural Council  {{!}} Mentor-Apprentice Program|website=www.fpcc.ca|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=firstpeoplescouncil|title=Master-Apprentice Program pt.1|date=2010-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kUhfYAwZes|accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onowa McIvor and Peter Jacobs from the University of Victoria, in particular, conducted a study of Mentor-Apprentice learners in BC and determined that this program is particularly effective for teaching adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uvic.ca/news/topics/2016+indigenous-language-revitalization-adult-learners-study+ring|title=MAPs for Indigenous language learning - University of Victoria|website=UVic.ca|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/indiginous-languages-bc-1.3828536|title=Adults shamed for speaking Indigenous languages hold key to revival|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The program was designed to be easily utilized by groups without extensive linguistic training, allowing communities to use the program on their own. It was also designed to align with the traditional learning style of California indigenous groups, which favours a one-on-one, voluntary learning environment, as opposed to the Western model of education that emphasizes competition among students and negative consequences for poor performance (i.e. poor grades).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The need for a program like the MALLP was evident due to the resource- and people-heavy nature of school-based language revitalization programs, like those used among the Maori, Irish, Hawaiians, and Welsh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, most of the parental generation of indigenous California communities no longer spoke their ancestral language, eliminating the possibility of revitalization through use of the language in the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of these issues, the MALLP was developed with the aim of assisting young professionals in these communities, and current and future parents, to become proficient speakers of their language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The Program==

The main goal of the MALLP is that the apprentice attains proficiency in their language over a few years, through the creation of mini-immersion settings within each team.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To create the mini-immersion settings, the teams are encouraged to go about their daily lives as normal, for a minimum number of hours per week, but to always communicate in the language that is being learned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The program incorporates techniques from several language-learning programs, including Total Physical Response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14761708|title=Learning another language through actions : the complete teacher's guidebook|last=1929-|first=Asher, James J.

The MALLP is based on ten main points:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinton|first=Leanne|date=2001-10-08|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004261723s002|pages=1–18|doi=10.1163/9789004261723_002|title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice|isbn=9789004261723}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teams should strive to communicate only in their language, and avoid English as much as possible.
# Teams should use nonverbal communication to embed the language in actions, gestures, and expressions.
# Masters should aim to teach their apprentices through the use of full sentences, and normal conversation.
# Teams should strive to have all their real communication occur in their language, not just specific instructional periods.
# It is important to recognize that language is part of culture, rather than being a separate entity from it.
# Teams should focus on developing the apprentice’s ability to speak and listen in their language, and think less about writing and grammatical analysis.
# Teams should develop activities to complete together, to allow for more opportunities for diverse language use.
# Whenever needed, audio and video recordings are encouraged to aid the apprentice.
# The concept of active learning is critical to the apprentice’s success.
# It is important to be attentive to  the needs of both members of the team.

[[File:Sarcophagus dyonisos 01 back side pushkin.jpg|thumb|400px|Dionysian scene on a 3rd-century AD [[sarcophagus]]]]
In [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]], an '''''orgion''''' (ὄργιον, more commonly in the plural '''''orgia''''') was an ecstatic form of worship characteristic of some [[mystery cults]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Luck]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006, 2nd ed.), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''orgion'' is in particular a cult ceremony of [[Dionysos]] (or [[Zagreus]]), celebrated widely in [[Arcadia]], featuring "unrestrained" masked dances by torchlight and [[animal sacrifice]] by means of random slashing that evoked the god's own rending and suffering at the hands of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].
&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Jost, "Mystery Cults in Arcadia," in ''Greek Mysteries: The Archaeology and Ritual of Ancient Greek Secret Cults'' (Routledge, 2003), pp. 144–164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Orgy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''orgia'' that explained the role of the Titans in Dionysos's dismemberment were said to have been composed by [[Onomacritus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.37.5; Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek art and literature, as well as some [[Church Fathers|patristic]] texts, indicate that the ''orgia'' involved [[snake handling]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton, ''A Late Antique Shrine of [[Liber]] Pater at Cosa'' (Brill, 1976), pp. 33–34. Among Church Fathers see [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 5.19; [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'' 2.12.2; [[Firmicus Maternus]], ''De errore profanarum religionum'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orgia'' may have been earlier manifestations of cult than the formal mysteries, as suggested by the violently ecstatic rites described in [[Greek mythology|myth]] as celebrated by [[Attis]] in honor of [[Cybele]] and reflected in the willing self-castration of her priests the [[Galli]] in the historical period. The ''orgia'' of both Dionysian worship and the cult of Cybele aim at breaking down barriers between the celebrants and the divinity through a state of mystic exaltation:&lt;ref&gt;Giulia Sfameni Gasparro, ''Soteriology and Mystic Aspects in the Cult of Cybele and Attis'' (Brill, 1985), p. 53 and 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Dionysian orgy allowed the [[Maenad|Bacchant]] to emerge from the '[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]' to be united with the god in the ecstatic exaltation of [[omophagia]], dancing and wine. … This kind of bodily [[mysticism]] and [[psychosomatic]] liberation had only temporary effects each time — the period of the ''[[Ecstasy (emotion)|ekstasis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Cults of the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell 1996, 2001, from the original French 1992), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Initiates of the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] and Bacchic ''orgia'' practiced distinctive burial customs (see ''[[Totenpass]]'') expressive of their beliefs in an [[afterlife]]; for instance, it was forbidden for the dead to wear wool.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Herodotus]] 2.81, as cited by Graf and Johnston, ''Ritual Texts'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of a group devoted to performing ''orgia'' are called ''orgeônes'', whose activities were regulated by law. The cult of the Thracian goddess [[Bendis]] was organized at Athens by her ''orgeônes'' as early as the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Corinne Ondine Pache, "Barbarian Bond: Thracian Bendis among the Athenians," in ''Between Magic and Religion'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of women in ''orgia'', which in some manifestations was exclusive to women, sometimes led to prurient speculation and attempts to suppress the rites. In 186 BC, [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|the Roman senate tried to ban]] Dionysian religion as subversive both morally and politically.&lt;ref&gt;Celia E. Schultz, ''Women's religious activity in the Roman Republic'' pp. 82–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isidore of Seville]] says that the [[Latin]] equivalent of ''orgia'' was ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#caerimonia|caerimoniae]]'' (English "ceremonies"), the arcane rites of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] preserved by the various [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|colleges]] of priests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''[[Etymologiae]]'' 6.19.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudo-athlete''' is a concept in Roman portraiture, favored in the late Republican Period, to describe a sculpture that has a combination of a veristic head and an idealized body. [[Verism]] shows the person portrayed without idealizing features, with warts, wrinkles, and other physical defects and deformities. Verism goes beyond a realistic rendering. There was a positive value of age and experience in Rome, so it manipulates the facial expression in an attempt to convey the stern traditional Roman values. One of the potential origins of the veristic style is from Roman funeral masks. The masks were used to give an impersonation of the deceased at the [[Roman Forum]]. Therefore, it was critical that the masks reproduced the appearance of the deceased and portrayed all of their features. The public funerals were to portray the character of the deceased, so artists were encouraged to make the masks as expressive as possible using the traditionally prized Roman values: stern moral seriousness (''[[gravitas]]''), firmness and strictness of judgement (''severitas''), determination and self-possession (''constantia''), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, C. (2005). The Roman Nude: Heroic Portrait Statuary 200 B.C.-A.D. 300. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the origin of [[verism]] is highly debated as to whether it was from Italic, Etruscan, Roman, Egyptian, or Greek influence, the purpose for realistic, unidealized rendering was specific. The signs of age were used as indicators of wisdom and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Gisela M. A. Richter. (1955). [http://doi.org/10.2307/298742 The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits]. The Journal of Roman Studies, 45, 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The body remains idealized due to Greek influence.  In Greek sculpture there is a concept of [[heroic nudity]]. It is used to indicate that a sculpture's apparently mortal human subject is in fact a hero or semi-divine being.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"&gt;Kleiner, F. (2010). Portraiture.

== Roman examples ==

=== Pseudo-Athlete of Delos ===
[[File:1477 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Pseudo-Athlete of Delos, 80 AD ca. - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto,.jpg|thumb|1477 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Pseudo-Athlete of Delos, 80 AD ca. - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto,]]
The Pseudo-athlete of Delos is a life-size nude male portrait that was found in the House of the Diadoumenos on the Greek island of Delos. It belonged to a Roman business man and dates back to 100 BCE. Stylistic traits of Greek sculpture, such as the [[contrapposto]] of the Polykleitan original and the sharp upturn of the head reminiscent of [[Hellenistic sculpture]], were incorporated. In contrast, the bald head, prominent ears, and wrinkled face is reminiscent of the Republican style, as is the combination of the veristic head with the idealized body.  The idealized nude body is symbolic of the concept of [[heroic nudity]] in Greek sculpture.  The realistic head is symbolic of wisdom and experience that comes with age. In Greek portraiture, the head and body show a consistent age. However, in the Roman pseudo-athlete there is a disconnect.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt; The draped cloth carefully placed across the left shoulder is reminiscent of the Roman toga, while the nude body is typical in Greek statues.&lt;ref&gt;Squire, M. (2011). The Art of the Body: Antiquity and its Legacy. London: I.B. Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; The body is used as a prop for the head. In the Delos pseudo-athlete, nudity is used as a costume or garment since the business man would not have appeared nude in public or in front of his guests.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt; The combination of the Greek style body with a Roman head makes the sculpture from Delos a great example of the Roman pseudo-athlete.

=== Tivoli General ===
[[File:General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01.JPG|thumb|General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01]]
In Tivoli, at the Sanctuary of Hercules, a pseudo-athlete portrait of a general was found.  The marble sculpture with a veristic Roman head and idealized Greek body dates back to 75-50 BCE. To show his rank in the army and hold up the heavy marble statue, there is a [[cuirass]] at his side. His typical Republican stern and wrinkled face is contrasted by a youthful almost nude body that exudes power and is in the tradition of a Hellenistic ruler. Through the reference back to Greek idealized body, the patron expresses cultural superiority. The general exudes modesty by using a draped cloth to cover his genitals.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1886">{{For|the town|Ruatapu, New Zealand}}

In [[Māori mythology|Māori tradition]], '''Ruatapu''' was the second son of the great chief [[Uenuku]], who belittled him for using the sacred comb of his elder brother, [[Kahutia-te-rangi]].  As revenge, Ruatapu enticed the children of the nobility into his canoe, sailed them in the ocean, and then sank it (Craig 1989:237).  Kahutia-te-rangi survived with the help of a whale and was thereafter known as [[Paikea]] (Reedy 1993:142-146). 

Meanwhile, Ruatapu convinced the gods of the tides to destroy the land and its inhabitants.  Paikea fled to high ground and was saved through the intervention of the goddess [[Moa-kura-manu]].  One version of the myth holds that Ruatapu drowned in the flood and that his bowels became the first jellyfish (Craig 1989:237, Reedy 1989:142-146).

==Flood myth==

In a tradition of the [[Ngati Porou]], a Māori tribe of the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, Ruatapu became angry when his father Uenuku elevated his younger half-brother Kahutia-te-rangi ahead of him. Ruatapu lured Kahutia-te-rangi and a large number of young men of high birth into his canoe, and took them out to sea where he drowned them.  He called on the gods to destroy his enemies and threatened to return as the great waves of early summer. As he struggled for his life, Kahutia-te-rangi recited an incantation invoking the southern humpback whales (''paikea'' in Māori) to carry him ashore. Accordingly, he was renamed [[Paikea]], and was the only survivor (Reedy 1997:83-85).

'''Sabaw''' is also known as Mervin Vrem S. Villegas from Arriola Compound Dulongbayan 2 San Mateo,Rizal. This family name belongs to the Kachin that live in [[Kachin State]] in Burma. They are originally from '''Sabaw Ga''' called [[Sabaw Land]] (Northern Burma). The name originates from a certain group of people living in that land who were notably prosperous and rich with livestock. From the name '''Sut baw''' (rich or prosperous) comes '''Sabaw'''. They belong to the [[Hka Hku]] [one of the tribes from Kachin (Kachin State)] and a few others living in the surrounding area today. '''Sabaw''' is Family Name and '''Amyu''' [the clan relationship name] is '''Udi Chyang Maja, Hkashu Hkasha'''.

Sabaw, in other words Sah-Bao, is a mythical creature found in the Northern Philippines. Sabaw like to prey on street cats and alley dogs. There are no records of Sabaws attacking real live humans.

Sabaw is also the Filipino word for soup and/or the liquid component of any dish, particularly stews.

Sabaw is also Filipino slang used for a person whose brain is not functioning properly anymore. For instance, when a person has just woken up or when a person has stayed up late and is suffering from sleep deprivation. For example, "Steven is so sabaw. He can't even spell Athena's name correctly."

'''Saint Senara''' is a legendary [[Cornish saint]] with links to the village of [[Zennor]] on the north coast of [[Cornwall]]
, UK. The [[Church of Saint Senara, Zennor]] is dedicated to her; the village, nearby headland [[Zennor Head]], and the neolithic tomb [[Zennor Quoit]] received her name indirectly.

==Historical records==
According to scholar [[Nicholas Orme]], a Saint Sinar of Zennor was first recorded in 1170 as a male saint ("Sanctus Sinar"), but from 1235 onwards as a female one ("Sancta Sinara"). Orme states that unless she can be identified with Azenor, the mother of Saint [[Budoc]] in Breton legends, nothing else is recorded about her. He also points out the similarity to Saint Senan, commemorated at nearby [[Sennen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Senara was reputedly a Breton princess of [[Brest, France|Brest]] originally named Asenora,&lt;ref&gt;Bede, [[Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum|Eccl. Hist.]] Book 3, chapter 23.&lt;/ref&gt; a woman described as having a "rather dubious reputation" before her conversion.{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2012}}&lt;ref name="SK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suemonkkidd.com/Reflections.aspx?t=m&amp;i=27|title=The Mermaid Chair|publisher=Suemonkidd.com|accessdate=13 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010231911/http://suemonkkidd.com/Reflections.aspx?t=m&amp;i=27|archivedate=10 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to a Breton king who wrongly accused her of adultery and threw her into the sea in a barrel while pregnant.{{#tag:ref||name="monaghan2004"}}&lt;ref name="Hainsworth2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hainsworth|first=Tessa|title=Seagulls in the Attic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RVKF5DA4aMC&amp;pg=PT197|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=10 June 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-5147-3|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was visited by an [[angel]], whilst floating in the sea off the westernmost end of Cornwall, and gave birth to a son in the waves, who later became Saint [[Budoc]] or an Irish bishop. She was washed up on the Cornish coast, and some believe she founded [[Zennor]] and gave her name to the eponymous village (and subsequently [[Zennor Head]], [[Zennor Quoit]] and Porthzennor Cove), before continuing to [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Wills2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=Dixe|title=Z to Z of Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDfhAAAACAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=25 July 2006|publisher=Icon Books|isbn=978-1-84046-754-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zennor.org/about_parish.html|title=About Parish|publisher=Zennor Parish Council|accessdate=13 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422182054/http://www.zennor.org/about_parish.html|archivedate=22 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the term as used in folklore and superstition|the main meaning of the modern German word|blessing|the Hebrew term|segan}}

'''''Segen''''' is a German word translating to "blessing, benediction; charm; prayer; spell, incantation".

It is in origin a loan from Latin ''signum''  ''sīgnāre'' "to make a sign", viz. the [[Sign of the Cross]] used to confer a Christian [[blessing]],
The term is attested as  [[Old High German]] ''seganōn'' from as early as c. AD 800, resulting in a modern ''segnen'' "to bless". The noun ''Segen'' "blessing" was derived from the verb at an early time, attested in the 9th century as ''segan''.
[[Old English]] hat the corresponding ''sægnan'', which survives as the dialectal (esp. Scottish) ''sain'' (popularized by Scott, ''[[The Heart of Midlothian|Heart of Mid-Lothian]]'' "God sain us").
The concept of ''Segen'', understood [[magical thinking|magically]], was very productive in the [[folklore]], [[folk religion]] and [[superstition]] of [[German-speaking Europe]], studied in great detail by the German philologists and folklorists of the 19th century.

The medieval church used the ''Segen'' (the sign of the cross with a spoken formula) liberally, intended as an act with protective effect, putting the person or thing blessed under the protection of God. Nor was the action reserved for priests or clerics, but any Christian was permitted to make the sign of the cross and invoke the protection of God. Thus the ''Segen'' came to be seen as the inverse of the [[curse]] (''Fluch''), magical acts with the power to either protect or harm.  
&lt;!--The blessing offered by parents (''vater- &amp; muttersegen, benedictio parentum, paternum et maternum votum'') was considered particularly effective, presumably based on the narratives of the Old Testament (Hebrew  ''barak'' בָּרַךְ lit. "to kneel").
--&gt; 
The concept of ''Segen'' thus became the continuant of the incantation formulas of the [[Germanic paganism|pre-Christian period]]  (the only surviving samples of which are the [[Merseburg Incantations]]).

Use of such formulas was partly encouraged by the Church, as they did superficially involve an expression of piety by the invocation of God, Christ or the Virgin Mary, but at the same time their magical use was viewed with scepticism and was sometimes repressed.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' citing "E. H. Meyer myth. 23"."{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the time  of the [[Early Modern witch-hunts]], the term ''segen'' had become ambiguous, and depending on context could refer to a harmless farewell, to a  pious invocation of God, or to a Satanic or superstitious spell  (''pro incantamento et adjuratione magica'' Stieler 1669{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}; e.g. ''[[Wolfssegen]]'' "contra lupos").
{{verse translation|lang=de|
si (landstreicher) kunnen sagen vom vinstern sternen und tuond die lüt segen lernen für den donder und den hagel
|
they [vagabonds] know tales of dark stars and teach people ''spells'' [segen] for [to control] thunder and hail.
|attr1=''[[Des Teufels Netz]]'' v. 6367 (15th century)}}

This early modern usage survives in dialectal variation throughout the rural parts of German-speaking Europe.
For [[German-speaking Switzerland]], the ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]'' [http://www.idiotikon.ch/Register/faksimile.php?&amp;band=7&amp;spalte=444 7,444 "Sëgeⁿ"] 
records some  two dozen compounds in ''-sëgeⁿ'', in some of which ''Segen'' takes the meaning "prayer" and in others "spell, charm".

A notable concept in Swiss folklore is the ''Alpsegen'' (''Alpe(n)sëgeⁿ, Alpsëgeⁿ''  [https://web.archive.org/web/20130325231631/http://digital.idiotikon2.ch/idtkn/id7.htm#page/70451/mode/1up 7,451]), a folk religious custom in Alpine Switzerland where every night 
a prayer must be sung over each [[Alpine pasture]]. This combined the function of an apotropaic charm with a practical aspect of communicating between remote pastures; if the ''Alpsegen'' was not heard from a neighbouring site, it would be a sign that a misfortune or accident had befallen and the neighbours would come to aid.

A '''shotel''' is a curved [[sword]] originating in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian swordsmen who were trained in using this weapon were known as shotelai. The curve on the shotel's blade varies from the Persian [[shamshir]], adopting an almost semicircular shape. The blade is flat and double-edged with a diamond cross-section. The blade is about {{convert|40|in}} in total length and the [[hilt]] is a simple wooden piece with no [[guard (weapon)|guard]]. The shotel was carried in a close fitting leather [[scabbard]].&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;*{{cite book | last = Stone | first = George Cameron |authorlink= George Cameron Stone | title = A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor in All Countries and in All Times | origyear = 1934 | year = 1999 | publisher = Dover Publications | location = Mineola NY | isbn = 0-486-40726-8 | page = 562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Evidence for the shotel dates from the earliest [[Dʿmt|Damotians]] (Damites) and [[Axumite Kingdom|Axumite]]s, used by both mounted and dismounted warriors. After the [[Solomon]]ic restoration of Atse Yikuno Amlak I, the resurgent Emperors began to re-establish the Axumite armies. This culminated in the reign of [[Amda Seyon I]]. Ethiopian forces were armed with short and long swords such as the [[Saif|Seif]] and Gorade. The Shotel swordsmen known as Shotelai and organized in the Axurarat Shotelai comprised one of the elite forces of Amda Seyon's Imperial host. Along with the Hareb Gonda and Korem cavalry, Keste Nihb archers and Axuarat Axuarai lancers were said to be the forces that "flew through the air like the eagle and spun on the ground like the avalanche", by a contemporaneous historian.{{cn|date=May 2012}} Shotel techniques among others included hooking attacks both against mounted and dismounted opponents that had devastating effect especially against mounted cavalry. The shotel could be used to hook and rip the warrior off the horse. Classically the Shotel was employed in a dismounted state to hook the opponent by reaching around a shield or any other defensive implement or weapon.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

==Design==
Its shape is similar to a big [[sickle]] and can be effectively used to reach around an opponent's shield and stab them in vital areas, such as the [[kidney]]s or [[lung]]s. It is closely resembled by the Afar Gile. The Gile has two cutting edges, while the shotel's upper edge is unsharpened and sometimes used braced against the swordsman's shield for strength. The Shotel and other Ethiopian swords are occasionally referred collectively in Geez as Han'e.

However, the mid-18th century European visitor to Ethiopia, Remedius Prutky, often used the word ''shotel'' to describe a carving knife.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Arrowsmith-Brown (trans.), ''Prutky's Travels in Ethiopia and other Countries'' with notes by Richard Pankhurst (London: Hakluyt Society, 1991), pp. 77, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA), [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Wii]] by [[THQ]] . The PS2, GameCube, and Wii versions are all ports of the same game developed by [[Blitz Games]], while the GBA, Nintendo DS and PC versions were separate games developed by WayForward Technologies and AWE Games respectively. It is based on the [[Nickelodeon]] [[animated sitcom]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', and stars the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|title character]], his best friend [[Patrick Star]], and their enemy [[Plankton and Karen|Plankton]] as they journey to nine different worlds, supposedly, inside the dreams of the characters. The Wii version was a North American [[launch title]]. It is also the first ''SpongeBob'' game released in Japan (PlayStation 2 and Wii versions), but was released under the title '''''SpongeBob''''' ('''スポンジ・ボブ''' ''Suponjibobu''), to mark it as the first video game in the ''SpongeBob'' series to have a Japanese release. The Windows version of the game is titled ''SpongeBob SquarePants: Nighty Nightmare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Steven|title=Lights, Camera, Pants!

==Gameplay==
Players have access to three playable characters during the game, [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], Patrick Starfishman ([[Patrick Star]] in superhero form), and [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Sheldon J. Plankton]], and must guide them through nine levels of play in a [[Dream world (plot device)|dreamworld]].&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/844/844283p1.html|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab Review |last=DeVries|first=Jack|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2008-01-08|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different types of gameplay have been incorporated into the game, known as flying, rampaging, racing, and platforming. During flying sections, the game sets obstacles, one in front of another, and the player must maneuver past them. In most cases, the game will tell the player which way to fly (up, down, left, and right). On the Wii, the player uses the controller like an actual plane control stick. The most common cases of this is when SpongeBob uses his plane to attack a giant-sized Plankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/723/723470p1.html|title=SpongeBob Takes Flight|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rampage levels, the player controls a giant sized Plankton and uses special powers and moves to destroy everything in their path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/725/725330p1.html|title=SpongeBob's Rampage |last=Casamassina|first=Matt|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-08-11|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player's laser power is indicated by a bar on the right side of the screen, which refills after use. The Wii version features controller movements that respectively activate moves. Racing gameplay is similar to most racing games; it is featured in both the air and the ground's gameplay, fuel must be collected in order to keep the player's vehicle running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/726/726629p1.html|title=SpongeBob Races|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-08-18|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platforming gameplay is spread throughout the game, such as when Plankton must escape from a live Krabby Patty or when Patrick Starfishman saves Bikini Bottom from his evil form, Dreaded Patrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/728/728389p1.html|title=SpongeBob Goes Platforming|last=Casamassina|first=Matt |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-08-25|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a dream, SpongeBob's bed transforms into a hot rod and he drives it around a track across Bikini Bottom, which now resembles an art style inspired by the works of [[Ed Roth]]. After several races against Patrick, Plankton and Gary, he accidentally drives into an unnoticed pit.

In another dream, Patrick is a superhero named "Starfishman" in a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] comic book-like world where everyone resembles him. Starfishman pursues the villainous "Dreaded Patrick", who attempts to remake the town in his own image. Starfishman goes around town beating his minions, getting clothes for a man after saving him from a train, and giving the mayor laundry detergent to help "clean up the town". Starfishman eventually beats Dreaded Patrick in a battle at his secret lair. However, Starfishman fails to see a surprise attack. He is tied to a rocket and launched into outer space, where he hits an asteroid, a piece of which falls to Earth and traps Dreaded Patrick.

In yet another dream, Plankton zaps a crumb of a Krabby Patty with his Enlargatron Ray. However, the ray's coordinates are inaccurate, causing the Krabby Patty to overgrow and mutate into a vicious living patty. Plankton decides to fight back with size but the inaccurate ray only makes him the height of an average citizen, not enough to dwarf the patty. Plankton, carrying only his freeze ray, is pursued by the patty throughout Bikini Bottom. The patty ultimately loses Plankton when he hides. However, Plankton gloats about his victory and is spotted. The patty leaps forward and crushes Plankton.

Returning to SpongeBob awakening, he reaches the bottom of the pit he drove into and is eaten by an Alaskan Bull Worm. He encounters Old Man Jenkins, who is building a biplane to escape the bowels of the worm. Within the worm, SpongeBob locates spare parts from the chief of a village inside and an inventor for the biplane, he also gets rid of a huge can of chili that's causing the worm stomach problems.

In outer space, an awakening Starfishman manages to untie himself from the rocket after flying around. He shoots asteroids guarding a space station and continues to fly around until he meets up with a U.F.O. in the shape of a patty. He shoots off its wings, destroying it. Then Patrick returns to Earth while trying figure out how to stop the rocket.

Plankton awakes to find the giant Krabby Patty sleeping beside him. As he sneaks away, Karen's wake-up call awakens the patty. Plankton sets the accurate coordinates for his ray and makes himself giant monster-sized. The patty flees and Plankton gives chase, destroying Bikini Bottom in his wake. He finds the patty hiding in a skyscraper and destroys each floor to force it out. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Jenkins forcibly exit the worm's mouth and find Plankton. The giant patty escapes Plankton's clutches and clings onto SpongeBob's plane. Enraged, Plankton pursues the plane.

SpongeBob tries to avoid Plankton while devising a plan to defeat him. After a long pursuit through the city, including the sewers and a construction site, SpongeBob engages Plankton on a radio tower. SpongeBob destroys the support bolts to make the tower unstable, causing Plankton to fall on his rear. As Plankton aches in pain, SpongeBob feels sorry for him and decides to help him up. Plankton then captures SpongeBob.

Starfishman arrives from outer space and teams up with Mermaid Man and the Bikini Bottom Defence Force Army to battle giant Plankton and rescue SpongeBob. Several other plankton arrive on the rooftops to get rid of him. After four battles, Starfishman must locate a shrink ray to shrink Plankton.
 
===Endings===
After Plankton is shrunk, he accompanies Patrick and SpongeBob into a dream bubble, where they meet a doctor with a Krabby Patty for a head. The doctor explains that the reason for their bizarre dreams is because they all ate a Krabby Patty before falling asleep; the chemical composition of the patties affected their biorhythms and caused a reaction that resulted in the dreams. SpongeBob then asks the doctor how he knows so much about Krabby Patties; the doctor strips his outfit off to reveal that he is the Krabby Patty in their own dreams. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton chase after him and head into the final level where they race against one another for the Krabby Patty trophy in a bizarre, nightmare-like racetrack. The game starts off with SpongeBob as the only choice available. To unlock Patrick and Plankton, the player must collect Sleepy Seeds spread throughout the game. The level's ending depends on which character the player wins with:
* SpongeBob celebrates his victory, and overlooks his dream bubble to discover that it was a dream. He pops out and brings the Krabby Patty to the Krusty Krab, chopping the patty into average-sized patties for the customers. SpongeBob then notices that he and the customers have Gary's shell on their backs. SpongeBob then meows, suggesting that he is turning into a snail.
* Patrick suddenly appears at the Krusty Krab where everyone is celebrating him. He attempts to eat the Krabby Patty in front of him, but it escapes and Patrick ends up ramming into a door, causing him to see multiple Garys.
* Plankton successfully takes over Bikini Bottom and destroys the Krusty Krab with his own Krabby Patty franchise. However, the talking patty from before warns him that, "what the patty gives, the patty can take away." Patties then begin raining down and crushing Plankton's empire, one of which has a familiar set of snail-eyes that crushes the Chum Bucket after bouncing off a run-down Krusty Krab.

In the ultimate ending, SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton wake up in one another's dream and it is revealed that this was all Gary's dream, who was the one who ate the Krabby Patty. After waking up, he goes around town and sees SpongeBob, Patrick, and Plankton, who are acting just like in his dream. He then returns home to rest. SpongeBob brings back a Krabby Patty for Gary, who refuses to eat it because it may give him nightmares. Gary then watches as SpongeBob has a "conversation" with the patty. As SpongeBob prepares to eat the patty, he is eaten by the Alaskan Bull Worm, causing Gary to faint into slumber.

==Development==
Developer [[Blitz Games]] had a meeting with staff from [[THQ]] during the 2005 [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] trade show, where they were asked to oversee and develop the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. THQ staff revealed that they had an "intimate" business relationship with [[Nintendo]], and that Nintendo had expressed an interest in having a SpongeBob game published on their new console, the [[Wii]], which at that point was still known by its development name Revolution. Blitz came up with several styles of play during development, some of which did not become part of the finished product. In particular, shooting sections using the Wiimote had been considered, but license holders Nickelodeon were uncomfortable with them due to SpongeBob SquarePants being a cartoon.&lt;ref name="wiire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewiire.com/features/195/1/Interview_Andrew_Oliver_Blitz_Games# |title=Interview: Andrew Oliver, Blitz Games|last=White|first=Shawn|publisher=thewiire.com|date=2007-04-22|accessdate=2008-01-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830001116/http://www.thewiire.com/features/195/1/Interview_Andrew_Oliver_Blitz_Games# |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Blitz developing their own [[middleware]] with a focus on providing cross-platform compatibility, the main sections of the game such as driving and platforming are the same for each console version of the game. The mini game controls work differently on the Wii version of the game, the Nintendo console was the main focus of development. Extra development time was spent configuring the control methods for the Wiimote and the standard controllers used on the other consoles.&lt;ref name="wiire"/&gt;

The game was announced prior to the 2006 E3 show, and was first shown to journalists at that event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3150747&amp;did=1|title=Previews: SpongeBob|last=Leone|first=Matt|publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2006-05-12|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nintendo Power]] referred to the game as the "most ambitious and most successful SpongeBob game to date" in their December 2006 issue. Some positive aspects noted by reviewers about it included the variety in gameplay, responsive controls on the GC and PS2 versions, straightforward and solid level design, and the game's overrall ambition, while negatives points included subpar graphics, especially on the GC version, overly long and poorly paced platforming and racing levels, and the occasionally unresponsive motion controls on the Wii version.

Several reviewers also noted that the fictional world does not resemble [[Bikini Bottom]] or the cartoon itself, that the story and overall tone is slightly darker and more surreal compared to previous games, and that the game does not "feel" like a SpongeBob SquarePants title.

'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion''''' (retitled '''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by the Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]]. ''The Golden Bough'' was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). The influence of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] and thought was substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Karbiener, K. &amp; Stade, G., |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume =2|publisher= Infobase Publishing|date= 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA189#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]''—an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or [[pomegranate]] to the new king, who must kill the old king - Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully]]

Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]], and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamel, Frazer (Editor)|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] and periodic [[sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]]. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Frazer's thesis was developed in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of [[Nemi]], "[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s Mirror", where religious ceremonies and the "fulfillment of vows" of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic marriage to a [[goddess]] of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:fane|fane]] of [[Rex Nemorensis|Nemi]], who was ritually murdered by his successor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (''Aftermath'', p. vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by Turner, in which [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' that while he had never studied [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his friend James Ward, and the philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of "the nature and historical relations of magic and religion". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that "we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection." Frazer included an extract from Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frazer, James George |title=The Golden Bough.

==Critical reception==
''The Golden Bough'' scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of [[Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection]] in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] in a speculative appendix; the discussion of [[Christianity]] was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leach, Edmund R. |url= http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |title= Kingship and divinity: The unpublished Frazer Lecture |location= Oxford |origyear= 28 October 1982 |journal= ''HAU: ''Journal of Ethnographic Theory ''1.1'' |date= 2011 |pages= 279–298 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922093723/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |archivedate= 22 September 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Jonathan Z. |title= When the bough breaks |work= History of Religions ''12.4'' |date=1973 |pages= 342–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=E.C.|last=Cawte|page=38|chapter=It's an Ancient Custom—But How Ancient?|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R. Angus|last=Downie|title=Frazer and the Golden Bough|location=London|publisher=Victor Gallancz|page=112|isbn=978-0-575-00486-3|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, at the inauguration of the [[Frazer Lecture|Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology]], he said: "It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists "had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" while they now dissociate themselves "from much that he wrote." While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as "little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism", while 
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], in his ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'' (1979), wrote: "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Initially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Hays &amp; L.L. Langness (Editor) |title= From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology |pages= 75, 314 |work= The Study of Culture |location= Corte Madera |publisher= Chandler &amp; Sharp |date= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas "began to belong to the past": {{Quote|In 1922, simultaneously with the publication of the first abridged edition of ''The Golden Bough'', came Malinowski's ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' and Radcliffe-Brown's ''The Andaman Islanders'', the first outstanding products of the British field research tradition that Frazer had very actively encouraged. As every first-year student knows, these monographs began to point students towards empirical studies of Frazer's 'savages', who, when spoken to in their own homes and languages, were found to have much more of interest to say for themselves than Frazer had to say about them. The central theme (or, as he thought, theory) of ''The Golden Bough''—that all mankind had evolved intellectually and psychologically from a superstitious belief in magicians, through a superstitious belief in priests and gods, to enlightened belief in scientists—had little or no relevance to the conduct of life in an Andamanese camp or a Melanesian village, and the whole, supposedly scientific, basis of Frazer's anthropology was seen as a misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;}}

[[Edmund Leach]], "one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect", was scathing of the [[artistic license]] exercised by Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'', saying: "Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to ''illustrate'' propositions which he had arrived at in advance by ''a priori'' reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!"&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

[[René Girard]], a French historian, literary critic, and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]], "grudgingly" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as "a key primitive ritual", but described his interpretation of the ritual as "a grave injustice to ethnology."&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence|journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]|first=Robert A.|last=Segal|pages=4–25|issue=1|volume=37|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scapegoat|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1986|page=120|isbn=978-0-801-83315-1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girard's "grievances" against ''The Golden Bough'' were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the [[New Testament]] Gospels were "just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be "revelatory texts" rather than myths or the remains of "ignorant superstition", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, "whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Girard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1978|page=180|isbn=978-0-804-72215-5|publisher=Athlone Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948). [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem "[[Sailing to Byzantium]]". The horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s understanding of religion was influenced by ''The Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joshi, S. T. |title=H. P. Lovecraft: A Life |publisher=Necronomicon Press |location=West Warwick |year=1996 |page=209 |isbn=0-940884-88-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lovecraft, H.

Eliot]] acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[William Carlos Williams]] refers to ''The Golden Bough'' in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PatersonWCW|title=Paterson - William Carlos Williams|first=|last=William Carlos Williams|date=5 May 1963|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Bough'' influenced [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; the novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt; [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt;

The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] drew on ''The Golden Bough'' in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, California |year=2008 |pages=330 |isbn=978-1-57731-593-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later described Frazer's work as "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=164 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Weston La Barre]], writing in ''[[The Human Animal (book)|The Human Animal]]'' (1955), described Frazer as "the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]" and wrote that Frazer's work was "an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the musician [[Jim Morrison]]'s song "[[Not to Touch the Earth]]" were influenced by the table of contents of ''The Golden Bough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hopkins, Jerry |author2=Sugarman, Danny |title=No One Here Gets Out Alive |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=978-0446602280 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s commentaries on ''The Golden Bough'' have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|title=Phil.uni-passau.de|author=|date=|website=uni-passau.de|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202203/http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman, in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists'' (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]]. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has cited ''The Golden Bough'' as one of the most important influences on her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination." Paglia acknowledged that "many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology "will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 | title= Pelosi’s victory for women | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171608/http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | archivedate= 1 May 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of ''The Golden Bough'' is "bland" and should be "avoided like the plague."&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | date= 10 March 1999 | title= In defense of "The Golden Bough" | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 28 April 2017 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072038/http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | archivedate= 12 May 2016 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tire machèt''''' ("pull [the] [[machete]]") is a [[Haiti]]an [[martial art]]; a form of [[fencing]] with machetes.

The origin of the practice lies in the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791-1804, in which rebel slaves, many armed only with the machetes they had used to cut [[sugarcane]], defeated the French colonial army. ''Tire machèt'' combines elements of historical European fencing and traditional African combat systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poon|first1=Linda|title='En Garde' Takes On New Urgency In A Duel With Machetes|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/24/379333823/en-garde-takes-on-new-urgency-in-a-duel-with-machetes|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=NPR.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally practiced in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buder|first1=Emily|title=The Master of a Secret Machete Martial Art|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/545057/papa-machete/|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tirhuta'''  or '''Mithilakshar''' is the [[writing system|script]] used for the [[Maithili language]] originating in the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] region of [[Bihar]], [[India]] and the eastern [[Terai]] region of [[Nepal]]. The oldest reference to Tirhuta script is Sahodara Temple of [[Narkatiaganj|Narkatiyaganj]], Bihar, dated 950 CE &lt;ref name="n4035"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11175r-tirhuta.pdf | title=N4035: Proposal to Encode the Tirhuta Script in ISO/IEC 10646 | first1=Anshuman | last1=Pandey | publisher=Working Group Document, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=2011-05-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213054204/http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11175r-tirhuta.pdf | archivedate=13 December 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The script has a rich history spanning a thousand years, believed to be originated in the 10th century CE, but years of neglect by [[Nepal]] and the [[Bihar]] government have taken their toll on the use of Tirhuta. It is similar to [[Bengali script]]. Most speakers of Maithili have switched to using the [[Devanagari script]], which is also used to write neighboring Central Indic languages such as [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. As a result, the number of people with a working knowledge of Tirhuta has dropped considerably in recent years.

==History and current status==
Before 14th CE, Tirhuta was exclusively used to write Sanskrit, later Maithili was written in this script. Despite the near universal switch from Tirhuta to the Devanagari script for writing Maithili, some traditional [[pandit|pundit]]s still use the script for sending one another ceremonial letters (''pātā'') related to some important function such as marriage. Fonts for this script were developed in 2003.&lt;ref name="n4035"/&gt;

The 2003 inclusion of Maithili in the VIIIth Schedule of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], having accorded official recognition to it as a language independent of Hindi, there is a possibility that this might lead to efforts to re-implement Tirhuta on a wider basis, in accord with similar trends in India reinforcing separate identities. However, currently, only Maithili in the Devanagari script is officially recognized.

'''''Traceroute''''' is a 2016 Austrian/American documentary film directed by [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]]. The autobiographical documentary and [[road movie]] deals with the history, politics and impact of [[nerd]] culture. Grenzfurthner calls his film a "personal journey into the uncharted depths of nerd culture, a realm full of dangers, creatures and more or less precarious working conditions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/47/47614/1.html|title=Über den Raum in die Zeit|first=Peter|last=Mühlbauer|website=Telepolis|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to "chase the ghosts of nerddom's past, present and future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/traceroute-a-nerds-eye-view-of-a-fascinating-road-trip-across-the-united-states/|title='Traceroute’, A Nerd’s Eye View of a Fascinating Road Trip Across the United States|date=2 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was co-produced by art group [[monochrom]] and Reisenbauer Film. It features music by [[Kasson Crooker]], Hans Nieswandt, and many others.

==Concept==

Artist and self-declared [[nerd]] [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] is documenting his personal road trip from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States, to introduce the audience to places and people that shaped and inspired his art and politics. Traceroute is a reflection on Grenzfurthner's own roots of nerddom, and "On the Road style romp across the United States as he visits icons of the counterculture, the outré, and the generally questionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/traceroute-%E2%80%93-personal-journey-uncharted-depths-nerd-culture|title=Review on Furtherfield; March 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grenzfurthner summarizes the concept in an interview for [[Boing Boing]]: "It is a film on biographies and obsessions and spaces of possibility – in other words something between loving embrace and merciless vivisection. Maintaining a critical meta-outlook was just as important to me as abandoning myself to unfathomable stammerings of adoration. And that all works for one simple reason: because I take a step forward, introducing myself and confessing my guilt like in Alcoholics Anonymous, only to then take off and visit the best whiskey distilleries. In my case these destinations are not whiskey makers, but people and places and symbols of a very special pop culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html|title=The story of Traceroute, about a Leitnerd's quest|date=14 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Film Threat]] he adds: "It was important for me to take nerddom apart, not only analyzing it, but also excavating its potential for greatness."&lt;ref name="filmthreat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmthreat.com/interviews/johannes-grenzfurthner-is-kinda-nerdy/|title=Johannes Grenzfurthner is Kinda Nerdy – Film Threat|website=filmthreat.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film incorporates art and illustrations by James Brothwell, Bonni Rambatan, [[Michael Marrak]], Karin Frank, Ben Lawson, Michael Zeltner, Josh Ellingson and [[eSeL]] in a cinematic collage&lt;ref name="filmthreat.com"/&gt; that draws inspiration from 1990s [[fanzine]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]] aesthetics, [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] culture, [[ANSI art]] and [[fantastic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressplay.at/2016/03/14/traceroute/ Review on Press Play by Marco Rauch, March 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; UK Film Review's Hannah Sayer summarizes the artistic style of the film in her review: "There is a real sense that this is a collaborative exploration of creativity: of the old and the new, the past and the present, and the traditional and the digital. The use of photography and drawings interspersed between the interviews with various people associated with nerd culture shows an artistic approach to the material and these images act as reflective snapshots of moments in time, reinforcing the importance of looking back to the past as well as looking forward to the future of the digital age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukfilmreview.co.uk/#!Traceroute-documentary-review/cu0l/5730ed7a0cf20cbfb2963dc0 UK Film Review, May 9, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
[[File:Traceroute--Johannes Grenzfurthner and Matt Winston.jpg|thumb|Traceroute: Johannes Grenzfurthner and Matt Winston talk about Stan Winston and special effects]]
Traceroute features interviews with [[Matt Winston]], [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Jason Scott]], Christina Agapakis, [[Trevor Paglen]], Ryan Finnigan, Kit Stubbs, [[V. Vale]], Sean Bonner, Allison Cameron, Josh Ellingson, Maggie Mayhem, [[Paolo Pedercini]], Steve Tolin, Dan Wilcox, [[Jon Lebkowsky]], Jan "Varka" Mulders (of [[Bad Dragon]]), Adam Flynn, Abie Hadjitarkhani, Kelly Poots, and some special guest appearances (e.g. [[National Park Service|NPS]] spokesperson Vickie Carson, hacker Nick Farr and cultural curator [[Scott Beale (cultural curator)|Scott Beale]]).

Metronaut writes: "Traceroute offers deep insights into the world of nerddom. A woman who creates cheese from bacteria on sweaty feet. A man who wants to construct a giant network of independent Geiger counters. Or a sex worker who identifies as a nerd. The multitude of topics and people shows how being a nerd is not restricted to programming and computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metronaut.de/2016/02/traceroute-von-nerd-zu-nerd/|title=Traceroute: Von Nerd zu Nerd - Metronaut.de|website=www.metronaut.de|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Writing===
Grenzfurthner performed a [[stand-up]] show called ''Schicksalsjahre eines Nerds'' at Vienna's Rabenhof Theater in 2014. Parts of this show form the basis of Traceroute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000007033569/Pornos-und-tote-Huehner|title=Pornos und tote Hühner|author=Dorian Waller|work=derStandard.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic script, although many scenes and interviews were improvised, was written by Johannes Grenzfurthner. The film's main language is English, but features archival footage in German.

===Filming===
Principal photography commenced on March 5, 2015 and ended March 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4490762/|title=Traceroute|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film can be considered [[microfilmmaking]] and [[guerrilla filmmaking]].

===Sound design===
Daniel Hasibar and Christian Staudacher created the sound design and audioscape underlying Grenzfurthner's narration.

==Music==
The film features music by Peter Barnett, [[Kasson Crooker]], Damien Di Fede, Matthew Huffaker, Brady Leo, [[Vera Lynn]], [[Kevin MacLeod (musician)|Kevin MacLeod]], Hans Nieswandt, Roger Sandega, Eric Skiff, among others.

==Distribution==

The film's World Premiere took place at NYC Independent Film Festival on April 28, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nycindieff.com/session/traceroute|title=NYC Independent Film Festival - Sessions|first=|last=http://bradmaxs.com|website=www.nycindieff.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Premiere took place at ''DOK.fest Munich'' ([[Internationales Dokumentarfilmfestival München]]) on May 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dokfest-muenchen.de/films/view/8105 Traceroute at DOK.fest Munich 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Various film festivals and conventions (like ''[[Hackers on Planet Earth]]'' 2016, ''[[Gen Con]]'' 2016, the ''European Media Arts Festival'' 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emaf.de/deutsch/timetable/traceroute.html|title=Traceroute at EMAF 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Osnabrück]], the ''[[Dutch Design Week]]'' 2016, the ''[[NRW-Forum]]'' 2016, ''Print Screen Festival'' 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printscreenfestival.com/#!traceroute/c6xy|title=Print Screen Festival|website=Print Screen Festival|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tel Aviv]], ''FrackFest'' 2016, ''Norwich Radical Film Festival'', the [[Chaos Communication Congress]] 2016, [[Guangzhou International Documentary Film Festival]] 2016) have screened the film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.monochrom.at/traceroute/ List of screenings on Traceroute's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Reviews of the film have been positive. Bradley Gibson of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gives Traceroute 10/10 points and writes: "Traceroute is the most fun I've ever had watching a documentary. If you're a nerd (and you are) this is the road trip you've always wanted to take with your smartest, geekiest friend. You're not going to want to come home. It's Cosmos. It's DragonCon on wheels. It's your favorite sex fantasy. It's alcohol soaked nonviolent subversive protest mobile and WiFi linked. It's ''On The Road'' updated with tech, science, pseudoscience, sex, and fandom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmthreat.com/reviews/traceroute|title=Traceroute – Film Threat|website=filmthreat.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mental Floss]]' Chris Higgins writes about Traceroute: "As many nerds have noticed, there's a glut of nerd-positive documentaries out there, but they tend to be either too self-serious, or too focused on the trappings of fandom to actually say much. Traceroute manages to be a real film, with humor and true insight (sometimes called out for us—and delightfully nullified—with a blinking 'INSIGHT' faux-HTML tag onscreen), primarily because it focuses on Grenzfurthner's personal journey, and he doesn't take himself too seriously. Let's put that another way: The director uses himself and a handful of subjects to create his story, and that specificity—coupled with his playfulness—makes it work. At one point he licks the chrome head of a Terminator prop. Then he licks a zombie head prop. Then he licks the propmaster himself. It's delightful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/79393/traceroute-documentary-about-nerds-and-annihilation|title=&lt;em&gt;Traceroute&lt;/em&gt;, A Documentary about Nerds and Annihilation|date=1 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop culture magazine [[Boing Boing]] calls Traceroute "a brilliantly careening biography of a highly enigmatic species. [...] Traceroute is radical individual empiricism, a narrative biographical puzzle and an experimental projection matrix. Despite continual stimulus satiation, it is wonderful fun: the film tickles the synapses with a perfectly mixed cocktail of collectively shared context and quirkiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html|title=The story of Traceroute, about a Leitnerd's quest|date=14 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Lichty of net culture magazine [[Furtherfield]] calls it "magical (...) After watching Traceroute, I was left with a real exhilaration and a deeply reflective feeling at once. (...) What Traceroute reveals is the tradition of alterity just beneath the surface of Western culture, and that it has a powerful effect on our mass consciousness, whether it is in plain sight or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/traceroute-%E2%80%93-personal-journey-uncharted-depths-nerd-culture|title=Patrick Lichty, Furtherfield; March 11, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felix Knoke of [[Engadget]] Germany writes: "For me it is the best nerd documentary I've seen so far. Simply for the fact that it doesn't take itself as deadly serious as the other ones. (...) Traceroute deserves high praise because it represents an old-school definition of nerd culture, one that is never compatible with fintech, unicorn and iGod."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.engadget.com/2016/03/23/traceroute-nerd-doku-kommt-nach-deutschland/|title=Traceroute: Nerd-Doku kommt nach Deutschland|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop culture critic Thomas Kaestle comments: "Traceroute is game, challenge, encyclopedia, and sentimental journey all in one. As a documentary it is most skillfully composed. And as a narration it is highly compatible. This film will, in passing, sweep proclaimed nerds off their feet. And it will touch the hearts of those who still need some explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zebrabutter.net/traceroute-unterwegs-mit-dem-leitnerd.html|title=Thomas Kaestle on Zebrabutter, January 13, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diamond in the Rough Films'' praises Grenzfurthner's hosting and storytelling: "This doc works in some very unconventional ways, not the least of which is our plucky protagonist. Grenzfurthner is an absolute charmer as our host and his narration is note-perfect (the accent is so cool in that Werner Herzog kind of way). It's really rare in a documentary about a not-that-famous person where you become almost instantly won-over and invested in their personal journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditrfilms.com/#!traceroute/hvlta|title=ditrfilms|website=ditrfilms|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogger and sci-fiction author [[Cory Doctorow]] states about Traceroute that "Johannes is a brilliant lunatic of surpassing and delightful weirdness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/ondemand/traceroute|title=Watch Traceroute Online - Vimeo On Demand|first=|last=monochrom|date=27 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2018|via=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt; MicroFilmmaker Magazine writes: "The different people Grenzfurthner chatted with were genuinely interesting and the organic way he moved from place to place was intriguing. [...] You'll find that you've learned an awful lot about technology, nerdiness, and America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microfilmmaker.com/2016/04/traceroute_ssr/|title=Traceroute (Straight Shooter Film Review) - MicroFilmmaker Magazine|website=www.microfilmmaker.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Propes (The Independent Critic) writes: "It's challenging. It's thought-provoking. It's remarkably honest. It's well researched. [...] If you're expecting nothing more than your usual nerd doc with its cosplay cuteness and asocial gamers, you're going to be not just disappointed but probably traumatized. Grenzfurthner is clearly full-on willing to challenge culture, stereotypes, accepted thoughts and just about everything else. There's a healthy dose of sexuality in Traceroute, which one might expect, yet Grenzfurthner also immerses the film in politics, activism and social shifts. [...] Refreshingly devoid of the pretentiousness so often found amongst truly intellectual films, Traceroute is simultaneously a pretty wonderful personal journey and an immensely satisfying cinematic experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theindependentcritic.com/traceroute|title=The Independent Critic - "Traceroute" Set for World Premiere on April 28th at NYC Independent Film Festival|website=theindependentcritic.com|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vacuum Flowers''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by [[Michael Swanwick]], which was published in 1987.  It is an early example of the [[cyberpunk]] genre, and features one of the earliest uses of the concept [[wetware (brain)|wetware]].

The protagonist of the novel is Rebel Elizabeth Mudlark, the recorded personality of a dead woman which has become the property of a corporation that intends to sell it as entertainment. Rebel escapes by taking over the body of Eucrasia Walsh, a woman who rents herself out for temporary testing of new wetware programming. While escaping the corporation Eucrasia's latent personality is beginning to reassert itself.

Rebel's adventures take her throughout the widely colonised [[solar system]].  She initially lives in canister worlds orbiting the Sun in a [[Trojan asteroid|trojan orbit]], where she sometimes works removing bioengineered weeds (''vacuum flowers'', the space-tolerant flora of the title) from the canisters' exterior ports.  Since the recording omits most of her memories, she must rely on strangers to help her survive, though she cannot trust any of them. Rebel meets and falls in love with Wyeth, a leader whose personality was reprogrammed into a team of four complementary personas.  Together they form an uneasy alliance with The Comprise, the [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] which rules [[Earth]], and encounter Dysonworlders, who live on [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] artificial [[comet]]s ([[Dyson tree]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16758">A '''verse novel''' is a type of [[narrative poetry]] in which a [[novel]]-length narrative is told through the medium of [[poetry]] rather than [[prose]]. Either simple or complex [[stanza]]ic verse-forms may be used, but there will usually be a large cast, multiple voices, dialogue, narration, description, and action in a novelistic manner.

== History ==

Verse narratives are as old as the ''Epic of [[Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Iliad]]'', and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', but the verse novel is a distinct modern form. Although the narrative structure is similar to that of a [[novella]], the organisation of the story is usually in a series of short sections, often with changing perspectives. Verse novels are often told with [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]], potentially providing readers with a cinematic view into the inner workings of the characters' minds. Some verse novels, following [[Byron]]'s [[mock-heroic]] ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24) employ an informal, colloquial register. ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' (1831) by [[Alexander Pushkin]] is a classical example, and with ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'' (1834) by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] is often taken as the seminal example of the modern genre.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the basic categorical issues see ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), ''s.v.'' 'Narrative Poetry'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major nineteenth-century verse novels that ground the form in Anglophone letters include ''[[The Bothie of Toper-na-fuisich]]'' (1848) and ''[[Amours de Voyage]]'' (1858) by [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1857) by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], ''[[Lucile (poem)|Lucile]]'' (1860) by 'Owen Meredith' ([[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Robert Bulwer-Lytton]]), and ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' (1868-9) by [[Robert Browning]]. The form appears to have declined with [[Modernism]], but has since the 1960s-70s undergone a remarkable revival. [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (1962) takes the form of a 999-line [[poem]] four [[canto]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, though the plot of the novel unfolds in the commentary. Of particular note, [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986) was a surprise bestseller, and [[Derek Walcott]]'s ''[[Omeros]]'' (1990) a more predictable success.&lt;ref&gt;The upturn is noted in J. A. Cuddon, ed., ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory'' (4th ed., rev. C. E. Preston, Oxford &amp; malden, MA: Blackwells, 1998; Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1999), ''s.v.'' 'verse-novel'.&lt;/ref&gt; The form has been particularly popular in the [[Caribbean]], with work since 1980 by Walcott, [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]], [[David Dabydeen]], [[Kwame Dawes]], [[Ralph Thompson (poet)|Ralph Thompson]], [[George Elliott Clarke]] and [[Fred D'Aguiar]], and in Australia and New Zealand, with work since 1990 by [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]], [[John Tranter]], [[Dorothy Porter]], [[Lisa Jacobson]], [[Chris Orsman]], [[David Foster (novelist)|David Foster]], [[Alistair Te Ariki Campbell]], and [[Robert Sullivan (New Zealand poet)|Robert Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;These geographical clusters are noted and discussed in the editorial introduction to [[Ralph Thompson (poet)|Ralph Thompson]], ''[[View from Mount Diablo]], An Annotated Edition'' (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, &amp; Tirril: Humanities-Ebooks, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Australian poet-author Alan Wearne's ''Night Markets'', and sequels, are major verse novels of urban social life and satire.

The Australian poet, C.J. Dennis, had great success in Australia during World War I with his verse novels, ''The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke'' (1915), and ''The Moods of Ginger Mick'' (1916). The first tells of an urban ruffian with a heart of gold who marries and becomes a father and a farmer in Melbourne, Australia, shortly before the start of World War I in 1914. The second is the story of another urban ruffian, and good friend of The Bloke, who enlists in the Australian Army, and dies in the early battles at Gallipoli in 1915.

The American author, poet, dramatist, screenwriter and suffragist and feminist, [[Alice Duer Miller]] published her verse novel, ''Forsaking All Others'' (1935), about a tragic love affair, and had a surprising hit with her verse novel, ''The White Cliffs'' (1940: later dramatised and filmed, but retaining and expanding the poems as voice-over narration, as ''The White Cliffs of Dover'' (1944). This told the story of a young American woman who goes to England in mid-1914, for a fortnight, falls in love with an American aristocrat, and marries him: he is killed in the last days of the First World War in 1918, and when World War II breaks out in 1939, she must decide whether or not to let her son join the army to fight for England. The story helped sway American sentiment towards helping the British, and was a best-seller! Miller’s poem-chapters were mainly traditional couplets, quatrains, and sonnets. They used several different voices, as well as letters from different characters.

The parallel history of the [[verse autobiography]], from strong Victorian foundation with [[Wordsworth]]'s ''The Prelude'' (1805, 1850), to decline with Modernism and later twentieth-century revival with [[John Betjeman]]'s ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'' (1960), Walcott's ''Another Life'' (1973), and [[James Merrill]]'s ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (1982), is also striking. The forms are distinct, but many verse novels plainly deploy autobiographical elements, and the recent [[Commonwealth]] examples almost all offer detailed representation of the (problems besetting) post-imperial and post-colonial identity, and so are inevitably strongly personal works.

There is also a distinct cluster of verse novels for younger readers, most notably [[Karen Hesse]]'s ''[[Out of the Dust]]'' (1997), which won a [[Newbery Medal]]. Hesse followed it with ''[[Witness]]'' (2001). Since then, many new titles have cropped up, with authors [[Sonya Sones]], [[Ellen Hopkins]], [[Steven Herrick]], [[Margaret Wild]], [[Nikki Grimes]], [[Virginia Euwer Wolff]], [[Ann Warren Turner]], [[Lorie Ann Grover]], [[Brenda Seabrooke]], [[Paul B. Janeczko]], and [[Mel Glenn]] all publishing multiple titles. Debut YA authors, Holly Thompson, Cathy Ostlere, Sarah Tregay, and others have added new titles to the shelves in 2011. [[Thanhha Lai]]'s ''[[Inside Out &amp; Back Again]]'' (2011) won the [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature|National Book Award]].

== Versification ==

Long classical verse narratives were in [[stichic]] forms, prescribing a metre but not specifying any interlineal relations. This tradition is represented in English letters by the use of [[blank verse]] (unrhymed [[iambic pentameter]]), as by both Brownings and many later poets. But since [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]] complex stanza forms have also been used for verse narratives, including ''[[terza rima]]'' (ABA BCB CDC etc.) and ''[[ottava rima]]'' (ABABABCC), and modern poets have experimented widely with adaptations and combinations of stanza-forms.

The stanza most specifically associated with the verse novel is the [[Onegin stanza]], invented by [[Pushkin]] in ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''. It is an adapted form of the [[Shakespearean sonnet]], retaining the three quatrains plus couplet structure but reducing the metre to [[iambic tetrameter]] and specifying a distinct [[rhyme scheme]]: the first quatrain is cross-rhymed (ABAB), the second couplet-rhymed (''CCDD''), and the third arch-rhymed (or chiasmic, EFFE), so that the whole is ABABCCDDEFFEGG.&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussion of the Onegin stanza see the introduction in ''Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse by Aleksandr Pushkin. Translated from the Russian, with a Commentary'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]] (rev. ed., in 4 vols, London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1975), especially i.10 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Pushkin required that the first rhyme in each couplet (the A, C, and E rhymes) be unstressed (or "feminine"), and all others stressed (or "masculine"). In the [[rhyme scheme]] notation capitalizing masculine rhymes, this reads as {{not a typo|aBaBccDDeFeFGG}}}}. Not all those using the Onegin stanza have followed the prescription, but Vikram Seth notably did so, and the [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] of the unstressed rhymes is an important factor in his manipulations of tone.
