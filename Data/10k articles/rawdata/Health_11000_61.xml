      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9068">The '''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System''' is used for the [[drug class|classification]] of [[Medication|active ingredient]]s of [[drug]]s according to the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[system]] on which they act and their [[therapeutic]], [[pharmacological]] and chemical properties. It is controlled by the [[World Health Organization]] Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC), and was first published in 1976.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_methodology/history/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC/DDD Methodology: History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Pharmaceutical code|pharmaceutical coding system]] divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act, their [[medicine|therapeutic]] intent or nature, and the drug's [[chemical classification|chemical characteristics]]. Different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code, for example [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin) has {{ATC|A01|AD05}} as a drug for local [[mouth|oral]] treatment, {{ATC|B01|AC06}} as a [[platelet inhibitor]], and {{ATC|N02|BA01}} as an [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]]); as well as one code can represent more than one active ingredient, for example {{ATC|C09|BB04}} is the combination of perindopril with amlodipine, two active ingredients that have their own codes ({{ATC|C09|AA04}} and {{ATC|C08|CA01}} respectively) when prescribed alone.

The ATC classification system is a strict hierarchy, meaning that each code necessarily has one and only one parent code, except for the 14 codes at the topmost level which have no parents. The codes are semantic identifiers, meaning they depict in themselves the complete lineage of parenthood.

== History ==
The ATC system is based on the earlier Anatomical Classification System, which is intended as a tool for the pharmaceutical industry to classify pharmaceutical products (as opposed to their active ingredients).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ephmra.org/user_uploads/who-atc%202013%20final.pdf|title=Comparison of the WHO ATC Classification &amp; EphMRA/PBIRG Anatomical Classification|publisher=EphMRA|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, confusingly also called ATC, was initiated in 1971 by the [[European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association]] (EphMRA) and is being maintained by the EphMRA and the [[Pharmaceutical Business Intelligence and Research Group]] (PBIRG). Its codes are organised into four levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ephmra.org/user_uploads/atcguidelines2016final.pdf|title=EphMRA Anatomical Classification Guidelines 2016|publisher=EphMRA|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's system, having five levels, is an extension and modification of the EphMRA's. It was first published in 1976.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Classification ==
In this system, drugs are classified into groups at five different levels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC: Structure and principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First level ===
The first level of the code indicates the anatomical main group and consists of one letter. There are 14 main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC/DDD Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example'': [[ATC code C|'''C''']] [[Cardiovascular system]]

=== Second level ===
The second level of the code indicates the therapeutic subgroup and consists of two digits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sdrugs.com/?c=atc&amp;n=0 the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example'': [[ATC code C03|C'''03''']] [[Diuretic]]s

=== Third level ===
The third level of the code indicates the therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

''Example'': C03'''C''' High-ceiling diuretics

=== Fourth level ===
The fourth level of the code indicates the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

''Example'': C03C'''A''' [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamide]]s

=== Fifth level ===
The fifth level of the code indicates the chemical substance and consists of two digits.

''Example'': C03CA'''01''' [[furosemide]]

=== ATCvet ===
The ''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System for veterinary medicinal products'' (ATCvet) is used to classify [[veterinary]] drugs. ATCvet codes can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the ATC code of most human medications. For example, furosemide for veterinary use has the code '''Q'''C03CA01.

Some codes are used exclusively for veterinary drugs, such as ''[[ATCvet code QI|QI]] Immunologicals'', ''[[ATCvet code QJ51|QJ51]] Antibacterials for intramammary use'' or ''QN05AX90 [[amperozide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atcvet/atcvet/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATCvet|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defined daily dose ==
{{main|Defined daily dose}}
The ATC system also includes defined daily doses (DDDs) for many drugs. This is a measurement of drug consumption based on the usual daily dose for a given drug. According to the definition, "[t]he DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=DDD: Definition and general considerations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and updates==
National issues of the ATC classification, such as the [[Germany|German]] ''Anatomisch-therapeutisch-chemische Klassifikation mit Tagesdosen'', may include additional codes and DDDs not present in the WHO version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimdi.de/static/de/klassi/atcddd/atc-gesetze.htm|publisher=Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information|title=ATC-Klassifikation mit DDD: Gesetzlicher Hintergrund|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATC follows guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for ATC classification and DDD assignment|date=2014-12-16|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_publications/guidelines/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806013259/http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_publications/guidelines/|archivedate=2015-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in creating new codes for newly approved drugs. In order to create a new ATC code, an application has to be sent to the WHO. New ATC codes are published twice annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New ATC|date=2015-04-29|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc/lists_of_new_atc_ddds_and_altera/new_atc/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal release of new ATC edition occurs once a year.

'''Ancient diet''' is mainly determined by food's accessibility which involves location, geography and climate while '''ancient health''' is affected by food consumption apart from external factors such as [[disease]]s and [[plague (disease)|plague]]s. There are still a lot of doubt about this ancient [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] due to lack of evidence. Similar to what anthropologist Amanda Henry has said, there are a lot of time periods in the human history but there are only theories to answer questions on what people actually ate then. Only recently have traces been discovered in what was left of these people.&lt;ref name = "gorski"&gt;Gorski, C. (2012, May 31). Retrieved May 9, 2015, from Fox News: http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/05/31/ten-thousand-year-old-tartar-holds-clues-to-human-diets/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient diet==

===Methods used in determining ancient diet===
#'''Paleofeces'''&lt;br&gt;These are ancient human feces found in archaeological [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] that help identify the food, diet and nutrition of the ancient people. Though it may not sound sanitary, the dried coprolite itself, a term used interchangeably, has no particular smell. There is a high quantity of paleofeces because everyone does it and they do it anywhere. Not only does it give the [[DNA]] of a single organism, but also the DNA of everything it ate. The study of paleofeces has actually helped eliminate the belief that ancient people subsidized on foraged berries. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, A. (2012, February 9). Retrieved May 9, 2015, from io9 We Come From The Future: http://io9.com/5883873/paleofeces-inside-the-archaeology-of-poop&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Tartar'''&lt;br&gt;This is a hard substance that builds up on human teeth after dental plague solidifies. Because ancient teeth still hold onto tiny pieces of food and bacteria, the study of tartar can help reveal what people ate and information on an individual’s health. Researchers and scientists use molecular methods and the microscope to examine the samples&lt;ref name = "gorski"/&gt;

===Factors that affect diet===
#'''Geography'''&lt;br&gt;This is considered one of the most important factors that play a huge role in determining what people eat, as it dictates what they are able to access. The Philippines, being an archipelago, is surrounded by different bodies of water making seafood one of the main dishes in Filipino diet. There is also a great variety of land animals such as the water buffalo (carabao) and pigs that were consumed due to the Philippine landscape. Vegetation and planting was also possible due to rich tropical soils present.
#'''Climate/temperature'''&lt;br&gt; In the Philippines, even though temperature differences are minimal, it still produces significant differences. These include vegetational differences and difference in forest species distribution as well as some properties of wood.Vegatational differences involve tropical plants that tend to grow in lower altitudes and plants mostly found in middle latitudes that grown in high altitudes such as Baguio.&lt;ref name = "werns"&gt;Wernstedt, F. L., &amp; Spencer, J. (1967). The Philippine Island World: A Physical, Cultural and Regional Geography. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Precipitation'''&lt;br&gt;The quantity and seasonality of rainfall greatly affects the distributional patterns of the natural vegetation often determining the kind of landscape as well as the species that will be present. In the Philippines, water availability also affects the selection of crops to be planted, for example, rice versus corn. Tropical soils are also greatly affected by differences in the availability of moisture.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;

===Food sources===

====Flora====
:Five crop plants form the bases for agricultural patterns in the Philippines. This includes rice, corn, yams and sweet potatoes, banana and coconut. Rice and banana are almost always present in the agricultural landscape and agricultural combinations include one or both crops. As food staples, three crops dominate - rice, corn, and yam-sweet potato group. Other crops are considered as complements, snack foods or seasonal.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Rice'''&lt;br&gt;Referred to as palay, it is considered the traditional staple food in the Philippines it being consumed by about three-fourths of the population. It is the primary crop on most of the Philippine farms and is grown on more farms than any other single crop because rice has few environmental restrictions. Temperatures are suitable everywhere except in the highest mountain country. In other places, restrictions are negated due to provision of irrigation or planting during the rainy season. Because of its favorable conditions, Central Luzon is the largest regional producer while Mindanao is the source of the largest surpluses.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Corn'''&lt;br&gt;Known locally as mais, corn was first introduced in Visayas during the sixteenth century and eventually spread to other parts of the Philippines. Because of its adaptability and affordability, it has been considered a common replacement for rice and has been steadily rising in importance as a Philippine crop and food staple. Corn can be grown almost everywhere in the Philippines even on drier soils and is being planted somewhere year-round. There are many varieties of corn grown but flint corns are the most common because of better adaptation in the making of "corn rice”. Though planting of corn is abundant, it suffers from a wide range of diseases and pests in the Philippine environment. It is in Southern Mindanao, Northeast Luzon and the Visayan islands of Cebu, Bohol, Leyte and Negros where corn is the dominant food crop.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Root Crops'''&lt;br&gt;Probably the oldest group of food crops in the Philippines, root crops includes yams, taros, sweet potato and manioc. Although rice has already replaced yams and taros as the preferred root crop, it still remains as the dominant food in some regions and has assumed complementary roles in others. The coming of the Spaniards also brought sweet potato, manioc and peanuts in the country. Sweet potato, commonly known as camote, has replaced yams in regions that still considered it as their staple food. Manioc also known as cassava, on the other hand, became a complementary crop. Peanut also became a complementary crop and became widely distributed but not commonly grown. These root crops have been considered as the staple food for the poor, thrifty or hard-time crop. The sweet potato, yam and manioc are widely grown in hill countries of Leyte and Sorsogon Peninsula of Southern Luzon.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Vegetable Crops'''&lt;br&gt;This kind of crop did not gain popularity unlike the first three because the shifting-cultivation background employed gathering of wild products as a complementary aspect of the dietary economy. Kitchen gardens mostly contained herbs and vines while seasoning has not been significant to native Filipino cookery, however this is up to debate as trading with Asian neighbors such India and Indonesia may have introduced certain spices to the Filipino diet especially in areas such as Mindanao, which was most likely lost due to Spanish colonization. Much of the practice were introduced by the Spaniards, Chinese or Americans. Some of the most popular vegetables planted are eggplant, taro (gabi), squash, mung bean, ampalaya and patola.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt; However archaeological evidence of charred vegetable matter on porcelain plates is possible evidence of wide of vegetables in the Filipino diet. 
#'''Fruit and Nut Crops'''&lt;br&gt;This group is composed of native plants that are found growing in wild areas and non-native plants that have been repeatedly introduced over time. The fruits and nuts sector hasn't been a dominant presence as a food staple but instead it has been considered a complement. Though coconut has been considered a commercial crop due to its wide variety of uses, it is still only a complementary or specialty itemjust as the other crops in this category. Some of the most popular fruits include banana, jackfruit, papaya and mango.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Beverage Crops'''&lt;br&gt;The closest thing the Philippines has to a traditional national drink is tuba. The tuba is made by collecting milk from green to ripe coconuts and slightly fermenting the coconut sap and variably dying it with mangrove bark but this has to be made daily and consumed immediately. Tuba can also be made from the sap of the buri palm or from the sap of the nipa palm. Coffee and cacao have also been introduced by the Spaniards and although both plants spread widely and Philippine conditions are suitable for it but neither caught on sufficiently to be promoted as a strong agricultural product.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;

====Fauna====
::Poultry and fish are the main sources of meat in the Philippines. Pigs, chicken and water buffalos (carabao) are not only of importance to the Philippine rice economy but are also consumed by many Filipinos. But because the Philippines is located in the Indo-Pacific realm, the greatest center of fish life, the country is one that shares in this rich aquatic resource with a total of more than 21,000 species of fishes known to frequent its waters.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Livestock and Poultry'''&lt;br&gt;Pigs, chicken, goats, deer water buffaloes and others dominate food consumption but there has also been the presence of ducks and geese as these are also present in southeast Asian mainland and therefore also the Philippines. Foreign influences later appeared as the country was colonized by different colonizers. The Spaniards added mutton to the traditional rice-fish-pork-chicken-beef dietary and the American further strengthened this influence so that lamb or mutton consumption increased steadily. Eggs also became a minor food supply to the dietary such as one local delicacy, the balut, which is an almost-hatched duck eggs cooked in boiling water in the shell.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;
#'''Fish and Other Seafoods'''&lt;br&gt;The traditional and basic Filipino diet is rice and fish. Fish and fish products supply the bulk of the protein consumed and fish appears daily for more the one-half of the Filipinos. As the Philippines is surrounded by waters, almost every family did fishing regularly or seasonally. Some usual fishes found in Philippine waters include dilis or anchovies that are abundant in the Visayan Sea, Sulu Sea, Samar Sea and waters of north Palawan and usually dried or processed to make bagoong, sardines or tamban that are numerous in Sulu and Visayan Seas and are cured, dried or salted to make tinapa, and dalagangbukid that are generally caught over the coral reefs in Sulu or Palawan waters and is later prepared as daing. Crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs are also abundant in Philippine coastal waters.

Due to geographic conditions in the Philippines, native fish are preserved to combat rapid spoilage which includes preservation by drying, salting and smoking. In drying, large fishes are usually used to make daing while smaller fishes are used to make cuyo. Salting and wet-salting is a popular practice in areas that are relatively remote from large markets due to seasonality of fishing season. While smoking fish or the process of making tinapa is done by brining, cooking and smoking that is usually done in places surrounding Manila Bay such as Bataan and Rizal.&lt;ref name = "werns"/&gt;

===Some ethnolinguistic groups and their diet===
#'''Bontoks'''&lt;br&gt;Rice is considered as the main produce of the Bontoks but during the dry periods from February to March when rain is scarce, they usually consume camote, corn and millet as alternative for rice. They also catch and gather fish, snails and crabs for consumption or for sale. In the earlier days, Bontok men usually brought tobacco and matches when hunting for wild deer and wild pigs. In the forests, they also gather rattan, edible fruits, beeswax and honey, and wild edible or ornamental plants.&lt;ref name = "ethno"&gt;Ethnography of the Major Ethnolinguistic Groups in the Cordillera. (2005). Quezon City, Philippines: Cordillera Schools Group, Inc. and New Day Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Ibaloys'''&lt;br&gt;Because of fertile soils and climate of Benguet, the Ibaloys are predominantly farmers. There are two varieties of rice. These are the kintoman and talon. The kintoman is the red variety of rice that is long grained, tastier and comes in various forms; the balatin-naw which is soft and sticky when cooked, the shaya-ut which is also soft, and the putaw which is slightly rough on the palate when eaten. This variety of rice is also used to make the native rice wine called tafey. The second variety of rice, the talon, on the other hand, is the whitelowland type that is planted during the rainy season. Ibaloys also plant root crops like camote, gabi, cassava and potatoes. Vegetation includes cabbage, celery and pechay. There are also several kinds of mushrooms wildly in addition to fruits like avocados, bananas and mangoes grown in many areas. Meat consumed includes pigs, cows, goats and chickens as well as wild deer (olsa), wild pigs (alimanok) and big lizard (tilay). Lastly, the Ibaloys consume fish from the few rivers in their area.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
#'''Ikalahans'''&lt;br&gt;Similar with the Ibaloys, the Ikalahans plant and consume this variety of rice in limited areas. Camote, gabi, beans, bananas, ginger and other fruit trees are also planted. Animals consumed include wild pigs, deer, birds, wild chickens and fishes. Domesticated pigs was not only used for consumption but also as a symbol of wealth while domesticated chicken are used as a source of food during childbirth or illness but is not a part of the regular diet.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
#'''Ifugaos'''&lt;br&gt;The basic meal of the Ifugaos is composed of a staple starch, more commonly rice as it is their staple food, served with dishes like vegetables, fish or snails, flavorings, and sometimes, cooked animal meat like chicken and pig. During low levels of rice, ifugaos consume grain or root crops like sweet potatoes. Fresh berries and other plant products and plants are served as snacks. Rice wine is a must in most rituals and special occasions with homemade yeast and glutinous rice as the basic ingredients.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
#'''Isnegs'''&lt;br&gt;The isnegs traditionally only consume two meals a day; one in the mid-morning and one in the late afternoon, or one at noon and the other in the evening. Though most of their meals include rice, rice is always scarce because of the limited womanpower. Hence, they resort to trade to satisfy demands. Meals also include vegetables and root crops such as camote and occasionally, fish and wild pig or wild deer. Dogs, pigs and chickens are only eaten during feasts and chicken eggs are seldom eaten because they are generally allowed to hatch. Sometimes, before or after meals, the typical isneg families enjoy home-grown coffee while gathering around the hearth while rice wine is only consumed during festive occasions.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
#'''Kalingas'''&lt;br&gt;Due to the availability of water, two planting seasons are possible in the kalingas rice terraces. They plant three varieties of rice namely onoy, oyakand dikit/diket. Men also hunt for wild pigs, deer and wild fowl in the forests. Fish, shells and other marine life are caught from rivers, streams and lakes surrounding their area. Fruit trees such as the coconut, coffee and banana are grown in the orchard or kakkaju. Wine (basi) is also made from sugarcane.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
#'''Kankana-eys'''
##'''Northern'''&lt;br&gt;Wet rice agriculture is their main economic activity with some fields toiled twice a year while other only once due to too much water or no water at all. There are two varieties of rice called topeng which are planted in June and July and harvested in November and December, and ginolot which are planted in November and December and harvested in June and July. Northern kankana-eys also farm camote. Camote delicacies include (1) makimpit which are dried camotes, (2) boko which are camote sliced into thin pieces that could be steamed (sinalopsop) or cooked as in and sweetened with sugar (inab-abos-sang). These are good substitutes for rice that could be sliced into thin pieces and added to rice before cooking (kineykey) mixing the sweetness when the rice cooks. Squash, cucumber and other climbing vines are also planted. They also hunt and fish small fishes and eel which is a special delicacy when cooked. Crabs are also caught to make tengba, a gravy of pounded rice mixed with crabs, salted and placed in jars to age. This is common viand of every household and is eaten during childbirth.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
##'''Southern'''&lt;br&gt;Although southern kankana-eys also engage in wet rice agriculture, the chief mains of livelihood is hunting and foraging. Wild animal meat such as deer, boar, civet cats and lizards are salted and dried under the sun to preserve it. Wild roots, honey and fruits are also gathered to supplement diet. Just like their northern counterpart, there are also two varieties of rice namely kintomanand saranayor bayag. The kintoman, just as mentioned earlier, is more popularly known as red rice due to its color. On the other hand, saranay is whitish and small grained. The usual types of fish caught are eel (dagitor igat) and small river fishes as well as crabs and other crustaceans. Pigs, chickens, dogs and cattle are domesticated as additional sources of food. Dog meat is considered as a delicacy and pigs and chickens are used mainly for ceremonial activities.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;
#'''Tingguians/Itnegs'''&lt;br&gt;Just like in most parts of the Philippines, rice is extensively grown in the province. There are two types of practices for rice cultivation namely wet-rice cultivation and swidden/kaingin. Corn is also planted as a major subsistence and as a replacement for rice. Other products consumed are camote, yams, coconut, mango, banana and vegetables. Sugarcane is planted to make wine usually consumed during traditional rituals and ceremonies. Pigs and chickens are consumed for food or for religious rituals while carabaos are killed during large celebrations. Hunting wild animals and fishing is also prevalent. Eel and other freshwater fish such as paleleng and ladgo(lobster) are caught to make viands for most families.&lt;ref name = "ethno"/&gt;

==Ancient health==

===Methods used in determining ancient health===
:Ancient people, especially Filipinos, don’t have formal professional doctors. There are only men in each group or tribe who have knowledge of healing herbs and practices. These men are the so-called healers or curers of the group who will respected until they lose the reputation. These healers, who are also called albularyo today, know unique methods of determining the condition of his/her patients. Hilot and tawas are some of the ancient practices used to identify the health of certain individuals. No mineral medicines are used. They highly depend on the herbs, bark and roof of trees, leaves of plants and vegetables for their medicine. Ancient Filipinos also believe that their health is greatly affected or influenced by the spirits and natural forces around them. They make no attempt to explain or justify their “theories of disease” in a systematic and logical manner. They also believe that skin diseases are brought upon by a ‘theory’ of attachment to the body or sometimes, inherited from past ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Garvan, J. The Negritos of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diseases===
:Ancient Filipinos did not believe that their diet and eating habits affect their health. They believed that allergies, food sensitivities and other diseases that may be seen outside of the body are effects of spirits’ actions. Diseases that don’t have “outside of the body symptoms” like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease were ignored. They only believed that their diet can affect their teeth. To avoid tooth decay, they chewed betel nut or tobacco because they believe that these kill the “worms” that were brought by drinking water or eating food.&lt;ref&gt;Noval-Morales, D., &amp; Monan, J. A Primer on the Negritos of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are some of the foods consumed and the diseases they cause.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Diseases !! Food that causes it

[[File:Kimberly-Clark automatic toilet paper dispenser.JPG|thumb|250px|right|An automatic toilet paper dispenser by [[Kimberly-Clark]], January 2008]]
An '''automatic toilet paper dispenser''' is a [[toilet roll holder]] that can be either button or sensor-activated to fold and cut the toilet paper automatically.

==Advantages==
The automatic toilet-paper dispenser can help aid disabled users, especially in large facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanlink.com/cp/article/Touchless-Toilet-Paper-Dispensers-Aid-Disabled-Users--15729|title=Touchless Toilet Paper Dispensers Aid Disabled Users|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturers==
{{advert|date=November 2016}}
===Camitool by Shikoku===
The Camitool by the Japanese company Shikoku uses motion sensor to dispense the toilet paper, so users do not have to touch the machine. It also cuts paper into 60, 90, or 120 cm portions and can be used with almost any brand of toilet paper. The dispenser comes in plastic as well as wood versions which cost roughly $750 and $1,200 respectively. It was released in 2012 and is currently being used by hospitals, and in public buildings in [[Kagawa Prefecture|Kagawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/750-hands-free-toilet-paper-dispenser-saves-resources-prevents-infection-video-335570|title=$750 Hands-Free Toilet Paper Dispenser Saves Resources, Prevents Infection [VIDEO]|date=23 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCOTT Coreless Bathroom Tissue by Kimberly-Clark===
The SCOTT by Kimberly-Clark is activated when the user waves his hand under a sensor on the machine or by pushing and turning a knob on the front of the dispenser. A given amount of toilet paper with a programmable sheet length — 16", 20" and 24" - is rolled out through the dispenser. K-C claims a 20% reduction in the amount of toilet paper by using the SCOTT. It was released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/2007-07-11-kimberlyclark-toiletpaper_N.htm|title=Final frontier of toilet tissue unveiled - USATODAY.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TPer===
The TPer is a prototype of an automatic toilet-paper dispenser. It works by spinning up an appropriate amount of folded paper before slicing it free. It was created in order to aid disabled and elderly users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/05/09/automatic-toilet-paper-dispenser-doles-out-neater-wads/|title=Automatic toilet paper dispenser doles out neater wads|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eadan===
The Eadan brand by Hangzhou Golden Key Science and Technology Co., Ltd includes the functions of infrared induction, automatic paper feeding and automatic cutting. It comes with LCD display screen for information on time, paper quantity regulation and working state. It can be operated by using either batteries or DC power input.

===OriFuji===
The OriFuji automatically cuts the toilet papers and folds them into a neat triangle shape. This makes it easier for the next person to pull and roll out the paper. A total of 10 companies in Japan put their combined energies into the creation of the new automated paper cutting and folding machine. The concept initially came about as a way to express the Japanese culture of omotenashi (hospitality), as to greet and welcome foreigners with heartwarming service in restrooms ahead of the [[2020 Tokyo Olympics]]. It was first introduced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laughingsquid.com/the-orifuji-toilet-paper-dispenser-automatically-folds-the-end-of-the-paper-into-a-triangle-with-each-pull/|title=The OriFuji Toilet Paper Dispenser Automatically Folds the End of the Paper Into a Triangle With Each Pull|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Useless Duck Company's "useless toilet paper machine" is a parody of automatic toilet paper dispensers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/no-one-will-ever-make-a-better-toilet-paper-self-dispen-1667179095|title=No One Will Ever Make a Better Toilet Paper Self-Dispenser Than This|first=Andrew|last=Liszewski|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court ruled on the admissibility of clinical opinions given by two [[psychiatrist]]s hired by the [[prosecution]] in answer to [[hypothetical question]]s regarding the defendant's future dangerousness and the likelihood that he would present a continuing threat to society in this [[Texas]] [[death penalty]] case. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] submitted an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief in support of the defendant's position that such testimony should be inadmissible and urging curtailment of psychiatric testimony regarding future dangerousness and a prohibition of such testimony based on hypothetical data.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;{{cite web

}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Estelle v. Smith]]'', 451 U.S. 454 (1981), the Supreme Court previously ruled on a Texas death penalty case regarding the use of a psychiatric examination to determine the defendant's [[competency evaluation (law)|competency to stand trial]] to predict future dangerousness.  In that case the Court held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s privilege against self-incrimination applied to pretrial psychiatric examinations by a prosecution psychiatrist who later testified regarding the defendant's future dangerousness without warning the defendant that such evidence could be used against him. The Court reasoned that although a defendant has no generalized constitutional right to remain silent at a psychiatric examination limited to the issues of sanity or competency, full [[Miranda warning]]s must be given with respect to testimony concerning future dangerousness.&lt;ref name=apa/&gt;

== Background ==
Thomas Barefoot (February 23, 1945 - October 30, 1984) was convicted of the [[murder]] of a [[police officer]]. The same Texas jury determined, in the sentencing phase of the trial, whether Barefoot should receive the [[death penalty]].

The Texas death-penalty statute required that the jury consider whether Barefoot would pose "future dangerousness".&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, the statute required that the jury determine whether the defendant would pose "a continuing threat to society".  By law, "society" includes within the prison system; thus, a defendant who could pose a risk to prison staff or other inmates would be eligible for the death penalty.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with other evidence, the prosecution called two psychiatrists who, answering hypothetical questions, testified that Barefoot was likely to remain a danger to society. Neither psychiatrist had examined Barefoot nor asked to do so, but each summarized their professional experience as equipping them to answer the questions accurately. One psychiatrist called Barefoot a "[[criminal sociopath]]" and said there was no treatment for this condition and that Barefoot was likely to commit acts of violence in the future. The other psychiatrist testified that Barefoot had "a fairly classical, typical, sociopathic personality disorder." He placed Barefoot in the "most severe category" of [[sociopaths]], and on a scale of one to ten, Barefoot was "above ten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Barefoot v. Estelle 
 |publisher=Harvard.edu 
 |accessdate=2008-01-25 
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The jury considered this as well as other evidence and imposed the death penalty.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

The Court ignored amicus briefs arguing that psychiatric evidence cannot be offered on such issues with any reasonable degree of certainty.&lt;ref name=apa/&gt;

=== Appeals ===
Barefoot appealed to the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] which rejected his argument that this use of psychiatric testimony during the sentencing phase of his trial was unconstitutional and upheld the conviction and sentence. After denials of a [[writ]] of [[certiorari]] and of [[habeas corpus]], petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court raising the same objections to the use of psychiatric testimony. Although the District Court rejected his claims and denied the writ, it did issue a certificate of [[probable cause]]. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied a second writ of habeas corpus and denied a stay of execution. The Court of Appeals also denied a stay of execution.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

The Supreme Court granted certiorari.

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Supreme Court upheld the denial of a stay of execution by the Court of Appeals, saying that the Court of Appeals followed the procedural guidelines for handling such applications for stays of execution on habeas corpus appeals pursuant to a certificate of probable cause. The Court also upheld the appellate court's finding on the merits of the case, reasoning that that clinical prediction testimony  was not in every case wrong and could be refuted by opposing experts, trusting the [[adversarial system]] to determine the accuracy of such statements.&lt;ref name="melton1997"/&gt;
{{quotation| There is no merit to petitioner's argument that psychiatrists, individually and as a group, are incompetent to predict with an acceptable degree of reliability that a particular criminal will commit other crimes in the future, and so represent a danger to the community.  ...Nor, despite the view of the American Psychiatric Association supporting petitioner's view, is there any convincing evidence that such testimony is almost entirely unreliable, and that the factfinder and the adversary system will not be competent to uncover, recognize, and take due account of its shortcomings.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt; }}

The Court's decision in this death penalty case was very important in influencing the legal opinion regarding psychiatric predictions of dangerousness, a position with which the  [[American Psychiatric Association]] and other medical ethicists disagree, leading some experts to conclude that a psychiatrist making such statements verges on the brink of being a [[Quackery|quack]]. Nevertheless, courts have been willing to accept such testimony despite the lack of [[empirical evidence]] that these predictions of future dangerousness are accurate.&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book

However, forensic experts state that psychiatric testimony on [[ultimate issue (law)|ultimate questions at law]] is unreliable due to the inherent limitations of current psychiatric clinical and experimental knowledge and practice.&lt;ref name=forensicsciences/&gt; Dr. James P. Grigson, one of the psychiatrists that testified in this case, was expelled from the American Psychiatric Association and the Texas Association of Psychiatric Physicians (TAPP) for making statements in testimony on defendants he had not examined. The TAPP said his expulsion was due not only to his replies to hypothetical questions but also for predicting dangerousness with 100% certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Breastfeeding promotion''' refers to coordinated activities and [[health policy|policies]] to [[health promotion|promote health]] among women, newborns and infants through [[breastfeeding]].

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends infants should be [[breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusively breastfed]] for the first six months of life to achieve optimal health and development, followed by complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/features/qa/57/en/index.html Online Q&amp;A: What is the recommended food for children in their very early years?] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, currently fewer than 40% of infants under six months of age are exclusively breastfed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/child_adolescent_health/news/archive/2011/29_07_2011/en/index.html World Breastfeeding Week: 1-7 August 2011.] Accessed 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of breastfeeding promotion in the United States==
{{See also|History of breastfeeding}}
Breastfeeding promotion is a movement that came about in the twentieth century in response to high rates of bottle-feeding among mothers, and in recognition of the many health benefits to both mothers and children that breastfeeding offers. While infant formula had been introduced in developed countries in the 1920s as a healthy way to feed one's children, the emergence of research on health benefits of breastfeeding precipitated the beginning of the breastfeeding promotion movement in the United States.&lt;ref name="From Breastfeeding to Bottles"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guasti|first=Cally|title=From Breastfeeding to Bottles|journal=Journal of Global Health|date=Fall 2012|url=http://www.ghjournal.org/jgh-print/fall-2012-issue/from-breastfeeding-to-bottles-2/|accessdate=November 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234525/http://www.ghjournal.org/jgh-print/fall-2012-issue/from-breastfeeding-to-bottles-2/|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s, [[La Leche League International|La Leche League]] meetings began.&lt;ref name="llli.org"&gt;[http://www.llli.org/lllihistory.html A Brief History of La Leche League International.] La Leche League International. Accessed 17 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States began incorporating benefits specific to breastfeeding promotion into its [[WIC|Women, Infants, and Children]] program in 1972. In 1989, WIC state agencies began being required to spend funds targeted at breastfeeding support and promotion, including the provision of education materials in different languages and the purchase of breast pumps and other supplies.&lt;ref name="USDA WIC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative History of Breastfeeding Promotion Requirements in WIC|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/legislative-history-breastfeeding-promotion-requirements-wic|publisher=USDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, WIC state agencies were authorized to use funds earmarked for food to purchase breast pumps.&lt;ref name="USDA WIC" /&gt;

Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention release a Breastfeeding Report Card, detailing breastfeeding rates and promotion programs nationally and in all fifty states. In 2013, 76.5% of US women had ever breastfed their children; 16.4% exclusively breastfed up to six months of age. The Healthy People 2020 target for exclusive breastfeeding at six months is 25.5%.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding Report Card 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breastfeeding Report Card: United States, 2013|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/pdf/2013BreastfeedingReportCard.pdf|publisher=CDC|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of infants who were breastfed exclusively or non-exclusively at six months was 35% in 2000 and increased to 49% by 2010.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding Report Card 2013" /&gt;

== Promotion techniques ==
Effective support techniques for breastfeeding include support given by people with specialized training during and after pregnancy, regular scheduled visits, and support that is directed towards specific groups of people.&lt;ref name=McFadden2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McFadden|first=Alison|last2=Gavine|first2=Anna|last3=Renfrew|first3=Mary J.|last4=Wade|first4=Angela|last5=Buchanan|first5=Phyll|last6=Taylor|first6=Jane L.|last7=Veitch|first7=Emma|last8=Rennie|first8=Anne Marie|last9=Crowther|first9=Susan A.|date=2017|title=Support for healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy term babies|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD001141|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001141.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28244064|via=|pmc=3966266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support has been shown to be effective when offered by both professional or peers, or a combination.&lt;ref name=McFadden2017 /&gt; Providing face-to-face support has been shown to be more likely to be successful for women who are breastfeeding exclusively.&lt;ref name=McFadden2017 /&gt;  

===Prenatal care===
The discussion of breastfeeding during early [[prenatal care]] can positively effect a woman's likelihood to breastfeed her child. During regular checkups, a woman's physician, midwife or other healthcare provider can initiate a conversation about the benefits of breastfeeding, which can influence a woman to breastfeed her child for a longer period of time than she might have otherwise.&lt;ref name="Prenatal Factors O'Campo"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1992.tb00402.x |title=Prenatal Factors Associated with Breastfeeding Duration: Recommendations for Prenatal Interventions |year=1992 |last1=O'Campo |first1=Patricia |last2=Faden |first2=Ruth R. |last3=Gielen |first3=Andrea C. |last4=Wang |first4=Mei Cheng | author4-link= Mei-Cheng Wang |journal=Birth |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=195–201 |pmid=1472267}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the involvement of [[lactation consultant]]s in the prenatal visits of low-income women increases the likelihood that they will breastfeed.&lt;ref name="Bonuck/Trombley 2005" /&gt;

=== Peer support and counseling ===
Peer support techniques can be used before, during, and after pregnancy to encourage exclusive breastfeeding, particularly among groups with low breastfeeding rates. Breastfeeding peer counselors, who are ideally women who have breastfed who can provide information, support, and troubleshooting to mothers, have had a positive effect on the breastfeeding rate in [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/089033449501100414 |title=Peer Counselor Program Increases Breastfeeding Rates in Utah Native American WIC Population |year=1995 |last1=Long |first1=D. G. |last2=Funk-Archuleta |first2=M. A. |last3=Geiger |first3=C. J. |last4=Mozar |first4=A. J. |last5=Heins |first5=J. N. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=279–84 |pmid=8634104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer counseling has also been effective at increasing breastfeeding initiation rates and breastfeeding rates up to three months after birth in Hispanic populations in the United States. In addition, peer counseling can be effective in encouraging not only exclusive breastfeeding, but also breastfeeding rates in combination with formula, or "any breastfeeding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpedi.158.9.897 |title=Effectiveness of Breastfeeding Peer Counseling in a Low-Income, Predominantly Latina Population |year=2004 |last1=Chapman |first1=Donna J. |last2=Damio |first2=Grace |last3=Young |first3=Sara |last4=Pérez-Escamilla |first4=Rafael |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume=158 |issue=9 |pages=897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer counseling has had a strong effect on breastfeeding initiation and duration in developing countries such as [[Bangladesh]] and in areas where home births are more prevalent than hospital births.&lt;ref name="jhl.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/089033440201800102 |title=Training Peer Counselors to Promote and Support Exclusive Breastfeeding in Bangladesh |year=2002 |last1=Haider |first1=R. |last2=Kabir |first2=I. |last3=Huttly |first3=S. R. A. |last4=Ashworth |first4=A. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=18 |pages=7–12 |pmid=11845742 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with nutrition support, particularly the [[WIC]] program in the United States, the presence of peer counselors can have a significant effect on incidence of breastfeeding among low-income women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1026224402712 |year=1997 |last1=Grummer-Strawn |first1=Laurence M. |last2=Rice |first2=Susan P. |last3=Dugas |first3=Kathy |last4=Clark |first4=Linda D. |last5=Benton-Davis |first5=Sandra |journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal |volume=1 |pages=35–42 |pmid=10728224 |title=An evaluation of breastfeeding promotion through peer counseling in Mississippi WIC clinics |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support during and immediately after childbirth can also help women initiate and continue breastfeeding while working through common concerns related to breastfeeding. This support can be non-medical, as [[doula]] care is. Culturally sensitive care (for example, care from a peer of a similar ethnic background) may be most effective at encouraging high-risk women to breastfeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/jmwh.12065 |title=Doula Care Supports Near-Universal Breastfeeding Initiation among Diverse, Low-Income Women |year=2013 |last1=Kozhimannil |first1=Katy B. |last2=Attanasio |first2=Laura B. |last3=Hardeman |first3=Rachel R. |last4=O'Brien |first4=Michelle |journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=378–382|pmc=3742682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lactation consultants ===
[[Lactation consultants]] are health care professionals whose primary goal is to promote breastfeeding and assist mothers with breastfeeding on an individualized or group basis. They work in a variety of health care settings, including hospitals, private doctor's offices, and public health clinics.&lt;ref name="What is an IBCLC"&gt;[http://www.ilca.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3832 What is an IBCLC?], International Lactation Consultant Association. Accessed November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Lactation consultants are board-certified by the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners.&lt;ref name="IBCLE home page"&gt;[http://iblce.org/ Home Page], International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners. Accessed November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of lactation consultants hold a certification in another healthcare profession, often as a nurse, midwife, dietician or physician. However, there is no specific post-secondary education required to become a lactation consultant.&lt;ref name="ILCA FAQ's"&gt;[http://www.ilca.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3313 Frequently Asked Questions], International Lactation Consultant Association. Accessed November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In low-income contexts, interventions by breastfeeding consultants can be effective in promoting breastfeeding among high-risk populations. In one study, while exclusive breastfeeding rates were low in both control and intervention groups, black and Latina low-income women who had prenatal and postnatal support from a lactation consultant were more likely to breastfeed at 20 weeks than women who had not accessed this support.&lt;ref name="Bonuck/Trombley 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-0435 |title=Randomized, Controlled Trial of a Prenatal and Postnatal Lactation Consultant Intervention on Duration and Intensity of Breastfeeding up to 12 Months |year=2005 |last1=Bonuck |first1=K. A. |journal=Pediatrics |volume=116 |issue=6 |pages=1413–26 |pmid=16322166 |last2=Trombley |first2=M |last3=Freeman |first3=K |last4=McKee |first4=D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, lactation consultants give a greater proportion of positive feedback to mothers regarding breastfeeding than either physicians or nurses do; the amount of positive advice that a first-time mother receives regarding breastfeeding from any health care provider can influence her likelihood to continue breastfeeding for a longer period of time.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding and Health Professional Encouragement"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/089033449801400414 |title=Breastfeeding and Health Professional Encouragement |year=1998 |last1=Humenick |first1=S. S. |last2=Hill |first2=P. D. |last3=Spiegelberg |first3=P. L. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=305–10 |pmid=10205449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social marketing and media===
Social marketing has been shown to influence women's decision to breastfeed their children. One study found that in years when Parents magazine ran formula advertisements at a higher frequency, the proportion of women who breastfed often decreased in the following year.&lt;ref name="Foss Southwell - Infant feeding in Parents mag"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1746-4358-1-10 |year=2006 |last1=Foss |first1=Katherine A |last2=Southwell |first2=Brian G |journal=International Breastfeeding Journal |volume=1 |pages=10 |pmid=16722542 |title=Infant feeding and the media: The relationship between Parents' Magazine content and breastfeeding, 1972-2000 |pmc=1489921 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, women who are exposed to marketing that promotes breastfeeding are likely to breastfeed at higher rates.&lt;ref name="Lindenberger - Promoting Breastfeeding WIC"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5993/AJHB.24.1.8 |title=Promoting Breastfeeding in the WIC Program: A Social Marketing Case Study |year=2000 |last1=Lindenberger |first1=James H. |last2=Bryant |first2=Carol A. |journal=American Journal of Health Behavior |volume=24 |pages=53–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the Internet's influence has also influenced women's choices in infant feeding. The Internet has served as both a vector for formula advertisement and a means by which women can connect with other mothers to gain support and share experiences from breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Milk and Social Media"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0890334412447080 |title=Milk and Social Media: Online Communities and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes |year=2012 |last1=Abrahams |first1=S. W. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=400–6 |pmid=22674963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, social media is a category of advertising that did not exist when the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] was published; thus, while some advertising practices undertaken by formula companies on the Internet violated the Code, they did so in ways that could not have been anticipated.&lt;ref name="Milk and Social Media" /&gt;

One social medium used to promote breastfeeding is video. These videos are often independently filmed and produced by lactation consultants who seek a new way to reach clients. While the efficacy of these videos has not been formally studied, they are a relatively new medium of conveying messages about breastfeeding to women.&lt;ref name="Breastfeed Ya Baby"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breastfeed Ya Baby|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaR-pvh4K_g|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teach Me How to Breastfeed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lumukanda|first=Tanefer|title=Teach Me How to Breastfeed|url=http://vimeo.com/72249314|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural and social factors ==

=== Ethnicity and breastfeeding promotion ===
Breastfeeding initiation and duration varies significantly by race and ethnicity. The National Immunization Survey in the United States found that while 73.4% of all women in the United States initiated breastfeeding upon the birth of their child, only 54.4% of black, non-Hispanic women and 69.8% of American Indian and Alaska Native women did. White non-Hispanic women initiated breastfeeding 74.3% of the time and Hispanic women had an initiation rate of 80.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20339344 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5911a2.htm |year=2010 |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |title=Racial and ethnic differences in breastfeeding initiation and duration, by state - National Immunization Survey, United States, 2004-2008 |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=327–34 |journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study  found that in a low-income environment, foreign-born black women had a similar breastfeeding rate to Hispanic women; both of these rates were higher than that of non-Hispanic white women. In addition, native-born black women had a somewhat higher rate of breastfeeding than white women.&lt;ref name="SSQ"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00656.x |title=Racial/Ethnic Differences in Breastfeeding Initiation and Duration Among Low-Income Inner-City Mothers |year=2009 |last1=Lee |first1=Helen J. |last2=Elo |first2=Irma T. |last3=McCollum |first3=Kelly F. |last4=Culhane |first4=Jennifer F. |journal=Social Science Quarterly |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=1251–1271 |pmid=20160902 |pmc=2768401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrant status in the United States is a predictor for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the [[Hispanic paradox]] plays a role in the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; Hispanic women who have been in the United States for longer are less likely to breastfeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0890334412438403 |title=Association between Acculturation and Breastfeeding among Hispanic Women: Data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System |year=2012 |last1=Ahluwalia |first1=I. B. |last2=d'Angelo |first2=D. |last3=Morrow |first3=B. |last4=McDonald |first4=J. A. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=167–73 |pmid=22526345}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for bottle-feeding as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that Hispanic women feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0730-7659.2005.00351.x |title=Prevalence of Breastfeeding and Acculturation in Hispanics: Results from NHANES 1999-2000 Study |year=2005 |last1=Gibson |first1=Maria V. |last2=Diaz |first2=Vanessa A. |last3=Mainous Ag |first3=Arch G. |last4=Geesey |first4=Mark E. |journal=Birth |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=93–8 |pmid=15918865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to prenatal care, socioeconomic status, cultural influence, and postpartum breastfeeding support all influence the differing rates of breastfeeding in different ethnic groups. In the United States, black women are more likely than white women to report that they "prefer bottle-feeding" to breastfeeding, and they are also more likely to be low-income and unmarried and to have lower levels of education. The decision to bottle-feed rather than breastfeed is of similar importance to low birth weight in predicting infant mortality, particularly in regards to the black-white infant mortality gap. Thus, breastfeeding promotion initiatives focused on black women should emphasize education and encourage black women to prefer breastfeeding to bottle-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.108.2.291 |title=The Decision to Breastfeed in the United States: Does Race Matter? |year=2001 |last1=Forste |first1=R. |last2=Weiss |first2=J. |last3=Lippincott |first3=E. |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=291–6 |pmid=11483790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts attribute high mortality rates and under nutrition amongst infants to the decreasing number of woman who breastfeed. This delay in breastfeeding initiation increases the risk of neonatal mortality. Experts suggest breastfeeding within the first day of birth until the infant is 6-months old.  Promotion of breastfeeding during this period could potentially reduce the mortality rates by 16% if infant was breast fed since day one and 22% if the infant was breastfed within the first hour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Delayed Breastfeeding Initiation Increases Risk of Neonatal Mortality

Kirkwood, MSc, FMedScib&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of breastfeeding initiation vary with ethnicity and socioeconomic situations. Studies suggest that college educated women over their 30 are more likely to initiate breastfeeding in comparison to other women who have different levels of educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;Assessing Infant Breastfeeding Beliefs Among Low-Income Mexican Americans, Sara L. Gill, PhD, RN, IBCLC, Elizabeth Reifsnider, PhD, RNC, WHNP, Angela R. Mann, RN, MSN, MPH, Patty Villarreal, MS, RN, CPNP, FAAN, and Mindy B. Tinkle, PhD, RNC, WHNP&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and location are reported factors of delayed breastfeeding and infant under nutrition. Low- income mothers are specifically at risk for under nutrition and high mortality rates amongst their infants because they replace breast milk with formula.&lt;ref&gt;Breastfeeding among Low Income, African-American Women: Power, Beliefs and Decision Making, Margaret E. Bentley, Deborah L. Dee*, and Joan L. Jensen {{DOI|10.1016/S1526-9523(00)00018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do so because they lack a supportive environment, embarrassment of nursing, or the need to return to school or work. About 16.5% of low-income mothers breastfed for the recommended time. Studies suggest that scarce financial and social resources are consistent with the high mortality rates amongst the infants of low-income mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Breastfeeding Duration among Low Income Women, Renee A. Milligan RNC, PhD†,*, Linda C. Pugh RNC, PhD‡, Yvonne L. Bronner RD, LD, ScD§, Diane L. Spatz RNC, PhD¶ andLinda P. Brown RN, PhD, FAAN&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of neonatal and infant mortality that is directly correlated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding is seen is sub-Saharan, Africa. Mortality rates are highest in this region of the world and have had the slowest progress to achieving reductions to the overall child mortality. Even if low-income mothers exclusively breast fed their infants for the 6 month – 1-year period, their infant is still at risk because most women commonly delay first day initiation of breast-feeding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Most women aren’t aware that absence in breast milk put their infant at risk for serious health problems in the future. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implements programs that promote and support breastfeeding and the benefits for infants and children. They compile many types of data so states can monitor progress and to educate expecting parents on the subject . But for other countries these programs aren’t so common.&lt;ref&gt;CDC National Immunization Surveys 2010 and 2011, Provisional Data, 2009 births&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic influence ===
[[Socioeconomic status]] of mothers likely has a larger influence on breastfeeding adherence than race or ethnicity, as many women who are members of groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed.&lt;ref name="SSQ" /&gt; In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed.&lt;ref name="California Mothers"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16416698 |year=2006 |last1=Heck |first1=KE |last2=Braveman |first2=P |last3=Cubbin |first3=C |last4=Chávez |first4=GF |last5=Kiely |first5=JL |title=Socioeconomic status and breastfeeding initiation among California mothers |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=51–9 |pmc=1497787 |journal=Public Health Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.&lt;ref name="California Mothers" /&gt;

The time commitment of exclusive breastfeeding is also an economic constraint. The time required per week to breastfeed rather than bottle-feed or feed solids to children can be a significant burden for women without other childcare or who need to spend this time doing paid work.&lt;ref name="Who Pays for Breastfeeding"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0890334413495450 |title=Who Pays for the Health Benefits of Exclusive Breastfeeding?

P. |last2=Forrester |first2=R. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=547–55 |pmid=24106021}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some evidence suggests that the long-term benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the short-term costs. In the United States, workplace policy surrounding breastfeeding and parental leave often does not reflect these benefits. In addition, women are often unable to risk the loss of their jobs or loss of income due to breastfeeding adherence, so bottle-feeding is the best solution for the short-term.&lt;ref name="Suckling and Silence"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/135457097338636 |title=Suckling and Silence in the USA: The Costs and Benefits of Breastfeeding |year=1997 |last1=Galtry |first1=Judith |journal=Feminist Economics |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, these young mothers receive even less education and support than adult mothers even though they need it most.&lt;ref name="respiratory.upenn.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Susanne M. |year=2014 |title=Breastfeeding Initiation Among Teenage Mothers |journal=Journal of Student Nursing Research |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=3 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/josnr/vol3/iss2/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants of the various studies reported that medical staff directed them towards the hospital's vast supply of formula milk instead of receiving lactation consultations even when they wished to breastfeed.&lt;ref name="Condon, L. 2012"/&gt;  
 
Adolescent mothers have particular needs due to levels of education, employment, exposure (or lack thereof) to breastfeeding, self-esteem, support from others,&lt;ref name="respiratory.upenn.edu"/&gt; and of cognitive and psychological immaturity.&lt;ref name="Condon, L. 2012"/&gt;  These factors contribute to a young mother's likelihood to experience distress during their breastfeeding experiences &lt;ref name="respiratory.upenn.edu"/&gt; and may even lead first time adolescent mothers to have different concerns and anxieties regarding breastfeeding from those of adult first time mothers.&lt;ref name="Condon, L. 2012"/&gt;

Studies suggest that even when young mothers are informed about the health benefits of breastfeeding other social norms take precedence.&lt;ref name="Condon, L. 2012"/&gt;  The potential of social embarrassment can be present in the minds of expecting adolescent mothers and may be a major factor that influences their choice of feeding method.&lt;ref name="respiratory.upenn.edu"/&gt; Adolescent mothers have also described conflicts between their wish to resume activities outside of the home in the post-natal period and the baby's need to be fed.  Public breastfeeding was seen as risking social disapproval, thus, discouraged  breastfeeding.  Some of the adolescent participants of some studies described how their fears become a reality when they were asked to stop [[breastfeeding in public]] areas.&lt;ref name="Condon, L. 2012"/&gt;

The breastfeeding promotion and support of adolescent mothers must take into account the context of the individual and their cultural norms.  Few teenagers can withstand the cultural pressure which categorizes bottle feeding as a norm. Therefore, new teenage mothers need more concerted prenatal anticipatory guidance, specialized lactation education and an increase of face-to-face postpartum support.&lt;ref name="Condon, L. 2012"/&gt;  To succeed with the task at hand, inpatient nursing care need to be tailor to the unique needs of this population.  Positive perception of inpatient postpartum nursing care has been found to be an important influence in a young mother's success with breastfeeding.  In a study conducted in the United States, young mothers reported positive postpartum experiences, especially in respect to breastfeeding initiation and mother-infant bonding, when their nursing care was targeted for adolescent mothers. The mothers reported that they felt better cared for and more motivated to initiate and sustain breastfeeding when nurses were friendly, patient, respectful and understanding of their individual needs.  Maternal self-confidence is a contributing factor that influences positive breastfeeding outcomes especially among adolescent mothers. Empowerment, compassion, understanding and patience are key when caring for young moms.&lt;ref name="respiratory.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Support outside of clinical settings is also important.  Changes to policies have been introduced in the California (U.S.) legislature that identify schools as key institution of support for adolescent mothers.  In 2015, State Assembly Member Cristina Garcia from Los Angeles, introduced an amendment which required an employer to provide break time to accommodate employees to express breast milk for the employee's infant child, breast-feed an infant child or address other needs related to breast-feeding.  This amendment also requires public schools to provide similar accommodations to lactating students.  These accommodations include but are not limited to access to a private or secure room, other than a restroom, permission to bring into a school campus any equipment used to express breast milk, access to a power source for said equipment, and access to store expressed breast milk. The bill does not mandate the construction of new space to make these accommodations possible.&lt;ref&gt;AB 302 Assembly Bill- Amended.  http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_0301-0350/ab_302_bill_20150420_amended_asm_v97.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy hopes to validate young mothers’ wishes to continue breastfeeding their infant children without shame.

On a global scale, recommendations have been made to educate school age children using curriculum that promotes healthy nutrition which includes breastfeeding.  The World Health Organization's Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding recommend education authorities help form positive attitudes through the promotion of evidence-based science regarding the benefits of breastfeeding and other nutrition programs.&lt;ref&gt;Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, World Health Organization.

{{Main article|La Leche League International}}

[[La Leche League International]] was founded in 1956 after breastfeeding rates in the United States dropped to about 20%.&lt;ref name="llli.org"/&gt; Today, La Leche League has groups in all 50 states and many countries worldwide. Its goals include promoting understanding of breastfeeding as a part of [[child development]] and providing support and education for breastfeeding mothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llli.org/ab.html?m=1 All About La Leche League.] La Leche League International. Accessed 19 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; La Leche League utilizes peer support groups in breastfeeding promotion in addition to supporting [[World Breastfeeding Week]] and other breastfeeding promotion initiatives.

=== Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative ===
{{Main article|Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative}}

The [[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative]] (BFHI) is an initiative of the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]] that seeks to encourage initiation of breastfeeding among mothers who give birth to their children in hospitals. Facilities that achieve its "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding" and implement the International code of Marketing Breast-milk Substitutes can be recognized as a Baby-Friendly facility by the BFHI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/about-us/baby-friendly-hospital-initiative Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.] Baby-Friendly USA. Accessed October 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, accreditation by the BFHI allows facilities to approach the Healthy People 2020 breastfeeding initiation goals. Worldwide, facilities that fulfill the requirements of the BFHI have been able to greatly increase their breastfeeding initiation rates among patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/baby.htm The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.] UNICEF. Accessed October 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines of the BFHI have also been effective in increasing breastfeeding initiation rates among populations that typically have lower incidences of breastfeeding, such as black women. In one study, the rate of infants exclusively breastfeeding more than quintupled over a four-year period upon the implementation of the BFHI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.108.3.677 |title=Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative Improves Breastfeeding Initiation Rates in a US Hospital Setting |year=2001 |last1=Philipp |first1=B.

===WHO and UNICEF Initiatives===
In addition to overseeing the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, the WHO and UNICEF have promoted breastfeeding on an international level. In 1990, the Innocenti Declaration On the Protection, Promotion, and Support of Breastfeeding was published after a joint meeting of WHO and UNICEF policymakers. The Innocenti Declaration set forth goals of exclusive breastfeeding up to 4–6 months, helping women be confident in their ability to breastfeed, and national policies regarding breastfeeding to be determined by individual countries, among other benchmarks.&lt;ref name="Innocenti Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Innocenti Declaration|url=http://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/innocenti.htm|work=UNICEF|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, UNICEF has published "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding" which has been implemented in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.

The WHO and UNICEF also undertake independent research and reviews of recent research on breastfeeding in order to inform their future recommendations.&lt;ref name="WHO Publications List"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications: Infant and Young Child Feeding|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infant_feeding/en/index.html|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNICEF, alongside its recommendations for nutrition for children and adults, advocates exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age and complementary feeding up to two years of age for young children. With these guidelines in mind, UNICEF believes that with optimal breastfeeding practices, up to 1.4 million deaths of children under 5 in the developing world can be prevented.&lt;ref name="Infant and Young Child Feeding UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Infant and Young Child Feeding|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_breastfeeding.html|work=UNICEF|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breastfeeding promotion projects by region==

===Africa===

====Uganda====
In Uganda, campaigns to promote breastfeeding have been conducted in the [[mass media]], including [[public service announcement]]s via radio, television, posters, newspapers and magazines, leading to improved knowledge of the benefits of breastfeeding for infants and mothers among individuals and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Neeru |last1=Gupta |first2=Charles |last2=Katende |first3=Ruth |last3=Bessinger |pmid=15663176 |url=http://www.jhpn.net/index.php/jhpn/article/view/293 |doi=10.3329/jhpn.v22i4.293 |year=2004 |title=An Evaluation of Post-campaign Knowledge and Practices of Exclusive Breastfeeding in Uganda |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=429–39 |journal=Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition|doi-broken-date=2018-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Breastfeeding and HIV ===
{{main article|Breastfeeding by HIV infected mothers}}

It has been argued that, in hindsight, the campaign for the universal promotion of breastfeeding prior to the acknowledgement of [[HIV]] contraction via [[mother-to-child transmission]] (MTCT) fails to consider affected mothers in [[developing countries]] who have limited or no access to procedures that would minify the chance of spreading the virus to their young ones. Initiatives for a decreased percentage of infants contracting HIV include administering [[Antiretroviral therapy]] (ART) to their mothers and providing milk formula in hand with proper water sterilization techniques to prevent disease from contamination. The majority of opposition comes from local and global policy makers who argue about the non-feasibility of these projects. However others argue that there is limited say of the women directly affected, resulting in further segregation of women in developing nations from preventive aid and health care systems.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006.

===Infant formula marketing in hospitals===
In many hospitals, women who are being discharged after giving birth are given discharge packs branded by a formula company that include  formula samples. Many breastfeeding experts argue that these commercial discharge packs decrease the likelihood that a woman will breastfeed and, if she does breastfeed, the length of time she will do so. Studies have found that marketing of infant formula in hospitals makes it likelier that a woman will breastfeed for a shorter amount of time due to the perceived convenience of bottle-feeding.&lt;ref name="Marketing Infant Formula Through Hospitals"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.103218 |title=Marketing Infant Formula Through Hospitals: The Impact of Commercial Hospital Discharge Packs on Breastfeeding |year=2008 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Kenneth D. |last2=Eastham |first2=Carissa A. |last3=Kasehagen |first3=Laurin J. |last4=Sandoval |first4=Alfredo P. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=290–5 |pmid=18172152 |pmc=2376885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snell - Formula Samples in Hospitals"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/089033449200800213 |title=The Association of Formula Samples Given at Hospital Discharge with the Early Duration of Breastfeeding |year=1992 |last1=Snell |first1=B.

L. |journal=Journal of Human Lactation |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=279–82 |pmid=11155598}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not accepting free formula is one of the criteria that determine whether a facility can be certified as [[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative|Baby-Friendly]]; thus, the economic burden of giving up access to formula for free can be a significant barrier for disadvantaged facilities that wish to achieve Baby-Friendly status.&lt;ref name="Becoming Baby-Friendly" /&gt;

A 2003 report indicates that cannabis and alcohol are the only drugs commonly found in the nation.&lt;ref name="Group2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Institute on Drug Abuse.

==History==
Seychelles' laws banning cannabis were copied verbatim from the 1882 [[cannabis in Mauritius|legislation in Mauritius]]. This caused some confusion as Mauritius had re-opened the cannabis trade in 1883, then closed it again in 1887, leaving some confusion as to which laws continued to apply to Seychelles.&lt;ref name="SeychellesHerchenroder1904"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Seychelles|author2=Sir Furcy Alfred Herchenroder|author3=Walter Lockhart Rind|title=The Laws of Seychelles Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIdDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA579|year=1904|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=579–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6617">In the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[marijuana]] (cannabis) is illegal, but possession of under one ounce is [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalized]]. In a [[United States Virgin Islands referendum, 2014|2014 referendum]], USVI voters expressed support for the [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] taking up the question of legalizing medical cannabis.

==Decriminalization (2014)==
In December 2014, USVI's unicameral [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands|Legislature]] voted 14–0 to override Governor [[John P. DeJongh]]'s [[line-item veto]] of cannabis decriminalization from the territory's 2015 budget. Penalties for possession of an ounce of cannabis or less were reduced from a year in jail and $5,000 fine to a civil offense punishable by a fine of $100-$200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailychronic.net/2014/39555/marijuana-possession-now-decriminalized-in-us-virgin-islands/|title=Marijuana Possession Now Decriminalized In US Virgin Islands|work=The Daily Chronic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor DeJohng had vetoed the measure in October, saying the bill would complicate the government's ability to deal with cannabis regarding workplace safety rules and pre-trial release and bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viconsortium.com/featured/marijuana-decriminalization-becomes-law-senate-overrides-de-jongh-veto/|title=Marijuana Decriminalization Becomes Law, Senate Overrides De Jongh Veto|work=viconsortium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical cannabis referendum (2014)==
In 2014 a [[United States Virgin Islands referendum, 2014|non-binding referendum]] was held in USVI, asking voters whether the Legislature should explore the issue of legalizing medical cannabis. In August the USVI Senate approved the addition of that referendum to the 2014 election, 12–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virginislandsdailynews.com/news/medical-marijuana-referendum-clears-senate-1.1726747|title=Medical marijuana referendum clears Senate|author=Aldeth Lewin|work=Virgin Islands Daily News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the results were announced as coming in favor consideration of medical cannabis, 56%–43% (10,503–8,074).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginislandsnewsonline.com/en/news/2014-usvi-election-count-in-official-certified-results-out|title=2014 USVI election count In! Official/certified results Out!|work=virginislandsnewsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed a [[United States Virgin Islands hemp referendum, 2012|2012 referendum]] that approved the legalisation of industrial hemp.

==Illicit economy==
The July 2003 ''Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands Drug Threat Assessment'' by the [[National Drug Intelligence Center]] describes the illicit economy around cannabis in the USVI:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most marijuana available in the USVI arrives from southern island locations such as St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines; however, its origin is unknown. ... Cannabis produced locally in the USVI usually is cultivated outdoors; however, poor terrain and arid climate across the USVI produce a low-quality product. ... Marijuana primarily is transported to the USVI in small maritime vessels. ... In the USVI local criminal groups and independent dealers are the primary wholesale and retail distributors of marijuana. ... Treatment data for the USVI are unavailable; however, USVI law enforcement officials indicate that marijuana abuse is widespread.
...

Typically, the marijuana available in the USVI is transported from islands in the Caribbean; the source of the marijuana is not known.... The DEA Caribbean Division reported the following marijuana seizures in the USVI: 0.3 kilograms in FY2000; 28.6 kilograms in FY2001, and 465.5 kilograms in FY2002. ... In St. Thomas and St. John, marijuana sold for approximately $1,300 per kilogram, $600 per pound, $100 per ounce, and $10 per bag in the second quarter of FY2002.
....

The percentage of drug-related federal sentences that were marijuana-related in Puerto Rico and the USVI in FY2001 was significantly lower than the national percentage. According to USSC data, 3.0 percent of drug-related federal sentences in Puerto Rico and 6.7 percent of drug-related federal sentences in the USVI were marijuana-related compared with 32.8 percent nationally.
...

The level of violence directly attributed to marijuana distribution in Puerto Rico and the USVI is low. However, distributors who sell marijuana often distribute other drugs, including cocaine and heroin, and commit violent crimes to protect their territory.
...

Cannabis also is cultivated--primarily outdoors--in the USVI; however, poor terrain and arid climate across the USVI produce a low quality product. Nearly all the cannabis cultivated is intended for local distribution. Cultivation sites most commonly are located in rural areas across the islands and typically contain 100 to 200 cannabis plants. In August 2002 federal and local law enforcement authorities seized approximately 1,100 cannabis plants in a series of raids in St. Croix. Law enforcement officials located the plants using helicopters. The plants were scattered in plots throughout the western half of the island. No arrests were made.
...

Most of the marijuana available in the USVI is transported by small maritime vessels from southern island locations including St. Lucia or St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Neither the principal transporters nor the origin of marijuana arriving in the USVI from these locations is known.
...

In the USVI local criminal groups and independent dealers are the primary wholesale- and retail-level distributors of marijuana. ... In the USVI marijuana is sold via hand-to-hand transactions on city streets and in residences, bars, and clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs3/3950/marijuan.htm#Top|title=Marijuana - Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands Drug Threat Assessment|work=justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WedgetailEagleCarrion.jpg|thumb|A [[wedge-tailed eagle]] and carrion ([[roadkill]] kangaroo) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.]]
'''Carrion''' (from [[Latin]] ''caro'', meaning "meat") is the decaying flesh of a dead animal.

==Overview==
Carrion is an important food source for large [[carnivore]]s and [[omnivore]]s in most ecosystems. Examples of carrion-eaters (or [[scavenger]]s) include [[vulture]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Hovenden, Frank. [http://www.comoxvalleynaturalist.bc.ca/wild_side/2003/vulture.html The Carrion Eaters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062448/http://www.comoxvalleynaturalist.bc.ca/wild_side/2003/vulture.html |date=1 June 2010 }}. Comox Valley Naturalists Society. 7 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hyena]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-striped_hyena.html "San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: Striped hyena"].

NYS Department of Environmental Conservation April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Komodo dragon]]s. Many invertebrates such as the [[Silphidae|carrion and burying beetle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John George Wood|title=Insects abroad: Being a popular account of foreign insects; their structure, habits and transformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10VHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=27 November 2011|year=1892|publisher=Longmans|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[maggot]]s of [[Calliphoridae|calliphorid flies]] and [[Flesh-fly|flesh-flies]] also eat carrion, playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains.

[[File:Flies settle on a sheep carrion.jpg|thumb|[[Fly|Flies]] settling on a [[sheep]] carrion]]
Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal's death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed [[bacteria]]. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]].

Some plants and [[fungus|fungi]] smell like [[Decomposition|decomposing]] carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction. Plants that exhibit this behavior are known as [[carrion flower]]s. [[Phallaceae|Stinkhorn mushroom]]s are examples of fungi with this characteristic.
[[File:Coyoteelk.jpg|thumb|left|A [[mountain coyote|coyote]] feeding on elk carrion in [[Yellowstone National Park]]'s Lamar Valley during winter.]]
Sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and should not be touched. An example of carrion being used to describe dead and rotting bodies in literature may be found in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (III.i):&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/julius_caesar.3.1.html The Life and Death of Julies Caesar]. SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example can be found in Daniel Defoe's ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds "its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing".

==In Noahide law==
{{main|Noahide laws}}
The thirty-count laws of [[Ulla (Talmudist)]] include the prohibition of humans consuming carrion.&lt;ref&gt;talmud, hullin 92b&lt;/ref&gt; This count is in addition to the standard seven law count and has been recently{{when|date=September 2018}} published from the Judeo-Arabic writing of [[Shmuel ben Hophni Gaon]] after having been lost for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mossad HaRav Kook]] edition of Gaon's commentary to Genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

== NIAID ==

NIAID conducts research at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana, This facility is developing a vaccine to prevent Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The vaccine being tested is a single-component vaccine that is designed to protect against all 15 chlamydia varieties. Studies have already shown that the vaccine can prevent laboratory cells from becoming infected.

Another prevention strategy being pursued is the development of topical microbicides (preparations that can be inserted into the vagina to prevent infection) that are effective and easy for women to use.

Studies continue to determine organism's genetic makeup. NIAID-supported scientists determined the complete genome (genetic blueprint) for C. trachomatis.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clinical studies==
A clinical study involves research using human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are two main types of clinical studies: clinical trials (also called interventional studies) and observational studies. ClinicalTrials.gov includes both interventional and observational studies.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/learn

===Clinical trials===
Clinical trials are used by researchers investigating the efficacy of interventions or protocol in the epidemiology, detection, prevention and treatment of Chlamydia infections. Interventions are the use of medical products, medication. devices; procedures or changes in the participants' behavior. The effects on the participants are measured and compared to previous trials, placebo or a new medical approach, or to no intervention.&lt;ref name="clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;{{cite web | title = Learn About Clinical Studies - ClinicalTrials.gov | url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/learn | accessdate = 2015-07-27  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institutes of Health support on-going research in the study of Chlamydia infection. At least 113 studies have been initiated as of 2015.&lt;ref name="clinicaltrials.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Clinical Trials.gov - A service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health |publisher=National Institutes of Health | url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=%22Chlamydia+Infections%22 
| accessdate = 2015-07-27  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example was the clinical trial of eye prophylaxis in newborns in the prevention of neonatal conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Clinical Trial of Eye Prophylaxis in the Newborn - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov | url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00000120?cond=%22Chlamydia+Infections%22&amp;rank=42 |date=September 2009| accessdate = 2015-07-27  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observational studies===
Research related to Chlamydia can take the form of an observational study. This type of study assesses outcomes in groups of participants according to a research plan or protocol. The volunteers in the study may receive interventions such as medical products, medications, devices, or procedures as part of their routine medical care. The volunteers in this type of study are not assigned to specific interventions as in a clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an oberservational study regarding Chlamydia infection was "Non-Invasive Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Testing in Women Seeking Emergency Contraception or Urine Pregnancy Testing: Meeting the Needs of an At-Risk Population" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Observational studies employ the use of randomised control studies.&lt;ref name="OakeshottKerry2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakeshott|first1=P.|last2=Kerry|first2=S.|last3=Aghaizu|first3=A.|last4=Atherton|first4=H.|last5=Hay|first5=S.|last6=Taylor-Robinson|first6=D.|last7=Simms|first7=I.|last8=Hay|first8=P.|title=Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial|journal=BMJ|volume=340|issue=apr08 1|year=2010|pages=c1642–c1642|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.c1642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
A case study that researches the prevalence and prevention of Chlamydia can be many things. It often entails personal contact, and a detailed history of the participants along with an extensive physical examination. Included in case studies of Chlamydia infection and the '''case''' results include its related contextual conditions. Chlamydia case studies also can be produced by following a formal research method. These case studies are likely to appear in formal research venues, such as journals and professional conferences. ork, and administrative science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11042">The '''Cigar Boom''' is the name given to the resurgence of [[cigar]] consumption in the United States during the mid-1990s. Beginning in 1992, imports and sales of premium cigars began to rise dramatically and manufacturers struggled to keep up with demand, leading to industry-wide shortages of raw materials and finished products. The period was marked and the trend accelerated with the 1992 establishment of ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' magazine.

By 1997, production caught up with demand and the downward side of the cycle of [[boom and bust]] began to make itself felt, leading to a shakeout of many of the smaller and weaker upstart manufacturers of [[boutique]] premium cigars. A slow resurgence of the industry began in 2001, until by 2011 total cigar imports began again to approach the peak years of the boom.

==History==

===American cigar demand in the 1980s===

Throughout the decade of the 1980s, imports of handmade cigars into the United States remained stagnant at about 100 million cigars per year.&lt;ref name="CABoom" /&gt; The lengthy plateau in consumer demand allowed [[tobacco]] farmers and brokers and cigar manufacturers to plan for future production.&lt;ref name="Rothman"&gt;Lew Rothman, "Are You Kiddin' Me? Just How Dumb Does Everyone Think We Are?' ''Cigar Magazine,'' vol. 3, no. 4 (Winter 2006-07), pp. 138-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Since cigar tobacco requires an extensive preparation process, including stripping, sorting, aging, and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], dramatic changes in the level of output required two or three years of advance time.&lt;ref name="Rothman" /&gt;

Stable consumer demand allowed companies to safely plan for the needs of the marketplace but the nature of the industry did not allow for rapid expansion of production. Cigar industry veteran [[Lew Rothman]] later recalled that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because there was only a finite number of potential customers and a fairly predictable demand for premium cigars, the quantity of tobacco planted to supply that demand, and the price for those [[wrapper (cigar)|wrappers]], [[binder (cigar)|binders]], and [[filler (cigar)|filler]] leaves, remained very constant throughout the 1980s and into the '90s. Basically, there were no new farmers, brokers, or factories for the product, and it was 'the same old, same old' for over a decade."&lt;ref name="Rothman" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 1992 revival===

In the 4th Quarter of 1992, the long-term decline in the importation of cigars began to show signs of being reversed, as quantities increased by 4% over previous year totals.&lt;ref name="WasAndIs"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Cigar+Boom+What+It+Was+(and+Is)-a01073874585 "The Cigar Boom What It Was (and Is),"] openlibrary.com/, 2008. Retrieved September 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of 1992 also saw the establishment of a new publication, credited by some with spurring the cigar boom of the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WasAndIs" /&gt; ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' magazine, a glossy monthly publication, helped to legitimize the idea that cigars were not a vile relic of a by-gone century and helped to foster an [[epicurean]] attitude towards hand-crafted tobacco products.&lt;ref name="Rothman" /&gt;  Over the years a number of important celebrities revealed themselves to be cigar [[connoisseurs]] in its pages, including television's [[William Shatner]] and radio's [[Rush Limbaugh]].

The year 1993 saw the first significant increase in cigar imports to the United States in more than a decade, with a total of 117.8 million cigars brought into the country, an increase of about 10 percent over the previous year's totals.&lt;ref name="CABoom"&gt;David Savona, [http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/The-Cigar-Boom_7598 "The Cigar Boom,"] ''Cigar Aficionado,'' Autumn 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year saw a further 12 percent gain in the number of imported cigars into the American market, to 132.4 million pieces.&lt;ref name="CABoom" /&gt; This was followed by an astounding 33 percent gain in 1995, with 176.3 million cigars imported into the country in that year.&lt;ref name="CABoom" /&gt; This trend further accelerated during the first part of 1996, with yet another 36 percent gain posted in the first quarter of that year.&lt;ref name="CABoom" /&gt; By the time 1996 came to a close, some 293 million premium cigars had been imported into the United States — an astonishing 66% gain over 1995's record imports.&lt;ref&gt;David Savona, "A Brief History of the Cigar Industry," ''Cigar Aficionado,'' vol. 20, no. 6 (Sept.-Oct. 2012), pg. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many upstart companies began in the 1990s in an attempt to meet blossoming demand, with long-term survivors including [[Tabacalera Perdomo]] (established 1992), [[Oliva Cigar Co.]] (established 1995), and [[Rocky Patel Premium Cigars|Rocky Patel]] (established mid-1990s). Many other upstart companies began manufacturing cigars in this period, meeting a change in consumer purchasing patterns that favored purchasing single cigars produced by a broad range of manufacturers rather than box quantities from established makers.&lt;ref&gt;Savona, "A Brief History of the Cigar Industry," pg. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw the growth of parallel grass roots industries, such as [[independent record labels]], premium [[coffee]] houses powered by the rapid expansion of [[Starbucks]], and [[microbreweries]] which produced special varieties of [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;For evidence that the premium cigar community was conscious of the parallel even at the time, see the coverage of [http://www.smokemag.com/0996/beer1.htm "Micromania"] in ''Smoke'' magazine, vol. 1, no. 4 (Fall 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid expansion of demand for and manufacture of hand-crafted cigars may be seen as part and parcel of this broad consumer trend which sought specialized craft products over generic mass-produced goods.

===Problems of the boom===

Due to the nearly 2 year turnaround between tobacco seed and the finished product, production was for a time unable to keep up with the new [[fad|fad-like]] demand for premium cigars, resulting in widespread backorders and rising prices.&lt;ref name="CABoom" /&gt; By 1995, the number of backordered cigars to American tobacconists hit the 25 million mark.&lt;ref name=Brief167&gt;Savona, "A Brief History of the Cigar Industry," pg. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as imports soared, this supply situation worsened, until nearly 50 million cigars were on backorder, unable to be shipped due to insufficient wholesale inventory, in 1996.&lt;ref name=Brief167 /&gt; For nearly 6 weeks in the summer of 1996, [[General Cigar Company]] found itself sold out of its [[Macanudo (cigar)|Macanudo]] cigar, unable to ship even a single box of what was then the best-selling premium cigar in America.&lt;ref name=Brief167 /&gt;

Lew Rothman later remembered the extraordinary situation in these years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Insanity reigned. *  *  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"Tobacco is harvested in six to seven primings, as the leaves on a plant mature from bottom to top. Each priming is normally three leaves. In past years and under normal circumstances, what is left is the corona, or top, of the plant. These are very small leaves heavily laden with [[nicotine]]. The corona was often sold to [[chewing tobacco]] companies who flavored this nicotine-laden tobacco and then sold it under names like Mail Pouch, [[Red Man]], and others... If the corona remained unsold, then it and the stalk would be plowed under to provide soil-enriching [[nitrogen]] for next year's crop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"During the Cigar Boom years, this practice all but disappeared! Why? Because during the priming cycle the tobacco stalks would have a secondary growth of tiny leaves much like the [[basal shoot|sucker branches]] you might see on a tree limb. The shortages of tobacco were so ferocious that everyone began harvesting these tiny second-growth leaves, called ''capadura,'' to use as filler tobaccos, and brokers started to sell capadura, the same stuff that used to get plowed under. The point being that every single conceivable scrap of anything that would pass for cigar leaf was being courted by manufacturers large and small, new and old, to meet the demand for cigars in the first half of the 1990s."&lt;ref name="Rothman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As backstocks of aged tobacco vanished and inferior sources were exploited, quality suffered. The April 1997 issue of ''Cigar Insider'' newsletter rated 50 offerings and scored none higher than 90 points for the first time in the publication's 16-month history.&lt;ref name=Brief167 /&gt; Newcomers to the industry, intent on making quick cash from the cigar fad, frequently produced an inferior product.

===The bust of 1997 and legacy===

The cigar boom is recognized to have ended in 1997, when the expanded supply of handmade cigars caught up with backorders and soon far outstripped demand, leaving millions of unsold cigars in wholesale inventory.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;Simon Chase, "Havana's Obesity Challenge," ''Cigar Magazine,'' vol. 7, no. 3 (Fall 2010), pp. 125-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated cigar smokers wearied of the frequently poor quality of new makers and returned to established names of the industry,&lt;ref name=Brief168&gt;Savova, "A Brief History of the Cigar Industry," pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; while many newcomers moved on to new hobbies.

As demand for new brands plummeted, newly established makers faced unparalleled [[cash flow|cash-flow]] problems and began to dump their unsold inventories. Discount cigar retailers suddenly found themselves awash in available product, with cigars sometimes being sold in 1998 for less than the cost of production.&lt;ref name=Brief168 /&gt;

The bust which swept the industry continued for a period of two years, a shakedown which resulted in the death of many fledgling companies.&lt;ref name="Chase" /&gt; Many of the manufacturers who survived the downturn of the industry, generally basing their production in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Nicaragua]], or [[Honduras]], were able to reestablish themselves through the marketing of new and innovative shapes and sizes.&lt;ref name="Chase" /&gt; Traditional [[ring gauge (cigars)|ring gauges]] were de-emphasized in favor of thicker and longer products, a trend which has continued into the cigar market of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Chase" /&gt;

Cigar sales began to climb again only in 2001.&lt;ref name=Brief168 /&gt; The rate of growth in the subsequent decade was slow, steady, and sustainable, averaging 6 percent annually.&lt;ref name=Brief168 /&gt; In 2011 a total of 278.5 million premium cigars were imported into the United States — 2.5 times the level of the last "pre-boom" year, 1991.&lt;ref name=Brief168 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10781">{{Governance}}
'''Clinical governance''' is a systematic approach to maintaining and improving the quality of patient care within the National Health Service, (NHS).  Clinical governance became important in health care after the [[Bristol heart scandal]] in 1995, during which an anaesthetist, Dr [[Stephen Bolsin]], exposed the high mortality rate for paediatric cardiac surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. It was originally elaborated within the [[United Kingdom]] [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and its most widely cited formal definition describes it as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A framework through which NHS organisations are accountable for continually improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Scally and Donaldson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition is intended to embody three key attributes: recognisably high standards of care, transparent responsibility and accountability for those standards, and a constant dynamic of improvement.

The concept has some parallels with the more widely known [[corporate governance]], in that it addresses those structures, systems and processes that assure the quality, accountability and proper management of an organisation's operation and delivery of service. However clinical governance applies only to health and social care organisations, and only those aspects of such organisations that relate to the delivery of care to patients and their carers; it is not concerned with the other business processes of the organisation except insofar as they affect the delivery of care. The concept of "[[integrated governance]]" has emerged to refer jointly to the corporate governance and clinical governance duties of healthcare organisations.

Prior to 1999, the principal statutory responsibilities of UK NHS Trust Boards were to ensure proper financial management of the organisation and an acceptable level of patient safety. Trust Boards had no statutory duty to ensure a particular level of quality. Maintaining and improving the quality of care was understood to be the responsibility of the relevant clinical professions. In 1999, Trust Boards assumed a legal responsibility for quality of care that is equal in measure to their other statutory duties. Clinical governance is the mechanism by which that responsibility is discharged.

"Clinical governance" does not mandate any particular structure, system or process for maintaining and improving the quality of care, except that designated responsibility for clinical governance must exist at Trust Board level, and that each Trust must prepare an Annual Review of Clinical Governance to report on quality of care and its maintenance. Beyond that, the Trust and its various clinical departments are obliged to interpret the principle of clinical governance into locally appropriate structures, processes, roles and responsibilities.

==Elements of clinical governance==
[[image:smallwhatisclingov.jpg|thumb|300px|Clinical governance is an aggregation of service improvement processes that are regulated by a single ideology.]]
Clinical governance is composed of at least the following elements:
*Education and Training
*[[Clinical audit]]
*Clinical effectiveness
*Research and development
*Openness
*Risk management
*Information Management

===Education and training===
It is no longer considered acceptable for any clinician to abstain from [[continuing education]] after qualification - too much of what is learned during training becomes quickly outdated. In [[National Health Service|NHS]] Trusts, the continuing professional development (CPD) of clinicians has been the responsibility of the Trust and it has also been the professional duty of clinicians to remain up-to-date.

===Clinical audit===
Clinical audit is the review of clinical performance, the refining of clinical practice as a result and the measurement of performance against agreed standards - a cyclical process of improving the quality of clinical care. In one form or another, audit has been part of good clinical practice for generations. Whilst audit has been a requirement of [[National Health Service|NHS]] Trust employees, in [[primary care]] clinical audit has only been ''encouraged'', where audit time has had to compete with other priorities.

===Clinical effectiveness===
Clinical effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a particular intervention works. The measure on its own is useful, but decisions are enhanced by considering additional factors, such as whether the intervention is appropriate and whether it represents value for money. In the modern health service, clinical practice needs to be refined in the light of emerging evidence of effectiveness but also has to consider aspects of efficiency and safety from the perspective of the individual patient and carers in the wider community.

===Research and development===
A good professional practice is to always seek to change in the light of evidence-led research. The time lag for introducing such change can be substantial, thus reducing the time lag and associated [[morbidity]] requires emphasis not only on carrying out research but also on efficiently implementing said research.
Techniques such as [[critical appraisal]] of the literature, [[project management]] and the development of guidelines, [[Clinical trial protocol|protocols]] and implementation strategies are all tools for promoting the implementation of research practice.

===Openness===
Poor performance and poor practice can too often thrive behind closed doors. Processes which are open to public scrutiny, while respecting individual patient and practitioner confidentiality, and which can be justified openly, are an essential part of quality assurance. Open proceedings and discussion about clinical governance issues should be a feature of the framework.

Any organisation providing high quality care has to show that it is meeting the needs of the population it serves. Health needs assessment and understanding the problems and aspirations of the community requires the cooperation between [[National Health Service|NHS]] organisations, public health departments, local authorities and community health councils.

The system of clinical governance brings together all the elements which seek to promote quality of care.

===Risk management===
Risk management involves consideration of the following components:

''Risks to patients'': compliance with statutory regulations can help to minimise risks to patients. In addition, patient risks can be minimised by ensuring that systems are regularly reviewed and questioned - for example, by ''critical event audit'' and learning from complaints.  [[Medical ethics|Medical ethical standards]] are also a key factor in maintaining patient and public safety and well-being.

''Risks to practitioners'': ensuring that healthcare professionals are immunised against infectious diseases, working in a safe environment (e.g. safety in acute mental health units, promoting an anti-harassment culture) and are kept up-to-date on important parts of quality assurance. Furthermore, keeping healthcare professionals up to date with guidelines such as fire safety, basic life support (BLS) and local trust updates is also important, these can be annually or more frequent depending on risk stratification.

''Risks to the organisation'': poor quality is a threat to any organisation. In addition to reducing risks to patients and practitioners, organisations need to reduce their own risks by ensuring high quality employment practice (including locum procedures and reviews of individual and team performance), a safe environment (including estates and privacy), and well designed policies on public involvement.

Balancing these risk components may be an ideal that is difficult to achieve in practice.  Recent research by [http://www.michaelfischer.org/ Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] finds that tensions between 'first order' risks (based on clinical care) and 'second order' risks (based on organisational reputation) can produce unintended contradictions, conflict, and may even precipitate organisational crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael D|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information management===
Information management in health:
Patient records (demographic, Socioeconomic, Clinical information) proper collection, management and use of information within healthcare systems will determine the system’s effectiveness in detecting health problems, defining priorities, identifying innovative solutions and allocating resources to improve health outcomes.

==Applying clinical governance in the field==
If clinical governance is to truly function effectively as a systematic approach to maintaining and improving the quality of patient care within a health system, it requires advocates.  It also requires systems and people to be in place to promote and develop it.

The system has found supporters outside of the UK.  The not-for-profit UK hospital accreditation group the [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]] base their system upon NHS clinical governance, and apply it to hospitals in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Malta]].
Also in the Spanish National Health Service several experiences has been implemented,  such the ones in Andalucía and Asturias.

The '''Crohn's and Colitis Foundation''' is a volunteer-driven [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to finding cures for [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]] and improving the [[quality of life]] of children and adults affected by these [[digestive diseases]]. Founded by Shelby Modell and Irwin M. Rosenthal,&lt;ref name = board/&gt; and formerly known as National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis and Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America,&lt;ref name= formerly/&gt; it was incorporated on December 17, 1965.&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; CCF has more than 50,000 members, served by the national headquarters, as well as over 40 chapters nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfa.org/about/?LMI=0|title=About Us - Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation Information - Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=www.ccfa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research, educational workshops and symposia, together with the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation scientific journal, ''[[Inflammatory Bowel Diseases]]'', enable medical professionals to keep pace with this rapidly growing field.  The National Institutes of Health has commended the Foundation for "uniting the research community and strengthening IBD research".&lt;ref name="ccfa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfa.org/about|title=About Us - Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation Information - Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=www.ccfa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation ranks third among leading health non-profits in the percentage of expense devoted to mission-critical programs, with at least 80 cents of every dollar the Foundation spends going toward medical research, professional education, and patient support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfa.org/about/press/pressreleases/caucus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516160032/http://ccfa.org/about/press/pressreleases/caucus |archivedate=2011-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Four decades ago, the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation created the field of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis research. The Foundation funds studies&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Paul. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/222844560/ Dr. Marshall S. Bedine On Crohn's Disease]". ''Baltimore Jewish Times''. April 8, 1994. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; at medical institutions, nurtures investigators at the early stages of their careers, and finances underdeveloped areas of research to find the causes of and cures for Crohn’s and colitis.&lt;ref name="ccfa.org"/&gt; The Foundation has provided more than $150 million for Crohn's and colitis research to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfa.org/about/mission?LMI=0.0|title=Our Mission and Core Values - Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=www.ccfa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patient and Professional Education and Support==

The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation offers literature and patient support services nationally as well as through its forty regional chapters. The Foundation provides information and education for the estimated 1.6 million inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and their families through a variety of periodicals (''Take Charge'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfa.org/myccfa/takecharge |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214021532/http://ccfa.org/myccfa/takecharge |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Under the Microscope''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfa.org/myccfa/microscope/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214021514/http://ccfa.org/myccfa/microscope/ |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ), books, awareness campaigns, local chapter events, Webcasts, and through its web site.[3] Due to its extensive public awareness and outreach efforts, the Foundation reaches at least one out of every 18 patients, compared to the Arthritis Foundation, with one out of every 85, or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, with one out of every 435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfa.org/about/members?LMI=0.5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208234324/http://www.ccfa.org/about/members?LMI=0.5 |archivedate=2010-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Advocacy is a major component of the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation's mission. Its advocates are not only patients, but family members, friends, caregivers, and doctors who want to make their voices heard and see a future free from Crohn's and colitis. Foundation advocates call for increased Federal funding for Crohn's and colitis research and awareness programs designed to improve the lives of patients and improved access to care.  The Foundation encourages its members, volunteers, and friends to become actively involved in advancing its public policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfa.org/advocacy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117165558/http://ccfa.org/advocacy/ |archivedate=2012-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awareness Week==
The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation designated the week of December 1–7 as Crohn's and Colitis Awareness Week in order to encourage all Americans to join in the effort to find cures for these diseases, help raise awareness and support research.

==Fundraising==
The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation primarily relies on the support of members and donors to continue its work. The Foundation raises critical dollars through its local and nationwide special events, spearheaded by its national Team Challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccteamchallenge.org/|title=Team Challenge - Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=www.ccteamchallenge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Take Steps&lt;ref name="cctakesteps.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cctakesteps.org/|title=Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=cctakesteps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; programs.

Team Challenge is the Foundation's endurance training and fundraising program, which prepares participants to run or walk a half marathon, take part in a cycling event, or experience a sprint triathlon while raising money for a cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccteamchallenge.org/|title=Team Challenge - Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=www.ccteamchallenge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Take Steps, the Foundation's largest fundraising event, mobilizes participants in over 150 local communities across the nation to come together and walk for Crohn’s and colitis research.&lt;ref name="cctakesteps.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
http://online.ccfa.org/site/PageServer?pagename=TS_homepage&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation received $3,042,350 of grants from the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] between 2008 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx?k=CROHN%60S%20%26%20COLITIS%20FOUNDATION%20OF%20AMERICA Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America]". ''[[USAspending.gov]]''. Bureau of Fiscal Services. [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. Accessed on February 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Comebacks Awards===
Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America established the Great Comebacks Awards in 1984 in order to recognize individuals who have triumphed over [[inflammatory bowel disease]].&lt;ref name= formerly/&gt; In 1991, the award was given to Dr. P. Kent Cullen, a colon surgeon who has ulcerative colitis and has undergone multiple [[ostomy]] surgeries.&lt;ref name= formerly/&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of the Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation is "to cure Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and to improve the quality of life of children and adults affected by these diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/about/|title=About Us {{!}} Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation Information {{!}} Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Foundation|website=www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the year 2013, the ADA began publishing the CDT codes on an annual basis. There are new codes, revised codes and deleted codes in each annual edition and dental professionals must update these codes to maintain compliance with HIPAA regulations. In addition, payment to dental professionals is based on the CDT code(s) reported on the ADA Claim Form, so using the most current codes helps to maximize reimbursement and minimize audit liability.

In the near future, dental professionals will be required to use diagnosis codes in support of the procedures and services they provide. The 2012 edition of the Dental Claim Form includes fields for diagnosis codes and instructions covering the use of the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding systems. In addition to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM there are other dental diagnostic coding systems under consideration, including [[SNODENT]] and [[EZCODES]].

[[Image:Bubbler.jpg|thumb|150px|A typical drinking fountain]]
A '''drinking fountain''', also called a '''bubbler''' ([[generic trademark]]) or '''water fountain''', is a [[fountain]] designed to provide [[drinking water]]. It consists of a basin with either continuously running water or a [[Tap (valve)|tap]]. The [[Drinking|drinker]] bends down to the stream of water and swallows water directly from the stream. Modern indoor drinking fountains may incorporate [[filter (water)|filter]]s to remove impurities from the water and chillers to lower its temperature. Drinking fountains are usually found in public places, like schools, rest areas, libraries, and grocery stores. Many jurisdictions require drinking fountains to be wheelchair accessible (by sticking out horizontally from the wall), and to include an additional unit of a lower height for children and short adults. The design that this replaced often had one spout atop a refrigeration unit.

Use of the words ''water fountain'' and ''drinking fountain'' vary across regional dialects of English.

Before potable water was provided in private homes, water for drinking was made available to citizens of cities through access to public fountains. Many of these early public drinking fountains can still be seen (and used) in cities such as Rome, with its many ''fontanelle'' and ''nasoni'' (big noses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fountains: splash and spectacle|last=Symmes|first=Marilyn, ed.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=1998|isbn=0-500-23758-1|location=London|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mid-19th century [[London]], water provision from private [[water companies]] was generally inadequate for the rapidly growing population and was often contaminated. Legislation in the mid nineteenth century formed the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]], made water filtration compulsory, and moved water intakes on the [[Thames]] above the sewage outlets. In this context, the public drinking fountain movement began. It built the first public baths and public drinking fountains.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Davies|title=Troughs and Drinking Fountains|ISBN=0-7011-3369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, the [[The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association|Metropolitan Free Drinking Fountain Association]] was established in 1859. The first fountain was built on Holborn Hill on the railings of the church of [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]] on Snow Hill, paid for by Samuel Gurney, and opened on 21 April 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel/otherart/water.htm |title=Victorian fountains |publisher=The website of Bob Speel |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain became immediately popular, used by 7,000 people a day. In the next six years 85 fountains were built, with much of the funding coming directly from the association. The movement soon became associated with the [[temperance movement]] as they provided a substitute for [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and were purposely positioned outside [[public house]]s.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

Muddied and bad tasting drinking water encouraged many Americans to drink alcohol for health purposes, so temperance groups constructed [[temperance fountain|public drinking fountains]] throughout the United States following the Civil War. The National [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (NWCTU)'s organizing convention of 1874 encouraged its attendees to erect the fountains in their hometowns. The NWCTU advocated the fountains as a means to discourage people from entering saloons for refreshment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCTU Drinking Fountains - Then and Now|url=http://www.wctu.org/fountains.html|work=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|publisher=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=|year=1996–2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014112806/http://wctu.org/fountains.html|archivedate=14 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NWCTU sponsored temperance fountains in towns and cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wctu.org/fountains.html WCTU Drinking Fountains &amp;ndash; Then and Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014112806/http://wctu.org/fountains.html |date=2011-10-14 }}, from Woman's Christian Temperance Union.&lt;/ref&gt;

After many of the aqueducts were destroyed after the siege of Paris in the 1870s, the Parisian poor had no access to fresh water. Richard Wallace, an Englishman, used the money from an inheritance to fund the construction of 50 drinking fountains (ever after known as ‘Wallace fountains’). Designed by Charles-Auguste Lebourg with four caryatids atop a green cylindrical base, these fountains have become iconic symbols of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paris et ses fontaines de la Renaissance a nos jours|last=Massounie|first=Dominique, Pauline Prevost-Marcilhacy and Daniel Rabreau|publisher=Delegation a l’action artistique de la ville de Paris|year=1995|isbn=2-905-118-80-6|location=Paris|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provision of drinking fountains in the United Kingdom was also linked to the [[temperance movement in the United Kingdom]], with the [[Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association]] in London drawing support from temperance advocates.  Many of its fountains were sited opposite [[public house]]s. The evangelical movement was encouraged to build fountains in churchyards to encourage the poor to see churches as supporting them. Many fountains have inscriptions such as "Jesus said whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water I shall give him shall never thirst". By 1877, the association was widely accepted and [[Queen Victoria]] donated money for a fountain in [[Esher]]. Many fountains, within London and outside, were called temperance fountains or would have a representation of the Greek mythical figure [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]].

A movement concerned with [[animal welfare]] resulted in the founding of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] in 1866. One of its concerns was the difficulty of finding fresh water for work horses in urban areas. Combination drinking fountains that provided a bubbler for people and a water trough for horses, and sometimes a lower basin for dogs, became popular. In particular, over 120 [[National Humane Alliance fountains]] were donated to communities across the United States between 1903 and 1913. The fountains were the gift of philanthropist Hermon Lee Ensign.

Drinking fountains were also built in the United States beginning in 1889 by the then-small Kohler Water Works (now [[Kohler Company]]) in [[Kohler, Wisconsin]], a company already established as a faucet producer.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The original 'Bubbler' shot water one inch straight into the air, creating a bubbling texture, and the excess water ran back down over the sides of the nozzle. Several years later the Bubbler adopted the more sanitary arc projection, which also allowed the user to drink more easily from it. At the start of the 20th century, it was discovered that the original vertical design was related to the spread of many [[contagious diseases]].&lt;ref name="aquasana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it Safe to Drink from Public Drinking Water Fountains?|url=http://www.aquasana.com/blog/2010/06/is-it-safe-to-drink-from-public-drinking-water-fountains/|work=aquasana|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109172747/http://www.aquasana.com/blog/2010/06/is-it-safe-to-drink-from-public-drinking-water-fountains/|archivedate=9 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking fountains in the United States were often subject to [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], until all legally enforced public segregation (segregation de jure) was abolished by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

In recent studies, it has been found that some drinking fountains have been contaminated with [[pathogens]] such as [[bacteria]]. In one study, a virus commonly known to cause diarrhea in young children known as the rotavirus has been found on drinking fountains in child [[day care]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterandhealth.org/public-water-fountains-gone/ |last=Bernard |first=Bruce |title=Where Have All the (Public Water) Fountains Gone? |publisher=Water quality and health |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to cases in the past where children have fallen ill due to [[coliform bacteria]] poisoning, many governments have placed strict regulations on drinking fountain designs. The vertical spout design{{clarify|date=October 2015}} is now illegal in most US jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Some governments even require water spouts to be as long as four inches to meet health standards.&lt;ref name="aquasana" /&gt; It is also recommended for young children to allow drinking fountains to run before drinking, as the water may also be contaminated with [[Lead (metal)|lead]]. This is especially common in older buildings with obsolete [[plumbing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Drinking Water in Schools|url=http://www.nrdc.org/greensquad/library/water_drink.asp|work=The Green Squad|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, this fear of contamination in tap water was hyped by producers of bottled water, thereby changing attitudes to publicly provided water in drinking fountains, which began to disappear from city streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-dont-trust-drinking-fountains-anymore-and-thats-bad-for-our-health/2015/07/02/24eca9bc-15f0-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6d2af58c326a|title=We don’t trust water fountains anymore, and that’s bad for our health|last=Pierre-Louis|first=Kendra|date=July 8, 2015|work=The Washington Post|access-date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Terminology==
The term ''bubbler'' is used in some regional [[dialects]] of the United States and in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/5/5-1377.html |title=LINGUIST List Sum: Use of bubbler as a synonym for drinking fountain |last=Christensen |first=Sean |date=2 December 1994 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of US dialects undertaken between 2002 and 2004 found the word ''bubbler'' is commonly used in southern and eastern Wisconsin and in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The phrase ''drinking fountain'' was common in the rest of the inland north and in the west, while ''water fountain'' dominated other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csumc.wisc.edu/wep/map.htm |title=Bubbler map |year=2004 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bubbler'' is sometimes used in the [[Portland, Oregon]], region where in the early 1900s former Wisconsin resident [[Simon Benson]] installed 20 fountains, which are now known in the Portland area as "[[Benson Bubbler]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Zeb Larson. [http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/benson_bubblers/ "Benson Bubblers"]. ''[[The Oregon Encyclopedia]]''. Retrieved 11 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are 52 of these iconic four-bowl drinking fountains still providing free-flowing water in downtown Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/water/article/352768|title=Benson Bubblers|last=|first=|date=|website=Portland Water Bureau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Outdoors==
Frost-resistant drinking fountains are used outdoors in cold climates and keep the control mechanisms below the frostline resulting in a delay for when water comes out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivanov|first1=Jossie|title=Frost-Proof Fountains|url=http://drinkingfountains.blogspot.ca/2014/03/frost-proof-fountains.html|website=Drinking Fountains|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ECA stack''' is a drug combination used in weight loss and as a [[stimulant]]. ECA is an initialism for [[ephedrine]], [[caffeine]], and [[aspirin]], with variants of it including the EC stack, which removes the aspirin for those who can not tolerate it. [[Dietary supplements]] based on or including elements of ECA were popular through the 1990s and early 2000s, but the marketing of ephedra- or ephedrine-containing stimulant combinations for weight loss and bodybuilding is now restricted or illegal in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and Netherlands due to reports of heart attack, stroke, and death associated with these supplements.&lt;ref name="fda-rule"/&gt;&lt;ref name="health-canada"/&gt;

==Efficacy ==
While it was available as a supplement, ECA was marketed with claims that it would aid weight loss, improve athletic performance and increase "energy".

===Fat loss===
Placebo-controlled studies have consistently found ephedrine in combination with caffeine to be effective in promoting moderate fat loss in the already-[[obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8384187 | volume=17 Suppl 1 | title=Ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin: safety and efficacy for treatment of human obesity | year=1993 | journal=Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. | pages=S73–8 |vauthors=Daly PA, Krieger DR, Dulloo AG, Young JB, Landsberg L }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis combining results from all available studies estimated average weight loss of 1&amp;nbsp;kg/month more than placebo.&lt;ref name="risk_meta" /&gt;

===Athletic performance===
There is insufficient evidence to support use of ephedra for athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=196247&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Natural supplements that contain ephedra (aka ''[[Ma Huang]]'') as an ephedrine substitute have been linked to cases of heart attack, stroke, and death in healthy young adults even when taken at the labeled dosage.&lt;ref&gt;''"The use of dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids may pose a health risk to some persons. These findings indicate the need for a better understanding of individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of such dietary supplements."'' [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/343/25/1833 Christine A. Haller, M.D., and Neal L. Benowitz, M.D. "Adverse Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Events Associated with Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra Alkaloids"] New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 343:1833-1838 12/21/2000, Number 25&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2003 meta-analysis of all available studies and case reports concluded that: "ephedrine- and ephedra-containing dietary supplements [...] have harms in terms of a 2- to 3-fold increase in psychiatric symptoms, autonomic symptoms, upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and heart palpitations. More serious adverse effects from ephedra use cannot be excluded at a rate less than 1.0 per thousand, and case reports raise the possibility that a causal relationship with serious adverse events may exist."&lt;ref name="risk_meta"&gt;[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/289/12/1537 Paul G. Shekelle, MD, PhD; Mary L. Hardy, MD; [[Sally C. Morton]], PhD; Margaret Maglione, MPP; Walter A. Mojica, MD, MPH; Marika J. Suttorp, MS; Shannon Lt "prescription of an ephedrine/caffeine product was not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This was found across a wide range of patient subgroups, different cardiovascular outcomes, different assumptions about exposure, and different utilization pattern.

==Legal status==
Due to deaths linked to ephedra-containing dietary supplements and the potential use of ephedrine as a precursor in illegal [[methamphetamine]] manufacture, many countries have taken steps to regulate these products.

===Status in The United States===
In the United States, it is illegal to market products containing ephedrine or ephedra alkaloids as a [[dietary supplement]].&lt;ref name="fda-rule"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date = August 22, 2006 | accessdate = July 7, 2009 | title = Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids | url = http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm152388.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[ephedra]], a botanical source of ephedrine alkaloids, was banned by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] due to serious safety concerns, injuries, and deaths linked to ephedra-containing supplements. However, ephedrine itself has never been illegal in the United States and is currently available over-the-counter. Reporting requirements and quantity limitations vary by state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ephedrine/ephedrine_law.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

A Congressional report said that when an ephedra supplement company, [[Metabolife]], in the USA was forced to release adverse event reports, cardiac and psychological reports were recorded in healthy young people at normal dosages.&lt;ref name="Metabolife_Adverse_Events"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141223212556/http://oversight-archive.waxman.house.gov/documents/20040827102309-56026.pdf Minority Staff Report, Special Investigations Division "Adverse Event Reports from Metabolife"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status in Canada===
In January 2002, [[Health Canada]] issued a voluntary recall of all ephedrine products containing more than 8&amp;nbsp;mg per dose, all combinations of ephedrine with other stimulants such as caffeine, and all ephedrine products marketed for weight-loss or bodybuilding indications, citing a serious risk to health.&lt;ref name="health-canada"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/2002/2002_01_e.html  | title = Health Canada requests recall of certain products containing Ephedra/ephedrine | publisher = [[Health Canada]] | date = January 9, 2002 | accessdate = July 7, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206073244/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/2002/2002_01_e.html |archivedate = February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status in Denmark===
An EC formulation called ''Letigen'' which combined 20&amp;nbsp;mg of synthetic ephedrine and 200&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine (recommended dose: 1-3 pills per day depending on user tolerance) was approved for sale by prescription in Denmark in 1990. During the peak of its use (in 1999) roughly 2% of the Danish population was using it.&lt;ref name="denmark"/&gt; That product's marketing was discontinued in 2002 upon the same sort of adverse reports seen in other countries.&lt;ref name="denmark"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hallas Jesper |author2=Bjerrum Lars |author3=Støvring Henrik |author4=Andersen Morten | year = 2008 | title = Use of a Prescribed Ephedrine/Caffeine Combination and the Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Events: A Registry-based Case-Crossover Study | quote = Prescribed ephedrine/caffeine was not associated with a substantially increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this study.| journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 168 | issue = 8| pages = 966–973 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwn191 | pmid=18756018 | pmc=2565736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pandemic is not homogeneous within regions, with some countries more afflicted than others. Even at the country level, there are wide variations in infection levels between different areas.

HIV infection is becoming [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to just over 12% of the world’s population but two-thirds of all people infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="aidsdayrpt2011" /&gt; The adult HIV prevalence rate is 5.0% and between 21.6 million and 24.1 million total are affected.&lt;ref name="aidsdayrpt2011" /&gt; However, the actual prevalence varies between regions. Presently, [[Southern Africa]] is the hardest hit region, with adult prevalence rates exceeding 20% in most countries in the region, and 30% in [[Swaziland]] and [[Botswana]].

[[Eastern Africa]] also experiences relatively high levels of prevalence with estimates above 10% in some countries, although there are signs that the pandemic is declining in this region. [[West Africa]] on the other hand has been much less affected by the pandemic.
Several countries reportedly have prevalence rates around 2 to 3%, and no country has rates above 10%. In Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, two of the region's most populous countries, between 5 and 7% of adults are reported to carry the virus.

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, more women are infected with HIV than men, with 13 women infected for every 10 infected men. This gender gap continues to grow. Throughout the region, women are being infected with HIV at earlier ages than men. The differences in infection levels between women and men are most pronounced among young people (aged 15–24 years). In this age group, there are 36 women infected with HIV for every 10 men. The widespread prevalence of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, the [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030101607.html|title=Speeding HIV's Deadly Spread|last=Timberg|first=Craig|date=2007-03-02|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-12|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of [[scarification]], [[Blood transfusion|unsafe blood transfusions]], and the poor state of [[hygiene]] and [[nutrition]] in some areas may all be facilitating factors in the transmission of HIV-1 (Bentwich et al., 1995).

Mother-to-child transmission is another contributing factor in the transmission of HIV-1 in developing nations. Due to a lack of testing, a shortage in antenatal therapies and through the feeding of contaminated breast milk, 590,000 infants born in developing countries are infected with HIV-1 per year. In 2000, the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] estimated that 25% of the units of blood transfused in Africa were not tested for HIV, and that 10% of HIV infections in Africa were transmitted via blood.

Poor economic conditions (leading to the use of dirty needles in healthcare clinics) and lack of [[sex education]] contribute to high rates of infection. In some African countries, 25% or more of the working adult population is HIV-positive. Poor economic conditions caused by slow onset-emergencies, such as drought, or rapid onset natural disasters and conflict can result in young women and girls being forced into using sex as a survival strategy.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;Samuels, Fiona (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2645&amp;title=hiv-aids-emergencies HIV and emergencies: one size does not fit all] London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still, research indicates that as emergencies, such as drought, take their toll and the number of potential 'clients' decreases, women are forced by clients to accept greater risks, such as not using contraceptives.&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"/&gt;

[[AIDS denialism|AIDS-denialist]] policies have impeded the creation of effective programs for distribution of antiretroviral drugs.  Denialist policies by former South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s administration led to several hundred thousand unnecessary deaths.&lt;ref name=chigwedere&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Seage GR, Gruskin S, Lee TH, Essex M |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes |volume= 49|issue= 4|pages= 410–415|date=October 2008 |pmid=19186354 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818a6cd5 |laysummary=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NattrassAA&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nattrass N |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=African Affairs |volume=107 |issue=427 |pages=157–76 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adm087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNAIDS]] estimates that in 2005 there were 5.5 million people in South Africa infected with HIV — 12.4% of the population. This was an increase of 200,000 people since 2003.

Although HIV infection rates are much lower in [[Nigeria]] than in other African countries, the size of Nigeria's population meant that by the end of 2003, there were an estimated 3.6 million people infected. On the other hand, Uganda, [[Zambia]], [[Senegal]], and most recently Botswana have begun intervention and educational measures to slow the spread of HIV, and Uganda has succeeded in actually reducing its HIV infection rate.

===Middle East and North Africa===

HIV/AIDS prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa is around 0.2% (0.1–0.7%), with between 230,000 and 1.4 million people infected. Among young people 15–24 years of age, 0.3% of women [0.1–0.8%] and 0.17% of men [0.1–0.3%] were living with HIV infection by the end of 2004.

Approximately 500,000 people are living with HIV in the MENA region. This number is 
estimated at 470,000 (350,000–570,000) without Afghanistan and Pakistan (which are not 
considered by UNAIDS geographic definition as part of MENA region), and reaches 580,000

Despite the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the MENA region, there are epidemics among vulnerable groups with an evidence of substantial proportion of local spread within the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sallam|first1=Malik|last2=Şahin|first2=Gülşen Özkaya|last3=Ingman|first3=Mikael|last4=Widell|first4=Anders|last5=Esbjörnsson|first5=Joakim|last6=Medstrand|first6=Patrik|title=Genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission in the Middle East and North Africa|journal=Heliyon|date=July 2017|volume=3|issue=7|pages=e00352|doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00352|pmid=28725873|url=http://www.heliyon.com/article/e00352/|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, the prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men in Egypt is estimated to be 5.0%–9.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the Middle East: Low Prevalence but Not Low Risk|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/hiv-aids-in-middle-east.aspx|website=pbr.org|publisher=Population Reference Bureau|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South and South-East Asia===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[HIV]] --&gt;
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Asia}}
The HIV prevalence rate in South and South-East Asia is less than 0.35 percent, with total of 4.2 – 4.7 million adults and children infected. More AIDS deaths (480,000) occur in this region than in any other except sub-Saharan Africa. The geographical size and human diversity of South and South-East Asia have resulted in HIV epidemics differing across the region.

In South and Southeast Asia, the HIV epidemic remains largely concentrated in [[injecting drug user]]s, [[men who have sex with men]], [[sex worker]]s, and clients of sex workers and their immediate sexual partners.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In the Philippines, in particular, sexual contact between males comprise the majority of new infections. An HIV surveillance study conducted by Dr. [[Louie Mar Gangcuangco]] and colleagues from the [[University of the Philippines]]-[[Philippine General Hospital]] showed that out of 406 MSM tested for HIV in Metro Manila, HIV prevalence was 11.8% (95% confidence interval: 8.7- 15.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gangcuangco LM, Tan ML, Berba RP | date = Sep 2013 | title = Prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection among men having sex with men in Metro Manila, Philippines | url = http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2013-44-5/10-5743-12.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health | volume = 44 | issue = 5| pages = 810–816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gangcuangco, et al. {{cite web |url=http://www.iasociety.org/Abstracts/A200739361.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213252/http://www.iasociety.org/Abstracts/A200739361.aspx |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants, in particular, are vulnerable and 67% of those infected in [[Bangladesh]] and 41% in [[Nepal]] are migrants returning from India.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Fiona Samuels and Sanju Wagle 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5733&amp;title=hiv-aids-migration-emphasis-bangladesh-nepal-india Population mobility and HIV and AIDS: review of laws, policies and treaties between Bangladesh, Nepal and India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024611/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5733&amp;title=hiv-aids-migration-emphasis-bangladesh-nepal-india |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to [[human trafficking]] and exploitation, but also because even those migrants who willingly go to India in search of work are often afraid to access state health services due to concerns over their immigration status.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===East Asia===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Asia}}
The national HIV prevalence levels in East Asia is 0.1% in the adult (15–49) group. However, due to the large populations of many East Asian nations, this low national HIV prevalence still means that large numbers of people are infected with HIV.  The picture in this region is dominated by China. Much of the current spread of HIV in China is through injecting drug use and paid sex. In China, the number was estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million by independent researchers, with some estimates going much higher.

In the rural areas of China, where large numbers of farmers, especially in [[Henan]] province, participated in unclean [[blood transfusion]]s; estimates of those infected are in the tens of thousands. In Japan, just over half of [[HIV/AIDS in Japan|HIV/AIDS cases]] are officially recorded as occurring amongst [[homosexuality|homosexual]] men, with the remainder occurring amongst heterosexuals and also via [[drug abuse]], [[perinatal|in the womb]] or unknown means.

In East Asia, men who have sex with men account for 18% of new HIV/AIDS cases and are therefore a key affected group along with sex workers and their clients who makeup 29% of new cases. This is also a noteworthy aspect because men who have sex with men had a prevalence of at least 5% or higher in countries in Asia and Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/asia-pacific/overview|title=HIV and AIDS in Asia &amp; the Pacific regional overview {{!}} Avert|website=www.avert.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caribbean====
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean}}
The Caribbean is the second-most affected region in the world.&lt;ref name="aidsdayrpt2011" /&gt; Among adults aged 15–44, AIDS has become the leading cause of death. The region's adult prevalence rate is 0.9%.&lt;ref name="aidsdayrpt2011" /&gt; with national rates ranging up to 2.7%.&lt;ref name=UNAIDS2005&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]] |year=2005 |title=AIDS epidemic update 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV transmission occurs largely through heterosexual intercourse. A greater number of people who get infected with HIV/AIDS are heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voelker|first1=Rebecca|title=HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean|journal=JAMA|volume=285|issue=23|pages=2961–3|date=2001|doi=10.1001/jama.285.23.2961|pmid=11410079|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193933}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two-thirds of AIDS cases in this region attributed to this route. Sex between men is also a significant route of transmission, even though it is heavily stigmatised and illegal in many areas. HIV transmission through injecting drug use remains rare, except in Bermuda and Puerto Rico.

Within the Caribbean, the country with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS is the Bahamas with a rate of 3.2% of adults with the disease. However, when comparing rates from 2004 to 2013, the number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV decreased by 4% over those years. Increased education and treatment drugs will help to decrease incidence levels even more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/caribbean|title=HIV and AIDS in the Caribbean {{!}} Avert|website=www.avert.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central and South America====
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Latin America}}
The populations of Central and South America have approximately 1.6 million people currently living with HIV and this number has remained relatively unvarying with having a prevalence of approximately .4%. In Latin America, those living with the disease have received help in the form of Antiretroviral treatment, with 75% of people with HIV receiving the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/regions/latinamerica|title=Latin America and the Caribbean {{!}} UNAIDS|website=www.unaids.org|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these regions of the American continent, only [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]] have national HIV prevalence of over 1%. In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1.

With HIV/AIDS incidence levels rising in Central America, education is the most important step in controlling the spread of this disease. In Central America, many people do not have access to treatment drugs. This results in 8–14% of people dying from AIDS in Honduras. To reduce the incidence levels of HIV/AIDS, education and drug access needs to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=HIV/AIDS training for C. America Garifuna health care workers|last=Carrillo|first=Karen Jaunita|date=30 September 2004|work=The New York Amsterdam News|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of immigrants traveling to Europe, all asymptomatic persons were tested for a variety of infectious diseases. The prevalence of HIV among the 383 immigrants from Latin America was low, with only one person testing positive for a HIV infection. This data was collected from a group of immigrants with the majority from Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monge-Maillo|first=Begoña|last2=López-Vélez|first2=Rogelio|last3=Norman|first3=Francesca F.|last4=Ferrere-González|first4=Federico|last5=Martínez-Pérez|first5=Ángela|last6=Pérez-Molina|first6=José Antonio|date=2015-04-01|title=Screening of Imported Infectious Diseases Among Asymptomatic Sub-Saharan African and Latin American Immigrants: A Public Health Challenge|url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/92/4/848|journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|language=en|volume=92|issue=4|pages=848–856|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.14-0520|issn=0002-9637|pmc=4385785|pmid=25646257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the United States|HIV/AIDS in Canada}}
Since the epidemic began in the early 1980s, 1,216,917 people have been diagnosed with AIDS in the US, with 1.1 million people  in 2014 living with HIV. 1 in 7 of them are not aware of it, with an estimated 161,200 (13%) not having been diagnosed. In 2015, 39,513 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the United States, a decrease of 19% from 2005 to 2014. The decrease may be due to targeted HIV prevention efforts, but progress has been uneven, and diagnoses have increased among a few groups. [[Men who had sex with men]] accounted for approximately 8 out of 10 HIV diagnoses among males. Diagnoses dropped 18% overall among white homosexual and bisexual men, but rose 24% among Hispanic/Latino and 22% among African American homosexual and bisexual men (87% among those aged 13 to 24), respectively. HIV diagnoses declined 35% among all heterosexuals (heterosexual contact accounting for 24% of HIV diagnoses), and 63% among people who inject drugs. Diagnoses also declined 40% among all women, and 42% among African American women. Regionally, the population rates (per 100,000 people) of persons diagnosed with HIV infection in 2015 were highest in the South (16.8), followed by the Northeast (11.6), the West (9.8), and the Midwest (7.6).&lt;ref name="CDCataglance"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: At A Glance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=USA.gov|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV continues to be through male homosexual sexual relations. In general, recent studies have shown that 1 in 5 gay and bisexual men were infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="Campaign"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community|title=HIV and the LGBT Community {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2014, in the United States, 83% of new HIV diagnoses among all males aged 13 and older and 67% of the total estimated new diagnoses were among homosexual and bisexual men. Those aged 13 to 24 also accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/msm/cdc-hiv-msm.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIDS is one of the top three causes of death for African American men aged 25–54 and for African American women aged 35–44 years in the United States of America. In the United States, African Americans make up about 48% of the total HIV-positive population and make up more than half of new HIV cases, despite making up only 12% of the population. The main route of transmission for women is through unprotected heterosexual sex. African American women are 19 times more likely to contract HIV than other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art8839.html |title=Kaiser Daily HIV/AIDS Report Summarizes Opinion Pieces on U.S. AIDS Epidemic |publisher=The Body – The Complete HIV/AIDS Resource  |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, there  was increased awareness that  young [[African American|African-American]] women in particular were at high risk for HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/07/29/black.aids.report/index.html|title=Report: Black U.S. AIDS rates rival some African nations|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, African Americans made up 10% of the population but about half of the HIV/AIDS cases nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/03/MNFE1DOUVC.

Since 1985, the incidence of HIV infection among women had been steadily increasing. In 2005 it was estimated that at least 27% of new HIV infections were in women.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 2005. Vol. 17. Rev ed. Atlanta: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC: 2007:1–46.

Accessed  28 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been increasing concern for the concurrency of violence surrounding women infected with HIV. In 2012, a meta-analysis showed that the rates of psychological trauma, including Intimate Partner Violence and PTSD in HIV positive women were more than five times and twice the national averages, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Machtinger EL, Wilson TC, Haberer JE, Weiss DS. Psychological trauma and PTSD in HIV-positive women: a meta-analysis.

There are also geographic disparities in AIDS prevalence in the United States, where it is most common in the large [[cities]] of California, esp. [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] and the East Coast, ex. [[New York City]] and in urban cities of the [[Deep South]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/reports/2005report/pdf/2005SurveillanceReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927133853/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/reports/2005report/pdf/2005SurveillanceReport.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates are lower in [[Utah]], [[Texas]], and Northern [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, has the nation's highest rate of infection, at 3%. This rate is comparable to what is seen in west Africa, and is considered a severe epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/health/aids-epidemic-in-washington-dc1819.html|title=AIDS epidemic in Washington, DC|author=|date=|website=pri.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in particular, a new wave of infection is being blamed on the use of [[methamphetamine]], known as crystal meth. Research presented at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference in [[Boston]] in February 2005 concluded that using crystal meth or [[cocaine]] is the biggest single risk factor for becoming HIV+ among US gay men, contributing 29% of the overall risk of becoming positive and 28% of the overall risk of being the receptive partner in [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name="lifeormeth.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeormeth.com/ |title=Life or Meth |accessdate=2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several renowned clinical psychologists now cite methamphetamine as the biggest problem facing gay men today, including Michael Majeski, who believes meth is the catalyst for at least 80% of seroconversions currently occurring across the United States, and Tony Zimbardi, who calls methamphetamine the number one cause of HIV transmission, and says that high rates of new HIV infection are not being found among non-crystal users. In addition, various HIV and STD clinics across the United States report anecdotal evidence that 75% of new HIV seroconversions they deal with are methamphetamine-related; indeed, in [[Los Angeles]], methamphetamine is regarded as the main cause of HIV [[seroconversion]] among gay men in their late thirties.&lt;ref name="lifeormeth.com"/&gt; The chemical "methamphetamine", in and of itself, cannot infect someone with HIV.

In Canada, nearly 60,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/aids-sida/research/index-eng.php|title=The State of the HIV/AIDS Pandemic|work=[[Public Health Agency of Canada]]|accessdate=2010-01-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100104092334/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/aids-sida/research/index-eng.php| archivedate= 4 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HIV-positive population continues to increase in Canada, with the greatest increases amongst [[aboriginal Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aids/|title=CBC News In Depth – AIDS|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2008-12-01|date=1 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081204120823/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/aids/| archivedate= 4 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Western Europe, the death rate from AIDS in North America fell sharply with the introduction of combination AIDS therapies (HAART).

===Eastern Europe and Central Asia===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia}}
There is growing concern about a rapidly growing epidemic in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], where an estimated 1.23–3.7 million people were infected as of December 2011, though the adult (15–49) prevalence rate is low (1.1%). The rate of HIV infections began to grow rapidly from the mid-1990s, due to social and economic collapse, increased levels of intravenous drug use and increased numbers of prostitutes. By 2010 the number of reported cases in [[Russia]] was over 450,000 according to the [[World Health Organization]], up from 15,000 in 1995 and 190,000 in 2002; some estimates claim the real number is up to eight times higher, well over 2 million. There are predictions that the infection rate in Russia will continue to rise quickly, since education there about AIDS is almost non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Strategic and International Studies. http://csis.org/program/hivaids&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukraine]] and [[Estonia]] also have growing numbers of infected people, with estimates of 650,000 and 4,400 respectively in 2011. The disease is now officially epidemic in this region, which means that prevention strategies may not be able to halt and reverse its spread. Also, transmission of HIV is increasing through sexual contact and drug use among the young (&lt;30 years). Indeed, over 84% of current AIDS cases in this region occur in non-drug-using heterosexuals less than 26 years of age.

===Western Europe===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Western Europe}}
In most countries of Western Europe, AIDS cases have fallen to levels not seen since the original outbreak; many attribute this trend to aggressive educational campaigns, screening of blood transfusions and increased use of condoms. Also, the death rate from AIDS in Western Europe has fallen sharply, as new AIDS therapies have proven to be an effective (though expensive) means of suppressing HIV.

In this area, the routes of transmission of HIV is diverse, including paid sex, injecting drug use, mother to child, male with male sex and heterosexual sex.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} However, many new infections in this region occur through contact with HIV-infected individuals from other regions. The adult (15–49) prevalence in this region is 0.3% with between 570,000 and 890,000 people currently infected with HIV. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS deaths have stayed low since the lows of the late 1990s. However, in some countries, a large share of HIV infections remain undiagnosed and there is worrying evidence of antiretroviral drug resistance among some newly HIV-infected individuals in this region.

===Oceania===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Australia|HIV/AIDS in New Zealand|HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea}}
There is a very large range of national situations regarding AIDS and HIV in this region. This is due in part to the large distances between the islands of Oceania. The wide range of development in the region also plays an important role. The prevalence is estimated at between 0.2% and 0.7%, with between 45,000 and 120,000 adults and children currently infected with HIV.

Papua New Guinea has one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the region. According to UNAIDS, HIV cases in the country have been increasing at a rate of 30 percent annually since 1997, and the country's HIV prevalence rate in late 2006 was 1.3%.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/asia/papua_new_guinea_profile.pdf Health Profile: Papua New Guinea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214223546/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/asia/papua_new_guinea_profile.pdf |date=14 February 2009 }}. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (September 2008). Accessed 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIDS and society ==
In June 2001, the [[United Nations]] held a Special General Assembly to intensify international action to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a [[global health|global health issue]], and to mobilize the resources needed towards this aim, labelling the situation a "global crisis".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS. New York, 25–27 June 2001 – http://www.un.org/ga/aids/conference.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the social effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, some sociologists suggest that AIDS has caused a "profound re-[[medicalisation]] of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Aggleton, Peter |author2=Parker, Richard Bordeaux |author3=Barbosa, Regina Maria |title=Framing the sexual subject: the politics of gender, sexuality, and power |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-520-21838-3 |oclc= |doi=}} p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carole S. |last=Vance | title=Anthropology Rediscovers Sexuality: A Theoretical Comment | journal= Social Science and Medicine | volume=33 |issue=8 |pages= 875–884 |year=1991 | pmid = 1745914 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(91)90259-F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors also influence HIV/AIDS. A 2003 study states that HIV and AIDS are less prevalent in [[Muslim]] populations and speculates that this may be due to the effect of several [[Islam]]ic tenets, such as avoidance of [[alcohol]] leading to less risky sexual behavior and benefits arising from [[circumcision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Peter B. ([[Harvard University]])|title=HIV and Islam: is HIV prevalence lower among Muslims?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=58|issue=9|date=May 2004|pages=1751–6|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00367-8|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | pmid = 14990375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8155">Although Senegal is a relatively underdeveloped country, [[HIV]] prevalence in the general population is low at around 0.08 per 1000 people, under 1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/senegal|title=Senegal|website=www.unaids.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relatively low prevalence rate is aided by the fact that few people are infected every year– in 2016, 1100 new cases were reported vs 48,000 new cases in Brazil. Senegal's death due to HIV rate, particularly when compared it to its HIV prevalence rate, is relatively high with 1600 deaths in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aidsinfo.unaids.org/|title=AIDSinfo {{!}} UNAIDS|website=aidsinfo.unaids.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost two times as many women were infected with HIV as men in 2016, and while almost three times as many women were receiving [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ARV) as men, only 52% of HIV positive people in Senegal received ARV treatment in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One way that Senegal maintains a low HIV prevalence is through conservative cultural norms that discourage sex outside of marriage, limiting the number of sexual partners an average Senegalese person will have and thus limiting their chance of coming into contact with the virus. The government also passed legislation to make working closely with sex workers to ensure they get regular [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]] and HIV tests and treatment possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnacq950.pdf|title=HIV/AIDS in Senegal: A USAID Brief|last=|first=|date=July 2002|website=US AID|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senegal also has had huge public health campaigns to promote condom usage. Senegalese hospitals have also had their blood supplies screened for syphilis and hepatitis since 1970, leading to the removal of some blood contaminated with HIV before an HIV antibody test was created. Currently, hospitals are well equipped with sterile equipment in order to prevent transmission of HIV by hospital procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== New infection statistics ==
In the general population, 80% of new infections occur in people in monogamous relationships. According to Senegal's AIDS authority, among the newly infected, three-quarters of people engage in some high risk behavior. About one quarter of the newly infected engage in high risk behaviors themselves and about half of the newly infected have a partner who engages in high risk activities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnls-senegal.org/index.php/2013-03-19-10-58-33/plan-strategique-2014-2017|title=Conseil National de Lutte contre le Sida - Plan Stratégique 2014-2017|last=yacine|website=www.cnls-senegal.org|language=fr-fr|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because homosexuality is illegal in Senegal, many MSMs have long term female partners as well as male partners, so many women unknowingly have a partner who is in a high risk group.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== At risk populations ===
While the overall HIV prevalence rate in Senegal is low, the prevalence rate is significantly higher in certain populations. Among men who have sex with men (MSM), the prevalence rate is around 19% and among sex workers, the prevalence rate is close to 22%. As a result, the Senegalese government has put emphasis on preventing transmission of the virus from these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drame|first=Fatou Maria|last2=Foley|first2=Ellen E.|date=2015-05-01|title=HIV/AIDS in mid-sized cities in Senegal: From individual to place-based vulnerability|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614007709|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=133|issue=Supplement C|pages=296–303|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HIV transmission rate in MSM communities has not decreased, partially because Senegal maintains laws against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wade|first=Abdoulaye S.|last2=Larmarange|first2=Joseph|last3=Diop|first3=Abdou K.|last4=Diop|first4=Oulimata|last5=Gueye|first5=Khady|last6=Marra|first6=Adama|last7=Sene|first7=Amsata|last8=Enel|first8=Catherine|last9=Diallo|first9=Pape Niang|date=2010-04-01|title=Reduction in risk-taking behaviors among MSM in Senegal between 2004 and 2007 and prevalence of HIV and other STIs.

Despite the later overturning of their convictions, the arrests created fear and suspicion in the MSM community.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The Senegalese government provides medical services to registered sex workers, but in recent years, the number of covert sex workers has been increasing. These unregistered sex workers cannot access sex worker-specific government health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Ellen E.|last2=Nguer|first2=Rokhaya|date=2010-12-01|title=Courting success in HIV/AIDS prevention: the challenges of addressing aconcentrated epidemic in Senegal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085906.2010.545628|journal=African Journal of AIDS Research|volume=9|issue=4|pages=325–336|doi=10.2989/16085906.2010.545628|issn=1608-5906|pmid=25875881}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 80% of all Senegalese sex workers may be unregistered. As a result, most sex workers do not have access to government sponsored STI and HIV testing and education about HIV prevention.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Diouf,  D.  (2007) HIV/AIDS  Policy  in  Senegal:  A  Civil  Society Perspective. New York, Open Society Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National response==
Unlike many African countries which denied the existence of the HIV epidemic, Senegal responded quickly when its first AIDS case was diagnosed in 1986. The Programme National de Lutte contre le SIDA (PNLS) was established to coordinate the government's anti-AIDS activity in 1986 and was later renamed the Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA (CNLS).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Senegalese government worked in cooperation with religious leaders and health professionals in order to maximize the reach of HIV/AIDS prevention education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition to working with religious figures to enhance public cooperation, the Senegalese government ran a condom marketing campaign and distributed more than 10 million free condoms in partnership with [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] in order to try to limit HIV transmission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many HIV positive people make efforts to hide their status because there is much discrimination against them, which complicates the government's attempts to provide services to the HIV positive population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Senegalese government is still working to stop the spread of AIDS. CNLS's goals for 2030 include zero new infections, zero deaths tied to AIDS, and zero discrimination against HIV-positive Senegalese citizens.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Health On the Net Foundation (HON)''' is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1995 under the auspices of the Geneva Department of Employment, Social Affairs and Health and based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. This came about following the gathering of 60 of the world's foremost experts on [[telemedicine]] to discuss the growing concerns over the unequal quality of online health information. The unanimous conclusion of this gathering was to create a permanent body that would, in the words of the program, "promote the effective and reliable use of the new technologies for telemedicine in healthcare around the world". The HON Foundation became one of the first organizations to guide both lay users and medical professionals to reliable sources of health information in cyberspace.

== Mission ==
The mission of the foundation is to guide the growing community of healthcare consumers and providers on the Internet to sound, reliable medical information and expertise. In this way, HON seeks to contribute to improved health care through patient empowerment and better informed health professionals.

== The Foundation ==
Health On the Net holds consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC)]] and a special relationship with the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]. The French National Health Authority appointed Health On the Net in 2007 as its official body to certify health websites based in France.

As a “Liaison A” to the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] Health Informatics Technical Committee (ISO/TC 215), Health On the Net contributes to the elaboration of standards developed by the committee.

Health On the Net offers users an array of tools and services to meet their health information needs, including: the HON Code of Conduct and its certification process; [http://everyone.khresmoi.eu/hon-search/ Khresmoi] and [https://www.hon.ch/HONselect/ HONselect] search engines, which provide access to trustworthy websites and support groups, medical images and terminology, journal articles and news; Provisu.ch, a database of reliable health information on all eye diseases and accessible by those with poor or no vision through its variability of letter size and audio version; Santeromande.ch, a database directed towards the French-speaking public of Switzerland and neighboring France and providing reliable health information and a directory of registered health professionals, medical centers, hospitals, medical associations and federal organizations.

== Certification ==
[[Image:HONcodeLOGO.png|thumb|The HONcode Logo]]
{{anchor|HONcode}}
HON Foundation issued a [[code of conduct]] [http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/Conduct.html (HONcode)] for medical and health websites to address reliability and usefulness of medical information on the Internet. HONCode is not designed to rate the veracity of the information provided by a website. Rather, the code only states that the site holds to the standards, so that readers can know the source and purpose of the medical information presented. The HONcode is voluntary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenberg L, D'Andrea G, Lorence D |title=Setting the public agenda for online health search: a white paper and action agenda |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=e18 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15249267 |pmc=1550592 |doi=10.2196/jmir.6.2.e18 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that webmasters and information providers apply for HONcode certification. Following this, the website is reviewed by a specialized team of health and legal professionals. The HONcode certification is dynamic and is renewed yearly according to site compliance. It is the oldest and the most used ethical and trustworthy code for medical and health-related information on the Internet.

The principles of the HONcode are:
# Authority – information and advice given only by medical professionals with credentials of author/s, or a clear statement if this is not the case
# Complementarity – information and help are to support, not replace, patient-healthcare professional relationships which is the desired means of contact
# Confidentiality – how the site treats personal and non-personal information of readers
# Attribution – references to source of information (URL if available) and when it was last updated
# Justifiability – any treatment, product or service must be supported by balanced, well-referenced scientific information 
# Transparency of authorship – contact information, preferably including email addresses, of authors should be available
# Transparency of sponsorship – sources of funding for the site
# Honesty in advertising and editorial policy – details about advertising on the site and clear distinction between advertised and editorial material

Each principle also has a Web 2.0 component in order to address the evolution of the Web in terms of information provision, including social media use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hon.ch/cgi-bin/HONcode/guidelines_comments_en.pl|title=HONcode: Certification for Websites with Web 2.0 elements|website=www.hon.ch|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently more than 8,000 HONcode certified websites, covering 90 countries. The HONcode has been translated into 35 languages.

== Limits and Criticism ==

The HONcode only applies to a website’s editorial processes and details, not to the actual published contents. The term "certification" can be misleading to the general public, as it can infer that the contents of the website are trustworthy, reliable or otherwise independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=Gunther|date=2000-01-01|title=Towards ethical guidelines for e-health: JMIR Theme Issue on eHealth Ethics|url=http://www.jmir.org/2000/1/e7/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=2|issue=1|pages=E7|doi=10.2196/jmir.2.1.e7|pmc=1761845|pmid=11720926}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the certification process is based on both self-declaration of adherence to the principles and assessment by a HONcode expert verifying that this is the case, it is not possible for a site to be initially certified if it does not meet the HONcode principles.

However, it is possible for a certified site to change its content such that it no longer meets the certification criteria. While website owners are required to inform HON of any fundamental changes to their website during periods between certification and recertification, this is not always the case. Thus a site may be listed as certified when it no longer is. This is addressed at latest during the recertification process, or earlier if HON is notified that the site no longer meets certification standards. The HONcode is considered a useful guide and for some it provides the best overall guidance compared to other tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Lih-Ming|last2=Yan|first2=Hanmu|last3=Margel|first3=David|last4=Fleshner|first4=Neil E.|date=2013-01-01|title=Urologists in cyberspace: A review of the quality of health information from American urologists' websites using three validated tools|journal=Canadian Urological Association Journal|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=100–107|doi=10.5489/cuaj.501|issn=1911-6470|pmc=3650761|pmid=23671523}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the end the reliability of the information is also dependent on the information provider.

The HONcode principles themselves are subject to criticism, with some experts indicating they are not adapted to modern Internet usages&lt;ref&gt;As of January 2016; the principles were last updated in March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and do not follow their own rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/Webmasters/Conduct.html|title=HONcode: Principles - Quality and trustworthy health information|website=www.hon.ch|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In response to those limitations, one previously certified website has decided to no longer display the Health On the Net logo;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prescrire.org/fr/12/38/0/529/About.aspx|title=Prescrire - Qui est Prescrire - "Non merci..." - Prescrire n'affiche plus le HONcode|website=www.prescrire.org|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; another site  warns visitors not to trust certified websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthwyze.org/index.php/component/content/article/403-why-you-should-avoid-all-hon|title=The Health Wyze Report - The Health Wyze Report|last=Corriher|first=Sarah C.|website=healthwyze.org|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that independent reviews state that Health Wyze is not considered a safe site itself (http://review.easycounter.com/healthwyze-scam-report and https://www.rxstars.net/healthwyze-reviews-an-unpopular-website-that-published-detailed-reports-on-pharmacy-industry/)&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet greater awareness of the HONcode and its certification process is needed, with the authors of one study highlighting the need “to broadcast the relevance of HON certification so that creditable medical health information could be published online”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Emily C|last2=Manecksha|first2=Rustom P|last3=Abouassaly|first3=Robert|last4=Bolton|first4=Damien M|last5=Reich|first5=Oliver|last6=Lawrentschuk|first6=Nathan|date=2014-12-01|title=A multilingual evaluation of current health information on the Internet for the treatments of benign prostatic hyperplasia|journal=Prostate International|volume=2|issue=4|pages=161–168|doi=10.12954/PI.14058|issn=2287-8882|pmc=4286727|pmid=25599071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year of certification is free of charge. However, the new recertification process, started in 2014 when the Foundation’s government sponsors required the Foundation to develop its financial independence, requires a financial contribution from the sites requesting recertification. The fees are as follows: €50 for non-profits with little visibility, €160 for sites with high visibility, and €325 for commercial websites. Visibility is determined by the website's Alexa ranking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/Webmasters/reassessment.html|title=Health On the Net (HON): About the HONcode re-assessment payment process|website=www.hon.ch|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing a further bias favoring disguised commercial websites instead of benevolent and scientific communities.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== HONcode Misuse  ==

In 2000 a journal article raised a number of problems with the HONcode logo, indicating that consumers may mistake it as an award or interpret it as an indicator for assessed information.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Other issues with the HONcode logo were discussed in the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'', a peer-reviewed eHealth journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nater|first=T|last2=Boyer|first2=C|last3=Eysenbach|first3=G|date=2000-01-01|title=Debate about evaluation and monitoring of sites carrying the HON-Logo|url=http://www.jmir.org/2000/2/e13/|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=2|issue=2|pages=E13|doi=10.2196/jmir.2.2.e13|pmc=1761850|pmid=11720932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Websites that are not in compliance with HONcode can continue to display the seal, as Health On the Net Foundation (HON) has no means of forcing the offending webmaster to remove the certification seal. However, as the certification seal [http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/policy.html active and dynamic] , leading to a page on HON servers with the date of the certification’s validity and the status of certification in real time, the link from websites will lead to the page showing that the site is no longer in compliance – i.e. that it is either being reassessed or the certification has been revoked. This is indicated in real time. It is, however, possible for the site to retain the logo without the click through. Thus users should be aware that if the seal is not clickable, the site is no longer in compliance and is misusing the logo.

Consumer protection advocate [[Stephen Barrett]] has been a strong supporter of the HONcode and has made efforts to improve compliance with its rules and to expose those who misuse it. A 2004 special supplement to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' provides coverage of his views on the subject, including suggested improvements and his criticisms of many named misusers.&lt;ref name="Wanjek"&gt;Christopher Wanjek. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25556-2004Apr19.html Attacking Their HONor: Some Dispute Value of Logo Used to Verify Accuracy, Integrity Of Health Web Site Contents.] Special to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 20, 2004; Page HE01&lt;/ref&gt;

The HONcode relies on the user’s sense of civic responsibility. In cases of suspected fraudulent websites or of misuse of the HONcode, HON advises internet users to alert [[Quackwatch]] or HON itself through the complaint mechanism on the HON website: "If you come across a healthcare Web site that you believe is either possibly or blatantly fraudulent and does NOT display the HONcode, please alert Quackwatch. Of course, if such a site DOES display the HONcode, alert us immediately."&lt;ref name="alert"&gt;[http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/audience_t.html "How to be a vigilant user"] Health On the Net Foundation, accessed 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other problems with the application of the HONcode principles are that HON does not have a means of verifying many of the principles, such as credentials (medical or otherwise) as stated on websites displaying the logo, or that copyright or confidentiality is not violated by webmasters.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 2012, life expectancy at birth in Spain reached '''82.5''' years, one of the highest among OECD countries and more than two years higher than the OECD average (80.2 years). Only Japan (83.2 years), Iceland (83.0 years) and Switzerland (82.8 years) had a higher life expectancy than Spain in 2012. The top three causes of death since 1970 have been cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/spain|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=World Health Organisation|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health status ==
===Obesity===
In 2013 there had been a  14% rise in the number of overweight people since 1987 when the figure had been 40% according to a survey conducted by the  [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadistica]].  18% of men and 16% of women were regarded as obese.  These was attributed to an increase in sedentary lifestyles. 14.4% of men and 17% of women declared they don't do any physical exercise. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain packs on kilos in obesity epidemic|url=http://www.thelocal.es/20130315/Spain-packs-on-kilos-in-obesity-epidemic|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=The Local ES|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 according to the [[World Health Organization]] 22.8% of men and 24.7% of women were obese. Spain was number 48 on the global obesity scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Healthy diet?

===Smoking===

Spain has achieved progress in reducing tobacco consumption over the past decade, with rates of daily smokers among adults coming down 32% in 2001 to 24% in 2011. However, smoking rates in Spain still remain higher than the developed world average.

===Diabetes===
In 2015 it was estimated that 10.58% of the population has diabetes, costing about $3,090  per person per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10: Which country has the highest rates of diabetes in Europe?

==Vaccination==
Spain's 19 [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]], consisting of 17 Regions and 2 cities, follow health policies established by the [[Spanish National Health System|Inter-Territorial Health Council]] that was formed by the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|National and Regional Ministries of Health]].&lt;ref name="Delgado"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delgado|first1=Sinesio| name-list-format = vanc |title=Spain |url=http://venice.cineca.org/documents/spain_ip.pdf |website=Instituto De Salud Carlos III|publisher=Centro Nacional De Epidemiologia|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Inter-Territorial Council is composed of representatives from each region and meets to discuss health related issues spanning across Spain.

Although the Ministry of Health is responsible for the oversight of health care services, the policy of devolution divides responsibilities among local agencies, including health planning and programing, fiscal duties, and direct management of health services. This decentralization proposes difficulties in collecting information at the national level.&lt;ref name="NITAG Policies Journal"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricciardi GW, Toumi M, Weil-Olivier C, Ruitenberg EJ, Dankó D, Duru G, Picazo J, Zöllner Y, Poland G, Drummond M | title = Comparison of NITAG policies and working processes in selected developed countries | journal = Vaccine | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–11 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25258100 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.09.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-Territorial Council's Commission on Public Health works to establish health care policies according to recommendations by technical working groups via letters, meetings, and conferences.

==Structure==

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a [[glycoprotein]] composed of 237 [[amino acid]]s with a [[molecular mass]] of 36.7 [[kDa]], approximately 14.5 αhCG and 22.2kDa βhCG.&lt;ref name="Canfield_1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Canfield RE, O'Connor JF, Birken S, Krichevsky A, Wilcox AJ | title = Development of an assay for a biomarker of pregnancy and early fetal loss | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 74 | pages = 57–66 | date = October 1987 | pmid = 3319556 | pmc = 1474496 | doi=10.1289/ehp.877457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[heterodimer]]ic, with an α (alpha) [[protein subunit|subunit]] identical to that of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), and β (beta) subunit that is unique to hCG.

* The [[chorionic gonadotropin alpha|α (alpha)]] [[protein subunit|subunit]] is 92 amino acids long.&lt;ref name="urlGlycoprotein hormones alpha chain precursor - Homo sapiens (Human)"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01215 | title = Glycoprotein hormones alpha chain precursor - Homo sapiens (Human) | publisher = UniProt Consortium | work = UniProt accession number P01215 | quote = P01215[25-116] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The β-subunit of hCG gonadotropin ('''beta-hCG''') contains 145 amino acids, encoded by six highly homologous [[gene]]s that are arranged in tandem and inverted pairs on [[chromosome 19]]q13.3 - ''CGB'' ([[CGB1|''1'']], [[CGB2 (gene)|''2'']], [[CGB3|''3'']], [[CGB5|''5'']], [[CGB7|''7'']], [[CGB8|''8'']])&lt;ref name="urlChoriogonadotropin subunit beta precursor - Homo sapiens (Human)"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01233 | title = Choriogonadotropin subunit beta precursor - Homo sapiens (Human) | publisher = UniProt Consortium | work = UniProt accession number P01233 | quote = P01233[21-165] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two subunits create a small [[hydrophobic]] core surrounded by a high surface area-to-volume ratio: 2.8 times that of a sphere.  The vast majority of the outer amino acids are [[hydrophilic]].&lt;ref name="pmid8202136"&gt;{{PDB|1HRP}}; {{cite journal |vauthors=Lapthorn AJ, Harris DC, Littlejohn A, Lustbader JW, Canfield RE, Machin KJ, Morgan FJ, Isaacs NW | title = Crystal structure of human chorionic gonadotropin | journal = Nature | volume = 369 | issue = 6480 | pages = 455–61 | date=June 1994 | pmid = 8202136 | doi = 10.1038/369455a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Human chorionic gonadotropin interacts with the [[LHCG receptor]] of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the [[corpus luteum]] during the beginning of [[pregnancy]]. This allows the corpus luteum to [[Secretion|secrete]] the hormone [[progesterone]] during the first trimester. Progesterone enriches the [[uterus]] with a thick [[Endometrium|lining]] of [[blood vessel]]s and [[capillary|capillaries]] so that it can sustain the growing [[fetus]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Due to its highly negative charge, hCG may repel the immune cells of the mother, protecting the fetus during the first trimester{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. It has also been hypothesized that hCG may be a placental link for the development of local maternal [[Immune tolerance|immunotolerance]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. For example, hCG-treated endometrial cells induce an increase in T cell [[apoptosis]] (dissolution of [[T cell]]s).  These results suggest that hCG may be a link in the development of peritrophoblastic immune tolerance, and may facilitate the [[trophoblast]] invasion, which is known to expedite fetal development in the endometrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kayisli U, Selam B, Guzeloglu-Kayisli O, Demir R, Arici A |title=Human chorionic gonadotropin contributes to maternal immunotolerance and endometrial apoptosis by regulating Fas-Fas ligand system |journal=J. Immunol. |volume=171 |issue=5 |pages=2305–13 |year=2003 |pmid=12928375 |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.171.5.2305}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that hCG levels are linked to the severity of [[morning sickness]] or [[Hyperemesis gravidarum]] in pregnant women.&lt;ref name="pmid10636378"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Askling J, Erlandsson G, Kaijser M, Akre O, Ekbom A | title = Sickness in pregnancy and sex of child | journal = Lancet | volume = 354 | issue = 9195 | pages = 2053 | date=December 1999 | pmid = 10636378 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04239-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its similarity to [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]], hCG can also be used clinically to induce [[ovulation]] in the [[ovary|ovaries]] as well as [[testosterone]] production in the testes. As the most abundant biological source is women who are presently pregnant, some organizations collect urine from pregnant women to extract hCG for use in [[Assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moedersvoormoeders.nl/ Moedersvoormoeders.nl] - a Dutch organization that collects urine from pregnant women to extract hCG.{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlwww.merck.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/p/pregnyl/pregnyl_pi.pdf | title = Pregnyl (chorionic gonadotropin for injection USP) | format = pdf | work = Prescribing Information | publisher = Merck &amp; Co., Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human chorionic gonadotropin also plays a role in [[cellular differentiation]]/proliferation and may activate [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Michels"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michels KB, Xue F, Colditz GA, Willett WC | title = Induced and spontaneous abortion and incidence of breast cancer among young women: a prospective cohort study | journal = Arch.

==Production==
Naturally, it is produced in the human placenta by the [[syncytiotrophoblast]].

Like any other [[gonadotropins]], it can be extracted from the urine of pregnant women or produced from cultures of genetically modified cells using [[recombinant DNA]] technology.

In [[Pubergen]], [[Pregnyl]], [[Follutein]], [[Profasi]], [[Choragon]] and [[Novarel]], it is extracted from the urine of pregnant women. In [[Ovidrel]], it is produced with [[recombinant DNA]] technology.&lt;ref name="pmid19007609"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama))| title = Gonadotropin preparations: past, present, and future perspectives | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = S13–20 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19007609 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==hCG forms==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
Regarding [[endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] forms of hCG, there are various ways to categorize and measure them, including total hCG, C-terminal peptide total hCG, intact hCG, free β-subunit hCG, β-core fragment hCG, hyperglycosylated hCG, nicked hCG, alpha hCG, and pituitary hCG.

Regular hCG is the main form of hCG associated with the majority of pregnancy and in non-invasive molar pregnancies.  This is produced in the [[trophoblast]] cells of the placental tissue. Hyperglycosylated hCG is the main form of hCG during the implantation phase of pregnancy, with invasive molar pregnancies, and with [[choriocarcinoma]].

Regarding pharmaceutical preparations of hCG from [[animal]] or [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] sources, there are many [[gonadotropin preparations]], some of which are medically justified and others of which are of a [[quackery|quack]] nature.

==Testing==

[[Blood]] or [[urine]] tests measure hCG. These can be [[pregnancy test]]s. hCG-positive indicates an implanted [[blastocyst]] and [[mammalian embryogenesis]]. These can be done to diagnose and monitor [[germ cell tumor]]s and [[gestational trophoblastic disease]]s.

Concentrations are commonly reported in thousandth international units per milliliter (mIU/ml). The international unit of hCG was originally established in 1938 and has been redefined in 1964 and in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glowm.com/index.html?p=glowm.cml/section_view&amp;articleid=93|title=The Diagnosis of Pregnancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time, 1 international unit is equal to approximately 2.35×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; moles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nibsc.ac.uk/documents/ifu/99-688.pdf|title=WHO Reference Reagent Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (Purified) NIBSC code: 99/688 Instructions for use (Version 3.0, Dated 05/11/2007)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203215926/http://www.nibsc.ac.uk/documents/ifu/99-688.pdf|archivedate=2012-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 6×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Canfield RE, Ross GT | title=A new reference preparation of human chorionic gonadotrophin and its subunits | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume=54 | issue=4 | pages=463–472 | year=1976 | pmid=1088359 | pmc=2366462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===

Most tests employ a monoclonal antibody, which is specific to the ''β-subunit'' of hCG (β-hCG). This procedure is employed to ensure that tests do not make [[Type I and type II errors|false positives]] by confusing hCG with LH and FSH. (The latter two are always present at varying levels in the body, whereas the presence of hCG almost always indicates pregnancy.)

Many hCG immunoassays are based on the [[Immunoassay#Two-site.2C noncompetitive immunoassays|sandwich principle]], which uses antibodies to hCG labeled with an enzyme or a conventional or luminescent dye.
Pregnancy urine dipstick tests are based on the [[lateral flow test|lateral flow]] technique.

* The [[urine test]] may be a ''chromatographic [[immunoassay]]'' or any of several other test formats, home-, physician's office-, or laboratory-based.&lt;ref name="henry"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A. McPherson |author2=Matthew R.

When the urine is dilute ([[specific gravity]] less than 1.015), the hCG concentration may not be representative of the blood concentration, and the test may be falsely negative.
* The [[blood plasma|serum]] test, using 2-4 mL of venous blood, is typically a chemiluminescent or fluorimetric immunoassay&lt;ref name="henry" /&gt; that can detect βhCG levels as low as 5 mIU/ml and allows quantification of the βhCG concentration.

===Reference levels in normal pregnancy===

The following is a list of serum hCG levels. (''LMP'' is the [[last menstrual period]] dated from the first day of the last menstrual period.) The levels grow exponentially after conception and implantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Guideline To HCG Levels During Pregnancy | url = http://americanpregnancy.org/while-pregnant/hcg-levels/ | publisher = American Pregnancy Association | date = 22 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===
The ability to quantitate the βhCG level is useful in the monitoring [[germ cell tumor|germ cell]] and [[Gestational trophoblastic disease|trophoblastic tumors]], follow-up care after [[miscarriage]], and in diagnosis of and follow-up care after treatment of [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal [[ultrasound]] after the βhCG levels have reached 1500 mIU/ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tualndi | first = Togas | name-list-format = vanc | title=Dr|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-tubal-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics|publisher=UpToDate|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, even an hCG over 2000 IU/l does not necessarily exclude the presence of a viable intrauterine pregnancy in such cases.&lt;ref name=kirk2013/&gt;

As pregnancy tests, quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hCG between 6 and 12 days after ovulation.&lt;ref name="wilcox"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox AJ, Baird DD, Weinberg CR | title=Time of implantation of the conceptus and loss of pregnancy | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | volume=340 | issue=23 | pages=1796–1799 | year=1999 | pmid=10362823 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402304}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be taken into account, however, that total hCG levels may vary in a very wide range within the first 4 weeks of gestation, leading to false results during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Butler SA, Khanlian SA, Cole LA | title=Detection of early pregnancy forms of human chorionic gonadotropin by home pregnancy test devices | journal=Clinical Chemistry | volume=47 | issue=12 | pages=2131–2136 | year=2001 | pmid=11719477}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rise of 35% over 48 hours is proposed as the minimal rise consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy.&lt;ref name=kirk2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirk E, Bottomley C, Bourne T | title = Diagnosing ectopic pregnancy and current concepts in the management of pregnancy of unknown location | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 250–61 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24101604 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestational trophoblastic disease like [[hydatidiform mole]]s ("molar pregnancy") or choriocarcinoma may produce high levels of βhCG (due to the presence of syncytialtrophoblasts- part of the villi that make up the placenta) despite the absence of an embryo. This, as well as several other conditions, can lead to elevated hCG readings in the absence of pregnancy.

hCG levels are also a component of the [[triple test]], a screening test for certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities/birth defects.

A study of 32 normal pregnancies came to the result a [[gestational sac]] of 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm was detected at a mean hCG level of 1150 IU/l (range 800-1500), a [[yolk sac]] was detected at a mean level of 6000 IU/l (range 4500-7500) and [[fetal heartbeat]] was visible at a mean hCG level of 10,000 IU/l (range 8650-12,200).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giacomello F, Magliocchetti P, Loyola G, Giovarruscio M |title=[Serum beta hCG levels and transvaginal echography in the early phases of pregnancy] |language=Italian |journal=Minerva Ginecol |volume=45 |issue=7–8 |pages=333–7 |year=1993 |pmid=8414139 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Tumor marker===
Human chorionic gonadotropin can be used as a [[tumor marker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tumor Markers Found in Blood or Urine|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/examsandtestdescriptions/tumormarkers/tumor-markers-t-m-blood-urine|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its β subunit is secreted by some [[cancer]]s including [[seminoma]], [[choriocarcinoma]], [[germ cell tumor]]s, [[hydatidiform mole]], [[teratoma]] with elements of [[choriocarcinoma]], and [[islet cell tumor]]. For this reason, a positive result in males can be a test for [[testicular cancer]]. The normal range for men is between 0-5 mIU/mL. Combined with [[alpha-fetoprotein]], β-HCG is an excellent tumor marker for the monitoring of [[germ cell tumor]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} &lt;!-- it would be helpful to have somewhere a complete list of tumors (by histology) that secrete βHCG. --&gt;

Human chorionic gonadotropin injection is extensively used for [[final maturation induction]] in lieu of [[luteinizing hormone]]. In the presence of one or more mature ovarian follicles, ovulation can be triggered by the administration of HCG. As [[ovulation]] will happen between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515 HCG Injection After Ovulation Induction With Clomiphene Citrate] at Medscape. By Peter Kovacs. Posted: 04/23/2004&lt;/ref&gt; procedures can be scheduled to take advantage of this time sequence,&lt;ref name=ivf.com&gt;[http://www.ivf.com/ovind.html IVF.com]; Ovulation Induction. Retrieved Mars 7, 2010{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[intrauterine insemination]] or sexual intercourse. Also, patients that undergo [[IVF]], in general, receive HCG to trigger the ovulation process, but have an [[oocyte retrieval]] performed at about 34 to 36 hours after injection by, a few hours before the eggs actually would be released from the ovary.

As HCG supports the [[corpus luteum]], administration of HCG is used in certain circumstances to enhance the production of [[progesterone]].

In the male, HCG injections are used to stimulate the [[Leydig cell]]s to synthesize [[testosterone]]. The intratesticular testosterone is necessary for [[spermatogenesis]] from the [[sertoli cells]]. Typical uses for HCG in men include [[hypogonadism]] and fertility treatment.

Several vaccines against human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for the prevention of pregnancy are currently in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Talwar_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Talwar GP, Gupta JC, Rulli SB, Sharma RS, Nand KN, Bandivdekar AH, Atrey N, Singh P | title = Advances in development of a contraceptive vaccine against human chorionic gonadotropin | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1183–90 | year = 2015 | pmid = | doi = 10.1517/14712598.2015.1049943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl warnings====
In the case of female patients who want to be treated with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl:&lt;ref name="urlhcgpregnyl"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmacyescrow.com/sx3559-s-HCG-PREGNYL-104604-s.aspx | title = HCG Pregnyl | date = 2010-10-13 | accessdate = 2010-10-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110325081609/http://www.pharmacyescrow.com/sx3559-s-HCG-PREGNYL-104604-s.aspx | archivedate = 2011-03-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
a) Since infertile female patients who undergo medically assisted reproduction (especially those who need [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]]), are known to often be suffering from tubal abnormalities, after a treatment with this drug they might experience many more [[ectopic pregnancies]]. This is why early ultrasound confirmation at the beginning of a pregnancy (to see whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or not) is crucial. Pregnancies that have occurred after a treatment with this medicine are submitted to a higher risk of multiplets. Female patients who have thrombosis, severe obesity, or thrombophilia should not be prescribed this medicine as they have a higher risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events after or during a treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl. b)Female patients who have been treated with this medicine are usually more prone to pregnancy losses.

In the case of male patients: A prolonged treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl is known to regularly lead to increased production of androgen. Therefore: Patients who are suffering from overt or latent cardiac failure, hypertension, renal dysfunction, migraines, or epilepsy might not be allowed to start using this medicine or may require a lower dose of HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl. Also this medicine should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of prepubescent teenagers in order to reduce the risk of precocious sexual development or premature epiphyseal closure. This type of patients' skeletal maturation should be closely and regularly monitored.

Both male and female patients who have the following medical conditions must not start a treatment with HCG Pubergen, Pregnyl: (1) Hypersensitivity to this medicine or to any of its main ingredients. (2) Known or possible androgen-dependent tumors for example male breast carcinoma or prostatic carcinoma.

===Anabolic steroid adjunct===
In the world of performance-enhancing drugs, HCG is increasingly used in combination with various [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) cycles. As a result, HCG is included in some sports' illegal drug lists.

When exogenous AAS are put into the male body, natural negative-feedback loops cause the body to shut down its own production of [[testosterone]] via shutdown of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis ([[Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis|HPGA]]). This causes testicular atrophy, among other things. HCG is commonly used during and after steroid cycles to maintain and restore testicular size as well as normal testosterone production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-08/sports/17199689_1_hcg-steroid-users-steroid-cycle | date = May 8, 2009 | first = Lance | last = Williams | name-list-format = vanc | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle | title=Manny Ramirez suspended; testosterone ratio exceeded limits; fertility drug reported}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High levels of AASs, that mimic the body's natural testosterone, trigger the [[hypothalamus]] to shut down its production of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Without GnRH, the [[pituitary gland]] stops releasing [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH). LH normally travels from the pituitary via the blood stream to the testes, where it triggers the production and release of testosterone. Without LH, the testes shut down their production of testosterone.&lt;ref name="pmid12740738"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Breda E, Keizer HA, Kuipers H, Wolffenbuttel BH | title = Androgenic anabolic steroid use and severe hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction: a case study | journal = Int J Sports Med | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–6 | date=April 2003 | pmid = 12740738 | doi = 10.1055/s-2003-39089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In males, HCG helps restore and maintain testosterone production in the testes by mimicking LH and triggering the production and release of testosterone.

If HCG is used for too long and in too high a dose, the resulting rise in natural testosterone and estrogen would eventually inhibit endogenous production of luteinizing hormone via negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== HCG diet ===
British endocrinologist [[Albert T. W. Simeons]] proposed HCG as an adjunct to an ultra-low-calorie weight-loss diet (fewer than 500 calories).&lt;ref name="isbn0-615-42755-3"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Simeons AT | title = Pounds &amp; Inches: A New Approach To Obesity | publisher = Popular Publishing | location = | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 0-615-42755-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simeons, while studying pregnant women in India on a calorie-deficient diet, and "fat boys" with pituitary problems ([[Frölich's syndrome]]) treated with low-dose HCG, observed that both lost fat rather than lean (muscle) tissue.&lt;ref name="isbn0-615-42755-3" /&gt; He reasoned that HCG must be programming the [[hypothalamus]] to do this in the former cases in order to protect the developing fetus by promoting mobilization and consumption of ''abnormal'', ''excessive'' [[adipose]] deposits.  Simeons in 1954 published a book entitled ''Pounds and Inches'', designed to combat obesity. Simeons, practicing at Salvator Mundi International Hospital in Rome, Italy, recommended low-dose daily HCG injections (125&amp;nbsp;IU) in combination with a customized ultra-low-calorie (500 cal/day, high-protein, low-carbohydrate/fat) diet, which was supposed to result in a loss of adipose tissue without loss of lean tissue.&lt;ref name="isbn0-615-42755-3" /&gt;

Other researchers did not find the same results when attempting experiments to confirm Simeons' conclusions, and in 1976 in response to complaints the FDA required Simeons and others to include the following disclaimer on all advertisements:&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of Simeon Management Corp.'' (Fed. Trade Comm'n, 1976) 87 F.T.C. 1184; affirmed by ''Simeon Management Corp. v. FTC'' (9th Cir. 1978) 579 F.2d 1137, 49 ALR-Fed 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|These weight reduction treatments include the injection of HCG, a drug which has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective in the treatment of obesity or weight control. There is no substantial evidence that HCG increases weight loss beyond that resulting from caloric restriction, that it causes a more attractive or "normal" distribution of fat, or that it decreases the hunger and discomfort associated with calorie-restrictive diets.|1976 FDA-mandated disclaimer for HCG diet advertisements}}

There was a resurgence of interest in the "HCG diet" following promotion by [[Kevin Trudeau]], who was banned  from making HCG diet weight-loss claims by the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] in 2008, and eventually jailed over such claims.&lt;ref name="FTC 2008/10"&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/10/trudeau.shtm Kevin Trudeau Banned from Infomercials For Three Years, Ordered to Pay More Than $5 Million for False Claims About Weight-Loss Book]; ''FTC v.

A 1995 meta analysis found that studies supporting HCG for weight loss were of poor methodological quality and concluded that "there is no scientific evidence that HCG is effective in the treatment of obesity; it does not bring about weight-loss or fat-redistribution, nor does it reduce hunger or induce a feeling of well-being".&lt;ref name="pmid8527285"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lijesen GK, Theeuwen I, Assendelft WJ, Van Der Wal G | title = The effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the treatment of obesity by means of the Simeons therapy: a criteria-based meta-analysis | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–43 | date=September 1995 | pmid = 8527285 | pmc = 1365103 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb05779.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2016, the American Medical Association (AMA) passed policy that "The use of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for weight loss is inappropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/11/15/890309/10166002/en/Obesity-Medicine-Association-Applauds-American-Medical-Association-s-Decision-to-Adopt-New-Anti-HCG-Policy.html#|title=Obesity Medicine Association Applauds American Medical Association's Decision to Adopt New Anti-HCG Policy|last=Association|first=Obesity Medicine|newspaper=GlobeNewswire News Room|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|There is no scientific evidence that HCG is effective in the treatment of obesity. The meta-analysis found insufficient evidence supporting the claims that HCG is effective in altering fat-distribution, hunger reduction, or in inducing a feeling of well-being. The authors stated “…the use of HCG should be regarded as an inappropriate therapy for weight reduction…” In the authors opinion, “Pharmacists and physicians should be alert on the use of HCG for Simeons therapy. The results of this meta-analysis support a firm standpoint against this improper indication. Restraints on physicians practicing this therapy can be based on our findings.”| American Society of Bariatric Physicians'&lt;ref name="ASBP" /&gt; commentary on Lijesen et. al (1995)&lt;ref name="pmid8527285" /&gt;}}

The scientific consensus is that any weight loss reported by individuals on an "HCG diet" may be attributed entirely to the fact that such diets prescribe calorie intake of between 500 and 1,000 calories per day, substantially below recommended levels for an adult, to the point that this may risk health effects associated with malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hcg-diet/AN02091 Does the HCG diet work — and is it safe?], [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homeopathic HCG for weight control====
Controversy about, and shortages&lt;ref name="urlBulletin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashp.org/DrugShortages/Current/Bulletin.aspx?id=382 | title = Chorionic Gonadotropin (Human) Injection Shortage | date = 2010-10-13 | format = | work = Bulletin | publisher = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | pages = | language = | quote = | accessdate = 2010-10-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of, injected HCG for weight loss have led to substantial Internet promotion of "[[homeopathy|homeopathic]] HCG" for weight control. The ingredients in these products are often obscure, but if prepared from true HCG via homeopathic dilution, they contain either no HCG at all or only trace amounts. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that oral HCG is bioavailable due to the fact that digestive protease enzymes and hepatic metabolism renders peptide-based molecules (such as insulin and human growth hormone) biologically inert. HCG can likely only enter the bloodstream through injection.

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] has stated that over-the-counter products containing HCG are fraudulent and ineffective for weight loss. They are also not protected as homeopathic drugs and have been deemed illegal substances.&lt;ref name="urlWeight Loss Drugs Dubbed Fraudulent and Illegal by FDA: Report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/49921/ | title = Weight Loss Drugs Dubbed Fraudulent and Illegal by FDA | vauthors = Phillips J | date = 2011-01-24 | format = | work = | publisher = Epoch Times | pages = | language = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110128024717/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/49921/| archivedate =2011-01-28| quote = | dead-url = yes | accessdate = 2011-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlHCG weight-loss products are fraudulent, FDA says - USATODAY.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/fitness/weight-loss-challenge/2011-01-24-hcgdiet24_ST_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip | title = HCG weight-loss products are fraudulent, FDA says - USATODAY.com | vauthors = Hellmich N | date = 2011-01-23 | format = | work = | publisher = USA Today | accessdate = 2011-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HCG is classified as a prescription drug in the United States and it has not been approved for over-the-counter sales by the FDA as a weight loss product or for any other purposes, and therefore neither HCG in its pure form nor any preparations containing HCG may be sold legally in the country except by prescription.&lt;ref name="MedPage20111206" /&gt; In December 2011, FDA and FTC started to take actions to pull unapproved HCG products from the market.&lt;ref name="MedPage20111206" /&gt; In the aftermath, some suppliers started to switch to "hormone-free" versions of their weight loss products, where the hormone is replaced with an unproven mixture of free amino acids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/03/08/prweb9258422.DTL|title=Hormone-Free HCG Drops are Quickly Replacing Homeopathic Counterparts|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or where [[radionics]] is used to transfer the "energy" to the final product.

== Tetanus vaccine controversy ==

In order to induce a stronger immune response, some versions of human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility vaccines were designed as [[conjugate vaccine|conjugates]] of the β subunit of HCG covalently linked to [[tetanus toxoid]].&lt;ref name="Talwar_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9459276"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Talwar GP | title = Fertility regulating and immunotherapeutic vaccines reaching human trials stage | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–10 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9459276 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/3.4.301 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/4/301.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that a non-conjugated [[tetanus vaccine]] used in developing countries is laced with a human chorionic gonadotropin based anti-fertility drug&lt;ref name="pmid12346214"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Tetanus vaccine may be laced with anti-fertility drug.

'''Juan Ramón de la Fuente Ramírez''' (born 5 September 1951 in [[Mexico City]]) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], academician and politician who served as [[Secretary of Health (Mexico)|Secretary of Health]] in the cabinet of President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] (1994–1999) and as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) from 1999 to 2007. He is currently Professor at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and Chairs the Board of the ''[[Aspen Institute|Aspen Institute Mexico]]''.&lt;ref name="Aspen Institute"&gt;{{cite web | author = Aspen Institute | title = The Aspen Institute Launches Aspen Institute Mexico Partnership | url = http://www.aspeninstitute.org/about/blog/aspen-institute-launches-aspen-institute-mexico-partnership | date = 2013-11-14 | accessdate = 2013-11-14 | authorlink = Aspen Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De la Fuente graduated from Medical School [[Medicine]] from the National Autonomous University in 1976 and trained in Psychiatry [[Psychiatry]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], [[United States]]. When he returned to Mexico he founded the Clinical Research Unit of the Mexican Institute of Psychiatry and joined the Faculty of UNAM's School of Medicine, where he was appointed Dean in 1991. In 1995 He was also elected President of the [[Mexican Academy of Sciences]] and a few years later he was appointed Secretary of Health by President Zedillo. In 1999, he resigned to his cabinet post to be appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] and in 2003 he was reappointed for a second term. In 2008 he was elected President of the International Association of Universities at [[UNESCO]] and was called by [[Ban Ki-moon]] to be member of the Council of the [[United Nations University]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="unu"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[United Nations University]] | title = UNU Council Members: Juan Ramón de la Fuente | url = http://www.unu.edu/council/members/delafuente.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131092051/http://www.unu.edu/council/members/delafuente.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-01-31 | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sits in several boards in México and abroad, such as ''[[El Universal (Mexico)|El Universal]]'', an influential newspaper in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="unu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = El Universal | title = Dan la bienvenida a Juan Ramón de la Fuente | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/476280.html | language = Spanish | date = 2008-01-22 | accessdate = 2008-05-31 | authorlink = El Universal (Mexico) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2008 he was elected as President of the [[International Association of Universities]].

He has written over two hundred papers and fourteen books, and has received numerous awards and honorary degrees such as the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the [[Mayo Clinic]], the Presidential Award for Excellence of the University of Texas and a Doctorate on Humane Letters from Arizona State University, amongst many others. He also received from President Vicente Fox the [[National Prize for Arts and Sciences (Mexico)]], the highest recognition of Mexico’s Government. Dr. de la Fuente is one of the most respected figures in Mexican society.

"Digital Infrastructure for the Learning Health System: The Foundation for Continuous Improvement in Health and Health Care." Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine, 2011. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83569/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK83569.pdf] {{isbn|0-309-15416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mclachlan"&gt;McLachlan S, Potts HWW, Dube K, Buchanan D, Lean S, Gallagher T, Johnson O, Daley B, Marsh W, Fenton N. "The Heimdall framework for supporting characterisation of learning health systems." ''J Innov Health Inform'' 2018;'''25'''(2):77–87. {{doi|10.14236/jhi.v25i2.996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was first conceptualised in a 2007 workshop organised by the US [[Institute of Medicine]], building on ideas around [[evidence-based medicine]]&lt;ref name="iom07" /&gt; and "practice-based evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Greene, S, and A Geiger. 2006. "A review finds that multicenter studies face substantial challenges but strategies exist to achieve Institutional Review Board approval." ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology'' 59(8):784-790.&lt;/ref&gt; There has since been increasing interest in the topic, including the creation of the [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] journal ''Learning Health Systems''.&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt;

LHS can be described as having four key elements:
#an organisational architecture that supports the formation of communities of patients, healthcare professionals and researchers who collaborate to produce and use "[[big data]]";
#large electronic health data sets, ''i.e.'' "big data";
#quality improvement at the point of care for each patient using new knowledge generated by research;
#research done in routine healthcare settings.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest C, Margolis P, Seid M and Colletti RB. PEDSnet: how a prototype pediatric learning health system is being expanded into a national network. Health Affairs 2014;33(7):1171–7&lt;/ref&gt;

They are thus dependent on the use of [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs) and have inherited the adoption challenges of EHRs.&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt; 

LHS entail a clinical lifecycle. Patient data is collected, it is amalgamated across multiple patients and a problem is defined.&lt;ref&gt;"From Patient Data to Medical Knowledge: The Principles and Practice of Health Informatics" by Paul Taylor, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2007 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470994702]&lt;/ref&gt; These are activities largely driven by healthcare professionals. With the support of technology, an analysis is performed, which returns evidence, from which knowledge is generated, which leads to changed clinical practice, and thus to new patient data being collected.&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deeny S and Steventon A.

The '''Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Psychiatrie}}) is a scientific institute based in the city of [[Munich]] in [[Germany]] specializing in [[psychiatry]]. Currently directed by Elisabeth Binder, Alon Chen and Martin Keck, it is one of the 81 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpg.de/institutes.html |title=Max Planck Institutes |accessdate=2014-07-29 |publisher=Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was founded as the German Institute for Psychiatric Research ({{lang-de|Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Psychiatrie}}) by [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III of Bavaria]] in [[Munich]] on February 13, 1917. The main force behind the institute was the psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]].&lt;ref&gt;Engstrom, Eric J., Wolfgang Burgmair, and Matthias M. Weber. "Psychiatric Governance, Völkisch Corporatism, and the German Research Institute of Psychiatry in Munich (1912–26)." History of Psychiatry 27, no. 1/2 (2016): 38-50, 137-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engstrom, Eric J et al. "Psychiatrie und Politik im Dienste des deutschen Volkes." In Emil Kraepelin: Kraepelin in München II, 1914-1921, ed. Wolfgang Burgmair, Eric J. Engstrom and Matthias M. Weber, 17-82. Munich: Belleville, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engstrom, Eric J. et al. "Wissenschaftsorganisation als Vermächtnis." In Emil Kraepelin: Kraepelin in München, Teil III: 1921-1926, edited by Wolfgang Burgmair, Eric J. Engstrom, and Matthias Weber, 17-71. Munich: belleville, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial funding was received from the Jewish-American banker [[James Loeb]],&lt;ref&gt;Burgmair, Wolfgang, and Matthias M. Weber. "'Das Geld ist gut angelegt, und du brauchst keine Reue zu haben': James Loeb, ein deutsch-amerikanischer Wissenschaftsmäzen zwischen Kaiserreich und Weimarer Republik." Historische Zeitschrift 277 (2003): 343-378.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], well into the 1930s. The Institute became affiliated with the K. W. Society for the Advancement of Science ({{lang-de|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften}}) in 1924.

In 1928 a new building of the institute was opened at 2 Kraepelinstrasse. The building was financed primarily by a donation of $325,000 from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Under the leadership of department heads [[Walther Spielmeyer]], [[Ernst Rüdin]], [[Felix Plaut]], [[Kurt Schneider]] and Franz Jahnel, the Institute gained an international reputation as a leading institution for psychiatric research.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpipsykl.mpg.de/en/institute/history/index.html  |title=History of the Institute |accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudin, a student of Kraepelin's, took over the directorship of the Institute in 1931, while also remaining head of genetics. As well as fostering an international scientific reputation, the Institute developed close ties with the Nazi regime. Rudin (along with [[Eugen Fischer]] of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]]) joined expert government committees. Rudin wrote the official commentary endorsing the forced sterilization laws. He was such an avid proponent that colleagues nicknamed him the "Reichsfuhrer for Sterilization".&lt;ref name=inhumanity&gt;[http://www.doew.at/cms/download/b1c46/en_seidelman_max_planck_society.pdf Science and Inhumanity: The Kaiser-Wilhelm/Max Planck Society] William E. Seidelman MD, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; Felix Plaut (in 1935) and Kurt Neubürger were dismissed from the Institute due to their [[History of Jews in Germany|Jewish origin]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The University Department of Psychiatry in Munich: From Kraepelin and His Predecessors to Molecular Psychiatry |last=Hippius |first=Hanns |authorlink= |author2=Hans-Jürgen Möller |author3=Norbert Müller |author4=Gabriele Neundörfer-Kohl |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |location= |isbn=3-540-74016-3 |pages=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of Rudin's lecture notes show that his teaching at the Institute was [[anti-semitic]].&lt;ref name=postwar/&gt; The Institute received a great deal of government funding, which was openly designed to further the Nazi regime's aims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jWQgAgAAQBAJ Baltic Eugenics: Bio-Politics, Race and Nation in Interwar Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 1918-1940 : Volker Roelcke: 3.

Roelcke, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Institute's facilities sustained much damage.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; After the war, Rudin claimed he was just an academic, had only heard rumours of the killing of psychiatric patients at nearby asylums, and that he hated the Nazis. He was supported by former Institute colleague [[Franz Josef Kallmann|Josef Kallmann]] (a eugenicist himself) and famous quantum physicist [[Max Planck]]{{check|date=March 2015}} and released with a 500 mark fine.&lt;ref name=postwar&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D4S13LYI9egC Genetic Research in Psychiatry and Psychology Under the Microscope] Jay Joseph.

In 1954 the Institute was incorporated into the Max Planck Society (as successive institution of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften under maintenance of the foundation of 1917). The Institute was divided into an Institute of Brain Pathology and a Clinical Institute, both at 2 Kraepelinstrasse. Twelve years later in 1966, the Institute was renamed as the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry. In the same year, a new research clinic was opened in Kraepelinstrasse 10.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

In 1984 the theoretical part of the Institute moved to a new building in [[Martinsried]], west of Munich. The Departments of Neurochemistry, Neuromorphology, Neuropharmacology and Neurophysiology were moved there. The Clinical Department, the Departments of Ethology and Psychology remained in Kraepelinstrasse. The independent Research Center of Psychopathology and Psychotherapy were closed.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

In 1989 the Institute's building in Kraepelinstrasse was renovated and enlarged with the addition of a new laboratory wing.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

In 1998 the theoretical part and the clinical part of the Institute segregated. The theoretical division of the Institute became the [[Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology]] and the clinical part kept the name "Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry".&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Research==
The Institute is one of the leading research centers on [[psychiatry]]. [[Physicians]], [[psychologists]], and [[natural science|natural scientists]] conduct research on psychiatric and [[neurological disorders]] and on the development of diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name="Research"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpipsykl.mpg.de/1495626/research.html |title=Research |accessdate=2014-07-29 |publisher=Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many patients participate in different clinical trails each year. Extensive phenotyping of the patients with analysis of blood and fluid samples, clinical psychopathology and neuropsychological testing, neurophysiological methods, neuroimaging techniques, and protein and gene analyses form the basis to investigate the causation of complex psychiatric and neurological diseases.&lt;ref name="Research"/&gt;

The concept of the Institute is based on a suitable balance between clinical and laboratory research. Research groups work on topics such as [[stress (psychological)|stress]], [[anxiety]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[neurologic diseases]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[schizophrenia]], [[sleep]], and other topics.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpipsykl.mpg.de/1495865/research.html  |title=Profile |accessdate=2014-07-29 |publisher=Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute consists of a 120-bed clinic equipped with laboratories for research on neuroendocrinology and sleep physiology, several special wards, a dayclinic for depression and psychiatry and various laboratories for cell and molecular biology.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

==Medical services==
The Institute provides medical service for psychiatric and neurological disorders. It has a hospital, dayclinic for depression and psychiatry and several outpatient clinics. The hospital consists of four psychiatric and one neurological ward with 120 beds. It treats about 2000 inpatients per year.&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpipsykl.mpg.de/825157/klinik.html |title=Medical services |accessdate=2014-07-29 |publisher=Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute provides treatment for [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[sleep disorders]], [[dementia]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Morbus Parkinson]], [[restless legs syndrome]], and [[endocrine diseases]].&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

The '''Medical Research Council''' ('''MRC''') is responsible for co-coordinating and funding medical research in the United Kingdom. It is part of [[United Kingdom Research and Innovation]] (UKRI), which came into operation 1 April 2018, and brings together the UK’s seven research councils, [[Innovate UK]] and Research England. UK Research and Innovation is answerable to, although politically independent from, the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]]. 

The MRC focuses on high-impact research and has provided the financial support and scientific expertise behind a number of medical breakthroughs, including the development of penicillin and the discovery of the structure of DNA. Research funded by the MRC has produced 32 Nobel Prize winners to date.

==History==
The MRC was founded as the Medical Research Committee and Advisory Council in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=121&amp;CATLN=1&amp;accessmethod=5&amp;j=1/|title=Records created or inherited by the Medical Research Council |accessdate=28 February 2012|publisher=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its prime role being the distribution of medical research funds under the terms of the [[National Insurance Act 1911]]. This was a consequence of the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, which recommended the creation of a permanent medical research body. The mandate was not limited to tuberculosis, however.

In 1920, it became the Medical Research ''Council'' under [[Royal Charter]]. A supplementary Charter was formally approved by the Queen on 17 July 2003. In March 1933, MRC established the first scientific published medical patrol named British Journal of Clinical Research and Educational Advanced Medicine, as a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research.

==Organisation and leadership==
{{Unreferenced section|January 2012|date=January 2012}}
The MRC is one of seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukri.org/about-us/governance-and-structure/|title=Governance and structure - UK Research and Innovation|accessdate=10 October 2017|publisher=Research Councils UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 6 June 2009 has been answerable to, although politically independent from, the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ukri.org/about-us/our-councils/|title=UKRI: Councils|accessdate=28 February 2012|publisher=Research Councils UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the MRC has been answerable to the [[Office of Science and Innovation]], part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].

The MRC is governed by a council, which convenes every two months. Its Council, which directs and oversees corporate policy and science strategy, ensures that the MRC is effectively managed, and makes policy and spending decisions. Council members are drawn from industry, academia, government and the NHS. Members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Daily management is in the hands of the Executive Chair. Members of the council also chair specialist boards on specific areas of research. For specific subjects, the council convenes committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mrc.ukri.org/about/our-structure/council/|title=MRC Council|accessdate=28 February 2012|publisher=Medical Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
Unilever first introduced the brand around 1982.

=== First UK television advert ===
Mentadent SR, formerly '''Gibbs SR''', is one of three toothpaste products still marketed by [[List of Unilever brands#Home and personal care brands|Unilever]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=DM01/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uni002/&gt; The product was originally named after its active ingredient, [[sodium ricinoleate]].&lt;ref name=DM01/&gt;

Gibbs SR was the first product to be promoted on UK television. The introduction of commercial television advertising was due to the [[Television Act of 1954]] which created the commercial broadcaster ITV. The advertisement was first shown on [[Associated-Rediffusion]] on 22 September, 1955 at 8.12pm BST, with a voiceover by [[Alex Macintosh]].&lt;ref name=DM01&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3878704/Storyboard-Britain-s-TV-advert-promised-1955-customers-Gibbs-SR-Toothpaste-leave-tingling-fresh-sale-900.html |title=Storyboard for Britain's first ever TV advert which promised 1955 customers that Gibbs SR Toothpaste would leave them 'tingling fresh' is on sale for £900 |first=Darren |last=Boyle |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=27 October 2016 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/timeline/classic-tv-adverts-still-bring-back-happy-memories-1.857319?referrerPath=2.2951| newspaper=[[News &amp; Star]]| location=Cumbria| title=Classic TV Adverts Still Bring Back Happy Memories| date=15 July 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715202622/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/timeline/classic-tv-adverts-still-bring-back-happy-memories-1.857319?referrerPath=2.2951| archive-date=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/home/the-end-of-a-golden-age/2006905.article |title=The end of a golden age |journal=[[Marketing Week]] |date=6 January 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement was written and produced by Brian Palmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1498112/How-my-dad-invented-the-ad.html |title=How my dad invented the ad |first=Alasdair |last=Palmer |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=11 September 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toothpaste==
Unilever make 3 varieties of toothpaste under the Mentadent brand&lt;ref name=Uni002/&gt;
#Mentadent P Toothpaste
#Mentadent Sensitive Toothpaste
#Mentadent SR Toothpaste

== Post 2003 brand within the United States and Canada ==
In 2003, Church &amp; Dwight Company acquired the United States and Canadian rights to the Mentadent brand from Unilever and then operated it as a subsidiary brand of [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] until it discontinued sales of the brand in 2016.&lt;ref name=Uni003/&gt;&lt;ref name=AHdiscontinedletter/&gt;

Mentadent is most notable for its unique [[toothpaste]] dispenser: a dual chamber pump.  This design is intended to keep two ingredients separated until they are dispensed.  Upon brushing, the ingredients will react with each other in the user's mouth. Both the toothpaste (formula) and the design of the pump were invented and then patented by Hans Schaeffer - who later sold the patent.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

In the majority of its toothpaste lines, the two separate ingredients are [[baking soda]] and [[peroxide]].  Upon brushing, baking soda and peroxide combine to release [[oxygen]] bubbles.  It is claimed that these bubbles will clean, whiten, and freshen the mouth.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

'''Clinical monitoring''' is the oversight and administrative efforts that monitor a participant's health and efficacy of the treatment during a [[clinical trial]]. Both independent and government-run grant-funding agencies, such as the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/data-and-safety-monitoring-plan-writing-guidance.shtml|title=NIMH » Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Writing Guidance|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s14084e/s14084e.pdf|title=Handbook for Good Clinical Research Practice (GCP)|last=|first=|date=2005|website=World Health Organization|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, require data and safety monitoring protocols for Phase I and II clinical trials conforming to their standards&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-038.html|title=NIH Guide:  FURTHER GUIDANCE ON A DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING FOR PHASE I AND PHASE II TRIALS|website=grants.nih.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Aspects of monitoring ==
According to the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]'s Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, the top five deficiency categories for site inspections caught by clinical monitors as reported in the 2001 Report to the Nation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/performance-improvement-2003/center-drug-evaluation-and-research|title=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|date=2015-11-23|work=ASPE|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:

*Failure to follow investigation protocol (the procedures and treatment subjects must undergo, as well as the schedule of assessments)
*Failure to keep adequate and accurate records
*Problems with the [[informed consent]] form
*Failure to report adverse events
*Failure to account for the disposition of study drugs
Therefore, the primary goal of clinical trial monitoring is to observe each trial site to ensure that the standardized operation procedures for the trial are being followed, reporting and managing any deviations from the investigation plan as they occur. Monitoring plans in the United States typically also require a clear protocol for reporting [[Adverse event|adverse/undesirable effects]] caused by the treatment to the [[Institutional review board|institutional review board (IRB)]], the [[Food and Drug Administration|US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)]], and the institution funding the research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM269919.pdf|title=Guidance for Industry: Oversight of Clinical Investigations|last=|first=|date=August 2013|website=US Food and Drug Administration|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA itself maintains an [[Adverse Event Reporting System]] for such occurrences in clinical trials it oversees in the United States.

== Functions of the clinical monitor ==

Clinical monitors execute the monitoring plan laid out by the sponsors and investigators of a clinical trial. Monitors may be referred to by many different titles, such as: [[Clinical Research Associate]], "on-site" monitor, Clinical Research Monitor, Study Site Monitor and Quality Specialist. The number of clinical monitors depends on the scale and scope of the trial.

Almost all field monitoring requires regular visits to the site by the clinical research associate throughout the period of the study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. On occasion, an extremely simple, low-risk study might be monitored almost exclusively by telephone except for the startup and closeout visits. Since the concept of "low risk" is subjective, this definition should be established in internal policies and procedures.

== Complexity of monitoring ==

The level of scrutiny of monitoring varies across studies based on risks and nature of the trial. 

Considerations that affect the design of monitoring plans usually include&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;:
*Complexity of the protocol (including toxicity, presence of special populations inside sample groups, amount of interaction needed, length of treatment, etc.)
*Risk of the treatment 
*Disease being evaluated
*Number of study subjects enrolled at the site
*Number of treatment sites (such as number of clinics with access to and assigning the treatment)
*Site performance
*Sponsor monitoring standard operating protocols
Several of these factors depend on the [[Phases of clinical research|phase]] of the clinical trial--for example, in some early Phase I studies of drugs whose effects on different individuals are unknown, the monitor may be required to be present during all or part of a subject's treatment, while Phase II investigations usually involve multiple investigation sites&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

The overall monitoring plan should remain fairly consistent, but the strategy for individual sites may change considerably during the course of the study depending on study conditions and site performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6933">[[Image:Jericho Health Centre 20050326.jpg|thumb|A primary care trust could commission community health centres.]]
A '''primary care trust''' (PCT) was part of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in [[England]] from 2001 to 2013. PCTs  were largely administrative bodies, responsible for commissioning primary, community and secondary health services from providers. Until 31 May 2011 they also provided community health services directly. Collectively PCTs were responsible for spending around 80 per cent of the total NHS budget. Primary care trusts were abolished on 31 March 2013 as part of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]], with their work taken over by [[clinical commissioning group]]s.

==Establishment==
In 1997 the incoming Labour Government abolished [[GP Fundholding]]. In April 1999 they established 481 primary care groups in England "thereby universalising fundholding while repudiating the concept." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Rudolf|title=Markets, politicians, and the NHS|journal=British Medical Journal|date=27 November 1999|volume=319|issue=7222|pages=1383–4|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7222.1383|pmc=1117121|pmid=10574834}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Primary and community health services were brought together in a single organisation controlling a unified budget for delivering health care to and improving the health of communities of about 100,000 people.  A Primary Care Group was legally speaking a subcommittee of a [[District health authority]]. As part of the implementation of the [[NHS Plan 2000]] PCGs were transformed into primary care trusts. 17 trusts were established in April 2000, a further 23 in October 2000, and 124 in April 2001 with a plan that all primary care groups would become trusts by 2004.  This was said to be a break with the market culture of the previous government, replacing [[GP Fundholding]] with a corporate culture that emphasises partnership and collective responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkin|first1=David|last2=Gillam|first2=Steve|last3=Smith|first3=Keri|title=Tackling organisational change in the new NHS|journal=British Medical Journal|date=16 June 2001|volume=322|issue=7300|pages=1464–1467|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7300.1464|pmc=32310|pmid=11408304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCTs held their own budgets and set their own priorities, within the overriding priorities and budgets set by the relevant [[strategic health authority]], and the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]]. They provided funding for [[general practitioner]]s and medical prescriptions; they also commissioned hospital and mental health services from NHS provider trusts or from the private sector. Many PCTs used the naming style "NHS", followed by the geographical area, to make it easier for local people to understand the management of the NHS locally.

==Management==
PCTs were managed by a team of [[executive director]]s headed by a [[chief executive]]. These directors were members of the trust's [[board of directors|board]], together with [[non-executive director]]s appointed after open advertisement. The [[chairman]] of a trust was a non-executive director. Other board members included the chair of the trust's Professional Executive Committee (PEC) (elected from local general practitioners, community nurses, [[pharmacist]]s, [[dentist]]s etc.).

The financial budgets, and much of the agenda, of PCTs were effectively determined by directives from the [[NHS strategic health authority|strategic health authority]] (SHA) or the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]].

==Restructuring==
In 2005 the Government announced that the number of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts would be reduced, the latter by about 50 per cent. The result was that, as of 1 October 2006, there were 152 PCTs (reduced from 303) in England, with an average population of just under 330,000 per trust. After these changes, about 70 per cent of PCTs were coterminous with local authorities having social service responsibilities, which facilitated joint planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4987430.stm |title=Local health bodies face shake-up |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing responsibilities were gradually removed from PCTs under the [[Transforming Community Services]] initiative.

On 12 July 2010, [[Andrew Lansley]] unveiled a new health [[white paper]] (which eventually became law as the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]]&lt;ref name=Act&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and Social Care Act 2012 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted |publisher=UK Parliament Website |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing significant structural changes to the NHS under the Conservative and Liberal Democrat [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]]. Among the [[National Health Service (England)#Current reform proposals|changes announced]], PCTs were to be abolished by 2013 with new GP-led commissioning consortia, [[clinical commissioning group]]s, taking on the responsibilities they formerly held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/12/radical-nhs-reform-plans |title=Pro-market agenda drives NHS reforms |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=12 July 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public health aspects of PCT business would become the responsibility of local councils. Facilities owned by PCTs would transfer to [[NHS Property Services]]. Strategic health authorities would also be abolished under these plans. Following widespread criticism of the plans, on 4 April 2011, the Government announced a "pause" in the progress of the Health and Social Care Bill to allow the government to "listen, reflect and improve" the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/06/government-pause-listen-reflect-improve-nhs-reform |title=Government to 'pause, listen, reflect and improve' NHS reform plans |first=Hélène |last=Mulholland |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate= 6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health and Social Care Act 2012 received Royal Assent on 27 March 2012&lt;ref name=Act /&gt; and PCTs were formally abolished on 31 March 2013.  Some of their staff were transferred to [[Commissioning Support Unit]]s, some to local authorities, some to [[clinical commissioning group]]s, some to NHS England and some were made redundant.

The '''periapical cyst''' (also termed '''radicular cyst''' or '''inflammatory cyst''') is the most common [[odontogenic]] [[odontogenic cyst|cyst]]. Periapical is defined as "the tissues surrounding the [[Dental anatomy#Surfaces|apex]] of the root of a tooth" and a cyst is "a pathological cavity lined by [[epithelium]], having fluid or gaseous content that is not created by the accumulation of pus."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most frequently located in the maxillary anterior region, it is caused by [[Pulp (tooth)|pulpal]] [[necrosis]] secondary to [[dental caries]] or [[dental trauma|trauma]]. The cyst has lining that is derived from the [[epithelial cell rests of Malassez]] which proliferate to form the cyst.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Highly common in the oral cavity, the periapical cyst is asymptomatic, but highly significant because a secondary [[infection]] can cause [[toothache|pain]] and damage. In [[radiograph]]s, it appears a radiolucency (dark area) around the apex of a [[tooth]]'s root.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Periapical cysts comprise approximately 75% of the types of cysts found in the oral region. The ratio of individuals diagnosed with periapical cysts is 3:2 male to female, as well as individuals between 20 and 60 years old. Periapical cysts occur worldwide.

Types of Periapical cysts:

Apical: 70%

Lateral: 20%

Residual: 10%

== Clinical features ==
Periapical cysts begin as asymptomatic and progress slowly. Subsequent infection of the cyst causes swelling and pain. Initially, the cyst swells to a round hard protrusion, but later on the body resorbs some of the cyst wall, leaving a softer accumulation of fluid underneath the mucous membrane.

Larger cysts may cause bone expansion or displace roots. Discoloration of the affected tooth may also occur. Patient will present negative results to electric and ice test of the affected tooth but will be sensitive to percussion. Surrounding gingival tissue may experience lymphadenopathy. The alveolar plate may exhibit crepitus when palpated.

Periapical cysts exist in two structurally distinct classes:

Periapical true cysts - cysts containing cavities entirely surrounded in epithelial lining.  Resolution of this type of cyst requires surgical treatment such as a cystectomy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Periapical pocket cysts - epithelium lined cavities that have an opening to the root canal of the affected tooth.  Resolution may occur after traditional root canal therapy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
Periapical cysts develop due to an inflammatory stimulus in 3 stages:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shafer's textbook of oral pathology.|last=R.|first=Rajendran,|date=2010|publisher=Reed Elsevier|isbn=9788131215708|location=[S.l.]|oclc=682882649}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Initial stage: Epithelial cells from the rests of Malassez at the apex of the roots of a non-vital tooth (one where the nerve and blood supply in the tooth have degenerated and no longer exist) become stimulated due to the body's inflammatory response to bacterial endotoxins infecting the pulp or as a direct response to necrotic pulp tissue, therefore re-entering the growth phase. Bacterial byproducts then are able to seep into the periapical region through the infected pulp.
# Cyst development stage:  Epithelial cells form strands and are attracted to the area which contains exposed connective tissue and foreign substances. Several strands from each rest converge and surround the abscess or foreign body. 
# Cyst growth stage: Fluid flows into the cavity where the forming cyst is growing due to the increased osmolality of the cavity in relation to surrounding serum in capillaries. Pressure and size increase.

=== Factors that influence cyst growth ===
The definitive mechanism by which cysts grow is under debate; several theories exist.

==== Biomechanical theory ====
Pressure and concentration differences between the cystic cavity and the growth surroundings influence fluid movement into the cyst, causing size increase.

==== Biochemical theories ====
a. [[Collagenase]] (breakdown of collagen) in the jaw bone leads to bone degeneration, providing room for cysts to develop. Substances released by the body's immune system as a result of the connective tissue breakdown, such as [[cytokine]]s and growth factors, contribute to the mobilization and proliferation of epithelial cells in the area.

b. Bone resorption caused by metabolism of acidic substances produced by cysts contributes to cyst growth. Such substances include [[Prostaglandin|Prostaglandin-2]] and [[Interleukin-1 family|Interleukin-1]] which are both produced by the cyst itself.

==== Nutritional deficiency theory ====
Epithelial cells will form a mass inside the cavity and the innermost cells become deprived of nutrients because they are far from the source of nutrients (the blood vessels). The innermost cells die and form an aggregate of dead tissue.  The inner cells undergo ischemic liquefactive necrosis which creates the cavity space surrounded by growing epithelial cells. This theory is unlikely in the absence of malignant transformation of epithelial cells as it does not follow the existing relationship between connective tissue and epithelium.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Abscess theory ====
Epithelial cells have an inherent quality to reproduce and cover any connective tissue that is not already lined with epithelia. Formation of an abscess must precede the epithelial proliferation in order for the cells to carry out this tendency. This theory explains why cysts are lined in epithelia but not why the initial cysts itself forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=George T.-J.|date=2010-10-05|title=Apical Cyst Theory: a Missing Link|journal=Dental Hypotheses|volume=1|issue=2|pages=76–84|issn=2155-8213|pmc=4205966|pmid=25346864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:den cyst.jpg|thumb|right|Visual image of the face of the person shown on the CT scan above. Swelling can be observed in the right cheek.]]

Secondary symptoms of periapical cysts include inflammation and infection of the pulp causing dental caries. This infection is what causes necrosis of the pulp.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Expansion of the cyst causes erosion of the floor of the maxillary sinus. As soon as it enters the maxillary [[antrum]], the expansion rate increases due to available space for expansion. Performing a percussion test by tapping the affected teeth will cause shooting pain. This is often clinically diagnostic of pulpal infection.

Radiographically, it is virtually impossible to differentiate granuloma from a cyst.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the lesion is large it is more likely to be a cyst. Radiographically, both granulomas and cysts appear radiolucent. Many lesions of the mandible in particular appear cystlike in appearance. It is often necessary to obtain a biopsy and evaluate the tissue under a microscope to accurately identify the lesion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Causes==
Dental cysts are usually caused due to root infection involving [[tooth decay]]. Untreated dental [[Tooth decay|caries]] then allow bacteria to reach the level of the pulp, causing infection. The bacteria gains access to the periapical region of the tooth through deeper infection of the pulp, traveling through the roots. The resulting pulpal [[necrosis]] causes proliferation of epithelial rests of Malassez which release toxins at the apex of the tooth. The body's inflammatory response will attack the source of the toxins, leading to periapical inflammation. The many cells and proteins that rush to an area of infection create osmotic tension  in the periapex which is the source of internal pressure increase at the cyst site.

These lesions can grow large because they apply pressure over the bone, causing [[resorption]].  The toxins released by the breakdown of granulation tissue are one of the common causes of bone resorption.

There are two schools of thought regarding cyst expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torabinejad M. Int J Oral Surg. 1983 Feb; 12(1):14-22.|first=M|date=February 1983|title=The role of immunological reactions in apical cyst formation|url=|journal=Int J Oral Surg.|volume=12|issue=1|pages=14–22|via=|pmid=6406374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Chemical reaction with Interleukin and Prostaglandin

==Diagnosis==
A non-vital tooth is necessary for the diagnosis of a periapical cyst, meaning the nerve has been removed by root canal therapy. Oral examination of the surrounding intraoral anatomical structures should be palpated to identify the presence of bone expansion or displacement of tooth roots as well as [[crepitus]] noises during examination, indicating extensive bone damage. Bulging of the buccal or lingual cortical plates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dental.pitt.edu/bone-structural-characteristics|title=Bone - Structural Characteristics - School of Dental Medicine - University of Pittsburgh|first=University of Pittsburgh University Marketing Communications|last=Webteam|website=dental.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be present. Age of occurrence in the patient, the location of the cyst, the edges of cystic contours, and the impact that the cyst has on adjacent structures must all be considered for proper diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunfee|first=Brian L.|last2=Sakai|first2=Osamu|last3=Pistey|first3=Robert|last4=Gohel|first4=Anita|date=2006-11-01|title=Radiologic and Pathologic Characteristics of Benign and Malignant Lesions of the Mandible|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1751–1768|doi=10.1148/rg.266055189|pmid=17102048|issn=0271-5333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several lesions can appear similarly in radiographic appearance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Intraoral X-rays or a 3-D cone beam scan of the affected area can be used to obtain radiological images and confirm diagnosis of cysts in the periapical area. Circular or ovoid radiolucency surrounding the root tip of approximately 1-1.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter is indicative of the presence of a periapical cyst.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholl|first=Robert J.|last2=Kellett|first2=Helen M.|last3=Neumann|first3=David P.|last4=Lurie|first4=Alan G.|date=1999-09-01|title=Cysts and Cystic Lesions of the Mandible: Clinical and Radiologic-Histopathologic Review|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1107–1124|doi=10.1148/radiographics.19.5.g99se021107|pmid=10489168|issn=0271-5333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border of the cyst is seen as a narrow opaque margin contiguous with the [[lamina dura]]. In cysts that are actively enlarging, peripheral areas of the margin may not be present. Periapical cysts have a characteristic  [[Locule|unilocular]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/unilocular|title=the definition of unilocular|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; shape on radiographs. There is also a severe border of cortication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cortication?s=t|title=the definition of cortication|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the cyst and surrounding bone. Pseudocysts, on the other hand, have a fluid filled cavity but are not lined by epithelium, therefore they have a less severe and more blurred border between the fluid and bony surroundings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.juniordentist.com/differences-true-pseudo-cyst.html|title=Difference between True and Pseudo Cyst|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resorption of the roots of affected teeth may also be observed as the absence of portions of normal root structures.

Infected cysts will produce a positive percussion test on the affected tooth as well as a negative response to the pulp test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remedyland.com/2013/04/pulp-test-or-pulp-vitality-test.html|title=What is pulp test or pulp vitality test - Remedy Land|date=10 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be visible swelling in the overlying soft tissues. The affected tooth may also exhibit discoloration.

==Treatment==
The infected tissue of the periapical cyst must be entirely removed, including the epithelium of the cyst wall; otherwise, a relapse is likely to occur. Root canal treatment should be performed on the tooth if it is determined that previous therapy was unsuccessful. Removal of the necrotic pulp and the inflamed tissue as well as proper sealing of the canals and an appropriately fitting crown will allow the tooth to heal under uninfected conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Surgical options for previously treated teeth that would not benefit from root canal therapy include cystectomy&lt;ref name="medeco.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medeco.de/en/dentistry-and-oral-medicine/operative-treatment-of-cysts/cystostomy/|title=Cystostomy|website=www.medeco.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cystostomy.&lt;ref name="medeco.de"/&gt; This route of treatment is recommended upon discovery of the cyst after inadequate root canal treatment. A cystectomy is the removal of a cyst followed by mucosa and wound closure to reduce chances of cyst regeneration. This type of treatment is more ideal for small cysts.

A cystostomy is recommended for larger cysts that compromise important adjacent anatomy. The cyst is tamponaded to allow for the cyst contents to escape the bone. Over time, the cyst decreases in size and bone regenerates in the cavity space.

[[Marsupialization]] could also be performed, which involves suturing the edges of the gingiva surrounding the cyst to remain open. The cyst then drains its contents and heal without being prematurely closed. The end result is the same as the cystostomy, bone regeneration. For both a cystostomy and marsupialization, root resectioning may also be required in cases where root resorption has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirtaniya|first=BC|last2=Sachdev|first2=V|last3=Singla|first3=A|last4=Sharma|first4=AK|date=2010-07-01|title=Marsupialization: A conservative approach for treating dentigerous cyst in children in the mixed dentition|url=http://www.jisppd.com/text.asp?2010/28/3/203/73795|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=203–8|doi=10.4103/0970-4388.73795|pmid=21157055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13579">'''Public Law 114-216''' is the federal law of the [[United States]] that regulates [[GMO food]] labeling. It was enacted on July 29, 2016 when [[President Obama]] signed then [[Senate Bill]] 764 (S.764). While the law is officially termed ''A bill to reauthorize and amend the [[National Sea Grant College Program]] Act, and for other purposes'', it evolved over time into "the legislative vehicle for a measure concerning bioengineered food disclosure".&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/764| author= [[U.

[[Roger F. Wicker]] (R-MS), cosponsored by Sen. [[Dan Sullivan (U.S. Senator)|Dan Sullivan]] (R-AK), and  passed Senate and House in June 2016. The law overturned relevant state laws such as Vermont's GMO labeling law that had called for strict and transparent GMO food labeling in Vermont after July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/2/obama-signs-bill-overturning-vermonts-gmo-labeling/| author=Stephen Dinan |title= Obama signs bill overturning Vermont's GMO labeling law|publisher=[[Washington Post]]| date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling of GMO food is mandated in at least 64 countries, including most European countries, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia.&lt;ref name=labelit&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.justlabelit.org/right-to-know-center/labeling-around-the-world/ |author= |title=Labeling around the world| publisher=justlabelit.org| date=  | accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The bill was created to "establish a national bioengineered food disclosure standard", whereby bioengineered food (commonly referred to as genetically modified organism or GMO food) is defined as "food that has been genetically engineered in a way that could not be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature".&lt;ref name=congress/&gt; It charges the [[U. S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard within two years with certain provisions:&lt;ref name=congress/&gt;
* Food from an animal cannot be declared bioengineered on the basis that animal has been fed bioengineered food.
* The minimum amount of bioengineered food present in food needs to be defined by the USDA to  carry the bioengineered label.
* The disclosure of bioengineered food can be a text, a symbol, or a digital or electronic link according to the discretion of the food manufacturer. 
* USDA is asked to conduct a study to see whether challenges exist in regard to access to electronic information.
* In certain cases a telephone number or internet site are allowed as a means of disclosure.
* Restaurant food and "very small" food manufacturers are excluded from disclosure requirements.
* States (and its subunits) are prohibited from establishing or continuing to require other GMO labeling practices.
* Food cannot be claimed to have no bioengineered food when there is no disclosure label.
* Certification by USDA's  [[National Organic Program]] "is sufficient" for a claim that bioengineered food is absent.

== USDA responsible for GMO labeling ==
While the [[FDA]] is responsible for protecting and promoting [[public health]] through the control and supervision of [[food safety]], the agency holds the position that "the use of [[genetic engineering]] in the production of food does not present any safety concerns for such foods as a class", and , as there is "an absence of reliable data indicating safety concerns" with GMO foods as a class, voiced no opposition for USDA having the responsibility of regulating GMO food labeling.&lt;ref name=fda&gt;{{cite web |url= http://4bgr3aepis44c9bxt1ulxsyq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FDA-HHS-TA-on-Senate-GE-compromise-bill.pdf |date= June 27, 2016 |title=FDA/HHS Technical Assistance on Senate Agriculture Committee draft legislation to establish a national disclosure standard for bioengineered foods (EDW16734) |publisher=FDA| accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agency commented that the bill has language that may allow GMO material to escape labeling: the bill requires labeling if the food contains "genetic material", but that may exempt secondary products like oil, starches, sweeteners, or proteins derived from GMO substrates.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt; The agency  questioned the specificity of  the definition of bioengineered food when it would not apply to GMOs that could also be achieved by 'conventional breeding".&lt;ref name=fda/&gt; The FDA has also voiced some concerns about food information being presented in electronic codes.&lt;ref name=fda/&gt;

As the details of the law need to be worked out, USDA established a working group by September 2016 "to develop a timeline for rulemaking and to ensure an open and transparent process for effectively establishing this new program, which will increase consumer confidence and understanding of the foods they buy, and avoid uncertainty for food companies and farmers".&lt;ref name=qns&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/article/usda-begins-crafting-rules-mandatory-gmo-food-labels/ |author=Ted Agres |title=USDA Begins Crafting Rules for Mandatory GMO Food Labels |publisher=Food Quality and Safety| date=September 13, 2016 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
Public Law 114-216 was passed after previous attempts to introduce a national GMO labeling bill had failed. It was fast-tracked without debate or committee review.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/us-senate-passes-gm-food-labeling-bill| author=Dianne Lugo |title=U.S. Senate passes GM food labeling bill| publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=July 8, 2016 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=consumerist&gt;{{cite web |url= https://consumerist.com/2016/07/29/president-signs-law-that-outlaws-vermont-gmo-labeling-rules-replaces-them-with-barcodes/| author=Chris Moran |title= President Signs Law That Overturns Vermont GMO Labeling Rules, Replaces Them With Barcodes |publisher=consumerist.com |date=July 29, 2016| accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original bill S. 764  - "A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes" -  had nothing to do with food and stalled after having passed the Senate. Hollowed out of its content it was replaced with a bill to defund [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref name=764related&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/764/related-bills|title=Related Bills - S.764 - 114th Congress (2015-2016): A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes.|first=Wicker,|last=Roger|date=29 July 2016|website=U.S. Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was then replaced with a bill creating to outlaw state-level GMO labeling and setting a voluntary GMO labeling bill.&lt;ref name=764related/&gt; When this bill failed, the S. 764 husk was used to rush through the present bill, just in time before the Vermont GMO food labeling requirement would have been activated on July 1.&lt;ref name=consumerist/&gt;

Previous attempts to enact a national GMO labeling law included H. R. 1599 in 2015 – ''the  Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015''. It was a proposed legislative amendment to the United States [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref name=hr1599&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1599/text |title=H.R. 1599 - Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015| publisher=US Congress |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act passed the House of  Representatives on July 23, 2015 but failed in the Senate. An earlier version of the bill had been originally introduced as H. R. 4432 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4432 |title=H.R.4432 - Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014| publisher=US Congress |date=April 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to regulate food labeling specifically in view of the introduction of [[GMO food]] in the United States.

==Proponents' view==
[[Katie Hill]], White House spokesperson, lauded the bill, "(t)his measure will provide new opportunities for consumers to have access to information about their food".&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt; Proponents have argued for a comprehensive labeling law that applies nationwide instead of a "patchwork" approach state-by-state.&lt;ref name=lange&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecochildsplay.com/2015/07/25/house-passed-the-dark-act-h-r-1599-banning-states-rights-for-gmo-labeling/ |author =Jennifer Lange|  title=House passed the Dark Act H.R. 1599 banning states’ rights for GMO labeling| publisher=Eco Child's Play| date=July 25, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also feel that a  proposed bill will enhance  agricultural biotechnology.&lt;ref name=lange/&gt;

Proponents argue that approved GMO food has undergone extensive testing, is "safe" and that basically labeling is unnecessary. Labeling may discourage consumers to use GMO products when such a choice may be irrational. A lot of consumers express fears that have not been substantiated by science.&lt;ref name=kopicki/&gt;

The bill is backed by [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]], [[Monsanto]], and other large food and beverage corporations.&lt;ref name=ecow&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecowatch.com/dark-act-clears-first-senate-hurdle-now-what-1908717697.html |author=Lorraine Chow |title=GMO Label Bill Clears Major Hurdle in Senate ... Now What?| publisher=EcoWatch |date=July 7, 2016 |accessdate=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opponents' view==
While GMOs are present in 75-80% of food Americans consume and have been termed "substantially equivalent" to the corresponding non-GMO foods by the FDA, consumers believe that they have a right to know what is in their food.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;  Thus, a 2013 poll by the [[New York Times]] indicated that ninety-three percent of American consumers would like to know if their food has been genetically modified.&lt;ref name=kopicki&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/science/strong-support-for-labeling-modified-foods.html?_r=1 |author=Allison Kopicki |title=Strong Support for Labeling Modified Foods| publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 27, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objection to the bill is that manufacturers have the option to use electronic codes in lieu of clear readable labels placed directly on the food package, which they argue hides the information.&lt;ref name=qns/&gt; The bill allows the use codes such as the [[QR code]] as a form of labeling, and opponents see this as impractical as well as discriminatory. They argue that, for instance, low-income families may not be able to access the information.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt; Critics also oppose the fact that no fines or penalties are included when companies do not follow the law.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Additionally, they are concerned that the bill's stipulation that labeling will be required when foods contain genetic material from genetic modification may exempt many of the highly processed foods and ingredients that are usually derived from genetically-modified crops (such as many seed oils, [[high-fructose corn syrup]], and some refined starches and sweeteners), because such foods are often sufficiently refined that no genetic material remains in them.&lt;ref name="Plumer2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plumer|first1=Brad|title=The controversial GMO labeling bill that just passed Congress, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12111346/gmo-labeling-bill-congress|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=Vox.com|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Stabenow  dismissed this interpretation when it was advanced by the FDA.&lt;ref name="Strom2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strom|first1=Stephanie|title=G.M.O.

Because clear and accessible labeling is not mandated, some opponents have called this bill and its predecessors the "DARK act" as in "Deny Americans the Right to Know" or "Keep Americans in the DARK".&lt;ref name=labelit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecow/&gt;&lt;ref name=brodwin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/07/30/dont-stop-states-from-passing-gmo-labeling-laws |author=David Brodwin |title=Don't Leave GMOs in the Dark |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |date=July 30, 2015 |access-date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;The '''Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation''' (QEMF) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[non-profit]] organization, founded in 1926 by [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876–1965)|Elisabeth of Bavaria]], wife of [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]]. She founded the organization, based on her experience with the wounded from the front-line during the [[First World War]]. The foundation wants to encourage laboratory research and contacts between researchers and clinical practitioners, with a particular focus on neurosciences. The QEMF supports seventeen university teams throughout [[Belgium]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "shoestring organization" with "offices mainly on [Joseph J. Mangano's] kitchen table"&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; was established to examine the relationships between low-level nuclear radiation and public health and question the [[Nuclear safety in the United States|safety of nuclear power]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

As of November 2010, Radiation and Public Health Project members have published 27 medical journal articles on health risks from radioactive exposures to nuclear reactors and weapons tests.  RPHP studies have claimed elevated rates of childhood, thyroid, and other cancers near reactors.

According to a 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the group's work has been controversial, and had little credibility with the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Similarly the work of the Radiation and Public Health Project has been criticized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission:&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/tooth-fairy.html|title=Backgrounder on Radiation Protection and the "Tooth Fairy" Issue|publisher=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies do not support the RPHP's claims. NRC finds there is little or no credibility in the RHP's studies". In an April 2014 article in Popular Science, Sarah Epstein referred to the group's work as "[[junk science]]" and disputed the group's peer-reviewed publications as being insufficiently evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/what-can-we-do-about-junk-science-16674140|title=What Can We Do About Junk Science|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Popular Science|author=Sarah Epstein|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Baby teeth ==
A set of 85,000 teeth that had been collected by Dr. [[Louise Reiss]] and her colleagues as part of the [[Baby Tooth Survey]] were uncovered in 2001 and given to the Radiation and Public health Project. By tracking the individuals who had participated in the tooth-collection project, the RHPR published results in a 2010 issue of the ''International Journal of Health Service'' that claimed that those children who later died of cancer before the age of 50 had levels of [[strontium 90]] in their stored baby teeth that was twice the level of those who were still alive at 50.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Matthew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/14cancer.html "Study of Baby Teeth Sees Radiation Effects"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 13, 2010. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was criticized by Stephen Musolino, a health physicist and specialist in radiation protection at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], as it "confuses [[correlation]] with [[Causality|causation]]" and in their opinion the authors of the paper are "ice-cream [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/decades-later-baby-tooth-survey-legacy-lives-on/article_c5ad9492-fd75-5aed-897f-850fbdba24ee.html Decades later, Baby Tooth Survey legacy lives on By JEFFREY TOMICH  Aug 1, 2013. St.Louis Post-Dispatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

RPHP studied 5,000 [[baby teeth]], the results of which were published in 5 medical journal articles.  High and rising levels of [[strontium-90]] in baby teeth were found near reactors.

The [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and nuclear industry groups responded with statements that the study was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/safetyandsecurity/factsheet/scienceonradiationhealtheffectsdispelstoothfairyproject/|title=Peer-Reviewed Science on Radiation Health Effects Dispels ‘Tooth Fairy Project’|date=August 2010|publisher=[[Nuclear Energy Institute]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups stated that the study suffered from small sample sizes; no control populations; no other cancer risk factors considered; no environmental sampling and analysis; [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] of data to fit the conclusion; and an incorrect [[half-life]] used for strontium-90. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not changed its opinion that there is no excess cancer risk from living near nuclear facilities.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

== Fukushima ==
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], Mangano and Sherman published several articles claiming detrimental health effects in America caused by fallout from Japan:

In a June 2011 article in [[CounterPunch]], they claimed a 35% increase in infant mortality on the West coast of the United States in the 10 weeks after the disaster, vs the 4 weeks prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/06/10/is-the-increase-in-baby-deaths-in-the-us-a-result-of-fukushima-fallout/print|title=Is the Increase in Baby Deaths in the US a Result of Fukushima Fallout?|website=CounterPunch.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Moyer of [[Scientific American]] stated that their claims are "critically flawed—if not deliberate mistruths", pointing out that this increase only appears [[Cherry picking|when choosing these specific time periods]], and there is no trend in the overall numbers for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/are-babies-dying-in-the-pacific-northwest-due-to-fukushima-a-look-at-the-numbers/|title=Are Babies Dying in the Pacific Northwest Due to Fukushima?

In January 2012, they claimed that fallout from Fukushima resulted in 13,983 excess deaths in the United States in the 14 weeks following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangano|first=Joseph J.|last2=Sherman|first2=Janette D.|date=2012-01-01|title=An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=1|pages=47–64|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22403909|doi=10.2190/hs.42.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was criticized for including different numbers of cities in the "before" and "after" categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Körblein|first=Alfred|date=2012-01-01|title=Response to "An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation"?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=553–555; discussion 561–570|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22993969|quote=The reason for the observed increase is that the data before and after Fukushima differ. ...

In a March 2013 article, published in the ''[[Open Journal of Pedriatrics]]'', they claimed a 16% increase in cases of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (CH) in 5 US states in the 10 months following the disaster.

[[File:Rebecca in Peoria c1880 web c 1880.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Mrs. Dr. Rebecca Keck (1838-1904) in Peoria c1880]]

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===

The oldest daughter in a large [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] pioneer farming family, Rebecca Keck ([[née]] Ilgenfritz, sometimes spelled Ilginfritz) was born in [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Wayne County, Ohio]] in 1838.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;''History of Scott Co., Iowa'' Chicago: Inter-State Pub. Co., 1882, pp. 858-861.&lt;/ref&gt;  She moved with her parents to [[Fairfield, Iowa]] at the age of thirteen, where she may have completed schooling as far as the eighth grade.&lt;ref name="State Census"&gt;''Iowa State Census'' July 3, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, she married John Conrad Keck, a merchant and mechanic newly arrived in Fairfield from Northampton County, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Jefferson County Marriages"&gt;''Jefferson County Iowa Marriages'' page 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Rebecca's brothers died of [[tuberculosis]] between 1857 and 1869; while she was nursing them through their illnesses, she also gave birth to six children (five girls and a boy)&lt;ref name="US Census"&gt;''United States Census'' records for 1860, 1870 and 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to develop a reputation among her neighbors as an [[herbalist]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;James Frederic Clarke, M.D. "A History of Medicine in Jefferson County, Iowa" ''The Journal of the Iowa State Medical Society'' Dec. 1934 and December, 1935. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, her husband built up a substantial farm equipment and foundry business.&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;''Report of the Iowa State Agricultural Society,'' John R. Shaffer, Secretary. 1866 through 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical career ===

Following the national banking [[Panic of 1873]], Mr. Keck's foundry business collapsed and the couple began to collect herbs and brew her remedies together, which Rebecca Keck started to sell door to door.&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;Dr. James Frederic Clarke M.D. ''ibid'' page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a wider market, in November, 1873, she took out her first advertisement for "Keck's [[Catarrh]]ochesis"  in Dubuque.&lt;ref name="Dubuque"&gt;''[[Dubuque Herald]]'' November 23 to 29, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; Success came very quickly; within three years she was advertising her "Catarrh Cure" heavily in a number of newspapers including the ''[[Telegraph Herald|Dubuque Herald]]'', the ''Davenport Gazette'' and the ''[[Chicago Times]]'' and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

Besides selling her remedies by mail order, she practiced as an "itinerant physician," a common business model for the frontier, because sick people were scattered across long distances and lacked regular access to medical care. She would rent rooms in a local hotel or storefront for visits of two days to two weeks, and take out large advertisements in advance to advise her customers of her upcoming personal consultations. She traveled her entire circuit every two months, so that patients could see her for follow-up treatment. At its height, her practice served between 12,000 and 15,000 patients, and she would typically see 350 patients per week.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

[[File:Flyer1894.jpg|thumb|The first page of a 4-page booklet describing Mrs. Dr. Keck's medical services, published in 1894.]]

Mrs. Dr. Keck moved her family to [[Davenport, Iowa]], on the Mississippi River, in 1875 as her business expanded.&lt;ref name="Finger's"&gt;''Finger's Davenport Business Directory for 1876''&lt;/ref&gt; As was common for Midwestern women physicians in her day, she used both Dr &amp; Mrs so that her married and professional status could both be understood by the public. She only treated chronic conditions and according to the testimonial letters she published in her advertising, the majority of her customers were working people and farm families who could not afford the high cost of private doctors' fees and who received her medical remedies and treatment advice by mail order.

Rebecca Keck considered herself to be a fully qualified physician by virtue of her long years of experience treating her family, neighbors and public customers. She owned a large medical library&lt;ref name="will"&gt;Rebecca J. Keck's last will and testament p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and advertised herself as an Eclectic practitioner. The [[Eclectic medicine|Eclectic School of medicine]], which grew out of the sectarian medical reform movements of the 1830s, was an active and publicly accepted school of medicine in the mid 19th century in the Midwest that competed with [[homeopathy]] and [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] (or regular, scientific) medical approaches. Eclectic treatments combined an emphasis on botanical remedies with a willingness to use regular medical techniques in certain cases.

There is no evidence that Rebecca Keck ever graduated from an Eclectic medical school although most of them were open to women by the 1870s. She did not enroll for regular medical training at the University of Iowa's new medical school which opened for men and women in 1871. Either she could not afford the time and money required (because of her six children and her family's bankruptcy in 1873) or she did not consider a professional degree to be necessary for her practice as a physician.

===Fame grows ===

With the exception of [[Lydia Pinkham]], Mrs. Dr. Keck appears to be the only woman to have earned substantial wealth on her own behalf in the lucrative but highly competitive and bruising profession of selling [[patent medicine]] in 19th century America.&lt;ref name="Stage"&gt;Sarah Stage, ''Female Complaints: Lydia Pinkham and the Business of Women's Medicine'' W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mrs. Pinkham, Mrs. Dr. Keck began her career because of family bankruptcy caused by the Panic of 1873. Unlike Mrs. Pinkham, Rebecca Keck not only believed herself to be a practicing physician, but became the top executive of the family's business and ran it herself, with the assistance of her two oldest daughters, Belle Alexander and Charlotte Dorn, while her husband played only a peripheral role and her only son contributed even less to the operations.

It is difficult to know Mrs. Dr. Keck's exact income, but she was able to purchase her infirmary in 1879 for $12,000 in cash,&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;''Davenport Gazette'' June 2, 1879, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time of her death, her life insurance payout of $15,520 was one of the largest made in the United States for the week of May 17, 1905.&lt;ref name="Insurance"&gt;''The Insurance Press'' May 17, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

While extremely unpopular with members of the medical establishment in Iowa and Illinois, Rebecca Keck enjoyed glowing front page editorial endorsements from newspapers in the cities where she practiced. Some newspapers ran her illustrated, full-column ads on the front page under the heading, "Mrs. Dr. Keck's Column." The ''Decatur Review''&lt;ref name="DecaturReview"&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=7104 About Decatur Review (Decatur, Illinois)]&lt;/ref&gt; declared on November 15, 1883, "We have a marked example among us of success in medicine, in the person of Mrs. Dr. Keck, well-known in the West," while the ''Bloomington Pantagraph'' declared on August 30, 1883 that Mrs. Dr. Keck "absorbs considerable public attention and is a subject for congratulation among the women of America…a forcible illustration of the ability of women to succeed" in "avenues of professional or public life." The ''Quincy Whig'' said she was "one of our longest established and best known physicians,"&lt;ref name="Whig"&gt;The ''Quincy Whig'' July 21, 1881 page 5&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Evening Peorian'' referred to her "celebrity as a physician and good name as a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' September 24, 1881 page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Peoria National Democrat'' declared, "her success is unprecedented…she is capable of doing the work of five ordinary women."

The regular medical establishment disagreed. The secretary of the Illinois State Board of Health, Dr. John Rauch was quoted in the ''Chicago Tribune'' as saying that Mrs. Dr. Keck was "foul and damnable in every way,"&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune'' February 7, 1880, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and mostly male members of county medical associations were hardly less kind; Dr. James Clarke M.D. of Fairfield averred that the sale of her [[catarrh]] cures "made the doctor wealthy, even if it did not cure her patients."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; Regular doctors universally dismissed her as a quack, and her name was excluded from the physicians and surgeons listing in the Davenport business directories every year after 1878, although she continued to describe herself as a specialist and physician in the regular alphabetical listings and bought the entire back cover of the 1882 edition to advertise her infirmary.

=== Legal reform ===

The state of Illinois passed its [[Medical Practices Act]] in 1877 in an effort to exert some control of the wholly unregulated medical profession in the state.&lt;ref name="Sandvick"&gt;Clinton Sandvick, Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877-1890  ''Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine''  June 2009; 82(2): 67–74&lt;/ref&gt; This Illinois law was a landmark in [[health law]] in the United States, leading the way towards improved standards for the dismal state of medical licensing and medical education in the country at that time.&lt;ref name="NEJM"&gt;''The New England Journal of Medicine'', known in 1890 as ''The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'' 122(11): page 257&lt;/ref&gt; The act defined requirements for a [[Medical license|physician's license]] that were extremely loose by modern standards, but which were sufficient to expel thousands of untrained and unqualified physicians and quacks from the state during the first year after it was passed.&lt;ref name="Board of Health 1878"&gt;Illinois State Board of Health, ''First Annual Report of the Illinois State Board of Health, 1878'' Springfield: Weber, Magie and Co. State Printer, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; Popular opposition to this measure was strong, and outraged citizens complained that a law requiring doctors to obtain a license to practice medicine was "an opening wedge for [[socialized medicine]]" in the state.&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;William K. Beatty, M.D. (1991) "John H. Rauch—Public Health, Parks and Politics" in ''The Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago'' Volume 44 page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Dr. Keck refused to stop treating her patients in Illinois and quickly emerged as one of the most formidable opponents to the state's legal reform effort. As she pushed back against the new governmental regulations, Mrs. Dr. Keck became locked in a highly publicized, adversarial relationship with the secretary of the new Illinois State Board of Health, [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch M.D.]], that lasted for at least a decade.&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt; When local doctors tried to block Mrs. Dr. Keck from practicing in McLean County, Illinois in early 1878, the ''Bloomington Daily Leader'' called hers the first test case of the new legislation, "the beginning of a long and tedious litigation" between the "regulars" and the "irregulars."&lt;ref&gt;''Bloomington Daily Leader'' February 12, 1878 page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting stigma of these accusations was probably an important reason why her accomplishments faded quickly and completely from public view after her death, and her career remains little known today.

Criminal charges were brought against Mrs. Dr. Keck in at least five different counties in Illinois for [[practicing medicine without a license]] between 1878 and 1889, but she was ably defended by her lawyer W. S. McCoy&lt;ref name="champaign"&gt;''The People of Illinois vs. Rebecca Keck'' Case No. 1686, Circuit Court of Champaign County, Ill. March 1886 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and persisted in business in McLean, Logan, Champaign, Peoria and Adams counties in Illinois for twenty years.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;''Decatur Review'' February 6, 1884, and hundreds of advertisements in newspapers from those cities&lt;/ref&gt; Iowa's medical legislation had even less effect on her business, and she opened Mrs. Dr. Keck's Infirmary for All Chronic Diseases in Davenport in 1879,&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; practicing with uninterrupted financial success there and in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and rural communities in Iowa until she retired in 1900.&lt;ref name="Republican"&gt;''Davenport Daily Republican'' July 11, 1900, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of quackery ===

Over the years, Mrs. Dr. Keck grew more and more boastful of her ability to cure many types of chronic diseases, including tuberculosis, an obviously impossible task in an era before the bacillus that caused the disease had even been identified.  Grateful patients wrote to her when they were cured of chronic lung infections, piles, eczema, general debility, deafness and a host of other issues, and she published their testimonial letters in her advertisements.,&lt;ref&gt;''Davenport Daily Gazette'' Nov. 10, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flyer"&gt;''Dr. Mrs.Keck's Medical Infirmary'' a four-page advertising flyer published by Rebecca J. Keck circa 1894, and thousands of advertisements published in newspapers, business directories and gazettes across upper Illinois and eastern Iowa between 1873 and 1900--see Newspaperarchive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent testimonial letters were a common feature of 19th century patent medicine advertising.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;James Harvey Young, ''The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation,'' Princeton, NJ: The Princeton University Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, United States Census records from 1880 show that many of these people actually existed as presented in print by Mrs. Dr. Keck.&lt;ref name="US Census"/&gt; However, in over a thousand ads that survive to be studied today, less than a hundred different individuals are named, and there is no way to verify the facts presented about their illnesses, particularly the accuracy of the diagnoses, and there is no way to know for sure what percentage of her thousands of other patients did and did not get cured.

Regular allopathic medical practice during the 1870s and 1880s often involved "heroic" treatments with harsh, mineral medications containing lead, mercury (calomel) and arsenic, as well as toxic vegetable compounds containing strychnine, castor oil (derived from ricin), belladonna and other poisonous substances we would consider extremely dangerous today.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Paul Starr, ''The Social Transformation of American Medicine'' Basic Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Clumsy, unsanitary surgical procedures were also common, so it is not impossible that Mrs. Dr. Keck's herbal tonics and sensible nursing advice were actually better for her patients than the regular doctors' remedies in some cases.

It is unlikely that Mrs. Dr. Keck ever hurt anyone. Alert opponents in the medical profession would have been quick to pounce on any provable instance if she had ever actually harmed a patient with her treatments. While a number of outright quacks were taken to court by angry patients seeking reparations for botched treatments in Davenport during the years she practiced, no such accusation against Mrs. Dr. Keck shows up in the public record.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;See for example: ''W.R.Alexander vs. Edward Emerson'' Case No. 1724, District Court of the State of Iowa for Scott County. November 6, 1890 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only parties who sued her during her career were male doctors with M.D. credentials. In every instance, they were seeking to solidify institutional boundaries for their evolving practice of allopathic or scientific medicine by first preventing her from getting a license and second by preventing her from practicing medicine without one. No evidence that she harmed a patient was ever produced in any of these cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2098">'''Right atrial pressure''' (RAP) is the [[blood pressure]] in the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]]. RAP reflects the amount of [[venous return curve|blood returning to the heart]] and the ability of the heart to pump the blood into the [[artery|arterial]] system. RAP is often nearly identical to [[central venous pressure]] (CVP),&lt;ref name="urlCentral Venous Catheter Physiology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/anesthesiology-elective/cardiac/cvcphys.cfm |title=Central Venous Catheter Physiology |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two terms are not identical, as a pressure differential can sometimes exist between the [[venae cavae]] and the right atrium. CVP and RAP can differ when venous tone (i.e the degree of venous constriction) is altered. This can be graphically depicted as changes in the slope of the [[venous return]] plotted against '''right atrial pressure''' (where central venous pressure increases, but right atrial pressure stays the same; VR = CVP − RAP).

==Factors affecting RAP==
Factors that increase RAP include:
*[[Hypervolemia]]
*Forced [[exhalation]]
*[[Tension pneumothorax]]
*[[Heart failure]]
*[[Pleural effusion]]
*Decreased [[cardiac output]]
*[[Cardiac tamponade]]
*[[Mechanical ventilation]] and the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
*[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
*[[Pulmonary Embolism]]

Factors that decrease RAP include:
*[[Hypovolemia]]
*Deep [[Breath|inhalation]]
*[[Distributive shock]]

'''Smoking in Syria''' is steadily increasing in popularity amongst the Syrian population, mainly in the forms of [[cigarette]]s or [[Hookah|Narghiles]]. In Syria, the '''General Organization of Tobacco''' manages the growth and exportation of [[tobacco]] products. Syrians collectively spend about $600 million per year on tobacco consumption.&lt;ref name="Mabardi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mabardi|first=Roueida|title=Smoking Ban Leaves Cafes Empty and Waterpipes Abandoned|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/Apr/29/Syrias-smoking-ban-leaves-cafes-empty-and-water-pipes-abandoned.ashx#ixzz1rQlBkkBg|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star: Lebanon|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, 20% of women and 60% of men smoke and 98% of the overall population is affected by passive smoking. [[Hookah|Narghiles]] (also known as the hookah or water pipe) and [[cigarette]]s are the two main forms of tobacco consumption.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking Ban Burns Syrian Businesses|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sccQeN89suw|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assumption that smoking, specifically the narghile, is embedded in Syrian culture, this phenomenon has only recently become widespread. Health officials are currently working on smoking cessation programs and policies, to remove this idea that smoking in Syria is an essential part of the culture, to educate regarding health effects, and to prevent citizens from smoking in public places.

==Smoking in Syrian culture and history==
{{See also|History of smoking}}
The factual history of smoking in Syria is uncertain. [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] was common in the Middle East before the arrival of tobacco, and is known to have existed in at least 2000 BC. Tobacco use in the middle east dates back to the 16th century. Narghile use is likely to have been a longstanding middle eastern tradition but may not have been considered a Syrian staple until the narghile’s popularity boom in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maziak W, Eissenberg T, Rastam S, Hammal F, Asfar T, Bachir ME, Fouad MF, Ward|title=Beliefs and attitudes related to narghile (waterpipe) smoking among university students in Syria.|journal=Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies|date=14 October 2004|volume=14|issue=9|pages=646–54|pmid=15380795|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2003.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narghile smoking is currently perceived as an important cultural feature of Syria, most notably in the city of [[Aleppo]], while cigarette smoking is perceived as a mundane activity with little importance to cultural life.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maziak|first=W.|author2=Eissenberg, Ward, Mock, Hammal|title=A pleasure among friends: how narghile (waterpipe) smoking differs from cigarette smoking in Syria|journal=Tobacco Control|year=2008|volume=17|issue=2|doi=10.1136/tc.2007.02052|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/17/2/e3.abstract|accessdate=2 May 2012|doi-broken-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the perception of Narghile being a staple of Syrian culture, Bisher Daaboul of the Syrian Society for Smoking Cessation notes that Narghiles have only been popular since the 1990s and “are not a tradition here in Syria that we have to live with and we have to protect.” &lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;

==Islam and smoking==
{{See also|Tobacco fatwa|Religious views on smoking}}
Although Islam has no specific ban on smoking tobacco, several Islamic principles are cited in support of the religion-based banning of tobacco. Depending on the location and community, Islamic authorities have either deemed smoking as ''[[Makruh]]'' (to be avoided) or ''[[Haram]]'' (forbidden).

The Fatwa Higher Council of Syria recently reiterated the importance of the 2007 ''[[fatwa]]'' (Islamic legal pronouncement), issued by Syria’s [[Grand Mufti]] Ahmad Badruddin Hassoun prohibiting every type of smoking, including cigarettes and narghile, as well as the selling and buying of tobacco and any affiliation with tobacco distribution.&lt;ref name="Syria Today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian smokers on the rise despite smoke bans|url=http://www.syria-today.com/index.php/may-2009/298-news/1409-syrian-smokers-on-the-rise-despite-smoke-bans|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Syria Today|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling’s justification is based on the view that smoking is a slow way of committing suicide, which is strictly prohibited in the Islamic faith. The connection to suicide is in reaction to the increasing spread of the knowledge of tobacco’s detrimental and potentially fatal health effects.&lt;ref name="Syria Today" /&gt;

==Appeal of Narghile smoking==
[[File:Small Argileh.jpg|thumb|Small argileh from [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]], Damascus.]]
Narghile smokers generally start smoking in their early 20s as they find that the activity produces a sense of togetherness among friends and facilitates an enjoyable social situation.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

The increasing prevalence of tobacco smoke in the form of the Narghile can be attributed to a variety of factors. French anthropologist Kamel Chaoucachi has isolated the three main elements of the narghile’s appeal, which include “passing of the smoking hose, conversation of the actors, and the nature of time within the created situation.” These factors highlight the social benefits of smoking the Narghile and the general increase in trendiness of the experience.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Both smokers and non-smokers in Syria acknowledge that smell and taste are noteworthy appealing factors of the narghile. This mention of the narghile’s sensory appeal signifies the importance of the introduction of ''[[Mu‘assel|Maasel]]'', a specially prepared fruit-flavored tobacco, in replacement of ''[[Ajami]]'', a raw unflavored tobacco, in regard to the growing popularity of the narghile. The spread of Maasel in the 1990s produced a surge in popularity for narghile smoking.&lt;ref name="Maziak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maziak|first=Wasim|title=The Waterpipe: Time for Action|journal=National Institute of Health|date=4 November 2008|volume=103|issue=11|series=11|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02327.x|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588474/pdf/nihms68007.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2012|pmc=2588474|pmid=18778388|pages=1763–1767}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing the pleasing aroma and taste, Maasel also simplifies the process of narghile preparation in comparison to the more complex process of preparing the traditional Ajami.&lt;ref name=Estimating&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Samer Rastam |author2=Kenneth D Ward |author3=Thomas Eissenberg |author4=Wasim Maziak |title=Estimating the beginning of the waterpipe epidemic in Syria|journal=BMC Public Health|date=4 August 2004|volume=4|issue=32|pages=32 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-4-32|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/4/32|accessdate=3 May 2012|pmid=15294023 |pmc=514554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional contributing factors to the spread of narghile use include free time and boredom of Syrian youth, social pressures, [[Euphoria|euphoric]] feeling after inhalation, aesthetic appeal of the narghile itself, smoking as a replacement for alcohol, widespread availability of the narghile in cafes and restaurants, and glamorization and commercialization of the practice in the media.&lt;ref name="Maziak"/&gt;

==Appeal of cigarette smoking==
Syrian cigarette smokers tend to start smoking in their teens, either in school, amongst family members, or (for males) in [[Syrian Armed Forces|military]] service. Cigarettes are mainly perceived as a means of stress management, coping, relaxation, and improvement in concentration.
In contrast to the positive view of smoking the Narghile, Syrian smokers tend to view cigarette smoking as a “mundane, oppressive, personal addiction.” &lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

A main appeal for teenage males is the sense of manliness that is associated with smoking cigarettes, while a main appeal for females of all ages is the associated sense of social liberalization. Other motivations stem from curiosity and general social pressures. Cigarette smokers acknowledge that many of the social pressures that initially prompted them to smoke have long faded but that they continue to smoke because of their addiction.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

==Perceptions of addiction==
Cigarette smokers perceive their habits as a clear [[addiction]]. Symptoms including cravings, inability to reduce tobacco consumption, and [[Nicotine withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms when attempting to quit.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

Although habitual Narghile smokers are less likely than cigarette smokers to perceive their habit as an addiction, many report steadily increasing frequency and intensity of narghile use, difficulty quitting, and withdrawal symptoms when attempting to quit.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

Narghile addiction tends to be more context dependent, as many who smoke it only crave it around friends or in the typical Narghile café setting. Cigarette smoking is a more personal pursuit, and desire to smoke is therefore constant regardless of the context.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

==Knowledge of health hazards==
Cigarette smokers generally believe that cigarettes are harmful to their own health and the health of the people around them. Cigarettes smokers are especially cognizant of the effects of [[second hand smoke]] on their family members. 
Narghile smokers are generally less cognizant of the narghile’s health effects on themselves and the people around them.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

Anthropologists hypothesize that the Syrian public considers narghile smoke to be less dangerous than cigarette smoke due to the perceived “filtration” process that occurs as the tobacco passes through water before it gets inhaled. This hypothesis has become less popular following increasing prevalence of surveying and research, which show that Syrian narghile smokers are aware that water is not a reliable means of filtration. The social atmosphere and positive connotation of smoking the narghile is likely to overshadow the health concerns and make it ultimately seem less harmful than smoking cigarettes.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Although specifics of the health hazards of tobacco use are not widely known, Syrian students tend to generally associate smoking the narghile with an increased risk in [[respiratory disease]] while mainly associating smoking cigarettes with an increased risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

==Social implications of smoking==
Despite the prevalence of cigarette smoking in Syrian society, there is still a sense of embarrassment attached to cigarette smoking, most notably in regard to the resulting odor it produces. This lack of social acceptance of cigarette smoking is relatively new and can be viewed as a positive progression within Syrian society.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

Narghile smoking, however, is generally socially acceptable. Tensions can sometimes arise between non-smoking parents and smoking children as well as between smokers and non smokers within groups of friends. Narghile smoking can sometimes cause smokers to only spend recreation time with other smokers.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2008"/&gt;

==Trends within groups of the Syrian population==

===Gender differences===
Males in Syria smoke more than females and have a higher daily consumption rate of cigarettes.  Among a sampling of Syrian professionals, smoking male schoolteachers and physicians consume about one pack per day whereas smoking female schoolteachers and physicians consume about half a pack per day. Men are more likely to be dependent on nicotine; according to surveys where dependence is measured by what time a cigarette is first smoked in the morning.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maziak|first=Wasim|title=Smoking in Syria|journal=Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis.|date=6 March 2002|volume=6|issue=3|pages=183–191|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iuatld/ijtld/2002/00000006/00000003/art00002|pmid=11934135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and smoking===
Women in Syria and across the entire [[Middle East]] are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the tobacco epidemic. In the past, Middle Eastern social customs deterred women from smoking tobacco in any form. Narghile smoking, however, is now a more acceptable activity for Syrian women and is seen as an indicator of increased socio-economic liberalization.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Abiding by traditions and cultural norms is a more popular reason for not smoking than that of health related concerns, religion, personal conviction, or economic reasons. The increased prevalence of tobacco use amongst Syrian women can therefore be seen in a positive light as it signifies increasing freedom for women in a generally male-dominated society. However, this development also brings about a new target group for tobacco companies and furthers the potential for the spread of the tobacco epidemic.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Cigarette use by Syrian women is still largely considered to be socially unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Non-Arabs, women from urban populations, women from smaller households, and women married to non-relatives are more likely to be smokers of narghile and cigarettes than their counterparts. Christians are more likely to be smokers than Muslims, and women working for pay are more likely to smoke than those that are unemployed. Sign of the tobacco epidemic spreading to women in poorer levels of society are particularly alarming, as this is the most unlikely sector of the population to be affected.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

===Age and smoking habits===
Male smoking rates increase from 16% in adolescents (up to 18 years of age) to 60% in adults. The age group among educated males with the steepest rise in smoking levels is from 19 to 21 years old.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

===Socio-economic trends===
Most habitual smokers in Syria are from lower and middle socioeconomic classes. One reason for this general trend is the tendency of Syrians males from lower socioeconomic levels to join the army rather than attend university. In 2002, smoking rates among military recruits were about 46% while the rates of age-matched university students were about 23%. Poorer students and/or those with poorer academic performance are more likely to join the military than to go to university and are thereby more likely to habitually smoke. In this case, those from a less favorable socio-economic background end up more vulnerable to nicotine dependency.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

Other cases indicate increased tobacco dependency with heightened levels of financial security. Male physicians in Syria are likely to become nicotine dependent earlier in their careers, whereas female physicians tend to habitually smoke later on in their careers. This trend is likely to be due to delayed financial independence for women.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

==Brand preference==
Smokers in Syria tend to evolve from switching brands in early stages of smoking to sticking with one brand as their dependency increases.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

Amongst adult nicotine-dependent smokers, brand selection is closely related to one’s socio-economic situation, as foreign brands tend to be double the price of local brands.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

90% of smoking high school students smoke foreign brands, as they smoke fewer cigarettes on average than adult habitual smokers. The less frequent amount of smoking amongst high school students makes foreign cigarettes less of a financial burden.
Foreign brands are viewed amongst Syrian smokers as lighter, safer, and better tasting, a belief that is derived from advertising strategies rather than the actual characteristics of foreign brands.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

==Quitting==
Cigarette smokers tend to have a strong desire to quit due to health concerns, [[stigmatization]], and concern for the safety of their family members. Quitting attempts are generally followed by relapse.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

Short periods of quitting allow smokers to experience the benefits of quitting such as better breathing ability, increased happiness amongst family members,  and increased stamina, but subsequent relapses tend to reduce the smoker’s confidence in their ability to fully quit, and therefore reduce their motivation to quit despite their experience of the positive effects of quitting.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

[[Relapse]]s tend to be attributed to stressful situations and having friend groups that smoke. Relapses are also caused by cigarette smokers’ use of the narghile as a means of easing off of cigarettes, which ends up proliferating their dependence.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

Some cigarette smokers do not have serious intentions to quit and others do not plan to quit at all, but the majority of cigarette smokers have interest in qutting.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

About a third of narghile smokers express motivation to quit.&lt;ref name="Health Care Providers"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Taghrid Asfara |author2=Radwan Al-Alib |author3=Kenneth D. Ward |author4=Mark W. Vander |author5=Wasim Maziak |title=Are primary health care providers prepared to implement an anti-smoking program in Syria?|journal=Patient Education and Counseling| date=November 2011 |volume=85|issue=2|pages=201–205|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2010.11.011|url=http://je5qh2yg7p.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/Elsevier:SD&amp;svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:sch_svc&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.aulast=ASFAR&amp;rft.auinit=T&amp;rft.date=2011&amp;rft.issn=07383991&amp;rft.volume=85&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=201&amp;rft.epage=205&amp;rft.title=Patient%20Education%20and%20Counseling&amp;rft.atitle=Are%20primary%20health%20care%20providers%20prepared%20to%20implement%20an%20anti-smoking%20program%20in%20Syria%3F&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016/j.pec.2010.11.011|pmc=3074023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some narghile smokers who are uninterested in quitting express enthusiasm about continuing their smoking habits in the future.

Many cigarette smokers indicate that they are waiting for a health incident to motivate them to quit.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

==Potential avenues for tobacco control==

===Price increases===
The method of price increase is likely to have a great impact on tobacco usage, due to the price-sensitivity of most habitual smokers.
A World Bank report in 2002 suggested that a 10% additional tax on local brands would be capable of cutting consumption by 5% and generating a revenue increase of 4.5%.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

Price increases on local brands of cigarettes are unlikely to increase illegal smuggling of foreign brands into Syria, as foreign brands are typically only bought by wealthier habitual smokers or irregular smokers. The majority smoking population (low-income habitual smokers) is therefore unlikely to supplement higher priced local brands with smuggled in foreign brands.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

===Smoking cessation programs===
[[Smoking cessation]] programs are essential to those seeking to quit, as medical literature suggests that less than 5% of quitters abstain from cigarettes permanently when quitting without external sources of support.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

The majority of health care providers are currently not trained to provide adequate cessation support, so the implementation of training programs is an important step in this method of control.&lt;ref name="Health Care Providers"/&gt;

===Media campaigns===
Media campaigns are a viable means of spreading knowledge to the public of the health effects of smoking. This is especially important in relation to narghile smoking, as its positive cultural perception is a large factor in its increasing popularity.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

===Age Restriction for access to tobacco products===
Age restriction is valuable as many cigarette smokers begin smoking in their teens due to social pressures. Lessening the availability of cigarettes to this age group may decrease chances of the development of a nicotine addiction.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

===Intensive prevention work for women===
Tradition has been the main barrier keeping women from smoking and this barrier is slowly breaking down. Public health efforts are focusing on replacing the passive barrier of tradition with an active barrier, such as awareness of negative health effects. Negative values of smoking have yet to be dissociated from the positive values of increasing economic and social freedoms for women.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

==Obstacles for public health initiatives==
One of the main obstacles for initiatives to curtail the [[tobacco epidemic]] in Syria is the shortage of reliable standardized data on tobacco use in Syrian society.  The first published initiative to study the epidemiology of smoking in Syria began in 1998.&lt;ref name="Maziak 2002 183–191"/&gt;

Another primary issue involves the Syrian medical industry and its health care providers. According to a sampling of Aleppo health care professionals in 2010, 22.4% of physicians and 26% of nurses smoke cigarettes and 9.5% of physicians and 9.4% of nurses smoke the narghile.&lt;ref name="Tobacco Epidemic"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K D Ward |author2=T Eissenberg |author3=S Rastam |author4=T Asfar |author5=F Mzayek |author6=M F Fouad |author7=F Hammal |author8=and J Mock |author9=W Maziak |title=The tobacco epidemic in Syria|journal=Tobacco Control|date=15 June 2006|doi=10.1136/tc.2005.014860|pmid=16723671|pmc=2563543|volume=15 Suppl 1|pages=i24–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Health care providers who smoke are less likely to believe that smoking is harmful and acknowledge the specific health impacts of smoking than those who do not smoke.&lt;ref name="Health Care Providers" /&gt;

Only half of physicians included in the 2010 study routinely inquire about their patient’s smoking habits, and of those, only 47.7% of those assist patients in quitting and only 11.6% encourage the scheduling of follow-up appointments for continued assistance. Only 5.3% of physicians reported to have prescribed medicine to aid in smoking cessation.&lt;ref name="Health Care Providers" /&gt;

Physicians note that the main obstacles for public health initiatives include lack of motivation amongst patients, lack of time, scarcity of medication, and lack of experience. Health care providers who smoke are also generally less motivated to promote cessation efforts due to their own smoking habits.&lt;ref name="Health Care Providers" /&gt;

==Syrian organizations for smoking cessation==
Two notable organizations are the Syrian Society for Smoking Cessation and the Syrian Center for Tobacco studies, both of which are affiliated with the World Health Organization.

The Syrian Society for Smoking Cessation is “a local association in Syria that was established on 22/02/2006 to support WHO and MOH efforts to control this huge problem. The main goal of this association is to increase the awareness among the Syrian society about the damages caused by smoking and also to prevent smoking spreading especially among the youths.” &lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Society for Smoking Cessation|url=http://www.emro.who.int/Arabic/Syria/Syrian%20Society%20for%20Smoking%20Cessation.htm|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies is “a pioneer model of international cooperation for the establishment of sustainable research base in a developing country setting. It addresses the need to create local expertise not only in research methodology, but also in research support and fund raising areas.” Its main goals are to study Syrian smoking practices qualitatively and quantitatively, to develop culturally appropriate and cost effective intervention techniques, and to train Syrian tobacco researchers in order to monitor the efforts to curtail the epidemic properly. One of its main strategies is multidisciplinary research, involving the efforts of medical anthropologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral pharmacologists, and physicians.&lt;ref name=SCTS&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.scts-sy.org/en/aboutus|publisher=Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bans on smoking==
Smoking in Syria is currently banned inside [[Coffeehouse|cafe]]s ([[hookah]] bars), restaurants and other [[public space]]s by a presidential [[decree]] issued on 12 October 2009 which went into effect on 21 April 2010. [[Syria]] was the first [[Arab country]] to introduce such a ban. The decree also outlaws smoking in educational institutions, health centres, sports halls, cinemas and theatres and on [[public transport]].&lt;ref name="BBC 8302794" /&gt; The restrictions include the [[narghile]]. According to the official  [[Syrian Arab News Agency]], fines for violating the ban range from 500 to 100,000 [[Syrian pound]]s (US$11 to $2,169).&lt;ref name="BBC 8634411"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 22 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A decree in 1996 banned [[tobacco advertising]],&lt;ref name="BBC 8302794" /&gt; while a 2006 law outlawed smoking on public transport and in some public places, introducing fines for offenders. People under the age of 18 are not allowed to buy tobacco in Syria.&lt;ref name="BBC 8302794"&gt;{{cite news

| work=BBC News 
| title=Assad decrees Syria smoking ban 
| date=12 October 2009 
| accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion of bans==
The 2010 ban has produced a variety of negative responses as it is said to “collide with Syria's water-pipe culture.” &lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news|last=May|first=Theodore|title=Syria's smoking ban sends cafe clientele away in packs|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-16-syria-smoking-ban_N.htm|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses say the ban is already hurting trade, and has, “led to a total halt in business” Although citizens know that this is the government’s attempt to tries improve the nation’s health, changing the tobacco loving culture in this region as well as the dependence on tobacco consumption for business may take some time.&lt;ref name="Mabardi"/&gt;  As of 2010, 20% of women and 60% of men are said to smoke and 98% of the overall population is affected by passive smoking.,  Narghile (also known as the hookah or water pipe) and cigarettes are the two main forms of tobacco consumption.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt;

Shop owners are trying to find ways around the law, such as allowing customers to smoke in the back or opening all doors and windows to have their restaurant be considered an outdoor establishment in which smoking would be allowed. They still take much caution, however, as they can be subject to fines and have the additional risk of the complete shutdown of their business following multiple offenses. Smoking customers themselves are subject to fines up to around $44.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;

Some businesses are beginning to accept the new law and try out other means of luring customers such as live music, cheaper prices, and better food. The “narghile boom” that had taken place over the course of the 15 years preceding the ban is believed to be at an end.&lt;ref name=GulfNews&gt;{{cite news|last=Moubayed|first=Sami|title=It's going to be tough to take a puff in the Mideast|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/syria/it-s-going-to-be-tough-to-take-a-puff-in-the-mideast-1.610649|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Gulf News|date=4.11.2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the successful cut-down on public smoking, the ban has also caused an increase in narghile delivery and at-home smoking, since this type of smoking is not prohibited by the ban.&lt;ref name="GulfNews" /&gt;

Health Minister [[Rida Said]] defended the ban saying it “protects the rights of non-smokers, many of whom are children, and is an important step towards reduction of smoking-related illness”.&lt;ref name=GulfNews /&gt;

Syria’s revolutionary youth organization (affiliated with the ruling Ba’ath party) held a rally in Damascus to promote the new law, as a means of bringing about a “healthy and strong population” &lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"/&gt;

==Smoking and the Syrian protests of 2011==
Cigarette smoke plays a large role in the characterization of [[2011-2012 Syrian uprising|Syrian protesters]]. “Syria’s disenfranchised Bouazizis are the greatest population of this revolution. Incidentally, a lot of them are also four-pack-a-day smokers.” Prominent activist bloggers advertise their smoking habits. A young Bouazizi from the city of Binnish said in July 2011, “I was lost for 12 hours in the mountains. Never mind that I had no food or water — my agony was, I had no cigarettes!” &lt;ref name="Smoking and the Revolution" /&gt;

The association with smoking and social liberalization for women has made smoking popular and present in the image of the female Syrian protester.&lt;ref name="Smoking and the Revolution"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahf|first=Mohja|title=Syria's Revolution: Created by Local Women &amp; Men Smoking Four Packs a Day|url=http://forusa.org/blogs/mohja-kahf/syrias-revolution-created-local-women-men-smoking-four-packs-day/10121|publisher=Fellowship of Reconciliation|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some territories controlled by the [[Syrian opposition]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]], smoking is banned and even punishable with death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Islamic-law-takes-hold-in-northern-Syria-Singing-smoking-and-pictures-banned-338771&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven C. Parrish''' (born April 13, 1950) is a C-Suite executive consultant, American lawyer, Chair [[Safe Horizon]], and community volunteer. Until 2008, he was an executive for [[Altria Group, Inc.|Altria Group Inc.]] (formerly [[Philip Morris Companies Inc.|Philip Morris Companies, Inc.]]) where he was a Senior Vice President for Corporate Affairs.

For more than a decade, Steve Parrish supported proposals to grant the Federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) authority to regulate the [[tobacco industry]]. His efforts were documented in network news broadcasts and national publications, including ABC's "Peter Jennings Reporting from the Tobacco File," a ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Magazine]]'' cover story "If It's Good for Philip Morris, Can It Also Be Good for Public Health?" and the national best-seller, ''A Question of Intent'' by former FDA Chairman Dr. [[David A. Kessler|David Kessler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/magazine/18tobacco.html|title=If It's Good for Philip Morris, Can It Also Be Good for Public Health?|last=Nocera|first=Joe|date=June 18, 2006|work=The New York Times Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Question of Intent: A Great American Battle with a Deadly Industry|last=Kessler|first=David|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2001|isbn=1-58648-121-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the passage of the landmark bill granting FDA regulatory authority over the tobacco industry, a 2009 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article quoted Parrish as congratulating Dr. Kessler.

American Journal of Public Health, 86(8), II29-II36.&lt;/ref&gt; The program has been carefully developed, evaluated and continually refined over the course of 15 years by prominent behavioral scientists from the [[University of California, San Francisco]]'s Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, the largest research center in the world dedicated to social, behavioral and policy science approaches to HIV.

In 1999, it was one of the first programs to be included in the [[Center for Disease Control]] and Prevention's ''Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions with Evidence of Effectiveness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/prev_prog/rep/resources/initiatives/compendium.htm |title=Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions with Evidence of Effectiveness |accessdate=2008-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308084833/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/prev_prog/rep/resources/initiatives/compendium.htm |archive-date=2008-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only program included that is designed specifically to address the HIV Prevention needs of young gay/bisexual men and other young men who have sex with men (MSM).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==History==
Recognizing the critical need for HIV prevention programs for young gay/bisexual men, Dr. Susan Kegeles and Dr. Robert Hays, research psychologists at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) at the University of California, San Francisco, applied for funding to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) to design, implement, and evaluate a community-level HIV prevention program for young gay/bisexual men. Their five-year grant was awarded in 1990.

[[Image:Mpowerment Project UCSF logo.jpg|thumb|alt=Mpowerment project logo.|Mpowerment Project.]]

They pilot tested the program in Santa Cruz, CA. Based on encouraging results there, they refined the program and implemented it in a second community (Eugene, OR), where it was named the Mpowerment Project. Following the program's success in Eugene, it was replicated in Santa Barbara, CA. In 1995 Drs. Kegeles and Hays received a second five-year grant form the NIMH to further develop the program for use in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. Dr. Greg Rebchook, a research psychologist who had worked at a department of public health and at a community-based organization, joined the team in 1996. This new grant enabled them to implement the Mpowerment Project in Albuquerque, NM – where the project was called MPower (1997–1998); and in Austin, TX – where the project was called Austin Men's Project / AMP (1999–2000).&lt;ref&gt;Kegeles, S.M., Hays, R.B., Pllack, L.

The Mpowerment Project is cost-effective compared with many other HIV prevention strategies. The cost per HIV infection prevented is far less than the lifetime medical costs of HIV disease.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J. G., Kegeles, S. M., Hays, R., &amp; Beltzer, N. (2001). Cost-effectiveness of the Mpowerment Project, a community-level intervention for young gay men. Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 27(5), 482-491.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the [[RAND Corporation]] developed a mathematical model of the cost of a wide variety of HIV prevention interventions. The Mpowerment Project is listed as the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen DA, Wu S-Y, and Farley TA, “Cost-Effective Allocation of Government Funds to Prevent HIV Infection,” Health Affairs, Vol. 24, No. 4, July/August 2005, pp. 915–926.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mpowerment manual was released in 2002 and updated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Kegeles, S.M., Rebchook, G., Hamiga, J. Sweeney, D., Tebbetts.S, Williams.R, Zovod. B, The Mpowerment Project Manual, University of California San Francisco (2010)
&lt;/ref&gt; The individually bound modules cover the following program components: 
*Module 1: Overview
*Module 2: Community Assessment – Knowing your community
*Module 3: Implementing Agency
*Module 4: Coordinators
*Module 5: Core Group &amp; Volunteers
*Module 6: Project Space
*Module 7: Formal Outreach – Social outreach events and outreach team
*Module 8: Informal Outreach
*Module 9: M-Groups
*Module 10: Publicizing the Mpowerment Project
*Module 11: The Community Advisory Board
*Module 12: Monitoring and Evaluation
*Module 13: M-Group Facilitator’s Guide
*Module 14: M-Group Meeting Guide

==Group Structure==
The project is made up of three levels of participants: the core group, volunteers, and the community advisory board.

The core group consists of 10-15 members who represent the demographics of that particular project's local community. These members oftentimes change according to shifts in the community's population.

Volunteers are those who cannot devote as much time to the core group, but would still like to contribute. Volunteers are what help the program be as cost effective as it is.

Finally, a community advisory board is available for the core group and volunteers. Consisting of older members of the LGBT community, the community advisory board provide relevant advice for the groups who usually consist of LGBT youth.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, R.B., Rebchook, G.M., &amp; Kegeles, S.M. (2003) The Mpowerment Project: Community-Building With Young Gay and Bisexual Men to Prevent HIV. American Journal of Community Psychology, 31, 301-312.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">'''Thomas Perkins Lowman Hunt''' (1802 in Whitchurch, [[Dorset]] – 18 August 1851 in Godlingstone near [[Swanage]]) was an English speech therapist, inventor of a method of curing [[stammering]].

==Life==
Hunt was born in [[Dorset]] in 1802, and is stated to have been educated at [[Winchester]], Hampshire. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1822, with the intention of becoming a minister of the church of England, but the affliction of a fellow-collegian who suffered from stammering is said to have arrested his attention, and he left Cambridge without taking a degree in order to devote himself to the study and cure of defective utterance.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=HNT822TP|name=Hunt, Thomas Perkins Lowman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the lips, the tongue, the jaws, and the breath were in different cases the offending members. Being satisfied of his ability to cure stammering, he sought wider experience in a provincial tour, and finally in 1827 settled in [[Regent Street]], London. He relied on simple common-sense directions. Each case was studied separately. Sometimes slow and sometimes rapid articulation was recommended to his patients, others were taught to place their tongues in particular positions, and others practised improved means of breathing. He held that not one case in fifty was the consequence of malorganisation, and objected to surgical operations. At an early date, 1828, he was patronised by Sir John Forbes, M.D., F.R.S., who sent him pupils for twenty-four years. When George Pearson, the chief witness in the case respecting the attempt on the life of [[Queen Victoria]] made by John Francis on 30 May 1842, was brought into court, he was incapable of giving utterance to his evidence, but after a fortnight's instruction from Hunt he spoke with perfect readiness, a fact certified by Sir Peter Laurie, the sitting magistrate. ''[[The Lancet]]'' of 16 May 1846 made a severe attack on Hunt as an unlicensed practitioner. Hunt ably replied in the ''[[Literary Gazette]]'' of 30 May. His leisure was spent in [[Dorset]], where he cultivated land, and made agricultural improvements and experiments. In 1849 his numerous pupils, belonging to all professions, in commemoration of his twenty-two years' service, subscribed for his bust in marble, which was modelled by [[Joseph Durham]], and exhibited in the Royal Academy.

He died at Godlingstone, near [[Swanage]], Dorset, on 18 Aug. 1851, leaving his practice to his son [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]]. His widow, Mary, died 25 Jan. 1855, aged 49.

In [[feminist psychology]], the terms '''womb envy''' and '''vagina envy''' denote the [[anxiety]] that many men may feel caused by envy of the biological functions of the female sex ([[pregnancy]], [[parturition]], [[breast feeding]]). These emotions could fuel the [[Social role|social]] subordination of women, and drive men to succeed in other areas of life, such as business, law, and politics.&lt;ref name="Horney 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last= Horney |first= Karen |title= Feminine Psychology |publisher= W.W. Norton Company, New York |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Karen Horney {{!}} German psychoanalyst|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Karen-Horney#ref669884|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Eve's Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History.|last = McElvaine|first = Robert S.|publisher = New York: McGraw-Hill|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each term is analogous to the concept of female [[penis envy]], derived from the theory of [[psychosexual development]], presented in [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]]; they address the [[gender role]] social dynamics underlying the "envy and fascination with the female breasts and lactation, with pregnancy and childbearing, and vagina envy [that] are clues and signs of transsexualism and to a femininity complex of men, which is defended against by psychological and sociocultural means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warnes |first=H. |last2=Hill |first2=G. |year=1974 |title=Gender Identity and the Wish to be a Woman |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=25–29 |doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(74)71290-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Womb envy==
''Womb envy'' denotes the envy men may feel towards a woman's role in nurturing and sustaining life. In coining the term, the [[Neo-Freudian]] [[psychiatrist]] [[Karen Horney]] (1885–1952) proposed that men experience womb envy more powerfully than women experience penis envy, because "men need to disparage women more than women need to disparage men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Horney |first= Karen |title= The collected works of Karen Horney (volume II) |publisher= W.W. Norton Company, New York |year=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], Horney considered womb envy a cultural, [[psychosocial]] tendency, like the concept of penis envy, rather than an innate male psychological trait.&lt;ref name="Horney 1967" /&gt;

[[Brian Luke]], in his book ''Brutal: Manhood and the Exploitation of Animals,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brutal: Manhood and the Exploitation of Animals|last = Luke|first = Brian|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses three ways in which men who experience womb envy may respond: by compensating—constructing a realm of exclusively male activity, by revaluing—devaluing the functions specific to women and/or magnifying the functions specific to men, and by appropriation—taking control of female specific functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brutal: Manhood and the Exploitation of Animals|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6uCEhroo-oEC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=when+was+the+phrase+womb+envy+coined&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j5pkhaDcZo&amp;sig=Ubdmin1P6fpc6_QloR1dkueRGug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq3_WP88TKAhVrn4MKHWK0CPAQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=when%2520was%2520the%2520phrase%2520womb%2520envy%2520coined&amp;f=false|publisher = University of Illinois Press|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780252074240|language = en|first = Brian|last = Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke attributes the coining of this term not to Horney, but to [[Eva Kittay]]. The first page of her 1984 article, ''Rereading Freud on 'Femininity' or Why Not Womb Envy?'', is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rereading Freud on ‘femininity' or why not womb envy?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0277539584900384|journal = Women's Studies International Forum|date = 1984-01-01|pages = 385–391|volume = 7|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(84)90038-4|first = Eva Feder|last = Kittay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it she does pose the question of why there is not an concept analogous to penis envy and offers the term womb envy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rereading Freud on 'Femininity' or Why Not Womb Envy?|last = Kittay|first = Eva|date = 1984|journal = Women's Studies Int. Forum, Vol. 7, No. 5, pp. 385-391|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Personality Theories,'' [[Barbara Engler]] discusses the often unconscious and indirect ways that womb envy manifests. "Womb envy, rather than being openly acknowledged by most males, has often taken subtle and indirect forms, such as rituals of taboo, isolation, and cleansing that have been frequently associated with [[menstruation]] and childbirth, the need to disparage women, accuse them of witchcraft, belittle their achievements and deny them equal rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Personality Theories|last = Engler|first = Barbara|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = 128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engler also refers to criticism of Horney's theory on the grounds that it equated [[womanhood]] with [[mother]]hood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Personality Theories|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UHCdjI36q9cC|publisher = Cengage Learning|date = 2008-08-25|isbn = 0547148348|language = en|first = Barbara|last = Engler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the limitations of Horney's broader psychological viewpoint, [[Bernardo J. Carducci]] points out the comparative lack of empirical evidence saying, "In comparison to other theorists..., Horney's work has generated very little empirical research among personality psychologists. Although her theoretical ideas were presented in a relatively straightforward manner, they have not stimulated much interest in others to investigate their validity. This may be in part due to the rejection of her ideas by the more traditional and influential Freudian tradition operating at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications|last = Carducci|first = Bernardo J.|publisher = Wiley|year = |isbn = |location = |page = 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Eve's Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History]]'' (2000), historian [[Robert S. McElvaine]] extended Horney's argument that womb envy is a powerful, elementary factor in the psychological [[Power (philosophy)|insecurity]] suffered by many men. He coined the term ''non-menstrual syndrome'' (NMS), denoting a man's possible insecurity before the biologic and reproductive traits of woman; thus, womb envy may impel men to define their [[Identity (social science)|identities]] in opposition to women. Hence, men who are envious of women's reproductive traits insist that a "real man" must be "not-a-woman", thus they may seek to socially dominate women—what they may or may not do in life—as psychological compensation for what men cannot do biologically.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine, Robert S. (2000) ''Eve's Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and the Course of History'' McGraw-Hill, New York pp. 72–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vagina envy==
''Vagina envy'' denotes the envy males may feel towards females for having a [[Vulva|vagina]]. In ''Psychoanalysis and Male Sexuality'' (1966), Hendrik Ruitenbeek relates vagina envy to men's desire to be able to give birth and to urinate (higher flow rate) and to [[masturbate]] in ways [[Human anatomy|physically]] different from those available to men, and that such psychological envy might produce [[misogyny]] in [[Neurosis|neurotic]] men.&lt;ref&gt;Ruitenbeek, Hendrik (1966) ''Psychoanalysis and Male Sexuality'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, New York p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Vagina Envy in Men'' (1993), the physician Harold Tarpley elucidates the theoretic differences among the constructs of "vagina envy", "womb envy", "breast envy", and "parturition envy", emotions wherein men suffer envy—"a grudging desire for another's excellence or advantage"—of women's female biologic capabilities of pregnancy, parturition, breast feeding, and of the social-role freedom to physically nurture children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarpley |first=Harold |year=1993 |title=Vagina Envy in Men |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=457–464 |doi= |pmid=8226185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The theory of "womb envy" or "vaginal envy" is criticized based on the position that it indicates how the essence of being a woman lies in motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Theories|last=Engler|first=Barbara|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|year=2009|isbn=9780547148342|location=Boston, MA|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are scholars who point out that the woman defined in terms of her essential maternity reduces her to her gender characteristics and could, hence, be exploited or be defined according to the terms of patriarchal logic and phallocentric impositions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy and the Maternal Body: Reading Silence|last=Walker|first=Michelle|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415168570|location=London|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domna Stanton]], for instance, drew from [[Jacques Derrida]]'s work to support this argument,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; particularly, the theorist's position that "the maternal, which is metaphorized as total being to substantiate a notion that can combat the paternal, represents only one aspect of potential female difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thinking Muse: Feminism and Modern French Philosophy|last=Allen|first=Jeffner|last2=Young|first2=Iris Marion|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1989|isbn=0253359805|location=Bloomington|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
