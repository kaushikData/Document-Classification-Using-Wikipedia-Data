      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5958">[[Image:RCA-833A.jpg|thumb|right|An [[RCA]] Radiotron 833A with [[heat sink]] connectors]]
The '''833A''' is a [[vacuum tube]] constructed for medium power oscillator or class B or C amplifier applications. It is a medium-mu power [[triode]] with 300 watts CCS or 350 watts ICAS anode dissipation. The long grid and anode leads, plus high internal capacitance, limits this tube to 15-30&amp;nbsp;MHz maximum frequency. Being medium mu, it is normally not suitable for grounded grid operation.

== Specifications ==
The 833A is a large tube of the type sometimes known as a "cookie jar" tube,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Harvey. [http://www.meta-gizmo.com/Tri/Dancing/PATH2POW.html Pathways to Power].&lt;/ref&gt; with the envelope nominally measuring 116.8&amp;nbsp;mm (4.60 in.) in diameter and 219.2&amp;nbsp;mm (8.63 in.) in height.  The 833A contains a thoriated tungsten filament rated at 10 volts and 10 amps.  A pair of 833A's with adequate forced air cooling can deliver 1000 watts of CCS RF power operating as a class C amplifier plate modulated stage.  

A pair of tubes used in a class B [[modulator]] can deliver 1800 watts of "peak" AF power in ICAS service with speech, or 1600 watts in CCS service with music or high duty cycle operation. Two 833A's are capable of approximately 800 watts sine wave power in a class B audio amplifier or modulator. This assumes approximately 58% efficiency, 1400 watts input, and 300 watts per tube anode dissipation. The anode normally shows a dull to medium red color when operating at full power.&lt;ref&gt;RCA Transmitting Tubes, TT5, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The tube is supported solely by its two filament posts. These posts are keyed with the F1 and F2 connection having a diameter of 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.375&amp;nbsp;in) and 11.1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.438&amp;nbsp;in) respectively.

The 833A was preceded by the 833.&lt;ref&gt;RCA Transmitting Rubes, TT3, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The 833A was widely used in small (1&amp;nbsp;kW class) AM broadcast transmitters. Typically, a pair of 833As would be used in the final amplifier, plate modulated by another pair. It was also used in small induction heaters. This tube has also been used by hobbyists to construct a vacuum tube [[Tesla coil]].&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Carl. [http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/cwillis/833acoil.html 833-A Vacuum Tube Tesla Coil].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian Dust''' (also '''yellow dust''', '''yellow sand''', '''yellow wind''' or '''China dust storms''') is a meteorological phenomenon which affects much of East Asia year round but especially during the spring months. The dust originates in the deserts of [[Mongolia]], northern China and [[Kazakhstan]] where high-speed surface winds and intense [[dust storms]] kick up dense clouds of fine, dry soil particles. These clouds are then carried eastward by prevailing winds and pass over China, [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]], as well as parts of the [[Russian Far East]]. Sometimes, the airborne particulates are carried much further, in significant concentrations which affect air quality as far east as the United States.

Since the turn of the 21st century, it has become a serious problem due to the increase of industrial [[pollution|pollutants]] contained in the dust and intensified [[desertification]] in China causing longer and more frequent occurrences, as well as in the last few decades when the [[Aral Sea]] of Kazakhstan and [[Uzbekistan]] started drying up due to the diversion of the [[Amu Darya|Amu River]] and [[Syr Darya|Syr River]] following a [[Soviet agriculture|Soviet agricultural program]] to irrigate Central Asian deserts, mainly for cotton plantations.

==Pollutants==
Sulfur (an [[acid rain]] component), soot, ash, carbon monoxide, and other toxic pollutants including heavy metals (such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[arsenic]], lead, [[zinc]], copper) and other [[carcinogens]], often accompany the dust storms, as well as viruses, bacteria, fungi, [[pesticides]], [[antibiotics]], [[asbestos]], [[herbicides]], plastic ingredients, combustion products as well as [[hormone]] mimicking [[phthalates]].  Though scientists have known that intercontinental dust plumes can ferry bacteria and viruses, "most people had assumed that the [sun's] ultraviolet light would sterilize these clouds," says microbiologist Dale W. Griffin, also with the USGS in St. Petersburg, "We now find that isn't true."&lt;ref name=News&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20011006/bob13.asp |title=Ill Winds |work=Science News Online |accessdate=October 6, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040319153009/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20011006/bob13.asp |archivedate=March 19, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Dust storm in Beijing 2006.JPG|thumb|Dust deposition in [[Beijing]] during the 2006 season.]]
Areas affected by the dust experience decreased visibility and the dust is known to cause a variety of health problems, including sore throat and [[asthma]] in otherwise healthy people.  Often, people are advised to avoid or minimize outdoor activities, depending on severity of storms.  For those already with asthma or respiratory infections, it can be fatal.  The dust has been shown to increase the daily mortality rate in one affected region by 1.7%.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Although sand itself is not necessarily harmful to soil, due to [[sulphur]] emissions and the resulting [[acid rain]], the storms also destroy farmland by degrading the soil, and deposits of ash and soot and [[heavy metals]] as well as potentially dangerous biomatter blanket the ground with contaminants including croplands, [[aquifer]]s, etc.  The dust storms also affect wildlife particularly hard, destroying crops, habitat, and toxic metals interfering with [[reproduction]].  [[Coral]] are hit particularly hard.  Toxic metals propagate up the food chain, e.g. from fish to higher mammals.  Air visibility is reduced, including cancelled flights, ground travel, outdoor activities, and can be correlated to significant loss of economic activity.  Japan has reported washed clothes stained yellow.

Korea Times has reported it costing 3 million [[South Korean Won|won]] (US $3,000), 6000 gallons of water, and six hours to clean one jumbo jet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/119_789.html |title= Washing dust off jumbo jet costs 3 million won |work= The Korea Times |accessdate= April 5, 2007| author= Kim Rahn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] also has taken steps, with international support, to plant trees in desert areas, and has claimed to have planted 12 billion trees. But the winds are so strong in certain places that the trees simply topple or get buried in sand.

== Composition ==
An analysis of Asian Dust clouds conducted in China in 2001 showed them to contain high concentrations of [[silicon]] (24–32%), aluminum (5.9–7.4%), [[calcium]] (6.2–12%), and iron, numerous toxic substances were also present, although it is thought that heavier materials (such as poisonous [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[cadmium]] from coal burning) settle out of the clouds closer to the origin.

People further from the source of the dust are more often exposed to nearly invisible, fine dust particles that they can unknowingly inhale deep into their lungs, as coarse dust is too big to be deeply inhaled.&lt;ref name=News/&gt;  After inhalation, it can cause long term scarring of lung tissue as well as induce cancer and lung disease.

== Historical reports ==
Some of the earliest written records of dust storm activity are recorded in the ancient Chinese literature.&lt;ref&gt;Goudie, A.S. and Middleton, N.J. 1992. The changing frequency of dust storms through time. Climatic Change 20(3):197–225.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the earliest Chinese dust storm record was found in the Zhu Shu Ji Nian (Chinese: 竹书纪年; English: the Bamboo Annals).&lt;ref&gt;Liu Tungsheng, Gu Xiongfei, [[An Zhisheng]] and Fan Yongxiang. 1981. The dust fall in Beijing, China, on April 18. 1981. In: Péwé, T.L. (ed), Desert dust: origin, characteristics, and effect on man, Geological Society of America, Special Paper 186, pp. 149–157.&lt;/ref&gt; The record said: in the fifth year of Di Xin (1150 BC, Di Xin was the Era Name of the King Di Xin of [[Shang Dynasty]]), it rained dust at Bo (Bo is a place in [[Henan Province]] in China; in [[Classical Chinese]]: 帝辛五年，雨土于亳).

The first known record of an Asian Dust event in Korea was in 174 AD during the [[Silla|Silla Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Chun Youngsin, Cho Hi-Ku, Chung Hyo-Sang and Lee Meehye. 2008. Historical records of Asian dust events (Hwangsa) in Korea. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 89(6):823–827. {{doi|10.1175/2008BAMS2159.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dust was known as "Uto (우토, 雨土)", meaning 'Raining Dirt/Earth', and was believed at the time to be the result of an angry god sending down dust instead of rain or snow.

Specific records referring to Asian Dust events in Korea also exist from the [[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]], and [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] periods.

[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumb|300px|Cloud to ground [[lightning]]. Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 [[ampere]]s, at up to 100 million [[volt]]s, and emits light, radio waves, [[x-ray]]s and even [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 [[kelvin]]s.]]

'''Atmospheric electricity''' is the study of [[electrical charge]]s in the Earth's [[atmosphere]] (or that of another [[planet]]). The movement of charge between the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the [[ionosphere]] is known as the [[global atmospheric electrical circuit]]. Atmospheric electricity is an interdisciplinary topic with a long history, involving concepts from [[electrostatics]], [[atmospheric physics]], [[meteorology]] and [[Earth science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atmospheric Electricity|last=Chalmers|first=J. Alan|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunderstorms act as a giant battery in the atmosphere, charging up the ionosphere to about 400,000 [[volt]]s with respect to the surface. This sets up an electric field throughout the atmosphere, which decreases with increase in [[altitude]]. Atmospheric ions created by cosmic rays and natural radioactivity move in the electric field, so a very small current flows through the atmosphere, even away from thunderstorms. Near the surface of the earth, the magnitude of the field is on average around 100 V/m.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=R. G.|date=2011-01-01|title=Fair weather atmospheric electricity|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/301/i=1/a=012001|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|language=en|volume=301|issue=1|pages=012001|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/301/1/012001|issn=1742-6596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atmospheric electricity involves both [[thunderstorm]]s, which create lightning bolts to rapidly discharge huge amounts of atmospheric charge stored in storm clouds, and the continual electrification of the air due to ionization from [[cosmic ray]]s and [[Background radiation|natural radioactivity]], which ensure that the atmosphere is never quite neutral.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317074712/http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/essd15jun99_1.htm|title=Soaking in atmospheric electricity|last=|first=|date=2008-03-17|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of electromagnetic theory}}
[[Electric spark|Sparks]] drawn from electrical machines and from [[Leyden jar]]s suggested to the early experimenters, [[Francis Hauksbee (scientist)|Hauksbee]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], Wall, [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Nollet]], and [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Gray]], that lightning was caused by electric discharges. In 1708, Dr. [[William Wall (theologian)|William Wall]] was one of the first to observe that spark discharges resembled miniature lightning, after observing the sparks from a charged piece of [[amber]].

[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s experiments showed that electrical phenomena of the atmosphere were not fundamentally different from those produced in the [[laboratory]], by listing many similarities between electricity and lightning. By 1749, Franklin observed lightning to possess almost all the properties observable in electrical machines.

In July 1750, Franklin hypothesized that electricity could be taken from clouds via a tall metal [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]] with a sharp point. Before Franklin could carry out his experiment, in 1752 [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] erected a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} [[iron]] rod at [[Marly-la-Ville]], near Paris, drawing sparks from a passing cloud. With [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]-[[Insulator (electrical)|insulated]] aerials, an experimenter could bring a grounded lead with an insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from the aerial to the grounding wire. In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that Franklin's theory was correct.

Around June 1752, Franklin reportedly performed his famous kite experiment. The kite experiment was repeated by Romas, who drew from a metallic string sparks {{convert|9|ft|m}} long, and by [[Tiberius Cavallo|Cavallo]], who made many important observations on atmospheric electricity. [[L. G. Lemonnier|Lemonnier]] (1752) also reproduced Franklin's experiment with an aerial, but substituted the ground wire with some dust particles (testing attraction). He went on to document the ''[[fair weather condition]]'', the clear-day electrification of the atmosphere, and its [[Diurnal phase shift|diurnal]] variation. [[Giovanni Battista Beccaria|Beccaria]] (1775) confirmed Lemonnier's diurnal variation data and determined that the atmosphere's charge [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] was positive in fair weather. [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure|Saussure]] (1779) recorded data relating to a conductor's induced charge in the atmosphere. Saussure's instrument (which contained two small spheres suspended in parallel with two thin wires) was a precursor to the [[electrometer]]. Saussure found that the atmospheric electrification under clear weather conditions had an annual variation, and that it also varied with height. In 1785, [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]] discovered the electrical conductivity of air. His discovery was contrary to the prevailing thought at the time, that the atmospheric gases were insulators (which they are to some extent, or at least not very good conductors when not [[ionization|ionized]]). [[Paul Erman|Erman]] (1804) theorized that the Earth was negatively charged, and [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier|Peltier]] (1842) tested and confirmed Erman's idea.

Several researchers contributed to the growing body of knowledge about atmospheric electrical phenomena. [[Francis Ronalds]] began observing the [[potential gradient]] and air-earth currents around 1810, including making continuous [[electrometer#Electrograph|automated recordings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resumed his research in the 1840s as the inaugural Honorary Director of the [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]], where the first extended and comprehensive dataset of electrical and associated meteorological parameters was created.

For high-altitude measurements, [[kite]]s were once used, and weather balloons or [[aerostat]]s are still used, to lift experimental equipment into the air. Early experimenters even went aloft themselves in [[hot-air balloon]]s.

==Description==
Atmospheric electricity is always present, and during fine weather away from thunderstorms, the air above the surface of Earth is positively charged, while the Earth's surface charge is negative. It can be understood in terms of a [[difference of potential]] between a point of the Earth's surface, and a point somewhere in the air above it. Because the atmospheric electric field is negatively directed in fair weather, the convention is to refer to the potential gradient, which has the opposite sign and is about 100V/m at the surface. The potential gradient in most locations is much lower than this value because it is an average of the charge built up by every thunderstorm and atmospheric disturbance around the globe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is a weak conduction current of atmospheric ions moving in the atmospheric electric field, about 2 [[Picoampere|picoAmperes]] per square metre, and the air is weakly conductive due to the presence of these atmospheric ions.

===Variations===
Global daily cycles in the atmospheric electric field, with a minimum around 03 [[Universal Time|UT]] and peaking roughly 16 hours later, were researched by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 20th century. This [[Carnegie curve]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Carnegie Curve|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10712-012-9210-2|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|volume=34|pages=209–232|doi=10.1007/s10712-012-9210-2|bibcode = 2013SGeo...34..209H|year=2012 | last1 = Harrison | first1 = R. Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt; variation has been described as "the fundamental electrical heartbeat of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;Atmospheric electricity affects cloud height - physicsworld.com http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/06/atmospheric-electricity-affects-cloud-height&lt;/ref&gt;

Even away from thunderstorms, atmospheric electricity can be highly variable, but, generally, the electric field is enhanced in fogs and dust whereas the atmospheric electrical conductivity is diminished.

===Near space===

The [[electrosphere]] layer (from tens of kilometers above the surface of the earth to the ionosphere) has a high electrical conductivity and is essentially at a constant electric potential. The [[ionosphere]] is the inner edge of the [[magnetosphere]] and is the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. ([[Photoionization]] is a physical process in which a photon is incident on an atom, ion or molecule, resulting in the ejection of one or more electrons.)&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=photoionization|file=P04620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic radiation===
{{main article|Background radiation|Cosmic ray}}

The Earth, and almost all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from [[proton]]s to [[iron]] and larger [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] derived sources outside our [[solar system]]. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an [[air shower (physics)|air shower]] of secondary ionising radiation, including [[X-ray]]s, [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, and [[electron]]s. Ionization from this secondary radiation ensures that the atmosphere is weakly conductive, and that the slight current flow from these ions over the Earth's surface balances the current flow from thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ions have characteristic parameters such as [[Electron mobility|mobility]], lifetime, and generation rate that vary with [[altitude]].

===Thunderstorms and lightning===
{{Main article|Thunderstorms|lightning}}The [[potential difference]] between the [[ionosphere]] and the Earth is maintained by [[thunderstorm]]s, with lightning strikes delivering negative charges from the atmosphere to the ground. [[File:Global lightning strikes.png|thumb|right|World map showing frequency of lightning strikes, in flashes per km² per year (equal-area projection). Lightning strikes most frequently in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Combined 1995–2003 data from the Optical Transient Detector and 1998–2003 data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor.]]
Collisions between ice and soft hail (graupel) inside [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus clouds]] causes separation of positive and negative [[charge carrier|charge]]s within the cloud, essential for the generation of lightning. How lightning initially forms is still a matter of debate: Scientists have studied root causes ranging from atmospheric perturbations (wind, humidity, and [[atmospheric pressure]]) to the impact of [[solar wind]] and energetic particles.

An average bolt of lightning carries a negative electric current of 40 [[ampere|kiloamperes (kA)]] (although some bolts can be up to 120 kA), and transfers a charge of five [[coulomb]]s and energy of 500 [[joule|MJ]], or enough energy to power a 100-watt lightbulb for just under two months. The voltage depends on the length of the bolt, with the [[dielectric breakdown]] of air being three million volts per meter, and lightning bolts often being several hundred meters long. However, lightning leader development is not a simple matter of dielectric breakdown, and the ambient electric fields required for lightning leader propagation can be a few orders of magnitude less than dielectric breakdown strength.  Further, the potential gradient inside a well-developed return-stroke channel is on the order of hundreds of volts per meter or less due to intense channel ionization, resulting in a true power output on the order of megawatts per meter for a vigorous return-stroke current of 100 kA .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In an average thunderstorm, the energy released amounts to about 10,000,000 kilowatt-hours (3.6{{e|13}} [[joule]]), which is equivalent to a 20-kiloton [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]]. A large, severe thunderstorm might be 10 to 100 times more energetic.

''[[St. Elmo's Fire]]'' is an electrical phenomenon in which luminous [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is created by a [[coronal discharge]] originating from a [[Ground (electricity)|grounded object]]. [[Ball lightning]] is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's Fire, whereas they are separate and distinct phenomena.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, J.D. (1980a) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KHdIE3_lv1cC Ball Lightning and Bead Lightning: Extreme Forms of Atmospheric Electricity]''. 8–9. New York and London: Plenum Press. {{ISBN|0-306-40272-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although referred to as "fire", St. Elmo's Fire is, in fact, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and is observed, usually during a [[thunderstorm]], at the tops of trees, spires or other tall objects, or on the heads of animals, as a brush or star of light.

Corona is caused by the electric field around the object in question [[ionization|ionizing]] the air molecules, producing a [[ionized air glow|faint glow]] easily visible in low-light conditions. Approximately 1,000 – 30,000 [[volts]] per centimetre is required to induce St. Elmo's Fire; however, this is dependent on the [[geometry]] of the object in question. Sharp points tend to require lower voltage levels to produce the same result because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high curvature, thus discharges are more intense at the end of pointed objects. St. Elmo's Fire and normal sparks both can appear when high electrical voltage affects a gas. St. Elmo's fire is seen during thunderstorms when the ground below the storm is electrically charged, and there is high voltage in the air between the cloud and the ground. The voltage tears apart the air molecules and the gas begins to glow. The nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere causes St. Elmo's Fire to fluoresce with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes neon signs to glow.

===Earth-Ionosphere cavity===
{{Main article|Schumann resonance}}
The [[Schumann resonance|Schumann resonances]] are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonance is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acting as a [[waveguide]]. The limited dimensions of the earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/schumann-resonance.html|title=NASA - Schumann Resonance|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical system grounding ===
{{main article|Earthing system}}
Atmospheric charges can cause undesirable, dangerous, and potentially lethal charge potential buildup in suspended electric wire power distribution systems. Bare wires suspended in the air spanning many kilometers and isolated from the ground can collect very large stored charges at high voltage, even when there is no thunderstorm or lightning occurring. This charge will seek to discharge itself through the path of least insulation, which can occur when a person reaches out to activate a power switch or to use an electric device.

To dissipate atmospheric charge buildup, one side of the electrical distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the distribution system, as often as on every support [[electricity pylon|pole]]. The one earth-connected wire is commonly referred to as the "protective earth", and provides path for the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor ground conductivity. The additional electric grounding wire that carries no power serves a secondary role, providing a high-current short-circuit path to rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an ungrounded device with damaged insulation become "electrically live" via the grid power supply, and hazardous to touch.

Each [[transformer]] in an alternating current distribution grid segments the grounding system into a new separate circuit loop. These separate grids must also be grounded on one side to prevent charge buildup within them relative to the rest of the system, and which could cause damage from charge potentials discharging across the transformer coils to the other grounded side of the distribution network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''Central Atlantic magmatic province''' ('''CAMP''') is the Earth's largest continental [[large igneous province]], covering an area of roughly 11 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is composed mainly of [[basalt]] that formed prior to the breakup of [[Pangaea]] in the [[Mesozoic]] Era, near the end of the [[Triassic]] and the beginning of the [[Jurassic]] periods. The subsequent breakup of Pangaea created the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and provided a legacy of [[basalt]]ic [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], [[Sill (geology)|sills]], and [[lava]]s over a vast area around the present central North Atlantic Ocean, including large deposits in northwest [[Africa]], southwest [[Europe]], as well as northeast [[South America|South]] and southeast [[North America]] (found as continental [[Tholeiitic magma series|thoeliitic basalts]] in [[subaerial eruption|subaerial flow]]s and [[Intrusion|intrusive bodies]]). The name and CAMP acronym were proposed by Andrea Marzoli (Marzoli et al. 1999) and adopted at a symposium held at the 1999 Spring Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.

The CAMP volcanic eruptions occurred about 201 million years ago and split into four pulses lasting for over ~600,000 years. The resulting large igneous province is, in area covered, the most extensive on earth. The volume of magma flow of ~2–3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; makes it one of the most voluminous as well.

This geologic event is associated with the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]].

==Connected magma flows==
[[File:CAMP Magmatism in the context of Pangea.jpg|thumb|250px|Location of large residual elements of the Central Atlantic magmatic province]]
Although some connections among these basalts had long been recognized, in 1988 they were linked as constituting a single major [[flood basalt]] [[Large igneous province|province]] {{harv|Rampino|Stothers|1988}}. The basaltic sills of similar age (near 200&amp;nbsp;Ma, or earliest Jurassic) and composition (intermediate-Ti quartz tholeiite) which occur across the vast [[Amazon River]] basin of [[Brazil]] were linked to the province in 1999 {{Harv|Marzoli|Renne|Piccirillo|Ernesto|1999}}. Remnants of CAMP have been identified on four continents (Africa, Europe, North America and South America) and consist of thoeliitic basalts formed during the opening of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] basin during the breakup of the Pangean supercontinent {{Harvcol|Blackburn|Olsen|Bowring|McLean|2013}}.

==Geographical extent==
The province has been described as extending within Pangaea from present-day central Brazil northeastward about 5000&amp;nbsp;km across western [[Africa]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and northwestern [[France]], and from the interior of western Africa westward for 2500&amp;nbsp;km through eastern and southern [[North America]] {{Harv|McHone|2000}}. If not the largest province by volume, the CAMP certainly encompasses the greatest area known, roughly 11 million km², of any continental [[large igneous province]].

Nearly all CAMP rocks are [[tholeiite|tholeiitic]] in composition, with widely separated areas where basalt flows are preserved, as well as large groups of [[diabase]] (dolerite) sills or sheets, small [[lopolith]]s, and dikes throughout the province. Dikes occur in very large individual swarms with particular compositions and orientations. CAMP activity is apparently related to the [[Rift (geology)|rifting]] and breakup of Pangaea during the Late [[Triassic]] through Early Jurassic periods, and the enormous province size, varieties of basalt, and brief time span of CAMP magmatism invite speculation about [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] processes that could produce such a magmatic event as well as rift a [[supercontinent]] {{Harv|Wilson|1997}}, {{Harv|McHone|2000}}.

==Connection with the Triassic-Jurassic boundary and the associated mass-extinction event==
In 2013 the CAMP's connection to the end-Triassic extinction, with major extinctions that enabled dinosaur domination of land, became more firmly established. Up until 2013, the uncertainties in the geochronologic dates had been too coarse to confirm the volcanic eruptions were correlated with major climate changes. The work by Blackburn et al. demonstrated a tight synchroneity between the earliest volcanism and extinction of large populations using zircon uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating. They further demonstrated that the magmatic eruptions as well as the accompanying atmospheric changes were split into four pulses lasting for over ~600,000 years {{Harvcol|Blackburn|Olsen|Bowring|McLean|2013}}.

Prior to that integration, two hypotheses were in debate. One hypothesis was based especially on studies on Triassic-Jurassic basins from [[Morocco]] where CAMP [[lava|lava flows]] are outcropping (e.g., {{Harvnb|Marzoli|Bertrand|Knight|Cirilli|2004}}), whereas the other was based on end-Triassic extinction data from eastern [[North America]]n basins and lava flows showing an extremely large turnover in fossil pollen, spores (sporomorphs), and vertebrates {{Harv|Whiteside|Olsen|Kent|Fowell|2007}}, respectively.

===Morocco===
[[File:Affioramento CAMP2.JPG|thumb|350px|A basaltic lava flow section from the Middle Atlas, Morocco]]
The thickest lava flow sequences of the African CAMP are situated in Morocco, where there are basaltic lava piles more than 300 metres thick. The most-studied area is [[High Atlas|Central High Atlas]], where the best preserved and most complete basaltic lava piles are exposed. According to geochemical, petrographic and isotopic data four distinct tholeiitic basaltic units were recognized and can be placed throughout the Central High Atlas: Lower, Intermediate, Upper and Recurrent basalts.
 
The Lower and Intermediate units are constituted by [[basaltic andesite]]s, whereas the Upper and Recurrent units have [[basalt]]ic composition. From Lower to Recurrent unit, we observe: 
*a progressive decrease of eruption rate (the Lower and the Intermediate units represent over 80% of preserved lava volume);
*a trend going from intersertal to [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyritic]] texture;
*a progressive depletion of incompatible element contents in the basalts, possibly linked to a progressive depletion of their mantle source.

====Isotopic analyses====
Ages were determined by [[Argon–argon dating|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar]] analysis on [[plagioclase]] {{Harv|Knight|Nomade|Renne|Marzoli|2004}}, {{Harv|Verati|Rapaille|Féraud|Marzoli|2007}}, {{Harv|Marzoli|Bertrand|Knight|Cirilli|2004}}. These data show indistinguishable ages (199.5±0.5&amp;nbsp;Ma) from Lower to Upper lava flows, from central to northern Morocco. Therefore, CAMP is an intense, short magmatic event. Basalts of the Recurrent unit are slightly younger (mean age: 197±1&amp;nbsp;Ma) and represent a late event. Consistently, the Upper and Recurrent basalts are separated by  a sedimentary layer that locally reaches a thickness of circa 80&amp;nbsp;m.

====Magnetostratigraphy====
According to [[Magnetostratigraphy|magnetostratigraphic]] data, the Moroccan CAMP events were divided into five groups, differing in paleomagnetic orientations (declination and inclination) {{Harv|Knight|Nomade|Renne|Marzoli|2004}}. Each group is composed by a smaller number of lava flows (i.e., a lower volume) than the preceding one. 
These data suggest that they were created by five short magma pulses and eruption events, each one possibly &lt;400 (?) years long. 
All lava flow sequences are characterized by normal polarity, except for a brief [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] reversal yielded by one lava flow and by a localized interlayered limestone in two distinct section of the High Atlas CAMP.

====Palynological analyses====
[[Palynology|Palynological]] data from sedimentary layers samples at the base of four lava flow sequences constrain the onset of the CAMP, since there is no evidence of depositional hiatus or tectonic deformation at the bottom of the lava flow piles {{Harv|Marzoli|Bertrand|Knight|Cirilli|2004}}. The palynological assemblage observed in these basal layers is typical of Late [[Triassic]] age, similar to that of the uppermost Triassic sedimentary rocks of eastern North America .
Samples from interlayered limestone in lava flows provided unreliable palynological data. One limestone bed from the top to the central High Atlas upper basalts yielded a Late Triassic palynological assemblage. However, the observed sporomorphs in this sample are rare and poorly preserved.

====Conclusions====
All of these data indicate that the basaltic lava flows of the Central Atlantic magmatic province in Morocco were erupted at c. 200&amp;nbsp;Ma and spanned the [[Triassic|Tr]]-[[Jurassic|J]] boundary. Thus, it is very possible that there is a connection between this magmatic event and the Tr-J boundary climatic and biotic crisis that led to the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|mass-extinction]].

===Eastern North America===
[[File:CAMP North America.JPG|350 px|thumb|Basal contact of the [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] section of Fundy basin, Nova Scotia, Canada]]

The North American portion of the CAMP lava flows crop out in various sections in the basins of Newark, Culpeper, Hartford, Deerfield, i.e. the [[Newark Supergroup]] in New England (USA), and in the [[Fundy Basin]] in Nova Scotia (Canada). The CAMP is here constituted by rare [[olivine]]- and common quartz-normative basalts showing a great lateral extension and a maximum thickness up to 1&amp;nbsp;km. The basaltic flows occur on top of continental fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary units of Triassic age. &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar data (on plagioclase) indicate for these basaltic units an absolute age of 198-200&amp;nbsp;Ma {{Harv|Hames|McHone|Renne|Ruppel|2003}} bringing this magmatic event undoubtedly close to the Triassic-Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary. Thus it is necessary to determine whether it straddles the boundary or not: if not, then the CAMP could not be a cause of the [[Triassic#Late Triassic extinction event|Late Triassic extinction event]]. For example, according to {{Harvnb|Whiteside|Olsen|Kent|Fowell|2007}} there are palynological, geochemical, and magnetostratigraphic evidences that the CAMP postdates the Tr-J boundary.

====Magnetostratigraphy====
In the Newark basin a magnetic reversal (E23r) is observed just below the oldest basalts and more or less in the same position as a palynologic turnover, interpreted as the Tr-J boundary. In Morocco, two reversal have been detected in two lava flow sequences. Two distinct correlations between the Moroccan and the Newark magnetostratigraphy have been proposed.  {{Harvnb|Marzoli|Bertrand|Knight|Cirilli|2004}} suggest that the Tr-J boundary is located above the lower reverse polarity level which is positioned more or less at the base of the Intermediate basalt unit of Morocco. These two levels can be correlated with chron E23r of the Newark Basin, therefore the North American CAMP Basalts postdate the Tr–J boundary whereas part of the Moroccan CAMP was erupted within the Triassic. Contrarily, {{Harvnb|Whiteside|Olsen|Kent|Fowell|2007}} propose that these two levels could be earliest Jurassic intervals of reverse polarity not sampled in the Newark Basin Sequence (many more lava flows are present in the Moroccan Succession than in the Newark Basin), but observed in Early Jurassic sedimentary sequences of the Paris Basin of France. Reverse polarity intervals in America could be present within [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] (Fundy basin, Nova Scotia) which are poorly sampled even if previous magnetostratigraphy analysis in this sequence showed only normal polarity, or in the Scots Bay Member of the Fundy basin which have never been sampled. There is only one outcrop in the CAMP of America where reverse polarity is observable: a CAMP–related (about 200&amp;nbsp;Ma) dike in North Carolina. {{Harvnb|Whiteside|Olsen|Kent|Fowell|2007}} suggest that reverse polarity intervals in this dike could be of post Triassic age and correlated with the same events in Morocco.

====Palynological analyses====
The Tr-J boundary is not officially defined, but most workers recognise it in continental strata by the last appearance of index taxa such as ''Ovalipollis ovalis'', ''Vallasporites ignatii'' and ''Patinasporites densus'' or, in marine sections, by the first appearance of the ammonite ''[[Psiloceras]] planorbis''. In the Newark basin the palynological turnover event (hence the Tr-J boundary mass extinction) occurs below the oldest CAMP lava flows. The same can be said for the Fundy, Hartford and Deerfield Basins. In the investigated Moroccan CAMP sections (Central High Atlas Basin), sedimentary layers sampled immediately below the oldest basaltic lava flows, apparently contain Triassic taxa (e.g., ''P. densus''), and were thus defined as Triassic in age as at least the lowest lava flows {{Harv|Marzoli|Bertrand|Knight|Cirilli|2004}}. Still, a different interpretation is suggested by {{Harvnb|Whiteside|Olsen|Kent|Fowell|2007}}: the sampled sedimentary strata are quite deformed and this can mean that some sedimentary units could be lacking (eroded or structurally omitted). With respect to the Triassic pollens found in some sedimentary units above the Upper Unit basalts, they could have been reworked, so they don’t represent a completely reliable constraint.

====Geochemical analyses====
CAMP lava flows of North America can be geochemically separated in three units: the older ones are classified as ''[[High and low titanium basalts|high titanium]] [[quartz]] [[Normative mineralogy|normative]]'' (HTQ) basalts (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0-1.3&amp;nbsp;wt%); these are followed by lava flows classified as ''[[High and low titanium basalts|low titanium]] quartz normative'' (LTQ) basalts (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ca. 0.8-1.3&amp;nbsp;wt%); and then by the youngest lava flow unit classified as ''high titanium iron quartz normative'' (HTIQ) basalts (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4-1.6&amp;nbsp;wt%). According to {{Harvnb|Whiteside|Olsen|Kent|Fowell|2007}}, geochemical analyses based upon titanium, magnesium and silicon contents show a certain correlation between the lower North American lava flows and the Lower Unit of the Moroccan CAMP, thus reinforcing the conclusion that the Moroccan basalts postdate the Tr-J boundary.

Therefore, according to these data, CAMP basalts shouldn’t be included among the direct causes of the Tr-J mass extinction.

At an official height of 1,930 msnm2 Pico Platillón is the highest mountain in Guárico. It is protected as per decree published in Official Gazette of Venezuela, No. 33,664 of February 20, 1987.

Pico Platillón is located in the heart of a mountainous row of the Juan Germán Roscio Natural Monument, west of San Juan de los Morros and south of Lake Valencia. Towards the south we continue with the Topo Cruz and the row La Glorieta. Further to the east in the direction of the city of San Juan are other mountain ranges including the Paraparo Topo.

The '''Chuhaister''' ({{lang-ukr|Чуга́йстер}}) is a Ukrainian [[tutelary deity]] of the forests.  Although he shares similarities with the Russian [[Leshy]], he is specific to the [[Eastern Beskids and the Ukrainian Carpathians|Ukrainian Carpathians]].

Chuhaister are masculine and humanoid in shape.  They are described either as being giant, long-haired old men who roam the woods naked or in white clothes, or as one-legged men to whom no harm can be done.  They are also imagined as the wind.  Their temperament is described as being cheerful and they are known to love singing and dancing.  Unlike their Russian counterpart, the Leshy, they are not dangerous to humans.

== Names and etymology ==
The '''Chuhaister''' is known by a variety of names including the following:

* '''Lisovii cholovik''' ({{lang-ukr|лісовий чоловік}}) "Forest man"
* '''Lisovii did''' ({{lang-ukr|лісовий дід}}) "Forest grandfather"
* '''Nochnik''' ({{lang-ukr|ночник}}) "Night Person"
* '''Gai''' ({{lang-ukr|гай}}) "Grove"

The origin of the name Chuhaister is unclear, but it may be related to the Proto-Slavic root *čuga, meaning to guard.  The origin of the second part of the word is unknown although it has been linked to the word for stork, ({{lang-ukr|аист}}).  The word may be of a foreign origin.

'''Clements Gap Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the [[Mid North]] of [[South Australia]] about {{convert|15| km}} west of [[Redhill, South Australia|Redhill]], {{convert|20|km}} north east of [[Port Broughton, South Australia|Port Broughton]] and 42 metres above sea level. The park preserves an area of natural bushland and the built remnants of a small historic agricultural township, [[Clements Gap, South Australia|Clements Gap]], about {{convert|12|km}} east of the [[Spencer Gulf]] coast. Maintained by the South Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/managing-natural-resources/park-management/plans-strategies-and-policies/park-management-plans |title=Park management plans |publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources, [[Government of South Australia]] |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III Natural Monument or Feature]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2014SASum&gt;{{cite web |title=Terrestrial Protected Areas of South Australia (see 'DETAIL' tab) |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/d00ca066-1c8c-412a-9e16-2a37647454a7/files/capad2014sa.xlsx |work=CAPAD 2012 |publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment |accessdate=23 June 2015 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is named for the surrounding farming locality of Clements Gap, a reference to the co-located pass through the [[Barunga Range]]. The Clements Gap pass in turn is thought to be named after a shepherd in the area prior to 1880, per research by local historian [[Rodney Cockburn]].&lt;ref name="PLB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PLBLocality"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/plb |work=Property Location Browser |accessdate=23 June 2017 |title=Search for 'Clements Gap, LOCB' |id=SA0037028 |quote=Adjacent to section 616, Hundred of Redhill, 16 km north-west of Redhill and, according to Rodney Cockburn, named after a shepherd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1963 eight sections (439-442 and 565-568) of the [[Hundred of Mundoora]] (north east corner) were set aside and designated '''Mundoora Conservation Park'''. In 1981 the park was renamed to its present designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Clements Gap Conservation Park |publisher=Birds SA |url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/location/clements-gap-conservation-park |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLB"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/plb |work=Property Location Browser |accessdate=23 June 2017 |title=Search for 'Clements Gap Conservation Park' |id=SA0014321 |quote=Previous Name: Mundoora Conservation Park; Derivation of Name: Clements Gap; Other Details: Name change approved by Geog Names Board-vide Minutes 28/7/1983 &amp; DL.3701/1967.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]] a '''collage''' is a [[tectonostratigraphy|tectonostratigraphic unit]] characterized by its heterogeneity in terms of its [[lithology]], rock ages, or both. The term is usually applied to [[Precambrian]] tectonostratigraphic units. Collages form by [[plate tectonics|plate tectonic processes]] like [[accretion (geology)|accretion]] and [[continental collision]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}

An '''electromagnetic pulse''' ('''EMP'''), also sometimes called a transient electromagnetic disturbance, is a short burst of [[electromagnetic]] energy. Such a pulse's origination may be a natural occurrence or man-made and can occur as a [[electromagnetic field|radiated]], [[electric field|electric]], or [[magnetic field]] or a conducted [[electric current]], depending on the source.

EMP interference is generally disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment, and at higher energy levels a powerful EMP event such as a lightning strike can damage physical objects such as buildings and aircraft structures. The management of EMP effects is an important branch of [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) engineering.

Weapons have been developed to deliver the damaging effects of high-energy EMP.

== General characteristics ==
An electromagnetic pulse is a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Its short duration means that it will be spread over a range of frequencies. Pulses are typically characterized by:

* The type of energy (radiated, electric, magnetic or conducted).
* The range or spectrum of frequencies present.
* Pulse waveform: shape, duration and amplitude.

The last two of these, the frequency spectrum and the pulse waveform, are interrelated via the [[Fourier transform]] and may be seen as two different ways of describing the same pulse.

=== Types of energy ===
{{Main|Electromagnetism}}
EMP energy may be transferred in any of four forms:
* [[Electric field]]
* [[Magnetic field]]
* [[Electromagnetic radiation]]
* [[Electrical conduction]]

Due to [[Maxwell's equations]], a pulse of any one form of electromagnetic energy will always be accompanied by the other forms, however in a typical pulse one form will dominate.

In general, only radiation acts over long distances, with the others acting over short distances. There are a few exceptions, such as a [[solar flare|solar magnetic flare]].

=== Frequency ranges ===
A pulse of electromagnetic energy typically comprises many frequencies from DC (zero Hz) to some upper limit depending on the source. The range defined as EMP, sometimes referred to as "DC to daylight", excludes the highest frequencies comprising the optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) and ionizing (X and gamma rays) ranges.

Some types of EMP events can leave an optical trail, such as lightning and sparks, but these are side effects of the current flow through the air and are not part of the EMP itself.

=== Pulse waveforms ===
The waveform of a pulse describes how its instantaneous amplitude (field strength or current) changes over time. Real pulses tend to be quite complicated, so simplified models are often used. Such a model is typically described either in a diagram or as a mathematical equation.

{|  style="margin:0.5em auto 0.5em auto; text-align:center;" cellpadding=4
|-
| [[File:rectangular pulse.svg|200px|alt=" "]]&lt;br&gt;Rectangular pulse
| [[File:double exponential.svg|200px|alt=" "]]&lt;br&gt;Double exponential pulse
| [[File:damped sinewave.svg|200px|alt=" "]]&lt;br&gt;Damped sinewave pulse
|}

Most electromagnetic pulses have a very sharp leading edge, building up quickly to their maximum level. The classic model is a double-exponential curve which climbs steeply, quickly reaches a peak and then decays more slowly. However, pulses from a controlled switching circuit often approximate the form of a rectangular or "square" pulse.

EMP events usually induce a corresponding signal in the victim equipment, due to [[Electromagnetic compatibility#Coupling mechanisms|coupling]] between the source and victim. Coupling usually occurs most strongly over a relatively narrow frequency band, leading to a characteristic [[damped sine wave]] signal in the victim. Visually it is shown as a high frequency sine wave growing and decaying within the longer-lived envelope of the double-exponential curve. A damped sinewave typically has much lower energy and a narrower frequency spread than the original pulse, due to the transfer characteristic of the coupling mode. In practice, EMP test equipment often injects these damped sinewaves directly rather than attempting to recreate the high-energy threat pulses.

In a pulse train, such as from a digital clock circuit, the waveform is repeated at regular intervals. A single complete pulse cycle is sufficient to characterise such a regular, repetitive train.

== Types ==
An EMP arises where the source emits a short-duration pulse of energy. The energy is usually broadband by nature, although it often excites a relatively narrow-band ''[[damped sine wave]]'' response in the victim. Some types are generated as repetitive and regular ''[[Voltage spike|pulse]] trains''.

Different types of EMP arise from natural, man-made, and weapons effects.

Types of natural EMP event include:

* [[Lightning]] electromagnetic pulse (LEMP). The discharge is typically an initial huge current flow, at least mega-amps, followed by a train of pulses of decreasing energy.
* [[Electrostatic discharge]] (ESD), as a result of two charged objects coming into close proximity or even contact. 
* Meteoric EMP. The discharge of electromagnetic energy resulting from either the impact of a [[meteoroid]] with a spacecraft or the explosive breakup of a meteoroid passing through the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Close |first2=P. |last2=Colestock |first3=L. |last3=Cox |first4=M. |last4=Kelley |first5=N. |last5=Lee |title=Electromagnetic pulses generated by meteoroid impacts on spacecraft |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=115 |page=A12328 |year=2010 |doi=10.1029/2010JA015921 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010JA015921/pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2010JGRA..11512328C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Chandler |title=Meteoric Airbursts: General Principles |publisher=QDL blog |url=http://qdl.scs-inc.us/2ndParty/Pages/7793.html |accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Coronal mass ejection]] (CME). A burst of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and accompanying magnetic field, ejected from the solar corona and released into the [[solar wind]]. Sometimes referred to as a Solar EMP.&lt;ref name="empact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empactamerica.org/solar_emp.php |title=EMPACT America, Inc. - Solar EMP |publisher=[[Web.archive.org]] |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2015-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726030320/http://www.empactamerica.org/solar_emp.php |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of (civil) man-made EMP event include:

* Switching action of electrical circuitry, whether isolated or repetitive (as a pulse train).
* [[Electric motor]]s can create a train of pulses as the internal electrical contacts make and break connections as the armature rotates.
* Gasoline engine ignition systems can create a train of pulses as the spark plugs are energized or fired.
* Continual switching actions of digital electronic circuitry.
* [[Electric power transmission|Power line]] surges. These can be up to several kilovolts, enough to damage electronic equipment that is insufficiently protected.

Types of military EMP include:

* [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] (NEMP), as a result of a nuclear explosion. A variant of this is the high altitude nuclear EMP (HEMP), which produces a secondary pulse due to particle interactions with the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and magnetic field.
* Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) weapons.

=== Lightning ===
{{Main|Lightning}}
Lightning is unusual in that it typically has a preliminary "leader" discharge of low energy building up to the main pulse, which in turn may be followed at intervals by several smaller bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lightning.ece.ufl.edu/PDF/Howard%20et%20al%20%5B2011%5Da.pdf |format=PDF |title=Measured close lightning leader step electric field derivative waveforms |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=116 |year=2011 |doi=10.1029/2010JD015249|bibcode=2011JGRD..116.8201H  | last1 = Howard | first1 = J. | last2 = Uman | first2 = M.

=== Electrostatic discharge (ESD) ===
{{Main|Electrostatic discharge}}

ESD events are characterised by high voltages of many kV but small currents and sometimes cause visible sparks. ESD is treated as a small, localised phenomenon, although technically a lightning flash is a very large ESD event. ESD can also be man-made, as in the shock received from a [[Van de Graaff generator]].

An ESD event can damage electronic circuitry by injecting a high-voltage pulse, besides giving people an unpleasant shock. Such an ESD event can also create sparks, which may in turn ignite fires or fuel-vapour explosions. For this reason, before refuelling an aircraft or exposing any fuel vapour to the air, the fuel nozzle is first connected to the aircraft to safely discharge any static.

=== Switching pulses ===
The switching action of an electrical circuit creates a sharp change in the flow of electricity. This sharp change is a form of EMP.

Simple electrical sources include inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, and the brush contacts in electric motors. Typically these send a pulse down any electrical connections present, as well as radiating a pulse of energy. The amplitude is usually small and the signal may be treated as "noise" or "interference". The switching off or "opening" of a circuit causes an abrupt change in the current flowing. This can in turn cause a large pulse in the electric field across the open contacts, causing arcing and damage. It is often necessary to incorporate design features to limit such effects.

Electronic devices such as vacuum tubes or valves, transistors and diodes can also switch on and off very quickly, causing similar issues. One-off pulses may be caused by solid-state switches and other devices used only occasionally.  However, the many millions of transistors in a modern computer may switch repeatedly at frequencies above 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, causing interference which appears to be continuous.

=== Nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) ===
{{Main|Nuclear electromagnetic pulse}}

A nuclear electromagnetic pulse is the abrupt pulse of electromagnetic radiation resulting from a [[nuclear explosion]]. The resulting rapidly changing [[electric fields]] and magnetic fields may couple with electrical/electronic systems to produce damaging current and [[voltage spike|voltage surges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728664-north-korea-has-given-electricity-industry-jolt-fear-americas-utilities-prepare|title=America’s utilities prepare for a nuclear threat to the grid|work=[[The Economist]]|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense [[gamma radiation]] emitted can also ionize the surrounding air, creating a secondary EMP as the atoms of air first lose their electrons and then regain them.

[[Nuclear EMP|NEMP]] weapons are designed to maximize such EMP effects as the primary damage mechanism, and some are capable of destroying susceptible electronic equipment over a wide area.

A high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) weapon is a NEMP warhead designed to be detonated far above the Earth's surface. The explosion releases a blast of gamma rays into the mid-[[stratosphere]], which ionizes as a secondary effect and the resultant energetic free electrons interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce a much stronger EMP than is normally produced in the denser air at lower altitudes.

=== Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) ===
Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) is a weapon-generated electromagnetic pulse without use of nuclear technology. Devices that can achieve this objective include a large low-inductance [[capacitor]] bank discharged into a single-loop antenna, a microwave generator, and an [[explosively pumped flux compression generator]]. To achieve the frequency characteristics of the pulse needed for optimal [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] into the target, [[Electromagnetic wave|wave]]-shaping circuits or microwave generators are added between the pulse source and the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. [[Vircator]]s are vacuum tubes that are particularly suitable for microwave conversion of high-energy pulses.&lt;ref name=kopp&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA332511  |title=The Electromagnetic Bomb - A Weapon of Electrical Mass Destruction |date=October 1996 |last=Kopp |first=Carlo |author-link=Carlo Kopp |journal=USAF CADRE Air Chronicles |publisher=[[U.S. Air Force]] |id=DTIC:ADA332511 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NNEMP generators can be carried as a payload of bombs, [[cruise missile]]s (such as the [[Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project|CHAMP]] missile) and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], with diminished mechanical, thermal and ionizing radiation effects, but without the consequences of deploying nuclear weapons.

The range of NNEMP weapons is much less than nuclear EMP. Nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons require chemical explosives as their initial energy source, producing only 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; (one millionth) the energy of nuclear explosives of similar weight.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 1}} The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect.{{sfn|Glasstone|Dolan|1977|loc=Chapter 11, section 11.73}} These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination. The effect of small e-bombs has proven to be sufficient for certain terrorist or military operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Examples of such operations include the destruction of electronic control systems critical to the operation of many ground vehicles and aircraft.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marks |first=Paul |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227026.200-aircraft-could-be-brought-down-by-diy-ebombs.html |title=Aircraft could be brought down by DIY 'E-bombs' |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |date=1 April 2009 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|reason=cited article is mostly speculation, not fact|date=July 2016}}

The concept of the explosively pumped flux compression generator for generating a non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse was conceived as early as 1951 by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="fcg"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Younger |title=Scientific Collaborations Between Los Alamos and Arzamas-16 Using Explosive-Driven Flux Compression Generators |journal=[[Los Alamos Science]] |issue=24 |pages=48–71 |year=1996 |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00326620.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-24 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but nations kept work on non-nuclear EMP classified until similar ideas emerged in other nations.

=== Electromagnetic forming ===
{{Main|Electromagnetic forming}}

The large forces generated by electromagnetic pulses can be used to shape or form objects as part of their manufacturing process.

== Effects ==

Minor EMP events, and especially pulse trains, cause low levels of electrical noise or interference which can affect the operation of susceptible devices. For example, a common problem in the mid-twentieth century was interference emitted by the ignition systems of gasoline engines, which caused radio sets to crackle and TV sets to show stripes on the screen. Laws were introduced to make vehicle manufacturers fit interference suppressors.

At a high voltage level an EMP can induce a spark, for example from an electrostatic discharge when fuelling a gasoline-engined vehicle. Such sparks have been known to cause fuel-air explosions and precautions must be taken to prevent them.&lt;ref&gt;"Fundamentals of Electrostatic Discharge", Compliance Magazine, 1 May 2015. Retrieved 25 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large and energetic EMP can induce high currents and voltages in the victim unit, temporarily disrupting its function or even permanently damaging it.

A powerful EMP can also directly affect magnetic materials and corrupt the data stored on media such as [[magnetic tape]] and computer [[hard drive]]s. Hard drives are usually shielded by heavy metal casings. Some [[IT asset management|IT asset disposition]] service providers and computer recyclers use a controlled EMP to wipe such magnetic media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/shredding/hard_drives/how_to_permanently_delete_data.html#data_wipe|title=EMP Data Wipe|author=&lt;!-- not stated --&gt;|date=|publisher=Newtech Recycling|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very large EMP event such as a lightning strike is also capable of damaging objects such as trees, buildings and aircraft directly, either through heating effects or the disruptive effects of the very large magnetic field generated by the current. An indirect effect can be electrical fires caused by heating. Most engineered structures and systems require some form of protection against lightning to be designed in.

The damaging effects of high-energy EMP have led to the introduction of EMP weapons, from tactical missiles with a small radius of effect to nuclear bombs tailored for maximum EMP effect over a wide area.

== Control ==
[[File:E-4 advanced airborne command post EMP sim.jpg|thumb|EMP simulator HAGII-C testing a [[Boeing E-4]] aircraft.]]
[[File:USS Estocin FFG-15 moored near EMPRESS I.jpg|thumb|EMPRESS I (antennas along shoreline) with {{USS|Estocin|FFG-15}} moored in the foreground for testing.]]
{{main|Electromagnetic compatibility}}
Like any [[electromagnetic interference]], the threat from EMP is subject to control measures. This is true whether the threat is natural or man-made.

Therefore, most control measures focus on the susceptibility of equipment to EMP effects, and [[radiation hardening|hardening]] or protecting it from harm. Man-made sources, other than weapons, are also subject to control measures in order to limit the amount of pulse energy emitted.

The discipline of ensuring correct equipment operation in the presence of EMP and other RF threats is known as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).

=== Test simulation ===
To test the effects of EMP on engineered systems and equipment, an EMP simulator may be used.

==== Induced pulse simulation ====
Induced pulses are of much lower energy than threat pulses and so are more practicable to create, but they are less predictable. A common test technique is to use a [[current clamp]] in reverse, to inject a range of damped sine wave signals into a cable connected to the equipment under test. The damped sine wave generator is able to reproduce the range of induced signals likely to occur.

==== Threat pulse simulation ====
Sometimes the threat pulse itself is simulated in a repeatable way. The pulse may be reproduced at low energy in order to characterise the victim's response prior to damped sinewave injection, or at high energy to recreate the actual threat conditions.

A small-scale [[Electrostatic discharge#Simulation and testing for electronic devices|ESD simulator]] may be hand-held.

Bench- or room-sized simulators come in a range of designs, depending on the type and level of threat to be generated.

At the top end of the scale, large outdoor test facilities incorporating high-energy EMP simulators have been built by several countries.&lt;ref name=baum1/&gt;&lt;ref name=baum2/&gt; The largest facilities are able to test whole vehicles including ships and aircraft for their susceptibility to EMP. Nearly all of these large EMP simulators used a specialized version of a [[Marx generator]].&lt;ref name=baum1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baum |first=Carl E. |journal=IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=211–8 |date=May 2007  |url=http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/History/BaumReminiscences.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reminiscences of High-Power Electromagnetics |doi=10.1109/temc.2007.897147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baum2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baum |first=Carl E. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=789–817 |date=June 1992 |url=http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/SDAN/0032.pdf |format=PDF |title=From the Electromagnetic Pulse to High-Power Electromagnetics|bibcode=1992IEEEP..80..789B |doi=10.1109/5.149443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include the huge wooden-structured [[ATLAS-I]] simulator (also known as TRESTLE) at [[Sandia National Labs]], New Mexico, which was at one time the world's largest EMP simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reuben |first=Charles |url=http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/trestle.html |title=The Atlas-I Trestle at Kirtland Air Force Base |publisher=The University of New Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papers on this and other large EMP simulators used by the United States during the latter part of the [[Cold War]], along with more general information about electromagnetic pulses, are now in the care of the SUMMA Foundation, which is hosted at the University of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/ SUMMA Foundation web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/index.htm |title=SUMMA Foundation - Carl Baum, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico |publisher=Ece.unm.edu |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Navy also has a large facility called the Electro Magnetic Pulse Radiation Environmental Simulator for Ships I (EMPRESS I).

==Safety==
High-level EMP signals can pose a threat to human safety. In such circumstances, direct contact with a live electrical conductor should be avoided. Where this occurs, such as when touching a [[Van de Graaf generator]] or other highly-charged object, care must be taken to release the object and then discharge the body through a high resistance, in order to avoid the risk of a harmful shock pulse when stepping away.

Very high electric field strengths can cause breakdown of the air and a potentially lethal arc current similar to lightning to flow, however electric field strengths of up to 200 kV/m (Kilovolts per metre) are regarded as safe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/i6055_11.pdf Protecting Personnel from Electromagnetic Fields], US Department of Defence Instruction No. 6055.11, 19 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic pulses are generally safe, although extremely high pulse levels can affect brain activity, as in [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]].

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Electromagnetic pulse in fiction and popular culture}}

The popular media often depict EMP effects incorrectly, causing misunderstandings among the public and even professionals. Official efforts have been made in the US to disprove these misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Report Meta-R-320: "[http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/reliability/cybersecurity/ferc_meta-r-320.pdf The Early-Time (E1) High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Its Impact on the U.S. Power Grid]" January 2010.

'''Elk Neck State Park''' is a public recreation area located between [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Elk River (Maryland)|Elk River]] near the southern tip of the [[Elk Neck Peninsula]] in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], [[Maryland]]. The [[state park]] is home to the historic [[Turkey Point Light]] and offers land-based and water-based recreation.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt; The park is located on [[Maryland Route 272|MD 272]], eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) south of the town of [[North East, Maryland|North East]], and {{convert|13|mi}} south of exit 100 on [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]]. It is operated by the [[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]].

==History==
The park had its genesis when, in 1936, naturalist Dr. William Abbott bequeathed his holdings along the Elk River to the state for use as a state park. Although he originally intended the land to be a gift to the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], a meeting with State Forester [[Maryland Forest Service|Fred W. Besley]] in 1935 persuaded Abbott to change the terms of his will. Following the state's purchase of additional acreage, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] created park improvements from 1937 to 1941.&lt;ref name=cecilhistory/&gt;

==Activities and amenities==
;Turkey Point Lighthouse
Dating from 1833, the [[Turkey Point Light]]house sits on a {{convert|100|ft|sing=on}} bluff overlooking the Upper Chesapeake Bay. The {{convert|35|ft|sing=on}} tower is a "private aid to navigation" maintained by a non-profit organization, Turkey Point Light Station, Inc., which offers weekend tours seasonally.&lt;ref name=tpls/&gt;
;Campgrounds
The park offers more than 250 campsites, rustic cabins, camper cabins, and youth group sites.&lt;ref name=camping/&gt;

The '''Hauterivian''' is, in the [[geologic timescale]], an [[age (geology)|age]] in the [[Early Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[Lower Cretaceous]] [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. It spans the time between 132.9 ± 2 [[annum|Ma]] and 129.4 ± 1.5 Ma (million years ago). The Hauterivian is preceded by the [[Valanginian]] and succeeded by the [[Barremian]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004) for a detailed geologic timescale&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Hauterivian was introduced in scientific literature by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] geologist [[Eugène Renevier]] in 1873. It is named after the Swiss town of [[Hauterive, Neuchâtel|Hauterive]] at the shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]].

The base of the Hauterivian is defined as the place in the [[stratigraphic column]] where the [[ammonite]] [[genus]] ''[[Acanthodiscus]]'' first appears. A reference profile for the base (a [[GSSP]]) had in 2009 not yet been established. The top of the Hauterivian (the base of the Barremian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species ''[[Spitidiscus|Spitidiscus hugii]]''.

In the ammonite [[biostratigraphy]] of the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Hauterivian contains seven ammonite [[biozone]]s:
* zone of ''[[Pseudothurmannia|Pseudothurmannia ohmi]]''
* zone of ''[[Balearites|Balearites balearis]]''
* zone of ''[[Plesiospitidiscus|Plesiospitidiscus ligatus]]''
* zone of ''[[Subsaynella|Subsaynella sayni]]''
* zone of ''[[Lyticoceras|Lyticoceras nodosoplicatus]]''
* zone of ''[[Crioceratites|Crioceratites loryi]]''
* zone of ''[[Acanthodiscus|Acanthodiscus radiatus]]''

{{lake stratification topics}}
The '''hypolimnion''' or '''under lake''' is the dense, bottom layer of water in a thermally-[[Lake stratification|stratified lake]]. It is the layer that lies below the [[thermocline]].

Typically the hypolimnion is the coldest layer of a lake in summer, and the warmest layer during winter. Being at depth, it is isolated from surface [[wind-mixing]] during summer, and usually receives insufficient irradiance (light) for [[photosynthesis]] to occur.

In deep, [[Temperate zone|temperate]] lakes, the bottom-most waters of the hypolimnion are typically close to 4&amp;nbsp;°C throughout the year. The hypolimnion may be much warmer in lakes at warmer latitudes.

==Overview==
As far back as 2015, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia began to explore the amount of electricity that can be moved along high voltage power lines linking the three countries. The objective was to exchange electricity between the Eastern Africa power pool to which both Kenya and Tanzania belong, and the Southern Africa power pool to which Tanzania ad Zambia belong. Each country would build and maintain the infrastructure within its borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0SD1Q020151019 | title=Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya to assess power output on high-voltage power line | date=19 October 2015 | accessdate=19 October 2016 | author=Reuters | publisher=[[Thomson-Reuters]] | location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya and Tanzania sought a joint consultant to advise of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==Construction in Kenya==
In October 2017, [[Kenya Electricity Transmission Company|Ketraco]], the Kenyan electricity transportation monopoly awarded the construction contract for a 400kV substation at Isinya and the {{convert|96|km|0}} 400kV high tension line from Isinya to Namanga, to [[North China Power Engineering Company Limited]] (NCPE).&lt;ref name="Const"&gt;{{cite web|date=18 October 2016 | url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/Chinese-firm-to-build-Sh2-6bn-power-line-to-Tanzania/539550-3421686-11q82s5z/index.html | accessdate=19 October 2016 | first=Neville | last=Otuki | location=Nairobi | title=Chinese firm to build KSh2.6 billion power line to Tanzania |

==Construction in Tanzania==
The work in Tanzania involves the construction of approximately {{convert|415|km|0}} of double circuit high tension power lines, from [[Namanga, Tanzania|Namanga]], through Arusha to Singida, a 400kV substation in Arusha and another 400kV substation in Singida.

This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Hereford and Worcester]]''', England, United Kingdom. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which chooses a site because of its [[fauna]], [[plant|flora]], geological or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=6 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hereford and Worcester was a county from 1974 to 1998, and it was designated an [[Area of Search]] by Natural England. Since 1998 Hereford and Worcester have been separate counties for local government purposes, but Natural England did not revise its list of counties to take account of the change until around 2014, and this Wikipedia list is still based on the pre-1998 counties. {{As of|2012}}, there are 189 sites designated in this Area of Search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SSSIs in Hereford and Worcester|work=English Nature|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1020|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 27 sites with a purely geological interest, and 154 listed for biological interest. A further 8 sites are designated for both reasons.

Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]]. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974&amp;ndash;1996 county system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs |work=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |accessdate=5 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819192309/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/search.cfm |archivedate=19 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the same approach is followed here. The data in the table is taken from Natural England in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI, and the County Background Datasheet for Hereford and Worcester.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/reportAction.cfm?Report=sdrt07&amp;Category=CF&amp;Reference=1020 Natural England County Background datasheet for Hereford and Worcester SSSIs] Accessed 14 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4785">'''Mountains of Slovenia''' are part of the [[Alps]] and of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]].

==Alps==
The Alps in Slovenia can be divided into:

*[[Julian Alps]] ({{lang-sl|Julijske Alpe}}) in the northwestern part of Slovenia. The highest peak is Mount [[Triglav]] - 2,864 metres (9,396 feet) above sea.&lt;ref name="hribi"&gt;http://www.hribi.net/seznamgora.asp?lng=1 Mountains of Slovenia - Hribi.net&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Karawanks]] ({{lang-sl|Karavanke}})- a massive ridge that forms a natural boundary between Slovenia and [[Austria]]. The highest peak is Mt. [[Stol (Karawanks)|Stol]] - 2,236 m ((7,336 feet).&lt;ref name="hribi"/&gt;
*[[Kamnik–Savinja Alps]] ({{lang-sl|Kamniško-Savinjske Alpe}}) lie to the south of [[Karawanks]]. The highest peak is Mt. [[Grintovec]] - 2,558 m (8,392 feet) above sea.&lt;ref name="hribi"/&gt;

==Dinarides==
In the [[Inner Carniola]], the highest peaks are Veliki Snežnik ({{convert|1796|m}}, part of the [[Snežnik|Snežnik plateau]] and the highest non-[[Alps|Alpine]] peak in Slovenia, and Suhi vrh ({{convert|1313|m}}), part of the [[Nanos (plateau)|Nanos plateau]]. They're both part of the [[Dinaric Alps]], a mountain chain that spans towards the southeast. The highest peak is [[Snežnik (mountain)|Snežnik]].

Part of the Dinaric Alps are also the [[Gorjanci]] mountain range, and in the [[Slovenian Istria]], Mt. [[Slavnik]] (1,028 m) and Mt. [[Vremščica]] (1,027 m).

==List of notable peaks==
This list contains height (above sea level) of some notable peaks in [[Slovenia]].

      <comment>In Ancient Greek, the language in which Lucian wrote, the two names are synonymous and interchangeable, but there is a consensus that was established on the talk page of this article several years ago, following a heated discussion, to use the name "Syrian" in the first sentence, but link it to the article [[Assyrian people]], as a compromise between editors. There are some editors here who are thoroughly opposed to calling Lucian an "Assyrian." You may challenge this consensus on the talk page.</comment>

'''Lucian of Samosata'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|lj|uː|ʃ|ən|,_|-|s|i|ən}}; {{lang-grc|Λουκιανὸς ὁ Σαμοσατεύς}}, {{lang-la|Lucianus Samosatensis}}}} ({{circa}} 125 AD – after 180 AD) was a [[Assyrian people|Syrian]] [[satire|satirist]] and [[rhetoric]]ian&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, "Paul of Samosata, Zenobia and Aurelian: The Church, Local Culture and Political Allegiance in Third-Century Syria", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 61 (1971), pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; who is best known for his characteristic [[tongue-in-cheek]] style, with which he frequently ridiculed superstition, religious practices, and belief in the paranormal. Although his native language was probably [[Syriac language|Syriac]], all of his extant works are written entirely in [[ancient Greek]] (mostly in the [[Attic Greek|Atticized dialect]] popular during the [[Second Sophistic]]).

Everything that is known about Lucian's life comes from his own writings, which are often difficult to interpret because of his extensive use of sarcasm. According to his oration ''The Dream'', he was the son of a [[lower middle class]] family from the village of [[Samosata]] along the banks of the [[Euphrates]] in the remote Roman province of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]. As a young man, he was apprenticed to his uncle to become a sculptor, but, after a failed attempt at sculpting, he ran away to pursue an education in [[Ionia]]. He may have become a travelling lecturer and visited universities throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. After acquiring fame and wealth through his teaching, Lucian finally settled down in [[Athens]] for a decade, during which he wrote most of his extant works. In his old age, he may have been appointed as a highly-paid government official in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], after which point he disappears from the historical record.

Lucian's works were wildly popular in antiquity and more than eighty writings attributed to him have survived to the present day, a considerably higher quantity than for most other classical writers. His most famous work is ''[[True History|A True Story]]'', a tongue-in-cheek satire against authors who tell incredible tales, which is regarded by some as the earliest known work of [[science fiction]]. Lucian invented the genre of the comic dialogue, a parody of the traditional [[Socratic dialogue|Platonic dialogue]]. His dialogue ''[[Lover of Lies|The Lover of Lies]]'' makes fun of people who believe in the supernatural and contains the oldest known version of "[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice#Similar stories|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]". Lucian wrote numerous satires making fun of [[Greek mythology|traditional stories about the gods]] including ''[[Dialogues of the Gods|The Dialogues of the Gods]]'', ''Icaromenippus'', ''Zeus Rants'', ''Zeus Catechized'', and ''The Parliament of the Gods''. His ''[[Dialogues of the Dead]]'' focuses on the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers [[Diogenes]] and [[Menippus]]. ''[[Philosophies for Sale]]'' and ''The Banquet or Lapiths'' make fun of various philosophical schools, and ''The Fisherman or the Dead Come to Life'' is a defense of this mockery.

Lucian often ridicules public figures, such as the Cynic philosopher [[Peregrinus Proteus]] in his letter ''[[Passing of Peregrinus|The Passing of Peregrinus]]'' and the fraudulent oracle [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] in his treatise ''[[Alexander the False Prophet]]''. Lucian's treatise ''[[De Dea Syria|On the Syrian Goddess]]'' satirizes cultural distinctions between Greeks and Syrians and is the main source of information about the cult of [[Atargatis]]. Lucian had an enormous, wide-ranging impact on western literature and works inspired by his writings include [[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', the works of [[François Rabelais]], [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', and [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.

==Life==
===Biographical sources===
Lucian is not mentioned in any contemporary texts or inscriptions written by others{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} and he is not included in [[Philostratus]]'s ''Lives of the Sophists''.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} As a result of this, everything that is known about Lucian comes exclusively from his own writings.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=1}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} A variety of characters with names very similar to Lucian, including "Lukinos," "Lukianos," "Lucius," and "The Syrian" appear throughout Lucian's writings.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} These have been frequently interpreted by scholars and biographers as "masks", "alter-egos", or "mouthpieces" of the author.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} Daniel S. Richter criticizes the frequent tendency to interpret such "Lucian-like figures" as self-inserts by the author{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} and argues that they are, in fact, merely fictional characters Lucian uses to "think with" when satirizing conventional distinctions between Greeks and Syrians.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=328}} He suggests that they are primarily a literary [[Trope (literature)|trope]] used by Lucian to deflect accusations that he as the Syrian author "has somehow outraged the purity of Greek idiom or genre" through his invention of the comic dialogue.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=329}} British classicist [[Donald Russell (classicist)|Donald Russell]] states, "A good deal of what Lucian says about himself is no more to be trusted than the voyage to the moon that he recounts so persuasively in the first person in ''True Stories''"{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=671}} and warns that "it is foolish to treat [the information he gives about himself in his writings] as autobiography."{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=671}}

Lucian was born in the town of [[Samosata]], located on the banks of the [[Euphrates]] river on the far eastern outskirts of the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=1}}{{sfn|Vout|2007|page=16}}{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=670}} Samosata had been the capital of [[Commagene]] until 72 AD when it was annexed by [[Vespasian]] and became part of the Roman province of [[Roman Syria|Syria]].{{sfn|Vout|2007|page=229}}{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=670}} The population of the town was mostly [[Assyrian people|Syrian]]{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} and Lucian's native tongue was probably [[Syriac language|Syriac]], a form of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}}{{sfn|Kaldellis|2007|page=31}}{{sfn|Pomeroy|Burstein|Donlan|Roberts|Tandy|Tsouvala|2018|page=532|ref=Pomeroy}}{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=670}}

During the time when Lucian lived, traditional [[Religion in ancient Rome|Greco-Roman religion]] was in decline and its role in society had become largely ceremonial.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=xi–xii}} As a substitute for traditional religion, many people in the Hellenistic world joined [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mystery Cults]], such as the [[Mysteries of Isis]], [[Mithraism]], the cult of [[Cybele]], and the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}} Superstition had always been common throughout ancient society,{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}} but it was especially prevalent during the second century.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}}{{sfn|Gordon|1996|pages=94–115}} Most educated people of Lucian's time adhered to one of the various Hellenistic philosophies,{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}} of which the major ones were [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripateticism]], and [[Epicureanism]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}} Every major town had its own university{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}} and these universities often employed professional travelling lecturers,{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xii}} who were frequently paid high sums of money to lecture about various philosophical teachings.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=xii–xiii}} The most prestigious center of learning was the city of [[Athens]] in Greece, which had a long intellectual history.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=xii–xiii}}

According to Lucian's oration ''The Dream'', which classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]] states he probably delivered as an address upon returning to Samosata at the age of thirty-five or forty after establishing his reputation as a great orator,{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}} Lucian's parents were [[lower middle class]] and his uncles owned a local statue-making shop.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} Lucian's parents could not afford to give him a higher education,{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}} so, after he completed his elementary schooling, Lucian's uncle took him on as an apprentice and began teaching him how to sculpt.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}} Lucian, however, soon proved to be poor at sculpting and ruined the statue he had been working on.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}} His uncle beat him, causing him to run off.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}} Lucian fell asleep and experienced a dream in which he was being fought over by the personifications of Statuary and of Culture.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}}{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|page=81}} He decided to listen to Culture and thus sought out an education.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}}{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|pages=81–82}}

Although ''The Dream'' has long been treated by scholars as a truthful autobiography of Lucian,{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–3}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=334}} its historical accuracy is questionable at best.{{sfn|Swain|1996|page=46}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=334}}{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=671}} Classicist [[Simon Swain]] calls it "a fine but rather apocryphal version of [Lucian's] education"{{sfn|Swain|1996|page=46}} and Karin Schlapbach calls it "ironical".{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|page=81}} Richter argues that it is not autobiographical at all, but rather a ''prolalia'', or playful literary work, and a "complicated meditation on a young man's acquisition of ''[[paideia]]''" [i.e. education].{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=334}} Russell dismisses ''The Dream'' as entirely fictional, noting, "We recall that [[Socrates]] too started as sculptor, and [[Ovid]]'s vision of Elegy and Tragedy (''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 3.1) is all too similar to Lucian's."{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=671}}

===Education and career===
[[File:Lucianus.jpg|thumb|Speculative portrayal of Lucian taken from a seventeenth-century engraving by [[William Faithorne]]]]

In Lucian's ''Double Indictment'', the personification of Rhetoric delivers a speech in which she describes the unnamed defendant, who is described as a "Syrian" author of transgressive dialogues, at the time she found him, as a young man wandering in [[Ionia]] in [[Asia Minor]] "with no idea what he ought to do with himself."{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=331}}{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}}{{sfn|Kaldellis|2007|page=31}} She describes "the Syrian" at this stage in his career as "still speaking in a barbarous manner and all but wearing a caftan [''[[kandys]]''] in the Assyrian fashion".{{sfn|Kaldellis|2007|page=31}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=331}} Rhetoric states that she "took him in hand and... gave him ''paideia''."{{sfn|Kaldellis|2007|page=31}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=331}} Scholars have long interpreted the "Syrian" in this work as Lucian himself{{sfn|Kaldellis|2007|page=31}}{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} and taken this speech to mean that Lucian ran away to Ionia, where he pursued his education.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} Richter, however, argues that the "Syrian" is not Lucian himself, but rather a literary device Lucian uses to subvert literary and ethnic norms.{{sfn|Richter|2017|pages=331–332}}

Ionia was the center of rhetorical learning at the time{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} The most prestigious universities of rhetoric were in [[Ephesus]] and [[Smyrna]],{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} but it is unlikely that Lucian could have afforded to pay the tuition at either of these schools.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} It is not known how Lucian obtained his education,{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}} but somehow he managed to acquire an extensive knowledge of rhetoric as well as classical literature and philosophy.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=xiii}}{{sfn|Kaldellis|2007|page=31}} Lucian mentions in his dialogue ''The Fisherman'' that he had initially attempted to apply his knowledge of rhetoric and become a lawyer,{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii, 349}} but that he had become disillusioned by the deceitfulness of the trade and resolved to become a philosopher instead.{{snf|Casson|1962|page=349}} Lucian travelled across the Empire, lecturing throughout Greece, Italy, and [[Gaul]].{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xiii–xiv}} In Gaul, Lucian may have held a position as a highly-paid government professor.{{snf|Casson|1962|page=xiv}}

[[File:Epicurus Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of [[Epicurus]], an Athenian philosopher whom Lucian greatly admired{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=107}}{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}]]

Lucian's philosophical views are difficult to categorize due to his persistent use of irony and sarcasm.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}} In ''The Fisherman'', Lucian describes himself as a champion of philosophy{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}} and throughout his other writings he characterizes philosophy as a morally constructive discipline,{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}} but he is critical of pseudo-philosophers, whom he portrays as greedy, bad-tempered, sexually immoral hypocrites.{{sfn|Turner|1967|pages=98–99}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|pages=338–341}} Lucian was not a member of any of the major philosophical schools.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=331}}{{sfn|Turner|1967|pages=98–99}} In his ''[[Philosophies for Sale]]'', he makes fun of members of every school{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=339}} and, in his ''Hermotimus'', he rejects all philosophical systems as contradictory and concludes that life is too short to determine which of them comes nearest to the truth, so the best solution is to rely on common sense.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}}

Nonetheless, at other times, Lucian writes approvingly of individual philosophies.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}} According to [[Everett Ferguson]], Lucian was strongly influenced by the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]].{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} ''The Dream or the Cock'', ''Timon the Misanthrope'', ''Charon or Inspectors'', and ''The Downward Journey or the Tyrant'' all display Cynic themes.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} Lucian was particularly indebted to [[Menippus]], a Cynic philosopher and satirist of the third century BC.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}}{{sfn|Richter|2017|pages=333–334}} Lucian wrote an admiring biography of the philosopher [[Demonax]], who was a philosophical [[Eclecticism|eclectic]], but whose ideology most closely resembled Cynicism.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} Demonax's main divergence from the Cynics was that he did not disapprove of ordinary life.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} Paul Turner observes that Lucian's ''Cynicus'' reads as a straightforward defense of Cynicism,{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} but also remarks that Lucian savagely ridicules the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus in his ''Passing of Peregrinus''.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}

Lucian also greatly admired [[Epicurus]],{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=107}}{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=98}} whom he describes in ''Alexander the False Prophet'' as "truly holy and prophetic".{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=107}} Later, in the same dialogue, he praises a book written by Epicurus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What blessings that book creates for its readers and what peace, tranquillity, and freedom it engenders in them, liberating them as it does from terrors and apparitions and portents, from vain hopes and extravagant cravings, developing in them intelligence and truth, and truly purifying their understanding, not with torches and [[Drimia maritima|squills]] [i. e. sea onions] and that sort of foolery, but with straight thinking, truthfulness and frankness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lucian Volume IV (Loeb Classical Library)|last = Harmon|first = A. M.|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1925|isbn = 978-0-674-99179-8|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = 235|url = http://www.loebclassics.com/view/lucian-alexander_false_prophet/1925/pb_LCL162.235.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Turner, although Lucian makes fun of [[Philosophical skepticism|Skeptic philosophers]],{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} he displays a temperamental inclination towards that philosophy.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} Lucian was skeptical of [[oracle]]s,{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=125}} though he was by no means the only person of his time to voice such skepticism.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=125}} Lucian rejected belief in the [[paranormal]], regarding it as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=58}}{{sfn|Russell|1986|page=670}} In his dialogue ''The Lover of Lies'', he probably voices some of his own opinions through his character Tychiades,{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=58}}{{efn|Tychiades is commonly identified as an authorial [[self-insertion]],{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=58}}{{sfn|Ogden|2007a|page=180}} although Daniel Ogden notes that this can only be true to a limited extent.{{sfn|Ogden|2007a|page=181}}}} perhaps including the declaration by Tychiades that he does not believe in ''[[daemon (classical mythology)|daemones]]'', [[Apparitional experience|phantoms]], or [[ghost]]s because he has never seen such things.{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=58}} Tychiades, however, still professes [[Theism|belief in the gods' existence]]:
:''Dinomachus:'' 'In other words, you do not believe in the existence of the Gods, since you maintain that cures cannot be wrought by the use of holy names?'
:''Tychiades:'' 'Nay, say not so, my dear Dinomachus,' I answered; 'the Gods may exist, and these things may yet be lies. I respect the Gods: I see the cures performed by them, I see their beneficence at work in restoring the sick through the medium of the medical faculty and their drugs. [[Asclepius]], and his sons after him, compounded soothing medicines and healed the sick, – without the lion's-skin-and-field-mouse process.'&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''The Lover of Lies'', translated by H. W. and F. G. Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucian had a generally negative opinion of [[Herodotus]] and his historiography, which he viewed as faulty.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=288}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=51}} The maxim that "Eyes are better witnesses than ears" is echoed repeatedly throughout several of Lucian's dialogues.{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=58}} Lucian was critical of [[Stoicism]] and [[Platonism]], because he regarded them as encouraging of superstition.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} His ''Nigrinus'' superficially appears to be a "eulogy of Platonism",{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} but may, in fact, be satirical, or merely an excuse to ridicule Roman society.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}

Bracht Branham to label Lucian's highly sophisticated style "the comedy of tradition".{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=2}} By the time Lucian's writings were rediscovered during the [[Renaissance]], most of the works of literature referenced in them had been lost or forgotten,{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=2}} making it difficult for readers of later periods to understand his works.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=2}}

===''A True Story''===
[[File:Aubrey Beardsley spider battle in 1894 True History.jpg|thumb|Illustration from 1894 by Aubrey Vincent Beardsley depicting a battle scene from Book One of Lucian's novel ''[[A True Story]]'']]

{{Main|A True Story}}
Lucian was one of the earliest novelists in [[Western world|Western]] civilization. In ''[[True History|A True Story]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀληθῶν Διηγημάτων}}), a fictional narrative work written in prose, he parodies some of the fantastic tales told by [[Homer]] in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and also the not-so-fantastic tales from the historian [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Robinson, ''Lucian and his Influence in Europe'' (London, 1979), 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bartley, 2003, "The Implications of the Reception of Thucydides within Lucian's 'Vera Historia'", Hermes Heft, 131, pp. 222–234.&lt;/ref&gt; He anticipated "modern" [[science fiction]] themes including voyages to the moon and Venus, [[extraterrestrial life]], interplanetary warfare, and artificial life, nearly two millennia before [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. The novel is often regarded as the earliest known work of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Grewell, Greg: "Colonizing the Universe: Science Fictions Then, Now, and in the (Imagined) Future", ''Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (2001), pp. 25–47 (30f.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fredericks, S.C.: [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/8/fredericks8art.htm “Lucian's True History as SF”], ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 1976), pp. 49–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Roy Arthur: [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/10/swanson10art.htm "The True, the False, and the Truly False: Lucian's Philosophical Science Fiction"], ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (November 1976), pp. 227–239.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|page=46}}&lt;ref&gt;Georgiadou, Aristoula &amp; Larmour, David H.

The novel begins with an explanation that the story is not at all "true" and that everything in it is, in fact, a complete and utter lie.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=13–15}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=51–52}} The narrative begins with Lucian and his fellow travelers journeying out past the [[Pillars of Heracles]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=15}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}} Blown off course by a storm, they come to an island with a river of wine filled with fish and bears, a marker indicating that [[Heracles]] and [[Dionysus]] have traveled to this point, and trees that look like women.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=15–17}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}} Shortly after leaving the island, they are caught up by a whirlwind and taken to the [[Moon]],{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=17–18}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}} where they find themselves embroiled in a full-scale war between the king of the Moon and the king of the Sun over colonization of the [[Venus|Morning Star]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=18}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}} Both armies include bizarre hybrid lifeforms.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=18–21}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}} The armies of the Sun win the war by clouding over the Moon and blocking out the Sun's light.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=22}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}} Both parties then come to a peace agreement.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=22–23}} Lucian then describes life on the Moon and how it is different from life on Earth.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=23–25}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=53–155}}

After returning to Earth, the adventurers are swallowed by a 200-mile-long whale,{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=27–28}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=156–177}} in whose belly they discover a variety of fish people, whom they wage war against and triumph over.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=27–33}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=156–177}} They kill the whale by starting a bonfire and escape by propping its mouth open.{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=34}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=156–177}} Next, they encounter a sea of milk, an island of cheese, and the [[Fortunate Isles|Island of the Blessed]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=35–37}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=156–178}} There, Lucian meets the heroes of the [[Trojan War]], other mythical men and animals, as well as [[Homer]] and [[Pythagoras]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=35–45}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=178–232}} They find sinners being punished, the worst of them being the ones who had written books with lies and fantasies, including [[Herodotus]] and [[Ctesias]].{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=46}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=178–232}} After leaving the Island of the Blessed, they deliver a letter to [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] given to them by [[Odysseus]] explaining that he wishes he had stayed with her so he could have lived eternally.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=45–49}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=178–232}} They then discover a chasm in the Ocean, but eventually sail around it, discover a far-off continent and decide to explore it.{{sfn|Casson|1962|pages=49–54}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=178–232}} The book ends abruptly with Lucian stating that their future adventures will be described in the upcoming sequels,{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=54}}{{sfn|Georgiadou|Larmour|1998|pages=232–233}} a promise which a disappointed ''[[scholia]]st'' described as "the biggest lie of all".{{sfn|Casson|1962|page=57}}

===Satirical dialogues===
In his ''Double Indictment'', Lucian declares that his proudest literary achievement is the invention of the "satirical dialogue",{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=42}} which was modeled on the earlier [[Platonic dialogue]], but was comedic in tone rather than philosophical.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=42}} The ''prolaliai'' to his ''[[Dialogues of the Courtesans]]'' suggests that Lucian acted out his dialogues himself as part of a comedic routine.{{sfn|Gilhuly|2006|page=275}} Lucian's ''[[Dialogues of the Dead]]'' ({{lang|grc|Νεκρικοὶ Διάλογοι}}) is a satirical work centering around the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and his pupil [[Menippus]], who lived modestly while they were alive and are now living comfortably in the abysmal conditions of the Underworld, while those who had lived lives of luxury are in torment when faced by the same conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macleod|first1=M. D.|title=Dialogues of the Dead. Dialogues of the Sea-Gods. Dialogues of the Gods. Dialogues of the Courtesans|date=1961|publisher=Loeb Classical Library; Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-99475-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue draws on earlier literary precursors, including the ''[[nekyia]]'' in Book XI of Homer's ''Odyssey'',{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=43–44}} but also adds new elements not found in them.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=44}} Homer's ''nekyia'' describes transgressors against the gods being punished for their sins, but Lucian embellished this idea by having cruel and greedy persons also be punished.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=44}}

[[File:Statue Hermes Chiaramonti.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, is a major recurring character throughout many of Lucian's dialogues.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=88}}]]

In his dialogue ''[[Lover of Lies|The Lover of Lies]]'' ({{lang|grc|Φιλοψευδὴς}}), Lucian satirizes belief in the [[supernatural]] and [[paranormal]]{{sfn|Ogden|2007|pages=1–3}} through a [[framing story]] in which the main narrator, a skeptic named Tychiades, goes to visit an elderly friend named Eukrates.{{sfn|Ogden|2007|pages=3–13}} At Eukrates's house, he encounters a large group of guests who have recently gathered together due to Eukrates suddenly falling ill.{{sfn|Ogden|2007|pages=3–13}} The other guests offer Eukrates a variety of [[Traditional medicine|folk remedies]] to help him recover.{{sfn|Ogden|2007|pages=3–13}} When Tychiades objects that such remedies do not work, the others all laugh at him{{sfn|Ogden|2007|pages=3–13}} and try to persuade him to believe in the supernatural by telling him stories, which grow increasingly ridiculous as the conversation progresses.{{sfn|Ogden|2007|pages=3–13}} One of the last stories they tell is "[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]", which the German playwright [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] later adapted into a famous ballad.{{sfn|Ogden|2007|page=1}}{{sfn|Luck|2001|page=141}}

Lucian frequently made fun of philosophers{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} and no school was spared from his mockery.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} In the dialogue ''Philosophies for Sale'', Lucian creates an imaginary slave market in which [[Zeus]] puts famous philosophers up for sale, including [[Pythagoras]], Diogenes, [[Heraclitus]], [[Socrates]], [[Chrysippus]], and [[Pyrrho]],{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=314–333}} each of whom attempts to persuade the customers to buy his philosophy.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=314–333}} In ''The Banquet, or Lapiths'', Lucian points out the hypocrisies of representatives from all the major philosophical schools.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} In ''The Fisherman, or the Dead Come to Life'', Lucian defends his other dialogues by comparing the venerable philosophers of ancient times with their unworthy contemporary followers.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} Lucian was often particularly critical of people who pretended to be philosophers when they really were not{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} and his dialogue ''The Runaways'' portrays an imposter Cynic as the antithesis of true philosophy.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} His ''Symposium'' is a parody of Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' in which, instead of discussing the nature of love, the philosophers get drunk, tell smutty tales, argue relentlessly over whose school is the best, and eventually break out into a full-scale brawl.{{sfn|Anderson|1976|pages=146–148}} In ''Icaromenippus'', the Cynic philosopher Menippus fashions a set of wings for himself in imitation of the mythical [[Icarus]] and flies to Heaven,{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=77–79}} where he receives a guided tour from Zeus himself.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=79}} The dialogue ends with Zeus announcing his decision to destroy all philosophers, since all they do is bicker, though he agrees to grant them a temporary reprieve until spring.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=79–80}} ''Nektyomanteia'' is a dialogue written in parallel to ''Icaromenippus'' in which, rather than flying to Heaven, Menippus descends to the underworld to consult the prophet [[Tiresias]].{{sfn|Anderson|1976|pages=139–140}}

Lucian wrote numerous dialogues making fun of traditional Greek stories about the gods.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=76–77}} His ''[[Dialogues of the Gods]]'' ({{lang|grc|Θεῶν Διάλογοι}}) consists of numerous short vignettes parodying a variety of the scenes from [[Greek mythology]].{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=76}} The dialogues portray the gods as comically weak and prone to all the foibles of human emotion.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=76–77}}{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} Zeus in particular is shown to be a "feckless ruler" and a serial adulterer.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=77}} Lucian also wrote several other works in a similar vein, including ''Zeus Catechized'', ''Zeus Rants'', and ''The Parliament of the Gods''.{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} Throughout all his dialogues, Lucian displays a particular fascination with [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods,{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=88}} who frequently appears as a major character in the role of an intermediary who travels between worlds.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=88}} ''The Dialogues of the Courtesans'' is a collection of short dialogues involving various courtesans.{{sfn|Gilhuly|2006|pages=274–294}}{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=301–311}} This collection is unique as one of the only surviving works of Greek literature to mention female homosexuality.{{sfn|Gilhuly|2006|pages=274–275}} It is also unusual for mixing Lucian's characters from other dialogues with stock characters from [[New Comedy]];{{sfn|Gilhuly|2006|page=277}} over half of the men mentioned in ''Dialogues of the Courtesans'' are also mentioned in Lucian's other dialogues,{{sfn|Gilhuly|2006|page=277}} but almost all of the courtesans themselves are characters borrowed from the plays of [[Menander]] and other comedic playwrights.{{sfn|Gilhuly|2006|page=277}}

Lucian's treatise ''Alexander the False Prophet'' describes the rise of [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]], a charlatan who claimed to be the prophet of the serpent-god [[Glycon]].{{sfn|Gordon|1996|pages=94–115}} Though the account is satirical in tone,{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=114}} it seems to be a largely accurate report of the Glycon cult{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=114}} and many of Lucian's statements about the cult have been confirmed through archaeological evidence, including coins, statues, and inscriptions.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=114}} Lucian describes his own meeting with Alexander in which he posed as a friendly philosopher,{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=114}} but, when Alexander invited him to kiss his hand, Lucian bit it instead.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=114}} Lucian reports that, aside from himself, the only others who dared challenge Alexander's reputation as a true prophet were the Epicureans (whom he lauds as heroes) and the Christians.{{sfn|Gordon|1996|page=114}}

Lucian's treatise ''[[De Dea Syria|On the Syrian Goddess]]'' is a detailed description of the cult of the Syrian goddess [[Atargatis]] at [[Manbij|Hierapolis]].{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=288}} It is written in a faux-[[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialect]] and imitates the ethnographic methodology of the Greek historian [[Herodotus]],{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=288}} which Lucian elsewhere derides as faulty.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=288}} For generations, many scholars doubted the authenticity of ''On the Syrian Goddess'' because it seemed too genuinely reverent to have really been written by Lucian.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=336}} More recently, scholars have come to recognize the book as satirical and have restored its Lucianic authorship.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=336}}

In the treatise, Lucian satirizes the arbitrary cultural distinctions between "Greeks" and "Assyrians" by emphasizing the manner in which Syrians have adopted Greek customs and thereby effectively become "Greeks" themselves.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|pages=289–292}} The anonymous narrator of the treatise initially seems to be a Greek Sophist,{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=292}} but, as the treatise progresses, he reveals himself to actually be a native Syrian.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|pages=292–293}} Scholars dispute whether the treatise is an accurate description of Syrian cultural practices because very little is known about Hierapolis other than what is recorded in ''On the Syrian Goddess'' itself.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=288}} Coins minted in the late fourth century BC, municipal decrees from [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rulers, and a late Hellenistic relief carving have confirmed Lucian's statement that the city's original name was "Manbog" and that the city was closely associated with the cults of Atargatis and [[Hadad]].{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=288}} A Jewish rabbi later listed the temple at Hierapolis as one of the five most important pagan temples in the Near East.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|page=289}}

''Macrobii'' ("Long-Livers") is an essay about famous philosophers who lived for many years.{{sfn|Kechagia|2016|pages=183–184}} It describes how long each of them lived, and gives an account of each of their deaths.{{sfn|Kechagia|2016|pages=183–184}} In his treatises ''Teacher of Rhetoric'' and ''On Salaried Posts'', Lucian criticizes the teachings of master rhetoricians.{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|page=81}} His treatise ''On Dancing'' is a major source of information about Greco-Roman dance.{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|pages=82–84}} In it, he describes dance as an act of ''[[mimesis]]'' ("imitation"){{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|page=82}} and rationalizes the myth of [[Proteus]] as being nothing more than an account of a highly skilled Egyptian dancer.{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|pages=82–84}} He also wrote about visual arts in ''Portraits'' and ''On Behalf of Portraits''.{{sfn|Schlapbach|2018|page=81}} Lucian's biography of the philosopher [[Demonax]] eulogizes him as a great philosopher{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} and portrays him as a hero of ''[[parrhesia]]'' ("boldness of speech").{{sfn|Ferguson|1993|page=332}} In his treatise, ''How to Write History'', Lucian criticizes the historical methodology used by writers such as Herodotus and Ctesias,{{sfn|Kempshall|2011|pages=489–491}} who wrote vivid and self-indulgent descriptions of events they had never actually seen.{{sfn|Kempshall|2011|pages=489–491}} Instead, Lucian argues that the historian never embellish his stories and should place his commitment to accuracy above his desire to entertain his audience.{{sfn|Kempshall|2011|page=491}} He also argues the historian should remain absolutely impartial and tell the events as they really happened, even if they are likely to cause disapproval.{{sfn|Kempshall|2011|page=491}} Lucian names [[Thucydides]] as a specific example of a historian who models these virtues.{{sfn|Kempshall|2011|page=491}}

In his satirical letter ''[[Passing of Peregrinus|The Passing of Peregrinus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Περὶ τῆς Περεγρίνου Τελευτῆς}}), Lucian describes the death of the controversial [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher [[Peregrinus Proteus]],{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|page=58}} who had publicly [[self-immolation|immolated himself]] on a pyre at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] of 165 AD.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|page=58}} The letter is historically significant because it preserves one of the earliest pagan evaluations of Christianity.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|pages=58–59}} In the letter, one of Lucian's characters delivers a speech ridiculing Christians for their perceived credulity and ignorance,{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|page=59}} but he also affords them some level of respect on account of their morality.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|page=59}} The speaker in the letter also refers to [[Jesus]], describing him as a "crucified [[Sophist]]" who had lived in [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] just over a century prior and had taught that his followers would attain immortality.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|page=59}} In the letter ''Against the Ignorant Book Collector'', Lucian ridicules the common practice whereby Near Easterners collect massive libraries of Greek texts for the sake of appearing "cultured", but without actually reading any of them.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|pages=191–192}}{{sfn|Wallace-Hadril|1983|page=79}}

===Pseudo-Lucian===
Some of the writings attributed to Lucian, such as the ''[[Amores (Lucian)|Amores]]'' and the ''Ass'', are usually not considered genuine works of Lucian and are normally cited under the name of "Pseudo-Lucian".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web|last1=Jope|first1=James|title=Interpretation and authenticity of the Lucianic Erotes|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/helios/v038/38.1.jope.pdf|website=muse.jhu.edu|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vout|2007|page=49}} The ''Ass'' ({{lang|grc|Λούκιος ἢ ῎Oνος}}) is probably a summarized version of a story by Lucian, and contains largely the same basic plot elements as ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (or ''Metamorphoses'') of [[Apuleius]], but with fewer inset tales and a different ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. J. Harrison |title=Apuleius: A Latin Sophist |origyear=2000 |edition=revised paperback |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-927138-2 |pages=9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amores'' is usually dated to the third or fourth centuries based on stylistic grounds.{{sfn|Vout|2007|page=49}}

===Renaissance and Reformation===

Lucian's writings were mostly forgotten during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Marsh|2010|page=544}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=2–3}} The ''[[Suda]]'', a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, concludes that Lucian's soul is burning in [[Hell]] for his negative remarks about Christians in the ''Passing of Peregrinus''.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} Lucian's writings were rediscovered during the [[Renaissance]]{{sfn|Marsh|2010|page=544}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=2–3}} and almost immediately became popular with the [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]].{{sfn|Marsh|2010|page=544}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=2–3}} By 1400, there were just as many Latin translations of the works of Lucian as there were for the writings of [[Plato]] and [[Plutarch]].{{sfn|Marsh|2010|page=544}} By ridiculing [[plutocracy]] as absurd, Lucian helped facilitate one of Renaissance humanism's most basic themes.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} His ''Dialogues of the Dead'' were especially popular and were widely used for moral instruction.{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=2–3}} As a result of this popularity, Lucian's writings had a profound influence on writers from the Renaissance and the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]].{{sfn|Marsh|2010|pages=862–865}}{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xvii–xviii}}{{sfn|Marsh|1998|pages=2–3}}

Many early modern European writers adopted Lucian's lighthearted tone, his technique of relating a fantastic voyage through a familiar dialogue, and his trick of constructing proper names with deliberately humorous etymological meanings.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} During the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], Lucian provided literary precedent for writers making fun of [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|Catholic clergy]].{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} [[Desiderius Erasmus]]'s ''[[In Praise of Folly|Encomium Moriae]]'' (1509) displays Lucianic influences.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} Perhaps the most notable example of Lucian's impact was on the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was on the French writer [[François Rabelais]], particularly in his [[Pentalogy|set of five novels]], ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', which was first published in 1532.  Rebelais also is thought to be responsible for a primary introduction of Lucian to the French [[Renaissance]] and beyond through his translations of Lucian's works.&lt;ref&gt;Pattard, Jean. ''Rebelais Works''. Champion Publishers.  1909.  Pages 204-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Screech, M.A.  ''Rebelais''. Ithaca; Cornell Press. 1979 pages 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Marsh|1998|page=71}}

Lucian's ''True Story'' inspired both [[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516){{snf|Casson|1962|page=xvii}} and [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726).{{snf|Marsh|2010|page=510}} [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s paintings ''[[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|The Calumny of Apelles]]'' and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'' are both based on descriptions of paintings found in Lucian's works.{{snf|Casson|1962|pages=xvii–xviii}} Lucian's prose narrative ''Timon the Misanthrope'' was the inspiration for William Shakespeare's tragedy ''[[Timon of Athens]]''{{snf|Casson|1962|page=xvii}}&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, A. Macc. "Timon of Athens – A Legendary Figure?", ''Greece &amp; Rome'', 2nd Ser., Vol. 34, No. 1 (April 1987), pp.&amp;nbsp;7–11.&lt;/ref&gt; and the scene from ''[[Hamlet]]'' with the gravediggers echoes several scenes from ''Dialogues of the Dead''.{{snf|Casson|1962|page=xvii}} [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s famous verse "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships/And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?" is a paraphrase of a quote from Lucian.{{snf|Casson|1962|page=xviii}} [[Francis Bacon]] called Lucian a "contemplative atheist".{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}

===Early Modern Period===
[[File:Nordkirchen-100415-12241-Lucian.jpg|thumb|Monument commemorating Lucian of Samosata from [[Nordkirchen]], Germany]]

[[Henry Fielding]], the author of ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' (1749), owned a complete set of Lucian's writings in nine volumes.{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=863}} He deliberately imitated Lucian in his ''Journey from This World and into the Next''{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=863}} and, in ''[[The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great]]'' (1743), he describes Lucian as "almost... like the true father of humour"{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=863}} and lists him alongside [[Cervantes]] and [[Jonathan Swift]] as a true master of satire.{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=863}} In ''The Convent Garden Journal'', Fielding directly states in regard to Lucian that he had modeled his style "upon that very author".{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=863}} [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux]], [[François Fénelon]], [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle]], and [[Voltaire]] all wrote adaptations of Lucian's ''Dialogues of the Dead''.{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} According to Turner, Voltaire's ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) displays the characteristically Lucianic theme of "refuting philosophical theory by reality".{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} Voltaire also wrote ''The Conversation between Lucian, Erasmus and Rabelais in the Elysian Fields'',{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} a dialogue in which he treats Lucian as "one of his masters in the strategy of intellectual revolution."{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}

[[Denis Diderot]] drew inspiration from the writings of Lucian in his ''Socrates Gone Mad; or, the Dialogues of Diogenes of Sinope'' (1770){{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} and his ''Conversations in Elysium'' (1780).{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} Lucian appears as one of two speakers in Diderot's dialogue ''Peregrinus Proteus'' (1791), which was based on ''The Passing of Peregrinus''.{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} Lucian's ''True Story'' inspired [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], whose writings later served as inspiration for [[Jules Verne]].{{snf|Casson|1962|page=xvii}} The German satirist [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] was the first person to translate the complete works of Lucian into [[German language|German]]{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} and he spent his entire career adapting the ideas behind Lucian's writings for a contemporary German audience.{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} [[David Hume]] admired Lucian as a "very moral writer"{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} and quoted him with reverence when discussing ethics or religion.{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} Hume read Lucian's ''Kataplous'' or ''Downward Journey'' when he was on his deathbed.&lt;ref name="Forfurther"/&gt;{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}

===Modern Period===
''Kataplous, or Downward Journey'' also served as the source for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of the ''[[Übermensch]]'' or ''Overman''.&lt;ref name="Forfurther"&gt;For discussion, see Babich, Babette: "Nietzsche’s Zarathustra and Parodic Style: On Lucian’s Hyperanthropos and Nietzsche’s Übermensch". 58, 4 (November 2011 [March 2013]): 58–74. http://dio.sagepub.com/content/58/4/58.refs.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche's declaration of a "new and super-human way of laughing – at the expense of everything serious!" echoes the exact wording of [[Tiresias]]'s final advice to the eponymous hero of Lucian's dialogue ''Menippus'': "Laugh a great deal and take nothing seriously."{{sfn|Branham|2010|page=864}} Professional philosophical writers since then have generally ignored Lucian,{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}} but Turner comments that "perhaps his spirit is still alive in those who, like [[Bertrand Russell]], are prepared to flavor philosophy with wit."{{sfn|Turner|1967|page=99}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many classicists viewed Lucian's works negatively{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} and read them with preconceived ideas in mind about the "Oriental" character.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} Many of these ideas were influenced by contemporary [[antisemitism]], a "reflexive and genteel" form of which was common throughout English and German scholarly writings prior to [[World War II]].{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} The German classicist [[Eduard Norden]] admitted that he had, as a foolish youth, wasted time reading the works of Lucian,{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} but, as an adult, had come to realize that Lucian was nothing more than an "Oriental without depth or character... who has no soul and degrades the most soulful language."{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}}

Rudolf Helm, one of the leading scholars on Lucian in the early twentieth century, labelled Lucian as a "thoughtless Syrian" who "possesses none of the soul of a tragedian"{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} and compared him to the Jewish German poet [[Heinrich Heine]], who was known as the "mockingbird in the German poetry forest."{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} In his 1906 publication ''Lukian und Menipp'', Helm argued that Lucian's claims of generic originality, especially his claim of having invented the comic dialogue, were actually lies intended to cover up his almost complete dependence on Menippus, whom he asserted was the true inventor of the genre.{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=333}} Lucian's Syrian identity received renewed attention in the early twenty-first century as Lucian became seen as what Richter calls "a sort of Second Sophistic answer to early twenty-first-century questions about cultural and ethnic hybridity."{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}} Richter states that [[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial critics]] have come to embrace Lucian as "an early imperial paradigm of the 'ethno-cultural hybrid.'"{{sfn|Richter|2017|page=327}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">In [[chemistry]], '''metal vapor synthesis''' (MVS) is a method for preparing [[metal complex]]es by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with [[ligand]]s.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-toluene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdampfer-test.de/aspire-cleito/|title=Aspire Cleito Verdampfer Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-08-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal evaporates upon being [[resistive heating|heated resistively]] or irradiated with an [[electron beam]].  The apparatus operates under high vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D. Heroux "Metal Vapor Synthesis of Transition Metal Compounds" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry 2006, John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0470862106.ia137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Timms "Transition metal vapors in chemical synthesis. The direct preparation of dibenzene chromium as an undergraduate experiment" J. Chem. Educ., 1972, volume 49, p 782. {{DOI| 10.1021/ed049p782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of [[molybdenum(V) chloride]] in the presence of the diene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stephan, G.

[[File:North america basement rocks.png|right|thumb|Geological map of North America showing (in white) the Midcontinent Rift, here labeled Keweenawan Rift. Lake Superior occupies the apex of the rift.]]

The '''Midcontinent Rift System''' (MRS) or '''Keweenawan Rift''' is a {{convert|2000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} long geological [[rift]] in the center of the [[North America|North American continent]] and south-central part of the [[North American plate]].  It formed when the continent's core, the [[North American craton]], began to split apart during the [[Mesoproterozoic]] era of the [[Precambrian]], about 1.1 billion years ago.  [[aulacogen|The rift failed]], leaving behind thick layers of [[igneous  rock]] that are exposed in its northern reaches, but buried beneath later sedimentary formations along most of its western and eastern arms. Those arms meet at [[Lake Superior]], which is contained within the [[rift valley]].  The lake's [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|north shore]] in [[Ontario]] and [[Minnesota]] defines the northern arc of the rift.  From the lake, the rift's eastern arm trends south to central lower [[Michigan]], and possibly into [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="GSA Grenville Front"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Carol|title=Is the "Grenville Front" in the central United States really the Midcontinent Rift?|journal=GSA Today|date=May 2018|volume=28|issue=5|pages=4–10|url=http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/science/G357A/article.htm|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The western arm runs from Lake Superior southwest through portions of [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], and [[Nebraska]] to northeastern [[Kansas]],&lt;ref name = MRW/&gt; and possibly into [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=Schmus /&gt;

[[File:Superior upland.jpg|thumb|right|Rift rocks are exposed in the [[buff (colour)|buff-colored]] areas around [[Lake Superior]] (black). The buff area on the north margin is the [[Lake Nipigon]] area.]]
The rock formations created by the rift included [[gabbro]] and [[granite]] [[intrusive rock]]s and [[basalt]] [[lava]]s.&lt;ref name = MNGeol/&gt;  In the Lake Superior region, the upwelling of this molten rock may have been the result of a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] which produced a [[triple junction]].&lt;ref name = MRW&gt;{{Cite web| title = Middle Proterozoic and The Mid-continent Rift | work = Minnesota's Rocks and Waters | publisher = [[Winona State University]] | url = http://geogroup4.wikispaces.com/file/view/Mid-continentRift.ppt| accessdate = 2008-04-13 }}(Powerpoint presentation)&lt;/ref&gt;  The hotspot domed the rocks of the Lake Superior area. Voluminous basaltic lava flows erupted from the central axis of the rift, similar to the present-day rifting under way in the [[Afar Depression]] of the [[East African Rift]] system.  

The southwest and southeast extensions represent two arms of the triple junction while a third [[Aulacogen|failed arm]] extends north into Ontario as the [[Nipigon Embayment]].&lt;ref name=Schmus&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Van Schmus |first = W.

The Michigan [[Copper Country]] in the [[Upper Peninsula]] and [[Isle Royale]] contains major [[native copper]] deposits in Keweenawan-age rocks associated with the rift.  A [[Copper mining in Michigan|copper mining industry]] was developed in Precolumbian times, reactivated in the 1840s and continued for more than a century.  Some low-grade copper and nickel deposits, among the largest in the world, also exist in the [[Duluth Complex]] North of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |  last = Kraker | first = Dan | title = FAQ: Everything you need to know about PolyMet | url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/12/02/environment/copper-mining-faq | date = 2013-12-02 | accessdate = 2013-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once thought to be [[Economic geology|uneconomic to mine]],&lt;ref name = Jira&gt;{{Cite web |last=Jira |first=Mark |author2=David Southwick |title=Mineral potential and geology of the Duluth Complex |work=Mineral Potential and Geology of Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota Geological Survey, University of Minnesota |url=http://www.mngs.umn.edu/mnpot/dcmplx.html |accessdate=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these deposits have attracted renewed interest from resource companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Kraker | first = Dan | title = PolyMet's copper-nickel mine rekindles decades-old environmental debate | publisher = [[Minnesota Public Radio]] | date = December 5, 2013 | url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/12/05/environment/polymet-copper-nickel-mining-history | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural gas prices''', as with other commodity prices, are mainly driven by [[supply and demand]] fundamentals.  However, [[natural gas]] prices may also be linked to the price of [[Price of petroleum|crude oil]] and/or petroleum products, especially in continental Europe.&lt;ref name="GasOilPriceLink"&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-rengas.17346943.html Herald Tribune] Natural gas price links to oil market frustrate regulators efforts to develop competition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/high-oil-prices-cut-the-cost-of-natural-gas|title=High Oil Prices Cut the Cost of Natural Gas|author=Roben Farzad|work=Businessweek.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas prices in the US had historically followed oil prices, but in the recent years, it has decoupled from oil and are now trending somewhat with coal prices.&lt;ref name="GasOilPriceLink2"&gt;[http://www.jasonmunster.com/natural-gas-prices-2/ Natural Gas Price Links]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current surge in unconventional oil and gas in the U.S. has resulted in lower gas prices in the U.S. This has led to discussions in Asian oil-linked gas markets to import gas based on the [[Henry Hub]] index,&lt;ref&gt;http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=305#.UZD6pitARpE&lt;/ref&gt; which was, until very recently, the most widely used reference for US natural gas prices.&lt;ref name="HenryHubRole"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/25/us-natgas-henryhub-marcellus-analysis-idUSKCN0HK17E20140925 DISAVINO Scott, KRISHNAN Barani, Henry Hub, king of U.S. natural gas trade, losing crown to Marcellus, Reuters, 25 September 2014] (Retrieved 21 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the marketplace, the price of natural gas is expressed in US dollars (or other currency) per 1 million British thermal units ([[MMBtu]]), thousand cubic feet (Mcf), or 1,000 cubic meters. Note that, for  natural gas price comparisons, $ per MMBtu multiplied by 1.025 = $ per Mcf of pipeline-quality gas, which is what is delivered to consumers. For rough comparisons, one  million [[Btu]] is approximately equal to a thousand cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=45&amp;t=8 EIA conversion chart] "$ per MMBtu multiplied by 1.025 = $ per Mcf"&lt;/ref&gt; Pipeline-quality gas has a BTU value slightly higher than that of pure methane, which has 1,012 BTU per cubic foot. Natural gas as it comes out of the ground is most often predominantly methane, but may have a wide range of BTU values, from much lower (due to dilution by non-hydrocarbon gases) to much higher (due to the presence of ethane, propane, and heavier compounds) than standard pipeline-quality gas.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/2010/ngpps2009/btu_content.cfm Natural gas processing plants in the United States: 2010 update], 17 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. market mechanisms==
The natural gas market in the United States is split between the financial (futures) market, based on the NYMEX futures contract, and the physical market, the price paid for actual deliveries of natural gas and individual delivery points around the United States. Market mechanisms in Europe and other parts of the world are similar, but not as well developed or complex as in the United States.

===Futures market===
The standardized NYMEX natural gas [[futures contract]] is for delivery of 10,000 mmBtu (10,000 million [[Btu]]) of energy (approximately {{convert|10000000|cuft|m3}} of gas) at [[Henry Hub]] in Louisiana over a given delivery month consisting of a varying number of days. As a coarse approximation, 1000 ft3 of natural gas ≈ 1 MMBtu ≈ 1 GJ.  Monthly contracts expire 3–5 days in advance of the first day of the delivery month, at which points traders may either settle their positions financially with other traders in the market (if they have not done so already) or choose to "go physical" and accept delivery of physical natural gas (which is actually quite rare in the financial market).

It should be noted that most financial transactions for natural gas actually take place off exchange in the [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] ("OTC") markets using "look alike" contracts that match the general terms and characteristics of the NYMEX futures contract and settle against the final NYMEX contract value, but that are not subject to the regulations and market rules required on the actual exchange.

It is also important to note that nearly all participants in the financial gas market, whether on or off exchange, participate solely as a financial exercise in order to profit from the net cash flows that occur when financial contracts are settled among counterparties at the expiration of a trading contract. This practice allows for the hedging of financial exposure to transactions in the physical market by allowing physical suppliers and users of natural gas to net their gains in the financial market against the cost of their physical transactions that will occur later on. It also allows individuals and organizations with no need or exposure to large quantities of physical natural gas to participate in the natural gas market for the sole purpose of gaining from trading activities.

In 2015-Nov [[Henry Hub]] Natural Gas Spot price was	- 2.09 за Million Btu ($77,133 per thousand cubic meters) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdw.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- (1000 m3 ≈ 36.906 MMBTU (1 million BTU) 
1 million BTU ≈ 27.096 m3 
2.09 Dollars per Million Btu = 0,07713 $ за m3) --&gt;

===Physical market===
Generally speaking, physical prices at the beginning of any calendar month at any particular delivery location are based on the final settled forward financial price for a given delivery period, plus the settled "basis" value for that location (see below). Once a forward contract period has expired, gas is then traded daily in a "day ahead market" wherein prices for any particular day (or occasional 2-3 day period when weekends and holidays are involved) are determined on the preceding day by traders using localized supply and demand conditions, in particular weather forecasts, at a particular delivery location. The average of all of the individual daily markets in a given month is then referred to as the "index" price for that month at that particular location, and it is not uncommon for the index price for a particular month to vary greatly from the settled futures price (plus basis) from a month earlier.

Many market participants, especially those transacting in gas at the wellhead stage, then add or subtract a small amount to the nearest physical market price to arrive at their ultimate final transaction price.

Once a particular day's gas obligations are finalized in the day-ahead market, traders (or more commonly lower-level personnel in the organization known as, "schedulers") will work together with counterparties and pipeline representatives to "schedule" the flows of gas into ("injections") and out of ("withdrawals") individual pipelines and meters. Because, in general, injections must equal withdrawals (i.e. the net volume injected and withdrawn on the pipeline should equal zero), pipeline scheduling and regulations are a major driver of trading activities, and quite often the financial penalties inflicted by pipelines onto shippers who violate their terms of service are well in excess of losses a trader may otherwise incur in the market correcting the problem.

===Basis market===
Because market conditions vary between Henry Hub and the roughly 40 or so physical trading locations around United States, financial traders also usually transact simultaneously in financial "basis" contracts intended to approximate these difference in geography and local market conditions. The rules around these contracts - and the conditions under which they are traded - are nearly identical to those for the underlying gas futures contract.

===Derivatives and market instruments===
Because the U.S. natural gas market is so large and well developed and has many independent parts, it enables many market participants to transact under complex structures and to use market instruments that are not otherwise available in a simple commodity market where the only transactions available are to purchase or sell the underlying product. For instance, options and other derivative transactions are very common, especially in the OTC market, as are "swap" transactions where participants exchange rights to future cash flows based on underlying index prices or delivery obligations or time periods. Participants use these tools to further hedge their financial exposure to the underlying price of natural gas.

==Natural gas demand==
The '''demand''' for [[natural gas]] is mainly driven by the following factors:
*Weather
*Demographics
*Economic growth
*Price increases, and poverty 
*Fuel competition
*Storage
*Exports

===Weather===
Weather conditions can significantly affect natural gas demand and supply. Cold temperatures in the winter increase the demand for space heating with natural gas in commercial and residential buildings.

Natural gas demand usually peaks during the coldest months of the year (December–February) and is lowest during the "shoulder" months (May–June and September–October). During the warmest summer months (July–August), demand increases again. Due to the shift in population in the United States toward the sun belt, summer demand for natural gas is rising faster than winter demand.

Temperature effects are measured in terms of 'heating degree days' (HDD) during the winter, and 'cooling degree days'(CDD) during the summer. HDDs are calculated by subtracting the average temperature for a day from 65 degrees. Thus, if the average temperature for a day is 50 degrees, there are 15 HDDs. If the average temperature is above 65 degrees, HDD is zero.

Cooling degree days are also measured by the difference between the average temperature and 65 degrees. Thus, if the average temperature is 80 degrees, there are 15 CDDs. If the average temperature is below 65 degrees, CDD is zero.

Hurricanes can affect both the supply of and demand for natural gas. For example, as hurricanes approach the Gulf of Mexico, offshore natural gas platforms are shut down as workers evacuate, thereby shutting in production. In addition, hurricanes can also cause severe destruction to offshore (and onshore) production facilities. For example, Hurricane Katrina (2005) resulted in massive shut-ins of natural gas production.

Hurricane damage can also reduce natural gas demand. The destruction of power lines interrupting electricity produced by natural gas can result in significant reduction in demand for a given area (e.g., Florida).

===Demographics===
Changing demographics also affects the demand for natural gas, especially for core residential customers. In the US for instance, recent demographic trends indicate an increased population movement to the Southern and Western states. These areas are generally characterized by warmer weather, thus we could expect a decrease in demand for heating in the winter, but an increase in demand for cooling in the summer. As electricity currently supplies most of the cooling energy requirements, and natural gas supplies most of the energy used for heating, population movement may decrease the demand for natural gas for these customers. However, as more power plants are fueled by natural gas, natural gas demand could in fact increase.

===Economic growth===
The state of the economy can have a considerable effect on the demand for natural gas in the short term. This is particularly true for industrial and to a lesser extent the commercial customers. When the economy is booming, output from the industrial sectors generally increases. On the other hand, when the economy is experiencing a recession, output from industrial sectors drops. These fluctuations in industrial output accompanying the economy affects the amount of natural gas needed by these industrial users. For instance, during the economic recession of 2001, U.S. natural gas consumption by the industrial sector fell by 6 percent.&lt;ref name="Source1"&gt;[http://www.naturalgas.org/business/demand.asp ''NaturalGas.org-Natural Gas Demand''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420211353/http://www.naturalgas.org/business/demand.asp |date=20 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price increases, and poverty===
Tariff increases and levels of household income also influence the demand for natural gas. A 2016 study assesses the expected poverty and distributional effects of a natural gas price reform – in the context of Armenia; it estimates that a significant tariff increase of about 40% contributed to an estimated 8% of households to substitute natural gas mainly with wood as their source of heating - and it also pushed an estimated 2.8% of households into poverty (i.e. below the national poverty line). This study also outlines the methodological and statistical assumptions and constraints that arise in estimating causal effects of energy reforms on household demand and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Alexander. 2016. [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kraussa/How%20natural%20gas%20tariff%20increases%20can%20influence%20poverty%20-%20Results,%20measurement%20constraints%20and%20bias.pdf ''How natural gas tariff increases can influence poverty: Results, measurement constraints and bias'']. Vol. 60. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.09.010 Energy Economics.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Fuel competition===
Supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace determine the short term price for natural gas. However, this can work in reverse as well. The price of natural gas can, for certain consumers, affect its demand. This is particularly true for those consumers who have the ability to switch the fuel which they consume. In general the core customers (residential and commercial) do not have this ability, however, a number of industrial and electric generation consumers have the capacity to switch between fuels. For instance, when natural gas prices are extremely high, [[electric generator]]s may switch from using natural gas to using cheaper coal or fuel oil. This fuel switching then leads to a decrease for the demand of natural gas, which usually tends to drop its price.

===Storage===
North American natural gas injections (positive) represent additional demand and compete with alternative uses such as gas for heating or for power generation. [[Natural gas storage]] levels significantly affect the commodity’s price. When the storage levels are low, a signal is being sent to the market indicating that there is a smaller supply cushion and prices will be rising. On the other hand, when storage levels are high, this sends a signal to the market that there is greater supply flexibility and prices will tend to drop.

===Exports===
Exports are another source of demand. In North America, gas is exported within its forming countries, Canada, the US and Mexico as well as abroad to countries such as Japan.

==Natural gas supply==
The '''supply''' for natural gas is mainly driven by the following factors:
*Pipeline capacity
*Storage
*Gas drilling rates
*Natural phenomena
*Technical issues
*Imports
*Transportation Wholesale Rates

|}

===Pipeline capacity===
The ability to transport natural gas from the well heads of the producing regions to the consuming regions affects the availability of supply in the marketplace. The interstate and intrastate pipeline infrastructure has limited capacity and can only transport so much natural gas at any one time. This has the effect of limiting the maximum amount of natural gas that can reach the market. The current pipeline infrastructure is quite developed, with the EIA estimating that the daily delivery capacity of the grid is {{convert|119|Gcuft|m3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Source3"&gt;[http://www.naturalgas.org/business/analysis.asp ''NaturalGas.org-Natural Gas Supply''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021010135021/http://www.naturalgas.org/business/analysis.asp |date=10 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, natural gas pipeline companies should continue to expand the pipeline infrastructure in order to meet growing future demand.
The coming addition of the Canadian Pipeline looks to provide additional resources for the North American populace CommercialNG.com &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/monthly/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Justin|title=New York Times|url=http://commercialng.com/|work=Commercial Energy Consultant|publisher=Bloomberg, New York Times|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
As natural gas injections (positive) represent additional demand, withdrawals (negative) represent an additional source of supply which can be accessed quickly.  The more storage banks like shale deposits used give more cushion for the natural gas markets.

===Gas drilling rates===
The amount of natural gas produced both from associated and non-associated sources can be controlled to some extent by the producers. The drilling rates and gas prices form a feedback loop. When supply is low relative to demand, prices rise; this gives a market signal to the producer to increase the number of rigs drilling for natural gas. The increased supply will then lead to a decrease in the price.

===Natural phenomena===
Natural phenomena can significantly affect natural gas production and thus supply. Hurricanes, for example, can affect the offshore production and exploitation of natural gas. This is because safety requirements may mandate the temporary shut down of offshore production platforms. Tornadoes can have a similar effect on onshore production facilities.

===Technical Issues===
Equipment malfunction, although not frequent, could temporarily disrupt the flow across a given pipeline at an important market center. This would ultimately decrease the supply available in that market. On the other hand, technical developments in engineering methods can lead to more abundant supply.

===Imports===
[[File:US Natural Gas Production.svg|thumb|U.S. Natural Gas Marketed Production (cubic feet) since 1900 US EIA]]
Imports are a source of supply. In North America, gas is imported from several countries, Canada and the US as well as abroad in the form of [[LNG]] from countries such as Trinidad, Algeria and Nigeria.

==Trends in natural gas prices==
[[Image:UsNaturalGasProductionAndPrices.png|frame]]
The chart shows a 75-year history of annual [[United States]] [[natural gas]] production and [[average]] [[wellhead]] [[price]]s from 1930 through 2005. Prices paid by consumers were increased above those levels by [[Business process|processing]] and [[Downstream (oil industry)|distribution]] costs. Production is shown in billions of cubic meters per year, and average wellhead pricing is shown in United States [[dollar]]s per thousand cubic meters, adjusted to spring, 2006, by the U.S. [[Consumer price index|Consumer Price Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Energy Information Administration | title=Historical Natural Gas Annual | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | year=2005 | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/historical_natural_gas_annual/current/pdf/table_01.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Energy Information Administration | title=Natural Gas Annual 2004 | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | year=2005 | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/natural_gas_annual/current/pdf/nga04.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Energy Information Administration | title=Natural Gas Monthly | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | year=Apr 2006 | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_dcu_nus_a.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bureau of Labor Statistics | title=Consumer Price Index | publisher=U.S. Department of Labor | year=2006 | url=http://www.bls.gov/cpi/ }} National, All Urban Consumers, All Items, Averaged by Year.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This article uses numeric conventions of the United States: "billion" = 1 000 000 000 and "trillion" = 1 000 000 000 000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1960s the U.S. was self-sufficient in [[natural gas]] and wasted large parts of its withdrawals by [[Gas flare|venting and flaring]]. Gas flares were common sights in [[Oil field|oilfields]] and at [[Oil refinery|refineries]]. U.S. natural gas prices were relatively stable at around (2006 US) $30/Mcm in both the 1930s and the 1960s. Prices reached a low of around (2006 US) $17/Mcm in the late 1940s, when more than 20 percent of the natural gas being withdrawn from U.S. [[Oil reserves|reserves]] was vented or flared.

Beginning in 1954, the [[Federal Power Commission]] regulated the price of US natural gas transported across state lines. The commission set the price of gas below the market rate, resulting in price distortions. The low prices encouraged consumption and discouraged production. By the 1970s, there were shortages of price-regulated interstate gas, while unregulated gas within the gas-producing states (intrastate gas) was plentiful, but more expensive. By 1975, nearly half the marketed gas in the US was sold to the intrastate market, resulting in shortages during 1976 and 1977 in the Midwest that caused factories and schools to close temporarily for lack of natural gas. The federal government progressively deregulated the price of natural gas starting in 1978, and ending with complete federal price deregulation in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Gas.Org, [http://naturalgas.org/regulation/history/ History of regulation], 20 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Supply and demand|supply]] interruptions{{citation needed|date = December 2014}} have caused repeated [[Energy crisis|spikes in pricing]] since 1990, longer range price trends respond to limitations in [[Natural resource|resources]] and their rates of development. As of 2006 the U.S. [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] estimated that the [[Continental shelf|Outer Continental Shelf]] of the [[United States]] held more than 15 trillion cubic meters of recoverable [[natural gas]], equivalent to about 25 years of domestic [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] at present rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Minerals Management Service | title=Leasing Oil and Natural Gas Resources | publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior | year=2006 | url=http://www.mms.gov/ld/PDFs/GreenBook-LeasingDocument.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=9 May 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205060226/http://www.mms.gov/ld/PDFs/GreenBook-LeasingDocument.pdf | archive-date=5 February 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Michael Janofsky | title=As Cuba Plans Offshore Wells, Some Want U.S. to Follow Suit | publisher=New York Times | date=9 May 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/washington/09drill.html?hp&amp;ex=1147233600&amp;en=385456f30856b86f&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total U.S. natural gas [[Oil reserves|reserves]] were then estimated at 30 to 50 trillion cubic meters, or about 40 to 70 years consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Overview of Natural Gas | title=U.S. Natural Gas Resource Estimates | publisher=(U.S.) Natural Gas Supply Association | year=2004 | url=http://www.naturalgas.org/overview/resources.asp | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218114833/http://www.naturalgas.org/overview/resources.asp | archivedate=18 December 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new technologies of [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[horizontal drilling]] have increased these estimates of recoverable reserves to many hundreds of trillion cubic feet. Hydraulic fracturing has reduced the Henry Hub spot price of natural gas considerably since 2008.  The increased [[shale gas]] production leads to a shift of supply away from the south to the northeast and midwest of the country. A recent study found that, on average, natural gas prices have gone down by more than 30% in counties above shale deposits compared to the rest of the US, highlighting that natural gas markets have become less integrated due to pipeline capacity constraints.&lt;ref name="Fetzer"&gt;[http://www.trfetzer.com/fracking-growth/ Fracking Growth - Impact of Shale Gas production on natural gas prices across the US], Fetzer, T. (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas prices in Europe==
Prices of natural gas for end-consumers vary greatly throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.eu/#Domestic|title=Europe's Energy Portal » Fuel, Natural Gas and Electricity Prices From Past to Present|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main objectives of the projected single EU energy market is a common pricing structure for gas products. A recent study suggests that the expansion of shale gas production in the U.S. has caused prices to drop relative to other countries, especially Europe and Asia, leaving natural gas in the U.S. cheaper by a factor of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Comparative Advantage of U.S. Manufacturing: Evidence from the Shale Gas Revolution|journal = Journal of International Economics|url = http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1399.pdf|first = Rabah|last = Arezki|first2 = Thiemo|last2 = Fetzer|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075547/http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1399.pdf|archivedate = 1 July 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the [[TTIP]] trade deal between the U.S. and Europe opens up access to cheap American natural gas, which allow Europe to diversify its supply base, but may threaten the [[Renewable Energy]] transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/05/ttip-free-trade-deal-renewable-energy-transatlantic-partnership-eu-us|title=TTIP: what does the transatlantic trade deal mean for renewable energy?|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Currently, Europe's main natural gas supplier is Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supplier countries|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/imports-and-secure-supplies/supplier-countries|website=European Union|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In September 2013, it was reported that multiple factors have conspired to cause Europe as a whole to decrease its use of natural gas and make more use of coal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=13151&lt;/ref&gt; The report also contains updated price trends.

==Natural gas prices in South America==
In South America, the second largest supplier of natural gas is Bolivia. 
The price which Bolivia is paid for its natural gas is roughly US$3.25 to Brazil and US$3.18 to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8I25M200.htm?sub=apn_home_down&amp;chan=db Businessweek]&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that Brazil pays between US$3.15/MMBtu and US$3.60/MMBtu (not including US$1.50/MMBtu in [[Petrobras]] extraction and transportation costs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Luiz Rodolfo Landim Machado | title= Facing Market Risks in Brazil: the experience of the Bolivia - Brazil Gas Pipeline | publisher=In [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] – OLADE Latin American Conference on Cross-Border Gas Trade. | url=http://www.iea.org/dbtw-wpd/Textbase/work/2002/gastrade/Lrlandi.pdf | format=PDF | date=October 2002 | accessdate=2 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060524231036/http://www.iea.org/dbtw-wpd/Textbase/work/2002/gastrade/Lrlandi.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of gas in the US as a whole is between US$5.85/MMBtu (21 May 2006), US$7.90/MMBtu (April 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nymex.com/ng_fut_csf.aspx|title=Futures &amp; Options Trading|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; US$6.46/MMBtu (June 2006).&lt;ref&gt;	[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060606.RGAS06/TPStory/Business ''Globe and Mail'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though several years ago the price of natural gas spiked at $14 in [[California]]&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news | title=Evo Morales et l'arme du gaz | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | date=25 January 2006 | accessdate=25 January 2006 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-734335,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to lack of pipeline capacity to and within California, and also due to power outages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/special/california/june01article/canatgas.html US DOE],  [http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntn12206.htm gasandoil.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185235/http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntn12206.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While according to ''[[Le Monde]]'', [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] pay US$2 per thousand cubic feet,&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt; which costs between $2.21 to $2.28 per mmBTU &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/16/markets-natgas-spot-idUSL2E8FGDPN20120416|title=Weekday demand lifts US Henry Hub gas from 31-mo low|work=Reuters|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in California according to Reuters.

==History/Background==
[[File:OilSheenFromValdezSpill.jpg|thumb|left|Heavy sheens of oil as visible on the surface of the water in [[Prince William Sound]] following the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]].]]Laws governing oil spills in the [[United States]] began in 1851 with the [[Limitation of Liability Act of 1851|Limitation of Liability Act]]. This statue, in an attempt to protect the shipping industry, stated that vessel owners were liable for incident-related costs up to the post-incident value of their vessel. The shortcomings of this law were revealed in 1967 with the release of over 100,000 tons of [[Petroleum|crude oil]] into the [[English Channel]] from the [[Torrey Canyon oil spill|Torrey Canyon]]. Of the $8 million of cleanup-related costs, the owners of the Torrey Canyon were held liable for only $50—the value of the only remaining Torrey Canyon lifeboat. In the meantime, the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1924]] had passed, but this statue only limited liability for ''deliberate'' discharge of oil into marine waters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Jeffery|year=2011|title=The Oil Pollution Act of 1990|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1376&amp;context=elr|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Review|volume=6 |issue=1|pages=1–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years following the Torrey Canyon spill, an oil platform eruption in the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] made national headlines and thrust oil pollution into the public spot light. As a result, in 1970, [[United States Congress|Congress]] placed oil pollution under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Act (FWPA) of 1965, which later became the [[Clean Water Act|Clean Water Act of 1972]] and had previously only covered sewage and Industrial discharge.  The FWPA set specific liability limitations. For example, vessels transporting oil were liable only up to $250,000 or $150 per gross ton. These limitations rarely covered the cost of removal and cleanup, let alone damages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the decades to follow, several other laws that dealt with oil spill liability and compensation were passed. These statues include: the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act|Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973]], the Deep Water Port Act of 1974, the [[Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]] of 1978, and the Alaska Oil Spill Commission of 1990. However, this fragmented collection of federal and state laws provided only limited safeguards against the hazards of oils spills. In 1976, a bill to create a cohesive safe measure for oil pollution was introduced to Congress. Neither the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] nor the [[United States Senate|Senate]] could agree on a single statue and the bill fell out of consideration numerous times.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil and Wilderness in Alaska|last=Busenberg|first=George|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-58901-662-0|location=Washington, DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1989, the [[Exxon Valdez]] hit aground in the [[Prince William Sound|Prince Williams Sound]] and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil—the largest marine oil spill in recorded history up to that point.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Soon afterward, in June 1989, three smaller spills occurred within coastal waters of the United States. This was timely evidence that oil spills were not uncommon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Alaska Governor [[Steve Cowper]] authorized the creation of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission in 1989 to examine the causes of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] and issue recommendations on potential policy changes. Cowper appointed [[Walter B. Parker]], a longtime transportation consultant and public official, as the chairman of the commission.&lt;ref name="pwsrcac"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pwsrcac.org/observer/long-life-service-walt-parker-passes-away-87/|title=After a long life of service, Walt Parker passes away at 87|last=|first=|date=2014-06-26|work=[[Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council]]|accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20140626/longtime-alaska-resources-and-transportation-adviser-walter-parker-dead-87-0|title=Longtime Alaska resources and transportation adviser Walter Parker dead at 87|last=Dunham|first=Mike|date=2014-06-26|work=[[Alaska Dispatch News]]|accessdate=2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Parker, the Commission issued 52 recommendations for improvements to industry, state, and federal regulations.&lt;ref name="pwsrcac" /&gt; 50 of these recommendations were worked into the Oil Pollution Act bill&lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d101:HR01465:&lt;/ref&gt; that was introduced into legislation on March 16, 1989 by [[Walter B.

==Enactment timeline==
* '''March 16, 1989:''' the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1973|Oil Pollution Act]] was introduced into the legislative process for enactment.
* '''June 21 of 1989:''' a committee reported and recommended that both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] should consider the bill further. Only about 1 in 4 bills are reported out of committee.
* '''November 9, 1989:''' the bill was passed by a vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].
* '''November 19, 1989:''' the bill was passed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], with revisions'''.''' The bill was sent back to the House of Representatives for approval of the changes added by the Senate. However, the House of Representatives did not agree to the revisions.
* '''August 2 of 1990:''' a conference committee was created, including members of both the House of Representatives and Senate, in order to resolve differences and propose a final bill for approval.  Initially, the Senate agreed to the committee's final proposed report.
* '''August 4 of 1990:''' both chambers of Congress had passed the bill in identical form. The final step in the legislative process was for the bill to go to the President to either approve and sign or veto it.
* '''August 18 of 1990:''' the bill was signed by the President and the Oil Pollution Act was officially enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr1465|title=Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (1990 - H.R. 1465)|website=GovTrack.us|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
A responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act is one who is found accountable for the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil from a vessel or facility into navigable waters, exclusive economic zones, or the shorelines of such covered waters. Responsible parties are strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cost of removing the oil in addition to any damages linked to the discharge. Unlike the liability for removal costs which are uncapped, liability for damages is limited as discussed in further detail below. Furthermore, the Oil Pollution Act allows for additional liability enacted by other relevant state laws.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=James|year=2010|title=Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA): Liability of Responsible Parties|url=http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/R41266.pdf|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Oil Pollution Act, federal, tribal, state, and any other person can recover removal costs from a responsible party so long as such entity has incurred costs from carrying out oil removal activities in accordance with the [[Clean Water Act|Clean Water Act National Contingency Plan]]. Reimbursement claims must first be made to the responsible party. If the potentially responsible party refutes liability or fails to distribute the reimbursement within 90 days of the claim, the claimant may file suit in court or bring the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund described below. In some instances, claims for removal cost reimbursement can be initially brought to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund thus sidestepping the responsible party. For example, claimants advised by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], governors of affected states,  and American claimants for incidents involving foreign vessels or facilities may initially present their claims to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. When claims for removal cost reimbursement are brought to the fund, the claimant must prove that removal costs were sustained from activities required to avoid or alleviate effects of the incident and that such actions were approved or directed by the federal on-scene coordinator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a manner similar to that described above, costs for damages can be recovered from a responsible party. However, the Oil Pollution Act only covers certain categories of damages. These categories include: natural resource damages, damages to real or personal property, loss of subsistence use, loss of government revenues, loss of profits or impaired earning capacity, damaged public services, and damage assessment costs. Additionally, some categories are recoverable for any person impacted by the incident while others are only recoverable by federal, tribal, and state governments. Furthermore, the Oil Pollution Act proscribes limits to liability for damages based on the responsible party, the particular incident, and the type of vessel or facility from which the discharge occurred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is a trust fund managed by the federal government and financed by a per-barrel tax on crude oil produced domestically in the United States and on petroleum products imported to the United States for consumption. The fund was created in 1986, but use of the fund was not authorized until the Oil Pollution Act's passage in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscg.mil/npfc/docs/PDFs/Reports/osltf_report.pdf|title=Report on Implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990|last=|first=|date=2004|website=|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds may be called upon to cover the cost of federal, tribal, state, and claimant oil spill removal actions and damage assessments as well as unpaid liability and damages claims.

President Bush acknowledged the changes the world would have to endure when signing the Oil Pollution Act and as a result, he pushed the Senate to quickly ratify the new international protocols. The reactions from industries were negative. Industry objected that the Oil Pollution Act would hinder the free flow in the trade of imported oil in the [[Waters of the United States]]. Not only does the OPA impose restrictions on trading imported oil overseas, but it also implements the state oil liability and compensation [[statute]]s, which they view as further restricting free trade. After OPA was enacted, the shipping industry threatened to boycott the ports of the United States to protest this new industry liability in both federal and state laws. In particular, the oil and shipping industries objected to the inconsistency between the OPA  and the international, federal and state laws that are impacted. As a result of the OPA enactment, certain insurance companies refused to issue certifications of financial liability under the Oil Pollution Act to avoid potential responsibility and compensation in the case of a disaster.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donaldson|first=Michael|year=1992|title=The Oil Pollution Act of 1990: reaction and response|url=http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&amp;context=elj|journal=Villanova Environmental Law Journal|volume=3|pages=1–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush also predicted that the enactment of the OPA could lead to larger oil shipping companies being replaced by the smaller shipping companies to avoid liability. In particular, smaller companies with limited resources would lack the finances to remediate oil spill disasters. Not just the oil industry, but also the vessel owners and operators would be held liable for an oil spill, facing a significant increase in financial responsibility. The OPA's liability increase for vessel owners raised fears and concerns from the vast majority of the shipping industry. Vessel owners objected that additional oil spill penalties imposed by the states are free from OPA limitations of the [[Limitation of Liability Act of 1851]]. Ultimately, the threat of unlimited liability under the OPA and other state statutes has led countless oil shipping companies to reduce oil trade to and from the ports of the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, there were positive reactions from the oil industries despite the newly enforced codes and regulations. In 1990, the oil industry united to form the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MRSC), a non-profit corporation whose expenses would be compensated by the oil producers and transporters. The major MRSC responsibility was to develop new response plans for oil spills cleanups and for the OPA-required remediation. Shipping companies like the [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Shipping]] reacted positively OPA's efforts to reduce their risk of liability for oil spill disasters. To help ensure OPA compliance, Exxon Shipping compiled all state and federal regulations to which they must abide. Several independent and non-U.S. companies and operators, however, may avoid operations in the United States ports due to the OPA liability. Though the majority of elicited reactions and criticism from the enactment of OPA has been negative, it has nevertheless led to founding and designing safer requirements for ships and global oil trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Long-term effects of OPA==
The Oil Pollution act imposes long term impacts due to the potential for unlimited liability and the statute's that hold insurers to serve as guarantors, which has ultimately resulted in the refusal of insurance companies to issue agreements of financial liability to vessel operators and owners. Thus, the inability to acquire proof of financial liability results in vessels not being able to legally enter waters of the United States. Since OPA does not exempt vessel creditors to enter U.S. waters, there is a disincentive for any lender to finance fleet modernization and or replacement. Lastly, OPA has the ability to directly impact the domestic oil production industry due to the rigorous offshore facility provisions.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Jeffery|year=2011|title=The Oil Pollution Act of 1990|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1376&amp;context=elr|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Review|volume=6|pages=1–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Financial responsibility:''' The [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] is responsible for the implementation of the vessel provisions mandated by the Oil Pollutions Act. According to OPA, vessel owners need evidence of financial liability that covers complete responsibility of a disaster if their vessel weighs more than 300 gross tons. Vessel owners are required by OPA to apply to the Coast Guard to acquire a "Certificate of Financial Responsibility" that serves as proof of their ability to financially responsible for cleanup and damages of an oil spill. In the case of an uncertified vessel entering the waters of the United States, the vessel will have to be forfeited to the United States. This is not a new protocol because vessel owners were always mandated to acquire certificates under the [[Clean Water Act|FWPCA 74]] and [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)]]. Since 2011, over 23,000 vessels have obtained the Coast Guard Certificates to allow access to waters of the U.S.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;
# '''Disincentives for fleet replacement and modernization:''' Since the Oil Pollution Act holds the vessel owners fully liable, it has created a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs. The majority of charterers refuse to pay more for higher grade vessels despite the liability and compensation regulations enforced by OPA. The new and safer double hull tanker vessels are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring single hull vessels mandated by OPA. For example, [[Exxon]] and [[Texaco]] have delayed the replacement of their single hull vessels for new double hulled ships. However, companies like [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] and [[Mobil]] have ordered two new double hull tankers. Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double hull tankers as well. Despite the change from single to double tanker vessels, it is still not sufficient enough to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;
# '''Domestic production:''' In the Oil Pollution Act, the U.S. Coast Guard is in charge of screening the application process for vessels, however, the Department of Interior's Mineral Management Service (MMS) implements and enforces all of the Oil Pollution Act's regulations for offshore oil facilities. Under OPA, the responsible parties are mandated to provide evidence declaring financial responsibility of $150 million for potential liability. If a party is unable to provide evidence declaring financial responsibility of $150 million, they will be subject to pay a penalty of $25,000 per day in violation of OPA and may also be subject to judicial decision of terminating all operations.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

Before the Oil Pollution was enacted, offshore facilities were required to provide evidence that declared financial responsibility of $35 million. After OPA, these offshore facilities had to increase their proof of financial responsibility by 4 times and OPA's requirement of financial responsibility expanded to include facilities in state waters as well. Facilities in state waters that are subject to the $150 million requirement includes [[Pipelines Under The Ocean|pipelines]], marina fuel docks, tanks, and oil production facilities that are located in, on, or under state coastal waters, and are adjacent to inland channels, lakes, and [[wetland]]s. The most evident impact of the enactment of OPA, is on the oil producers within the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Many offshore facilities are located in the Gulf of Mexico and in the marshes and [[wetlands of Louisiana]]. Major producers are most likely able to meet OPA's requirement of financial responsibility, however, the major oil companies within the Gulf of Mexico have exponentially withdrawled the operation of their offshore facilities.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

Due to environmental pressures and the restrictive governmental regulations enforced by OPA, substantial proposals of exploration and production in the United States have been withdrawn. As a result of major companies withdrawing their plans to drill, many smaller, independent producers had entered to profitize. By October 1993, 93% of all oil and natural gas exploration and drilling were from independents producers. Of these new exploration projects, approximately 85% of drilling operations were in the Gulf of Mexico. The independent oil producers generated nearly 40% of the crude oil in the United States and 60% of domestic natural gas.

==International treaties==
In the case of oil pollution caused by other nations (especially ships), [[International treaties]] such as the [[International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage]] and [[International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage]] which have a similar intention as the Act, have not been signed by the United States, as it was deemed the Oil Pollution Act provided sufficient coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION FOR SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/dtltlb20114_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|accessdate=30 June 2017|pages=20, 23|date=31 January 2012|quote=[p20:] However, it should be noted that in some cases, substantial compensation may be available under applicable national law, as for instance in the case of the United States Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA 1990).

'''Operation Sandblast''' was the code name for the first submerged circumnavigation of the world, executed by the [[United States Navy]] [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[radar picket]] [[submarine]] {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586}} in 1960 under the command of [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Captain Edward L. Beach]].  ''[[The New York Times]]'' described ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged [[circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth]] as "a triumph of human prowess and engineering skill, a feat which the United States Navy can rank as one of its bright victories in man's ultimate conquest of the seas."&lt;ref name="Modern"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Modern Magellans | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40617FC345C16738DDDAA0994DD405B808AF1D3 | work= New York Times| date= May 13, 1960 | accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumnavigation took place between 24 February and 25 April 1960, covering {{convert|26,723|nmi|km mi}} over 60 days and 21 hours.  The route began and ended at the [[St. Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the [[Equator]].  During the voyage, ''Triton'' crossed the Equator four times while maintaining an average speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h mph}}.  ''Triton''{{'}}s overall navigational track during Operation Sandblast generally followed that of the first circumnavigation of the world, led by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] from 1519 to 1522.

The initial impetus for Operation Sandblast was to increase American technological and scientific prestige before the May [[1960 Paris Summit]] between [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  It also provided a high-profile public demonstration of the capability of U.S. Navy [[Nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarines]] to carry out long-range submerged operations independent of external support and undetected by hostile forces, presaging the initial deployment of the U.S. Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[George Washington-class submarine|ballistic missile submarines]] later in 1960.  Finally, Operation Sandblast gathered extensive [[Oceanography|oceanographic]], [[Hydrography|hydrographic]], [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]], [[Geophysics|geophysical]], and [[Psychology|psychological]] data during ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation.

Although official celebrations for Operation Sandblast were cancelled following the diplomatic furor arising from the [[1960 U-2 incident|shooting down of a CIA U-2 spy plane]] over the Soviet Union in early May 1960, ''Triton'' did receive the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe in recognition of the successful completion of its mission, and Captain Beach received the [[Legion of Merit]] for his role as ''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer.  In 1961, Beach received the [[Magellanic Premium]], the United States' oldest and most prestigious scientific award, from the [[American Philosophical Society]] in "recognition of his navigation of the U.S. submarine ''Triton'' around the globe."

==Mission overview—Project Magellan==
{{Quotation|There is no doubt that sooner or later the USSR will put some nuclear submarine to sea.  It would be a shame if we permit them to announce this to the world by virtue of some dramatic feat which we could have done ourselves.

"Project Magellan" is, in my estimation, head and shoulders above any of the remainder as a feat of submarine navigation and a demonstration of the global range of nuclear submarines.&lt;ref name=Finch110&gt;{{cite book |title= Beneath the Waves: The Life and Navy of Capt.

===Mission origins===
The possibility of a submerged circumnavigation of the world by a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine was initially discussed between [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Evan Peter Aurand|Evan P. Aurand]], President Eisenhower's naval aide, and [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[William Anderson (naval officer)|William R. Anderson]], commanding officer of the first nuclear submarine, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|''Nautilus'']], before it was decided to attempt a [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)#Operation Sunshine - under the North Pole|submerged voyage]] under the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Ice Diaries: The Untold Story of the USS ''Nautilus'' and the Cold War's Most Daring Mission |last= Anderson |first= William R. |authorlink= William Anderson (naval officer) |author2=Don Keith |date= 2008 |publisher= [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson Publishers]] |location= [[Nashville, Tennessee]] |isbn= 978-0-7852-2759-5  |pages= 154–159 |url= http://www.donkeith.com/index.php?p=13  |accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Aurand is credited with recommending that a successful submerged circumnavigation, timed to conclude just prior to the upcoming [[1960 Paris Summit|May 1960 Four Power Paris Summit]] between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Dwight D. Eisenhower and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] Nikita Khrushchev, would provide a much needed boost to American prestige, and consequently this voyage, [[Code name|code-named]] Operation Sandblast, reflected the highest priority within the Eisenhower administration.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 110, 230n29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Admiral Burke's classified response dated 18 January 1960 acknowledged the technical feasibility of Project Magellan while further noting that the "Magellan route" could be transited in "56 days at {{convert|20|kn|km/h mph}} and 75 days at {{convert|15|kn|km/h mph}}," with the latter option costing an additional $3.34 million USD in nuclear fuel consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 110, 230n31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aurand forwarded his Project Magellan proposal and Burke's assessment to Press Secretary [[James C. Hagerty]] in a memorandum dated 26 January 1960.  Project Magellan was subsequently approved by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and USS ''Triton'' was specifically recommended by Aurand to undertake Project Magellan.&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy nuclear-powered [[radar picket]] submarine ''Triton'' (''pictured'') was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive [[Nuclear submarine|submarine]] ever built at the time of her commissioning, costing $109,000,000 excluding the cost of her nuclear fuel and reactors.&lt;ref name=Polmar67&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  A unique submarine, she also had the distinction of being the only non-Soviet submarine to be powered by two nuclear reactors.  ''Triton''{{'}}s  high speed was derived from her twin-reactor nuclear propulsion plant, with a designed speed, surfaced and submerged, of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. On 27 September 1959, ''Triton'' achieved "well in excess of" {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} during her initial sea trials.&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible," p. 178, 180&lt;/ref&gt;  As originally designed, ''Triton''{{'}}s total reactor output was rated at {{convert|34000|hp}}, but she achieved {{convert|45000|hp}} during her sea trials ''(pictured)'', and her first commanding officer believed ''Triton''{{'}}s plant could have reached {{convert|60000|hp}} "had that been necessary."&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt;

''Triton''{{'}}s first commanding officer was [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]] (''pictured''), a highly decorated submarine officer who had participated in the [[Battle of Midway]] and 12 combat patrols during [[World War II]], earning 10 decorations for gallantry, including the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].  After the war, Beach served as the naval aide to the [[President of the United States]] from 1953 to 1957, and he also was the best-selling author of the non-fiction book ''Submarine!'' and a [[Run Silent, Run Deep#Novel plot|novel ''Run Silent, Run Deep'']], which was made into a [[Run Silent, Run Deep#Movie plot|1958 movie]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;"Edward L Beach." [[Current Biography|''Current Biography'' (1960)]], p. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last interview prior to his death in 2002, Captain Beach recalled  ''Triton'' and the background to her historical mission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As I was reporting to the ''Triton'', I remember saying, "This ship is an unusual one. We've got to do something special with it. What could it be?" We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If you take a look at a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go.  So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.&lt;ref name=WellAroundtheWorld&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schultz |first= Fred |authorlink= |date=February 2003 |title= We'll Go Around the World: An Interview with Captain Edward L.

Following her commissioning on 10 November 1959, ''Triton''  was assigned to [[Submarine Squadron]] 10 (Subron 10), the U.S. Navy's first all-nuclear force, based at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London|U.S. Submarine Base in New London]], [[Connecticut]], under the command of [[Commodore (USN)#Present day title usage|Commodore]] Thomas H.

On 20 January 1960, ''Triton'' got underway to conduct an accelerated series of at-sea testing.  ''Triton'' returned on 1 February as preparations continued for her forthcoming [[shakedown cruise]], scheduled for departure on 16 February 1960, which involved operating with the [[command ship]] {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|2}}, [[flagship]] of the [[U.S. Second Fleet]], in northern European waters.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

===Mission objectives===
On 4 February 1960, Captain Edward L. Beach and Commodore Thomas H. Henry of Subron 10 arrived at [[the Pentagon]] in civilian attire to attend a top-secret, high-level meeting led by [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] Wallace M. Beakley, Deputy [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Fleet Operations and Readiness.  Also attending were [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Lawson P. Ramage]], Director of the Undersea Warfare Division, OPNAV; Captain [[Henry G. Munson]], Director of the [[Hydrographic office#United States|U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office]], and staff representatives from the submarine [[U.S. Navy type commands|type commands]] for the [[ComSubLant|Atlantic]] and [[ComSubPac|Pacific]] fleets.&lt;ref name=FirstB5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Papers of Vice Admiral Wallace M. Beakley | url= http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/bravo/beakley.htm | work= Operational Archives Branch | publisher= [[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] | date= 1940–1964 | accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was announced ''Triton''{{'}}s upcoming shakedown cruise was to be a submerged world circumnavigation, code-named Operation Sandblast, which would generally follow the track of the first [[Ferdinand Magellan#Voyage of circumnavigation|circumnavigation in 1519–1522 led by Ferdinand Magellan]]. ''Triton'' would depart as scheduled on 16 February, and the submarine would arrive back home no later than 10 May 1960.  The mission objectives for Operation Sandblast were summarized below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.&lt;ref name=FirstB5/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Captain Beach, the Navy came up with the [[code name]] of ''Sandblast'' because it was judged that taking his ship around the world submerged would "take a lot of sand" on the crew's part to be successful.  Also, ''Sand'' served as Beach's personal code name during the mission.  As the captain noted:  "Most beaches are full of sand, I was informed."&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', pp. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission preparations===
[[File:USS Triton Loadingfood.jpg|thumb|right|Loading ship's stores|alt=U.S. Navy enlisted man lifting a bag of potatoes surrounded with other bag and cases of food in a submarine torpedo room.]]
Beach and Henry arrived back in New London at 5:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 5 February. Later that morning, after breakfast, Beach briefed his officers, whom Beach had insisted needed to know, about their new shakedown orders and the mission objectives for Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=WellAroundtheWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-5 to B-6, B-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 50"&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. ix–x, Chapter 3, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The officers and crew of ''Triton'' had just 12 days to complete preparations for their much more ambitious, but top secret, shakedown cruise. With the exception of Chief Quartermaster (QMC) William J. Marshall, the enlisted personnel did not initially know the true nature of their upcoming mission.&lt;ref name="Beach. p. 50"&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cover story was devised that, following the shakedown cruise, ''Triton'' would proceed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] to undergo additional testing required by BuShips. The crew and civilian personnel were also instructed to file their [[Income tax in the United States|federal income taxes]] early and take care of all other personal finances that might arise through mid-May.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-5 to B-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 47–48, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lt. Commander]] Will M. Adams, ''Triton''{{'}}s [[executive officer]], and Lt. Commander Robert W. Bulmer, her operations officer, along with Chief Quartermaster Marshall, prepared the precise, mile-by-mile track of their upcoming voyage in the secure chart room, located at &lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt; headquarters.&lt;ref name="Beach. p. 50"/&gt;  Lt. Commander Robert D. Fisher, ''Triton''{{'}}s supply officer, coordinated loading of stores sufficient for a 120-day voyage ''(pictured)''. Eventually, some {{convert|77613|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of food were loaded on board, including {{convert|16487|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of frozen food, {{convert|6631|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of canned meat, {{convert|1300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of coffee, and {{convert|1285|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vice Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]], the head of the [[Naval Reactors|U.S. Navy's Naval Reactors branch]], sent special power-setting instructions for ''Triton''{{'}}s reactors, allowing them to operate with greater flexibility and a higher safety factor.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key personnel change occurred on 2 February when ''Triton''{{'}}s veteran chief engineering officer, Lt. Commander Leslie D. Kelly, left for duty at the Rickover's Naval Reactors branch of the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]. His relief was his former assistant engineering officer, Lt. Commander Donald G. Fears.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. ix–x, Chapter 3, pp. 44, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a number of [[Supercargo|supercargo personnel]] joined ''Triton'' for her shakedown cruise, with none aware of the top-secret nature of Operation Sandblast.  Joseph Baynor Roberts was a well-known [[photographer]] from the [[National Geographic Magazine|''National Geographic'' Magazine]], and as a Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve, he was recalled to active duty to serve as the [[press pool]] for the voyage with the [[Public affairs (military)|U.S. Navy Office of Information]].  Additionally, Roberts and First Class Photographer's Mate (PH1) William R. Hadley, USN, detached from [[Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], coordinated the photo-reconnaissance aspects of Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name="Largess185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 113 - 114"&gt;Beach.

The other civilian personnel included [[PhD|Dr.]]  Benjamin B. Weybrew, a [[psychologist]] at [[Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory|U.S Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory]], would carry out a battery of psychological studies with volunteers from the crew.  [[Geophysicist]] Michael Smalet, [[civil engineer]] Gordon E. Wilkes, and [[oceanographer]] Nicholas R. Mabry coordinated the various scientific and technical aspects of Operation Sandblast for the [[Naval Oceanographic Office|U.S. Navy's Hydrographic Office]].  Eldon C. Good monitored the [[Inertial navigation system|Ship Inertial Navigation System (SINS)]] prototype, newly installed onboard ''Triton'' by the [[Sperry Corporation#Sperry Rand|Sperry Gyroscopic Company]].

McConnell was the Electric Boat [[guaranty]] representative assigned to ''Triton''{{'}}s shakedown cruise.&lt;ref name="Largess185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 113 - 114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo 587–589, 606–606 "/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dempewolffe |first= Richard F. |date=February 1960 |title= This Makes the Torpedo Child's Play |journal= [[Popular Mechanics]] |volume= 113 |issue= 2 |pages= 248–250 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=S9sDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA248&amp;lpg=RA1-PA248&amp;dq=sperry+%22ship+inertial+navigation+system%22+1960#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-07-06 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 1960, ''Triton'' went to sea to do a final check of all shipboard equipment. Except for a malfunctioning wave-motion sensor, ''Triton'' was deemed ready for her shakedown cruise.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' departed New London on 16 February 1960 for what was announced as her shakedown cruise ''(pictured)''.  ''Triton'' set course to the south-east (134 degrees true).&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-7.&lt;/ref&gt; At dawn on 17 February, ''Triton'' performed her first morning star-sighting using the built-in [[sextant]] in her No. 1 periscope during the nightly ventilation of the shipboard atmosphere. The inboard induction valve was closed after the removal of a rusted flashlight that had prevented its closure.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-7 to B-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 84–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Beach announced the true nature of their shakedown cruise ''(pictured)'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men, I know you’ve all been waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I can tell you that we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 89-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the upcoming voyage, Beach adopted a decidedly non-traditional command style:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early on, I realized that what this particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch.  Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction.  Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications was not a problem — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be.  My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us.  It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up.  This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the shakedown cruise, Beach adopted a specific weekly shipboard routine.  Mondays and Tuesdays involved regular activities, with drills, lectures, school of the ship, and class programs from the noon to 1600 watch.  Wednesdays had the crew on reduced activities that is traditionally known as Rope Yarn Sunday.  Thursdays saw a schedule of regular drills, and Fridays involved upkeep and general maintenance activities known as Field Day.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saturdays had regular activities with afternoon drills, and Sundays had reduced activities with normal watches and religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, beginning on 17 February during the [[Watchstanding|mid watch]], ''Triton'' came to periscope depth to take a nightly fix using the built-in sextant in her celestial periscope, ventilate and replenish her shipboard atmosphere using the [[submarine snorkel|snorkel]], and dispose of any shipboard garbage.  Since ''Triton'' did not have a generator to extract oxygen from sea water, these nightly snorkeling activities were crucial to maintaining a suitable atmosphere.

Later that same day, 17 February 1960, ''Triton'' experienced a serious leak with a main condenser circulating water pump, and a reactor warning alarm tripped because of a defective electrical connection. Both incidents were handled successfully and did not affect the ship's performance.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February ''Triton'' conducted her first general daily drill and on 19 February released her first twice-daily hydrographic bottles, used to study ocean current patterns.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-9 to B-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on 19 February, shipboard sensors detected a radiation leak.  It was subsequently determined the [[radium]] dials on three wristwatches were the cause for the alarm, and once removed, no radiation was detected for the balance of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Hadley | first= William | title= Nuclear power's danger exaggerated | url= http://www.yumasun.com/opinion/power-55822-nuclear-radiation.html | date= January 28, 2010 | work= Letters to the editor | publisher= [[Yuma Sun]] | accessdate= 2010-11-11 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100417181450/http://www.yumasun.com/opinion/power-55822-nuclear-radiation.html# | archive-date= 2010-04-17 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 February, ''Triton'' detected a previously uncharted [[seamount]] with her [[fathometer]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation, p. B-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach maintained that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seemingly mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I had a field day every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object."  To remove trash without surfacing, ''Triton'' had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship.  However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.&lt;ref name=WellAroundtheWorld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-10 to B-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 94–96; 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February, ''Triton'' made her first landfall, reaching [[St. Peter and Paul Rocks]] ''(pictured)'' after traveling {{convert|3250|nmi|km mi}}. The Rocks served as the home plate for ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged circumnavigation. Photographic reconnaissance was carried out by Lt. Richard M. Harris, the CIC/ECM officer, and Chief Cryptologic Technician (CTC) William R. Hadley, who served as the ship's secondary photo-recon team for the voyage.  ''Triton'' turned south and crossed the [[equator]] for the first time later that day, passing into the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with ship's personnel participating in the [[Line-crossing ceremony|crossing the line ceremony]] ''(pictured)''.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-16 to B-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 102–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destination: Cape Horn===

Beach dressed in khaki uniform and ceremonial sword; Chief Loyd Garlock dressed as King Neptune, Ruler of the Raging Main; crewman Ross MacGregor dressed as Davy Jones in background; and crewman Harry Olsen dressed as the Royal Baby.]]
On 1 March 1960, as ''Triton'' passed along the east coast of South America, a trio of crises threatened to end Operation Sandblast prematurely. The first was when Chief Radarman (RDC) John R. Poole began suffering from a series of [[kidney stone]]s.  The second was when the ship's fathometer went out of commission, with its loss meaning ''Triton'' could no longer echo-sound the sea floor, increasing the danger of grounding or collision as the ship traveled through poorly charted waters.  Captain Beach observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fortunately at the present time we are in an area where the water is deeper than normal for the Atlantic and for a number of hours there is [no] worry about unexpectedly scraping the top of any unsuspected submerged peak.  But we will want that fathometer badly as we approach Cape Horn.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps most critically, the third problem involved the readings on one of the reactors indicating a serious malfunction which required its shutdown. As Captain Beach noted, "So far as ''Triton'' and the first of March were concerned, it seemed that troubles were not confined to pairs. On that day we were to have them in threes."&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his electronics technician team returned the fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and ''Triton''{{'}}s engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, ''Triton'' continued south, although there was a detour to the [[Golfo Nuevo]] region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the [[Argentine Navy]] had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but ''Triton''{{'}}s contact turned out to be a school of fish.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-22 to B-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beach. p. 116-140"&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 116–140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939605,00.html |title= ARGENTINA: The Ping in Golfo Nuevo |accessdate=24 February 2010 |work= [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] |publisher= [[Time Inc.]] |date= 22 February 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March, ''Triton'' located the [[Falkland Islands]] on her radar and prepared to conduct [[photoreconnaissance]] of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley Harbor]]. Before they could visually sight the islands, Poole's condition worsened so much that–taking a calculated risk–Captain Beach reversed course, ordered [[flank speed]], and sent a radio message to headquarters describing the situation.&lt;ref name="Beach. p. 116-140"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-24 to B-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the ship's log on that date, Beach noted:
[[File:Capehorn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cape Horn]] (7 March 1960)|alt=Capt Horn as seen from the periscope of the nuclear submarine USS ''Triton'' is a rugged, jagged-edge mountainous rock formation rising above heavy sea swells under a stormy sky.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the control and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, carrying out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands are aware of the decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved that they did not have to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation'' 1960, p. B-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fortunately, the [[Baltimore class cruiser|heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Macon|CA-132|2}}, with Captain Reuben T. Whitaker in command, had been on a good-will cruise to South American ports since January as the flagship for Rear Admiral Edward C. Stephan, Commander Naval Forces South Atlantic (Task Force 138).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Macon | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m1/macon.htm | accessdate = 2010-02-24 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5hPuXmOeF?url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m1/macon.htm | archivedate = 2009-06-10| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-24 to B-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Macon'' had been in Argentine waters in conjunction with US President Eisenhower's visit to Argentina from 26–29 February 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/prestravels/ptravel2.html#eisenhower |title= Dwight D.

''Triton'' broached, exposing only her [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] while preserving the submarine's submerged status. A boat-handling party led by Lieutenant George A. Sawyer, the ship's gunnery officer, transferred Poole to the waiting whaleboat, which then returned to ''Macon''. Poole was the only crew member who did not complete the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation'' 1960, pp. B-26 to B-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 142–158.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Radarman Poole was subsequently examined by both the doctors aboard ''Macon'' and at a hospital in Montevideo, but his third attack of kidney stones, which prompted his transfer off ''Triton'', proved to be his last–and he did not require kidney surgery.&lt;ref name=Beach291&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged,'' p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rendezvous, ''Triton'' dove and turned back southwards. She subsequently passed west of the Falklands, and rounded Cape Horn ''(pictured)'' through [[Estrecho de le Maire]] ([[Drake Passage]]) on 7 March. Captain Beach described his first impressions of this legendary lands-end of the Western Hemisphere as "bold and forbidding, like the sway-backed profile of some prehistoric sea monster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=[[National Geographic Society|''National Geographic'']] |volume=118 |issue=5 |page=593 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Beach allowed all the crew an opportunity to view Cape Horn through the ship's periscope, requiring five reverses of ''Triton''{{'}}s course to keep the cape in sight.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation'' 1960, pp. B-30 to B-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 159–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Across the Pacific===

On 7 March, ''Triton'' entered the [[Pacific Ocean]] and passed into the operational control of Rear Admiral [[Roy S. Benson]],&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 1011.&lt;/ref&gt; Commander Submarine Force U.S. Pacific Fleet (&lt;small&gt;COMSUBPAC&lt;/small&gt;), who had been Captain Beach's commanding officer while he served on the [[Gato class submarine|fleet submarine]] {{USS|Trigger|SS-237|3}} in the [[Pacific War]]. ''Triton''{{'}}s first Pacific visual landfall was [[Easter Island]], some {{convert|2500|nmi|km mi}} away.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-30 to B-31, B-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March, ''Triton'' detected a [[seamount]], registering a minimum depth of {{convert|350|fathom|m ft}}, with a total height of {{convert|7000|ft|m}} above the ocean floor. Also on that day, ''Triton'' successfully conducted a drill simulating the emergency shutdown of both her reactors and loss of all power.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-31 to B-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 163–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, the starboard propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged to contain the leak.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 171–175.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's [[Submarine hull#Pressure hull|pressure hull]], it could not be repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, ''Triton'' could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to ''Triton''{{'}}s fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.&lt;ref name=Beach291/&gt;

An alternative to the fathometer was devised involving the use of the ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the combat intelligence center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the fathometer to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor.&lt;ref name=Beach17579&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 175–179.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 March, ''Triton'' detected a submerged peak using active sonar and the gravity meter that confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.&lt;ref name=Beach17579/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' next spotted [[Easter Island]] on that same day, 13 March 1960, first by radar, then by periscope. The northeastern coast of the island was photographed for two and a half hours before the statue that [[Thor Heyerdahl]] had erected was spotted. The entire crew was invited to observe through the periscope before ''Triton'' departed for her next visual landfall–[[Guam]], some {{convert|6734|nmi|km mi}} distant.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-33 to B-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A malfunctioning air compressor was repaired on 17 March.  The repair required the complete re-wiring of the compressor's armature, a task ordinarily done aboard a [[submarine tender]] or in a shipyard. Captain Beach was deeply impressed by "this spirit and outlook [that] permeated our crew."  He was also "astonished" by two different makeshift fathometer sound transmitters created by the electronics and engineering crewmen. One was based on a general announcing speaker, while the other used a stainless steel cooking pot from the galley, with stainless steel rods and copper wiring. Beach noted in the ship's log: "I could only marvel at the ingenuity of the American sailor."&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 182–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March, ''Triton'' detected another submerged peak, using its sonar and gravity meter, and crossed the equator a second time–passing into the [[Northern Hemisphere]] again. Another submerged peak was successfully detected on 20 March.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-35 to B-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that day, ''Triton'' made her closest approach to [[Pearl Harbor]], and the crew celebrated with a [[luau]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beach18788&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] on 23 March, losing 24 March from her calendar. The next day, sonar indicated another rise from the ocean floor, previously uncharted, logged with a depth of {{convert|350|fathom|m ft}}.&lt;ref name=Beach18788/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, 27 March, ''Triton'' passed the point of closest approach to the location where [[USS Triton (SS-201)|her namesake]] was lost during [[World War II]], and a memorial service was held to commemorate the occasion. A submerged [[Salute#Naval cannon fire|naval gun salute]] was fired to honor the lost crew when three water slugs were shot in quick succession from the forward torpedo tubes.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-39 to B-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 28 March, ''Triton'' spotted Guam and observed activity on shore via her periscope. Petty Officer Edward Carbullido ''(pictured)'', who had been born on Guam but had not returned home for 14 years, was asked to identify his parents' house through the periscope while the boat remained submerged in Agat Bay. ''Triton'' then changed course for the [[Philippines]], the midpoint of her around-the-world voyage.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-40 to B-B-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 195-201.&lt;/ref&gt; Carbullido was subsequently able to go home to Guam for [[Christmas Day]] 1960 on a 60-day leave, with the cost of his flight paid for by selling a magazine article on ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation written by Captain Beach, and with the assistance of [[Pan American Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged,'' pp. 201, 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Beach subsequently wrote an account of Carbullido's visit for the November 1961 issue of ''[[American Legion|The American Legion Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |date=November 1961 |title=Two Trips to Guam |journal=''[[American Legion|The American Legion Magazine]]'' |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=20–21, 50 |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanlegionma715amer/americanlegionma715amer_djvu.txt |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
On 31 March, ''Triton'' crossed over the [[Philippine Trench]] and began threading her way through the vast [[Philippines|Philippine archipelago]], passing from the [[Philippine Sea]] through the [[Surigao Strait]] and then the [[Mindanao Sea]], and finally through the [[Bohol Strait]] into the [[Camotes Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special water sample was taken during ''Triton''{{'}}s transit of Surigao Strait; its recipient was the retired Vice Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]], the task force commander whose battleships had defeated the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Southern Force]] during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The Battle of Surigao Strait .2825 October.29|Battle of Surigao Strait]], history's last naval action fought between battleships, during World War II. Captain Beach observed, "We think that Admiral Oldendorf will appreciate a sample of this body of water."&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-45 to B-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April, ''Triton'' spotted [[Mactan Island]], and shortly before noon, sighted the [[Magellan shrine|monument]] (''pictured'') commemorating the death of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] at that site, thereby reaching the midpoint of her circumnavigation.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-46 to B-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 205–217.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Ordinarily a leader given to the most meticulous preparations for any important undertaking, one who personally checked every item and left no stone unturned in his effort to eliminate any possible cause of failure, Magellan's every action during this entire episode ... might almost have been calculated with the intention of seeking defeat. Such was the height of his religious fervor that divine intervention was expected as a matter of course. God, having brought him this far, would not forsake him now. So much have thought Magellan in the height of his exaltation, forgetting entirely that God is not bound by the conventions of man's thought.|Captain Edward L. Beach on Magellan and his demise|&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later that same day, [[April Fool's Day]], ''Triton'' was sighted by the only unauthorized person to spot the submarine during her top secret voyage–a young Filipino man in a small dugout canoe (''pictured'') about {{convert|50|yd|m}} off ''Triton''’s beam, staring at her raised periscope. Captain Beach later recorded his reactions to this unexpected encounter in his log:

{{quote|It is a ludicrous situation: On one hand an impassive Asian, staring with curious concentration at an unusual object in the water; on the other, a U.S. Navy officer, equipped with all technical devices money and science can procure, looking back with equally studied concentration. On one end of the periscope, an outrigger canoe propelled by the brawny arms of its builder; on the other end, a $100,000,000 submarine, the newest, biggest, most powerful in the world, on a history-making voyage.

The noted photographer Joseph Baynor Roberts of ''National Geographic'' magazine was able to snap several photos of this unexpected interloper ''(pictured)'' through the ship's periscope before ''Triton'' moved out of range. The November 1960 issue identified the fisherman as 19-year-old Rufino Baring of [[Mactan Island|Punta Engano, Mactan Island]], who believed he had encountered a sea monster: "I was very frightened. I tried to get away as fast as I could."&lt;ref name=LanceStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tricity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=585–615 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Terrified fisherman thought ''Triton'' a sea monster," ''National Geographic Magazine'' (November 1960) p. 602&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged,'' pp. 291–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on the afternoon of 1 April, ''Triton'' proceeded through [[Hilutangan Channel]] into the [[Sulu Sea]] ''via'' [[Bohol Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-50 to B-57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 217–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April, ''Triton''{{'}}s [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] [[repeater]]s, used to maintain the ship's [[Bearing (navigation)|navigational bearing]], began to experience sudden, severe [[oscillation]]s, possibly caused by a malfunctioning [[synchro]] [[Servomechanism|amplifier]].  The helm was shifted to direct gyro input, the synchro amplifiers were checked out, and the gyroscopic repeaters appeared to return to normal function.  Later, while transiting the Pearl Bank Passage, a narrow channel lined with [[coral reefs]], a periscope observation determined that ''Triton'' was off course, indicating a potentially hazardous helm error.  Steering control was immediately shifted to the control room, with the helm using the master gyroscopic repeater. While the malfunction was detected in time and the ship was not in any immediate danger, the loss of navigational bearing could have been catastrophic, with Captain Beach noting that "the episode had a sobering effect."&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-57 to B-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 221–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton''  then proceeded through the [[Sibutu Passage]] into the [[Celebes Sea]], leaving Philippine waters, and subsequently entered [[Makassar Strait]], crossing the equator a third time, on 3 April, and then, during 4 April, transited the [[Flores Sea]], bound for Lombok Strait, the gateway to the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-59 to B-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Ocean===
On 5 April, ''Triton'' entered the [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Lombok Strait]]. The transition proved dramatic. The change in [[salinity]] and density of the seawater caused her to dive abruptly from periscope depth to {{convert|125|ft|m}} in about 40&amp;nbsp;seconds. Captain Beach noted, "I had experienced changes in water density many times before, but never one of this magnitude." ''Triton'' returned to periscope depth and subsequently entered the [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-60 to B-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 227–232.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Operation Sandblast Navigators.JPG|thumb|right|''Triton''{{'}}s navigators|alt=Three naval officer plotting the submerged course of the nuclear submarine ''Triton'', with Captain Beach seated before chart in the center, with Lt. Commander Will M. Adams standing at right holding a pair of dividers and Lt. Commander Robert W. Bulmer standing at the left holding a pencil, and an unidentified individual seated in the background.]]
While crossing the Indian Ocean, ''Triton'' conducted a sealed-ship experiment. Beginning 10 April, rather than refreshing the air in the ship by snorkeling each night, she remained sealed, using compressed air to make up for consumed [[oxygen]], as well as burning "[[oxygen candle]]s" to replenish the ship's atmosphere. Also, starting on 15 April, the smoking lamp was extinguished, with no [[tobacco smoking]] permitted anywhere aboard the ship.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-64 to B-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 233–244, 249–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this smoking ban, Dr. Benjamin Weybrew carried out a battery of tests on crew volunteers, both smokers and non-smokers, to measure cardiovascular functions and psychological stress indices to determine the effects that the prohibition of tobacco had on individual and group performance of the test subjects.  The objective of this experiment was to determine the advisability of prohibiting the use of tobacco from submarine operations given the extended submerged duration of missions involving nuclear-powered submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test results determined that smokers showed consistently higher mean oral temperature and [[Pulse|pulse rate]], both at rest and following exercises, as well as significantly increased pulse rates over non-smokers, a marked decrease in alertness, and an increase in [[Insomnia|insomnia symptoms]].  However, there was no significant difference in [[blood pressure]] between smokers and non-smokers.  Finally, smokers experienced "debilitative performance decrements" during the smoking prohibition, and as a consequence, this also affected the morale of non-smokers, both among the participants in the experiment as well as non-participants.  Dr. Weybrew concluded smoking should be avoided because of its attendant health and relational issues, and not smoking enhances one's overall stress coping capacity (SCC).&lt;ref&gt;Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web | author= David Collins | title= A 1960 submarine smoking ban lasted just three days | url= http://www.theday.com/article/20100416/NWS05/304169857 | publisher= [[The Day (New London)|The Day]] | date= April 16, 2010 | accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1963 convention of the Cigar Institute of America, Weybrew noted: "When a smoker is forbidden to smoke he just doesn't like it.  The smokers in the test got irritable, ate too much, had trouble sleeping, and personal relationships began to deteriorate."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It took nearly another half-century for the Navy to ban smoking aboard subs. On 8 April 2010, the U.S. Navy announced a permanent smoking ban onboard submarines effective 31 December 2010.{{cite web | author= Lance M. Bacon | title= SubFor: Smoking on subs to end by Dec. 31 | url= http://www.navytimes.com/news/2010/04/navy_sub_smoking_ban_040810w/ | work= Navy Times | date= April 10, 2010 | accessdate= 2010-05-21 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Easter]] Sunday, 17 April, ''Triton'' sighted the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and subsequently re-entered the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], returning to the command authority of Rear Admiral Lawrence R. Daspit (&lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-68 to B-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 244-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The return to the St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks===
[[File:Surfacing off Cadiz USS Triton 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Off Cadiz, Spain (2 May 1960)|alt=Port side view of the sail and forward deck of the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' breaking the surface of the ocean near Cadiz, Spain, with hull number 586 visible on its sail.]]

The smoking lamp was re-lit on 18 April, with the three days of prohibition having taken a noticeable toll on crew morale.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than passing the word in a traditional manner, Captain Beach demonstrated the lifting of the ban by walking through the ship smoking a [[cigar]], blowing smoke in people's faces, and asking, "Don't you wish you could do this?" He recorded in his log that "it took some 37&amp;nbsp;seconds for the word to get around."  On 20 April 1960, ''Triton'' crossed the [[Prime Meridian]], and on 24 April, the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-60 to B-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 247–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day that the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated, 24 April 1960, ''Triton'' experienced a major equipment failure.  In the after torpedo room, a hydraulic line to the stern plane mechanism burst.  Through the prompt action by Torpedoman's Mate Third Class Allen W. Steele, aided by Engineman Third Class Arlan F. Martin, this potentially catastrophic event was successfully contained. Eventually, the main hydraulic system was restored with a control valve from the steering system, but the boat's steering controls remained on emergency mode for the rest of the voyage. It was subsequently determined that the pipe burst was caused by a fractured valve.  For his quick and decisive actions in handling this emergency, Steele was presented the [[Commendation Ribbon|Navy Commendation Medal]].&lt;ref name="72-73"&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-72 to B-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 254-257, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April, ''Triton'' crossed the Equator a final time, re-entering the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and shortly thereafter, she sighted the [[St. Peter and Paul Rocks]], completing the first submerged [[circumnavigation]]. As Captain Beach wrote, "We are not yet home, but we may be considered to have taken a long lead off third base."&lt;ref name="72-73"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 257–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeward bound===

During 28–29 April, ''Triton'' conducted engineering drills, then proceeded to [[Tenerife]], the [[Canary Islands]], arriving on 30 April, and thereafter setting course for [[Cadiz]], Spain, to complete two additional goals of Operation Sandblast. One was to honor the seaport where Ferdinand Magellan set sail from in 1519 to initiate the first global maritime circumnavigation, and the other was to deliver a plaque created to honor Magellan's and ''Triton''{{'}}s historic voyages when ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} off Cadiz on 2 May 1960.&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 263"&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 263–267, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterward, Beach noted, "We are on the last leg of our trip enroute to the United States."&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-76 to B-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 260–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' returned to the United States, surfacing off the coast of [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]], on 10 May 1960. Captain Beach was flown by helicopter (''pictured'') to Washington, D.C., where news of ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged around-the-world voyage was announced by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]  at the White House, with Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, known as the "Father of the Nuclear Navy", in attendance. Beach flew back to his boat later that day, and ''Triton'' arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 11 May 1960, completing her shakedown cruise and the first submarine circumnavigation of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

==Mission accomplishments==
{{Quotation|''Triton''{{'}}s globe-girdling cruise proved invaluable to the United States. Politically, it enhanced the nation's prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit capabilities of the first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data.&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Triton | url = https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/triton-v.html | accessdate = 2010-02-24|link=off}}&lt;/ref&gt;|''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''}}

When Tully made inquiries regarding inconsistencies pertaining to the fastest motorized maritime circumnavition record, the Guinness World Records  response was:  "If the US Department of Defense would care to present us with all the facts, we'll look at it again."&lt;ref name=Posiedon16&gt;''Confronting Poseidon'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tully noted that this information had been publicly available since the publication of ''Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton'', Captain Beach's 1962 account of Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=Beachappendix/&gt;&lt;ref name=Posiedon15/&gt;  Arguably, ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation remains the fastest for a motorized sea vessel, beating ''Cable &amp; Wireless Adventurer''{{'}}s 1998 74-day voyage and [[MY Ady Gil|''Earthrace{{'}}s]] 2008 circumnavigation of 60 days, 23 hours, and 49&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=Posiedon15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/content/outside/singlepage.asp?fid=871&amp;pno=1|title=Earthrace!|date=June 2007|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122011707/http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/content/outside/singlepage.asp?fid=871&amp;pno=1|archivedate=January 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific &amp; national security accomplishments===
Operation Sandblast gathered extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, and geophysical data.  Water samples were taken throughout ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation, which were tested for differences in chemical composition, salinity, density, and temperature. Such samples were vital for submarine operations. Water salinity and density affects submerged trim, as well as sonar performance, while warmer water affects the efficiency of shipboard condensers and, consequently, ship speed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Measurements from the installed gravity meter provided a continuous record of variations in earth's gravity field throughout ''Triton''{{'}}s circumnavigation. This extensive gravity study assisted the Navy in developing navigational aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=National Geographic|volume=118 |issue=5 |page=594 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 144 hydrographic bottles to track ocean currents were released during Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'' p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Triton'' mapped uncharted seamounts, coral reefs, and other submerged topographic structures using its fathometer and sonar systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These scientific data gathered during Operation Sandblast continued to be invaluable in providing information on oceanic changes, with Sydney Levitus, the director of [[NOAA|NOAA's Ocean Climate Laboratory]] in Silver Spring, Maryland, characterizing ''Triton''{{'}}s data (''pictured'') as being "a very exciting set of observations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Richard Harris | title= Ship Logs Help Scientists Trace Oceans' Warming | url= http://www.vpr.net/npr/126476624/ | work= VPR News | publisher= [[Vermont Public Radio]] | date= 6 May 2010| accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Richard Harris | title= Ship Logs Help Scientists Trace Oceans' Warming | url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126476624 | publisher= [[National Public Radio]] | date= 6 May 2010 | accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Sandblast also proved nuclear-powered submarines could undertake extended operations independent of any external support. Specifically, ''Triton'' tested a prototype [[Inertial navigation system|ship inertial navigational system]] (SINS) for submarine use, as well as being the first submarine to test the floating [[VLF#Details of VLF submarine communication methods|very low frequency]] (VLF) communications buoy system, with both systems being vital for the Navy's upcoming [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] fleet ballistic missile submarines (FBM) deterrence patrols. Finally, the psychological testing of ''Triton''{{'}}s crew members to determine the effects of long-term isolation was particularly relevant for the initial deployment of the [[George Washington class submarine|Navy's fleet ballistic missile submarines]], as well as NASA's upcoming manned space program, [[Project Mercury]], with MIT engineers assuring NASA "that getting to the moon and back was simpler than guiding an [[antiballistic missile]] or circumnavigating the earth under water in a nuclear submarine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beach |first=Edward L. |authorlink=|date=November 1960 |title=''Triton'' Follows Magellan's Wake |journal=National Geographic|volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=614–615 |id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aquilinefocus.blogspot.com/2008/12/psychological-officers-submarine-part-2.html |title= Submarine - Part 2  |accessdate=2009-01-20 |work= Psychological Officers |publisher=Molten Eagle |date=December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Gruntman.

In his 2000 book ''Ships Of Discovery And Exploration'', historian Lincoln P. Paine further summarized the true accomplishment of Operation Sandblast:

{{quote|Although the voyage had been conceived as a way for [[Dwight D.

===Promotions and qualifications===
On 11 April 1960, the chief petty officers Hugh M. Bennett, Jr.; Joseph H. Blair, Jr.; Harry W. Hampson; Herbert F. Hardman; and Lynn S. Loveland were announced for promotion to [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] and moved into the [[ward room]].&lt;ref name=BeachB-66&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on that date, the first-class petty officers George M. Bloomingdale; Richard R. Fickel; Joseph R. Flasco; Gene R. Hoke; Lonard F. Lehman; George W. Mather; J. C. Meaders; Russell F. Pion; Gerald R. Stott; and Robert R. Tambling were promoted to Chief Petty Officers and moved in the [[Goat locker|Chiefs' Quarters]].&lt;ref name=BeachB-66/&gt;

Executive Officer Will Mont Adams, Jr., received notice of his promotion to full Commander on 30 April 1960, his birthday, effective 1 February 1960.&lt;ref name=Beach76&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on that date, Chief Engineering Officer Donald Gene Fears was promoted to Lieutenant Commander, effective 1 February 1960.&lt;ref name=Beach76/&gt;

==Mission legacy==

{{Quotation|The epochal achievement of the fleet of Magellan in circumnavigating the globe was echoed in the magnificent accomplishment by the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' in 1960.  Like the voyage of Magellan, that of the ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that thru the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven thru the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dibner. ''Victoria and Triton''. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;|Bern Dibner (1964)}}

===Triton Plaque===
[[File:Magellan-Triton.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Triton Plaque|alt=A round brass metal object features a sailing ship in the center over the U.S. Navy submarine service chest insignia of a dolphin and framed in a laurel wreath. In a circle around the edges are the Latin words "Ave Nobilis Dux, Iterum Factum Est" which translates to "Hail Noble Captain, It is Done Again."]]

In the eight days prior to ''Triton''{{'}}s departure on her around-the-world submerged voyage, Captain Beach approached Lt. Tom B. Thamm, ''Triton''{{'}}s Auxiliary Division Officer, to design a commemorative plaque for their upcoming voyage, as well as the first circumnavigation led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref name=Beach5556&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 55–56, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque's eventual design consisted of a [[brass]] disk about {{convert|23|in|cm}} in diameter, bearing a sailing ship reminiscent of Magellan's carrack, ''Trinidad'', above the [[Submarine Warfare insignia|submarine dolphin insignia]] with the years 1519 and 1960 between them, all within a [[laurel wreath]]. Outside the wreath is the motto &lt;tt&gt;AVE NOBILIS DUX, ITERUM FACTUM EST&lt;/tt&gt; ("Hail Noble Captain, It Is Done Again").&lt;ref name=Beach5556/&gt;

Commodore Tom Henry, commanding Submarine Squadron 10, supervised the completion of the plaque. The carving of the wooden form was done by retired Chief Electrician's Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.&lt;ref name=Beach5556/&gt;

During the homeward leg of her around-the-world voyage, ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} on 2 May 1960 off [[Cadiz]], Spain, the departure point for Magellan's earlier voyage. ''Triton'' broached, and ''Weeks'' transferred the finished plaque to ''Triton'' for transport back to the United States. The plaque was subsequently presented to the Spanish government by [[John Davis Lodge]], the United States Ambassador to Spain. This plaque is located at the City Hall in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, and it is mounted on the wall of the city hall with a marble slab memorializing the 1960 ''Triton'' submerged circumnavigation.&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 263"/&gt;

Duplicates of the Triton Plaque were also presented to the [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in [[Mystic, Connecticut]], and the [[Naval Historical Association]] in Washington, D.C., as well as the [[U.S. Navy Submarine School]] and the U.S. Navy [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]], both located in Groton, Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Beach. pp. 263"/&gt;

Triton Light is a [[lighthouse|navigational beacon]] on the seawall of the [[United States Naval Academy|United States Naval Academy (USNA)]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] meets Spa Creek and the Annapolis harbor. It was donated to the Academy and named for the Greek god by the [[United States Naval Academy]] Class of 1945. The crew of ''Triton'' provided samples of water taken from the 22 [[sea]]s through which their ship had passed during their submerged 1960 circumnavigation, which were used to fill a globe built into the [[Triton Light]] along with a commemorative marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0003244.htm |title=Triton Light Pictures |accessdate=2008-09-13 |work= Historical Marker Database |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USS ''Triton'' Submarine Memorial Park is located along the [[Columbia River]] in Washington. Its purpose is "to establish a permanent park in north Richland in recognition of all the decommissioned reactor cores off-loaded at the Port’s barge slip, transported and stored at the [[Hanford Site]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Triton Sail| url=http://www.prosser.org/media/Port%20of%20Benton%2009Fall.pdf| format=PDF| work=The re: Port of Benton| publisher=Port of Benton| date=Fall 2009| accessdate=2010-02-11| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5niucuKXZ?url=http://www.prosser.org/media/Port%20of%20Benton%2009Fall.pdf| archivedate=2010-02-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park features ''Triton''{{'}}s [[sail (submarine)|sail superstructure]] (''pictured'') and eventually an information display on the history of ''Triton''. The park also serves as a tourist attraction, especially due to its location, since Hanford is the resting place of spent reactor cores from several Navy ships. The park's tentative location is at the end of Port of Benton Boulevard in north [[Richland, Washington]]. Planning called for ''Triton'''s sail to be cut up for transport and re-assembly at the park site.

The legacy of Operation Sandblast on its 50th anniversary was summarized by retired Captain James C. Hay, who had served on ''Triton'' during its historic submerged around-the-world voyage.  On the editorial page of the April 2010 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is truly a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|skipper's]] ''tenacity''.  More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at anytime, and do what ever was required.  It's a good [[Nautical fiction|sea story]] about doing what had to be done.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's a good thing to do to re-read about one of the forerunners of all we've done since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= James C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">[[File:Preparing absinthe.jpg|thumb|The ''louche'' of [[absinthe]] is an instance of the ouzo effect]]

The '''ouzo effect''' (also '''louche''' or '''spontaneous emulsification''') is a cloudy (''[[wikt:louche#French|louche]]'') oil-in-water [[emulsion]] that is formed when water is added to [[ouzo]] and other [[:Category:Anise liqueurs and spirits|anise-flavored liqueurs and spirits]], such as [[pastis]], [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|rakı]], [[Arak (distilled beverage)|arak]], [[sambuca]] and [[absinthe]]. Such microemulsions occur with only minimal mixing and are highly stable.&lt;ref name="Sitnikova+2005" /&gt;

== Observation and explanation ==
[[File:Glassofarak en.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arak (drink)|Arak]] with water and ice]]
The ouzo effect occurs when a strongly [[hydrophobic]] [[essential oil]] such as [[anethole|''trans''-anethole]] is dissolved in a water-[[Miscibility|miscible]] [[solvent]], such as [[ethanol]], and the concentration of ethanol is lowered by addition of small amounts of water.&lt;ref name="Sanchez-Dominguez Rodriguez-Abreu 2016 p. 369"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil-in-water [[emulsion]]s are not normally stable. Oil droplets [[Coalescence (chemistry)|coalesce]] until complete phase separation is achieved at [[macroscopic]] levels. Addition of a small amount of [[surfactant]] or the application of high [[shear rate]]s (strong stirring) can stabilize the oil droplets.

In a water-rich ouzo mixture the droplet coalescence is dramatically slowed without mechanical agitation, dispersing agents, or surfactants. It forms a stable homogeneous fluid [[Dispersion (materials science)|dispersion]] by liquid-liquid [[nucleation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the droplets of oil in the emulsion grow by [[Ostwald ripening]], and that droplets do not coalesce. The Ostwald ripening rate is observed to diminish with increasing ethanol concentrations until the droplets stabilize in size with an average diameter of {{gaps|3|microns}}.

Based on thermodynamic considerations of the multi-component mixture, the emulsion derives its stability from trapping between the binodal and [[spinodal]] curves in the [[phase diagram]].&lt;ref name=grillo /&gt; However, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the observed slowing of Ostwald ripening rates at increasing ethanol concentrations appear not fully understood.

== Applications ==
[[File:Louche effect grapefruit-cello.webm|thumb|Video of water being poured into a solution of 151-proof [[Everclear (alcohol)|Everclear]] and essential oils from [[grapefruit]] rinds.]]
Emulsions have many commercial uses. A large range of prepared food products, [[detergent]]s, and body-care products take the form of emulsions that are required to be stable over a long period of time. The ouzo effect is seen as a potential mechanism for generating [[surfactant]]-free microemulsions without the need for high-shear stabilisation techniques that are costly in large-scale production processes. The creation of a variety of dispersions such as pseudolatexes, silicone emulsions, and biodegradable polymeric nanocapsules, have been synthesized using the ouzo effect, though as stated previously, the exact mechanism of this effect remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Pamukkale 2 4 Commons.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Travertine terrace formations at Pamukkale, Turkey. May 21, 2011]]
'''Pamukkale''', meaning "cotton castle" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is a natural site in [[Denizli]] in southwestern [[Turkey]]. The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing water.&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=286|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in Turkey's Inner [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region, in the [[Büyük Menderes River|River Menderes]] valley, which has a temperate climate for most of the year.

The ancient Greco-Roman city of [[Hierapolis]] was built on top of the white "castle" which is in total about {{convert|2700|m|ft|-1}} long, {{Convert|600|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|160|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high. It can be seen from the hills on the opposite side of the valley in the town of [[Denizli]], 20&amp;nbsp;km away.

Known as Pamukkale (Cotton Castle) or ancient Hierapolis (Holy City), this area has been drawing the weary to its thermal springs since the time of [[Classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcium-rich springs. Dripping slowly down the vast mountainside, mineral-rich waters foam and collect in terraces, spilling over cascades of stalactites into milky pools below. Legend has it that the formations are solidified cotton (the area’s principal crop) that giants left out to dry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Tourism is and has been a major industry in the area for thousands of years, due to the attraction of the thermal pools.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; As recently as the mid-20th century, hotels were built over the ruins of Hierapolis, causing considerable damage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} An approach road was built from the valley over the terraces, and motor bikes were allowed to go up and down the slopes. When the area was declared a [[World Heritage Site]], the hotels were demolished and the road removed and replaced with artificial pools.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Overshadowed by natural wonder, Pamukkale’s well-preserved Roman ruins and museum have been remarkably underestimated and unadvertised; tourist brochures over the past 20 years have mainly featured photos of people bathing in the calcium pools. Aside from a small footpath running up the mountain face, the terraces are all currently off-limits, having suffered erosion and [[water pollution]] at the feet of tourists.

==Geology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Pamukkale's terraces are made of [[travertine]], a sedimentary rock deposited by water from the hot springs.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt;

In this area, there are 17 hot water springs in which the temperature ranges from {{convert|35|C}} to {{convert|100|C}}. The water that emerges from the spring is transported {{convert|320|m}} to the head of the travertine terraces and deposits calcium carbonate on a section {{convert|60|to|70|m|ft}} long covering an expanse of {{convert|24|m}} to {{convert|30|m}}. When the water, supersaturated with [[calcium carbonate]], reaches the surface, [[carbon dioxide]] de-gasses from it, and calcium carbonate is deposited. Calcium carbonate is deposited by the water as a soft [[gel]] which eventually crystallizes into travertine.

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}

===Museum===
In this museum, alongside historical artifacts from Hierapolis, there are also artifacts from Laodiceia, Colossae, Tripolis, Attuda and other towns of the Lycos (Çürüksu) valley. In addition to these, the museum has a large section devoted to artifacts found at [[Beycesultan]] Hüyük that includes some of the most beautiful examples of Bronze Age craft.

Artifacts from the Caria, Pisidia and Lydia regions are also on display in this museum. The museum’s exhibition space consists of three closed areas of the Hierapolis Bath and the open areas in the eastern side which are known to have been used as the library and gymnasium. The artifacts in open exhibition space are mostly marble and stone. Hierapolis is broken down into ruins.

The underground volcanic activity which causes the hot springs also forced [[carbon dioxide]] into a cave, which was called the [[Plutonium (cave)|Plutonium]], which here means "place of the god [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]". This cave was used for religious purposes by priests of [[Cybele]], who found ways to appear immune to the suffocating gas.

[[Tadpole]]s can be found in the pools.&lt;ref name="redesigned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/10165623 |title=Pamukkale Turkey Hotel And Hostel Redesigned |accessdate=2009-09-02 |date=2009-01-10 |publisher=PRLog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protecting the thermal waters ==
The hotels built in the 1960s were demolished as they were draining the thermal waters into their swimming pools and caused damage to the terraces.{{cn|date=September 2018|reason=The source for this section mentions hotels being demolished but if these were Byzantine era hotels or were constructed in the late 1950s or in the 1960s}} The water supply to the hotels is restricted in an effort to preserve the overall site and to allow deposits to regenerate.&lt;ref name="veryturkey"/&gt;

Access to the terraces is not allowed and visitors are asked to follow the pathway.&lt;ref name="veryturkey"&gt;[http://veryturkey.com/destination-info/other/pamukkale Pamukkale Travetines Denizli]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7603">'''Planetary management''' is intentional global-scale management of [[Earth]]'s [[biological]], [[chemical]] and [[physical property|physical]] processes and [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycles]] ([[Water cycle|water]], [[Carbon cycle re-balancing|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[Sulfur cycle|sulfur]], [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]], and others). Planetary management also includes managing [[human]]ity’s influence on planetary-scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6743/full/400399a0.html|title=A manual for planetary management|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective planetary management aims to prevent destabilisation of [[Earth's climate]], protect [[biodiversity]] and maintain or improve human well-being. More specifically, it aims to benefit society and the [[World economy|global economy]], and safeguard the [[ecosystem services]] upon which humanity depends – global [[climate]], [[freshwater]] supply, [[food]], [[energy]], clean air, fertile [[soil]], [[pollinators]], and so on.

Because of the sheer complexity and enormous scope of the task, it remains to be seen whether planetary management is a feasible paradigm for maintaining global [[sustainability]].  The concept currently has defenders and critics on both sides: [[environmentalist]] [[David W. Orr]] questions whether such a task can be accomplished with human help and technology or without first examining the underlying human causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Orr |first=David W. |authorlink=David W. Orr |editor= W. B. Willers |year=1999 |chapter=The Question of Management |title=Unmanaged Landscapes: Voices for Untamed Nature |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYZM0gBHyekC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Island Press]] |isbn=1-55963-694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while geographer [[Vaclav Smil]] acknowledges that "the idea of planetary management may seem preposterous to many, but at this time in history there is no rational alternative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smil |first=Vaclav |authorlink=Vaclav Smil |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ntHWPMUgpMC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Earth's Biosphere: Evolution, Dynamics, and Change |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-69298-8 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been around in science fiction novels since the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In 2004, the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] published “Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; The publication’s executive summary concluded: “An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required”. It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment. In 2009, the [[planetary boundaries]] concept was published in the science journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]. The paper identifies nine boundaries in the Earth system. Remaining within these nine boundaries, the authors suggest, may safeguard the current equilibrium.

In 2007, France called for [[UNEP]] to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization, the [[United Nations Environment Organization]]. The rationale was that UNEP’s status as a programme, rather than an organization in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of Earth. The call was backed by 46 countries. Notably, the top five emitters of [[greenhouse gas]]es failed to support the call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL03357553._CH_.2400 |title=46 nations call for tougher U.N. environment role|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-02-03|first=Alister|last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other environmental worldviews ==
Together with planetary management, [[stewardship]] and [[environmental wisdom]] are different ways to manage the Earth&lt;ref name=cosm&gt;[http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-living/articles/11650.aspx Donna Cosmato, ''What's Your Environmental Worldview?'']&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[environmental worldview]]s".

In particular:
* Planetary management focus its attention on humans needs and wants, while stewardship aim at the benefit of humans, organisms and ecosystems of the Earth:&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; in other words, planetary management considers humans as the most important species in the Earth, while stewardship and environmental wisdom consider all the species at the same level of importance.
* To accomplish its scope, planetary management relies on technology and innovation (as stewardship and [[spaceship-earth worldview]]), while environmental wisdom relies on the lesson learned from nature.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt;

'''Protected areas of Tasmania''' consists of [[protected area]]s located within [[Tasmania]] and its [[Territorial waters|immediate onshore waters]], including [[Macquarie Island]]. It includes areas of [[crown land]] (public land) managed by [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]] agencies as well as private reserves. As of 2016, 51% of Tasmania's land area has some form of reservation classification, the majority is managed by the [[Tasmania Parks &amp; Wildlife Service]] (about 42% of total Tasmanian land area). [[Marine protected area]]s cover about 7.9% of [[territorial waters|state waters]].

Within each classification of reserve there may be a variation of [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN categories]] which can serve as a rough guide of "conservation significance".

==Legislation and management==
*[[Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service]] manages crown land reserved under the ''Nature Conservation Act 2002''. The 10 classes of protected land are: conservation area, historic site, game reserve, national park, nature recreation area, nature reserve, regional reserve and state reserve.&lt;ref name=NCA2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/nca2002237/ |title=Nature Conservation Act 2002 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |website=www.austlii.edu.au |access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PWSListings&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=5710 |title=Reserve Listing: National Parks and Reserves declared under the Nature Conservation Act 2002 |publisher=[[Tasmania Parks &amp; Wildlife Service]] |website=www.parks.tas.gov.au |access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CrownLandFAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=33344 |title=Crown Land Frequently Asked Questions |website=parks.tas.gov.au |publisher=Tasmania Parks &amp; Wildlife Service |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Parks and Reserves Management act 2002'' determines the management objectives for each class.&lt;ref name=NPARMA2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/nparma2002361/ |title=National Parks and Reserves Management Act 2002 |publisher= Australasian Legal Information Institute |website=austlii.edu.au |access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of area totals==
At 30 June 2016, Tasmania's terrestrial reserves cover {{Convert|3.4|e6ha}} (about 50.1% of the area of Tasmania), of which Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service manages 823 reserves (about {{Convert|2.9|e6ha|abbr=unit}}, or over 42% of the area of Tasmania).&lt;ref name=PWSListings/&gt;&lt;ref name=TasResEstate2016/&gt;

The following table demonstrates the distribution of terrestrial protected areas as of June 2016, any marine areas are excluded. All protected areas not managed by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service or Sustainable Timber Tasmania is grouped into "other", including: formal and informal reserves on public land, reserves on private land, and Wellington Park.&lt;ref name=PWSListings/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReserveSummaryList&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/file.aspx?id=28768 |title=Reserve Summary Report (Nature Conservation Act 2002) [list of TPWS-managed reserves] |publisher=[[Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service]] |website=parks.tas.gov.au |date=20 February 2015 |access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TasResEstate2016/&gt;

'''Samson's riddle''' is a [[riddle]] that appears in the biblical narrative about [[Samson]]. Samson wagered a riddle to thirty Philistine guests, in these words: "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet" (Judges 14:14). Instead of a fair riddle that could be discerned with deduction, the riddle was based on a private experience of Samson who killed a young lion (kephir)&lt;ref name=TorahClass&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torahclass.com/old-testament-studies/40-old-testament-studies-judges/336-lesson-21-chapter14|website=Torah Class: Rediscovering the Old Testament|title=Old Testament Studies: Lessen 21 Chapter 14|author=Tom Bradford|publisher=Seed of Abraham Ministries, Inc|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after a while found bees and honey in its corpse. "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" (Judges 14:18) is the answer to the riddle. The Philistines, who could not solve the riddle, extorted the answer from Samson's wife, who persuaded Samson to tell it to her. The wager's prize was 30 soft under shirts (sedin)&lt;ref name=TorahClass/&gt; and good suits (chalipha)&lt;ref name=TorahClass/&gt; to the winner, for which Samson slew 30 Philistine men to pay the terms.

[[Chazal|The Jewish sages]] and the medieval commentators accepted the story literally and did not pay much attention to the riddle. In modern times, many biblical scholars have studied the Samson cycle and its components, including Samson's riddle. Some of them, mainly influenced by [[form criticism]], have tried to reconstruct the original background and meaning of the riddle and of other components in the story, under the assumption that story in its current form is the product of a combination of originally independent traditions; These scholars proposed diverse answers to the riddle, not necessarily related to the answer proposed in the biblical text. Other scholars investigated the riddle and the narrative surrounding it in their final form, as a literary work of art.

==Biblical narrative==
{{main|Samson}}
Samson's riddle is interwoven with the narrative about Samson and the woman from [[Timnah]]. This narrative appears in chapters 14-15 in the [[Book of Judges]], and is part of the Samson cycle, which includes chapters 13-16. The first part of the narrative, in chapter 14, is the one that includes the riddle. There are several difficulties in the text, especially concerning Samson's parents involvement in the phases preceding the wedding, and concerning chronological aspects in the description of the feast and the riddle. In critical exegesis, these difficulties are usually treated assuming that the text has undergone several editorial phases. Traditional exegesis tends to harmonize the difficulties.{{citation needed|reason=There are numerous problems in the text between various versions.  This needs to be explicitly mentioned and then sourced.|date=December 2016}} &lt;ref&gt;see for example Soggin 1981, pp. 239-241; &lt;/ref&gt;

===Background: The incident with the lion===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
[[file:Dore-SamsonSlayingTheLion.jpg|thumb|210px|"Samson Slaying the Lion", Doré]]
The first woman Samson befriended was a [[Philistine]] woman from [[Timnah]], whom he chose as his appointed wife. His parents, [[Manoah]] and [[Wife of Manoah|his wife]], have pleaded him to take an [[Israelite]] wife instead, but Samson refused. They - and perhaps Samson himself - were not aware of the fact that Samson's stubbornness was part of a divine plan to provide him an excuse to strike the Philistines, as indeed will happen later. On his way to his wife Samson encountered a lion, and "he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat" (Judges 14:6). Eventually, when Samson returned to the place where he killed the lion, he saw that a swarm of [[honey bee|bees]] has created a [[beehive|hive]] in the carcass. Samson collected honey from the hive for himself and for his parents, not telling them or anyone else about the source of the honey.

===The wedding feast, the riddle, and its consequences===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The wedding feast was held at the wife's household. The incident with the lion became the subject of a riddle that Samson posed to his thirty Philistine guests in the feast: "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet". Samson promised to give the Philistines thirty expensive garments if they solve the riddle within seven days, or else, if they don't solve the riddle, they will give him such garments. The Philistines, who couldn't solve the riddle fairly, threaten the life of Samson's wife so that she would tell them the answer. The wife begged Samson to tell her the answer until he did so, then she told the answer to the Philistines, who told it to Samson: "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?". Samson, who understood that the Philistines had blackmailed the answer from his wife, reacted furiously: "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle". In order to pay his debt, Samson went to [[Ashkelon]], murdered thirty Philistines and took their garments. After this incident, Samson left his wife angrily and returned to his own family. The incident has set in motion, according to the divine plan, a series of violent conflicts between Samson and the Philistines, as described later in the story.

==The individual elements in the narrative==
Some scholars, especially the earlier ones, influenced by [[form criticism]], tend to assume that the distinctive elements of the riddle and its surrounding narrative had existed separately before the literary crystallization that interwove them together, and that their original form and meaning might have been different than those reflected in their current context. For example, the Philistines' answer appears in the text as the correct answer to the riddle, but it is possible that the original answer was different. Scholars of this attitude tend to focus on the various elements of the story and treat them individually, outside their current context, trying to understand their [[Sitz im Leben|original background]]. Hereinafter, the individual elements of the story will be discussed according to this exegetical attitude.

Some scholars think that the Samson cycle in general, and Samson's riddle and its surrounding narrative in particular, were largely influenced by [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] culture; Some of them think that this influence was mediated by Philistine culture, which is generally thought to be related to [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Yadin 2002, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, some scholars treat the narrative, or certain [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s in it, in light of parallel stories of [[Greek mythology]] and [[folklore]]. Another widely accepted assumption is that the narrative should be interpreted in light of [[theme (narrative)|theme]]s related to sex and gender arising from the Samson cycle in general, and from the context of the wedding feast in particular, which implies an erotic and reckless atmosphere. Accordingly, some interpretations tend to the erotic or the vulgar.

===The incident with the lion===
Scholars have tried to explain the incident with the lion, which constitute the subject of the riddle. This incident, like other descriptions in Samson cycle, contains unrealistic elements: That Samson could tear apart the lion bare-handed is undoubtedly exceptional, but the description of bees nesting in the lion's carcass also seems unrealistic, as bees do not normally nest in carcasses. A few scholars have tried to explain the realistic background of this description, by suggesting, for example, that the bees nested in the lion's dry skeleton and not in his rotten carcass,&lt;ref&gt;This opinion is cited at Margalith 1986, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; but such opinions are uncommon. The common opinion is that this is a description of an exceptional or even miraculous event, like that of the tearing of the lion. Accordingly, most scholars ignore the realistic background of the description and treat it with literary methods.

Some scholars examine the description with methods from [[comparative literature]] and [[form criticism]]. These scholars tend to separate between the description of the tearing of the lion and that of the bees and the honey, and to explain the background of each of these elements individually. It is widely conjectured that the two motifs originally existed separately, unrelated to each other and to Samson's riddle. Othniel Margalith, a scholar of Philistines and their culture, has suggested that the original background of the two motifs is Philistine-Mycenaean.&lt;ref&gt;For the lion's tearing motif see below. For the bees in the lion's carcass see Margalith 1986, pp. 228-229.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Tearing of the lion====
The tearing of the lion can be treated as a legendary description meant to exalt Samson as a superhuman hero, like other description in the Samson cycle that demonstrates his prodigious physical strength. The motif of a hero defeating a lion is widespread in world folklore, and appears in other places in the Hebrew Bible; it is told of [[David]] (1 Samuel 17:36) and about [[Benaiah]] (2 Samuel 23:20).&lt;ref&gt;See Amit 1999, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Carus]], the lion is a mythical symbol of the heat of the sun, and Samson represents the [[solar deity]] who can "kill the lion", that is to diminish the heat of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Carus 1907, pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Carus' conjecture is rooted in an old scholarly approach, not accepted in current research, which considers Samson a mythological "solar hero" - that is, a [[god]] or a [[demigod]] related to the sun - and interprets the stories about him from this point of view.

Margalith points out the fact that in other occurrences of the motif of the defeating of a lion in the bible, and in [[ancient Near East]] in general, the hero hunts the lion and doesn't kill him bare-handed as in the Samson story; On the other hand, this detail of killing the lion bare-handed is widespread in Greek sources. This indicates, according to Margalith, the Mycenaean background of the biblical story. Margalith compares the story about Samson tearing the lion to the story about [[Heracles]] killing the [[Nemean lion]] bare-handed; and to other heroes of Greek mythology, who like Samson kills a lion bare-handed on their way to captivate their beloved.&lt;ref&gt;Margalith 1987, pp. 66-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honey in the lion's carcass====
Scholars have suggested parallels to the motif of bees nesting in the lion's carcass. In this context one frequently mention the alleged ritual of [[bugonia]] - raising bees in a cow's carcass - described in Greek and Roman literary sources, in [[Virgil]]'s ''Georgics'' for example.&lt;ref&gt;Book 4, verse 295 onward, cited at Amit 1999, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; This fictitious literary description is understood in light of the ancient belief of [[spontaneous generation]]. Virgil describes bugonia as an [[Egypt]]ian custom. Some speculate that the description arose in connection with the identity between ''apis'', the Latin word for "bee", and [[Apis (god)|Apis]], the Latin name of the Egyptian bull-deity.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Naor's note at Tur-Sinai 1966, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the biblical description was influenced by a similar double meaning in Hebrew (see below). Also mentioned in the context of bees in the lion's carcass motif is the story about [[Onesilus]] and the bees that nested in his skull.

===The riddle===
The riddle Samson posed to the Philistines is the only explicit example of a riddle in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Margalith 1986, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; In its context, the answer to the riddle is honey from the lion's carcass: Honey is "something to eat" and "something sweet", and lion is "the eater" and "something strong". Apparently, the riddle is an unfair one, and can hardly be called a riddle, since it is based on a private experience of Samson which the Philistines could not possibly know about. The Philistine could not even think of an incident like this, since, as stated previously, bees do not normally hive in carcasses. In addition, the words "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet" can be interpreted in many ways other than referring to honey from a lion.

Many commentators have been uncomfortable with the riddle's unsolvable nature, and they have tried to interpret it according to the assumption that it can be solved without knowledge of the incident with the lion and the bees. It is assumed that the riddle originally had an independent answer, not necessarily identical with the one stated in the biblical text, and that only at a later stage in the creation of the narrative was the riddle connected to the incident with the lion and the bees. For instance, it has been posited that the riddle's original meaning, or at least one of its possible  meanings, is sexual, with the description of honey as "something to eat" and "something sweet" having originally referred to [[semen]].&lt;ref&gt;See discussion and literature cited at Crenshaw 1978, pp. 114-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4792">The '''San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea''' was adopted in June 1994 by the [[International Institute of Humanitarian Law]] after a series of round table discussions held between 1988 and 1994 by diplomats and naval and legal experts.  It is "the only comprehensive international instrument that has been drafted on the law of naval warfare since 1913." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jmst.htm Commentary by Louise Doswald-Beck: Section 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/1913a.htm 1913 Oxford Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 67 of the Manual states that it is permitted for belligerents to attack merchant vessels flying the flag of neutral States outside of neutral waters if they "are believed on reasonable grounds to be carrying [[contraband]] or breaching a [[blockade]], and if after prior warning they intentionally and clearly refuse to stop, or intentionally and clearly resist visit, search or capture". Paragraph 146 states that it is permitted to capture neutral merchant vessels outside neutral waters if they are engaged in any of the activities referred to in paragraph 67. The term ''[[neutral waters]]'' is defined in paragraph 14: "Neutral waters consist of the internal waters, territorial sea, and, where applicable, the archipelagic waters, of neutral States. Neutral airspace consists of the airspace over neutral waters and the land territory of neutral States." &lt;ref name="San Remo Manual"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/7694fe2016f347e1c125641f002d49ce |title=San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |date=31 December 1995 |accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Explanation" of Article 102 that accompanies the text of the San Remo Manual clarifies that a declaration or establishment of a blockade is prohibited if it has the sole purpose of starving the civilian population or denying it other objects essential for its survival. It also provides that a blockade is rendered unlawful if the effect on the civilian population is excessive in relation to the lawful military purpose.

The San Remo Manual was cited by the Israeli government to justify its [[Gaza flotilla raid|boarding and seizure of ships]] trying to break the [[Gaza blockade]] (see [[Legal assessments of the Gaza flotilla raid]]),&lt;ref name=ABC-Lateline&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6455">{{nihongo|'''Suijin'''|水神|water god}} is the [[Shinto]] god of water in [[Japan]].
The term Suijin (literally water people or [[water deity]]) refers to the heavenly and earthly manifestations of the benevolent Shinto divinity of water. But it also refers to a wide variety of mythological and magical creatures found in lakes, ponds, springs and wells, including serpents ([[snakes]] and dragons), eels, fish, turtles, and the flesh-eating [[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]]. As The God of Water, '''Mizu no Kamisama''', '''Mizugami''', or '''Suijin''', he is widely revered in Japan. He is a big part of Japanese culture and is often worshiped in temples. Suijin is also known as '''the Water God''', {{nihongo|'''Suiten'''|水天||||||"water heaven"}} and {{nihongo|'''Sui-ō/Suiu'''| 水王||||||"water lord"}}/Suiu (.

Suijin is sometimes conflated with [[Ryūjin]], the dragon kami who is also associated with water. [[Fudō Myōō]] is also sometimes termed Suijin because of his association with the waterfall. In most cases, however, Suijin appears simply as a stone plaque, or even a simple small stone set upright near a spring’s emergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashkenazi|first=Michael|title=Handbook of Japanese Mythology|year=2003|publisher=In Handbooks of World Mythology.Santa Barbara, Calif : ABC-CLIO.|isbn=9781576074671|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
{{Underlinked|section|date=January 2018}}

The Water Kami is the guardian of the fishing folk, and a patron saint of fertility, motherhood, and easy childbirth. One reason people worship and praise the Water Kami and give offerings to it is to hope for pure and unpolluted water for human consumption, as well as for other uses like agriculture and sanitation. Other reasons of worship include praying for success in fishing trips, praying for successful and good fertility and motherhood, as well as for easy childbirth.&lt;ref name=Schumacher&gt;{{cite web|last=Schumacher|first=Mark|title=Suijin|url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/suijin.html|publisher=www.onmarkproductions.com|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrines devoted to the worship of the Water Kami are called "Suitengū Shrines". One example is the [[Kurume Suitengū|Suitengū Shrine]] in [[Kurume, Fukuoka|Kurume]] ([[Fukuoka prefecture|Fukuoka]]), which is the main shrine of all Suitengū Shrines in Japan. It is especially famous to those praying for safe and easy childbirth. Another famous Suitengū Shrine is the [[Tsukiji]] [[Suitengū (Tokyo)|Suijin Shrine]], located near the [[Tsukiji fish market]] in Tokyo, in order to protect and watch over the fishers and their businesses.&lt;ref name=Schumacher /&gt;

Throughout Japan, this deity is widely worshipped at Suitengū Shrines and through the means of votive stone markers devoted to the Water Kami throughout the countryside. Most of these stone markers can be found enshrined at dikes of agricultural irrigation canals, along rice paddy fields, at mountain springs, normal springs, streams, rivers, wells, household wells, and even inside sewage water and septic tanks. When a Suijin stone marker is enshrined at mountain springs, that form sources for agricultural waterways, it is often labeled as Water distributing kami (mikumari no kami 水分神), in which cases they may also be associated with the kami of the mountain (Yama no Kami 山の神).&lt;ref name=Schumacher /&gt;

=== Festivals ===
{{Underlinked|section|date=January 2018}}

There is a vast amount of festivals that are dedicated to the Water Kami, most of them being concentrated in summer and winter, though emphasis is particularly placed on observances in summer. The core of the summer festival is found at the Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto and at the Tsushima Shrine in Tsushima ([[Aichi Prefecture]]). The observances have the significant role of exorcism of bad spirits and purification, especially aimed at dangerous epidemic diseases and water-related disasters which commonly happen during the summer.

An example list of some of the festivals based on worshipping Suijin (this list does not include all festivals):&lt;ref name=Schumacher /&gt;&lt;ref name=Higashi&gt;{{cite web|last=Higashi|title=Suijin|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=227|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Suijin Matsuri, December 1 and June 15 — On these days in Japan, various locations hold the Suijin Matsuri, a Shinto celebration and ceremony to honor the Kami of Water.
* Kamakura Matsuri, Akita Prefecture, Around February 15–17 each year — Igloos (called "kamakura") are built with a small alcove inside dedicated to Suijin, who is honored during this festival to ensure good crops in the coming year. This festival has a history of over 400 years.
* Suijin-sai, April 3, Funabashi Fishing Harbor (Chiba) — A festival to pray for a good fishing haul and safety at sea. All fishing boats from the area gather in the harbor with their flags streaming in the wind, and a "Kagura" ritual (sacred Shinto music and dance), dedicated to the god of the sea, is performed on board the vessels. An important ritual since the Edo Period, the festival is called Funa-sai for short. 
* Suitengū Spring Festival, Kurume City (Fukuoka), May 3–5 — This annual festival, held at the Suitengū Shrine in Kurume City, is reportedly over 800 years old. Participants pray for safe and easy child birth, for protection from drowning, and to ask for the safety and health of children. This festival is also held at other Suitengū sites in Japan on May 5. Another major festival in Kurume City is the Water Festival, which takes place from August 3 to 5. 
* Okinohata Suitengu Festival, Yanagawa (Fukuoka), May 3–5 — Held on the canal by the shrine for three days and nights, with about 30,000 visitors. Many pray for their children to be protected from drowning.
* Gion Festival, Around July 25, Near Tsukuba (Ibaraki) — Anniversary feast of Suijin-gū Shrine of Tsuchiura City (Ibaraki). Water is splashed over the portable shrine.&lt;ref name=Schumacher /&gt;&lt;ref name=Higashi /&gt;

The '''Syringe Tide''' was an [[environmental disaster]] during 1987–88 in [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] where significant amounts of [[medical waste]], including [[syringe|hypodermic syringes]], and raw garbage washed up onto beaches on the [[Jersey Shore]], in [[New York City]], and on [[Long Island]]. This forced the closing of beaches on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]].&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Jane|title=Beach Debris Still a Mystery; 77 Syringes Wash Up on S.I.|work=The New York Times|page=1|date=12 July 1988|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/nyregion/beach-debris-still-a-mystery-77-syringes-wash-up-on-si.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials scrambled to identify the source of the material as some local economies struggled with diminished tourism.

==Reaction==
Reports of medical waste and sewage spills drove away hundreds of thousands of vacationers, costing the $7.7-billion-a-year tourism industry on the Jersey Shore more than $1 billion in lost revenue that summer, tourism officials say. Later the losses were tallied between 15 and 40% of typical tourism revenue. It was a source of even greater turmoil due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Schmitt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/nyregion/on-the-jersey-shore-a-summer-to-forget.html |title=On the Jersey Shore, a Summer to Forget |location=New Jersey; Atlantic Ocean |publisher=The New York Times |date=1988-09-02 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and reaction==
Officials finally traced the source of the waste to the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on [[Staten Island]]. After much deliberation, [[New York City]] was required to pay $1 million for past pollution damages as well as pay for the cleanup. No reparations were paid to the business owners on the Jersey Shore for revenues lost during the months of inactivity.&lt;ref name="NarvaezTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narvaez|first1=Alfonso A.|title=New York City to Pay Jersey Town $1 Million Over Shore Pollution|work=The New York Times|page=4|date=8 December 1987|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/08/nyregion/new-york-city-to-pay-jersey-town-1-million-over-shore-pollution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[syringe]] tides of 1987 and 1988, the participants in the New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/hep/ New York-New jersey Harbor Estuary Plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919031549/http://www.seagrant.sunysb.edu/hep/ |date=2006-09-19 }}, accessed February 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; implemented an extremely successful effort, known as the Short-term Floatables Action Plan. The plan has been implemented since 1989 and is supposed to curtail floatable debris wash-ups by intercepting debris slicks within the Harbor. With this plan, the extent of beach closures declined from over {{convert|70|mi|km}} in 1988 to fewer than {{convert|4|mi|km}} in 1989, and closures have remained at a low level in later years. The Short-term Floatables Action Plan has four key elements:&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.marist.edu/diglib/EnvSci/archives/hudsmgmt/ny-njharborestuaryprogram/debris.html Floatable Debris], accessed February 19, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524210352/http://library.marist.edu/diglib/EnvSci/archives/hudsmgmt/ny-njharborestuaryprogram/debris.html |date=May 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Surveillance: Environmental organizations will conduct regular air and sea patrols of the Harbor to look for and report slicks of floatable debris.
*Regular Cleanups: The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) will use cleanup vessels to collect floatable debris in the Harbor and focuses its activities on conditions when slicks are most likely to occur.
*Non-routine Cleanups: USACE also attempts to capture additional debris slicks in the Harbor when they are detected and reported.
*Communications Network: [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] coordinates a reporting network as well as cleanup activities among all the program participants.

==Popular culture==
It is thought that the Syringe Tide was the specific incident cited in [[Billy Joel]]'s 1989 hit single "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]" by the line "Hypodermics on the shores." It was also the basis for [[Barbara Ehrenreich]]’s ''The Great Syringe Tide''.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Old Man and the "C" Student|The Old Man and the 'C' Student]]", when punishing the students Principal [[Seymour Skinner|Skinner]] sends [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] to the beach to "pick up all this medical waste that's washed up on the shore." Milhouse accidentally pricks himself on a [[syringe]], and Skinner replies "Well, just keep working. You'll prick yourself with the [[antidote]] sooner or later."

The 1988 [[Skinny Puppy]] song "[[VIVIsectVI|Hospital Waste]]" was written about the incident.

In the episode "The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore" from ''[[It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia]]'', Frank and Mac are on a beach covered in needles but blame it on New Jersey being the steroid capital of the world.

'''Taiga Rescue Network (TRN)''' was an international network of more than 200 non-governmental organizations, indigenous peoples and individuals working to defend the world's boreal [[forest]]s, also known as [[Taiga]]. TRN was established in 1992 to give a voice to support, link and publicize local struggles fighting for the boreal forests and its peoples. TRN no longer exists. In 2010, TRN held its last conference in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nordicforests.org/conference-invitation-taiga-rescue-challenges/|title=NordicForests.org {{!}} Conference invitation: Taiga Rescue Challenges {{!}} info about High Conservation Value Forests in Norway, Sweden and Finland|date=2010-05-24|access-date=2017-06-16|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524213437/http://nordicforests.org/conference-invitation-taiga-rescue-challenges/|archivedate=2010-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website remained online until April 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taigarescue.org/|title=TRN - Taiga Rescue Network - the Boreal forest|date=2013-04-06|access-date=2017-06-16|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406214022/http://www.taigarescue.org/|archivedate=2013-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and Goals ==

TRN's '''mission''' was support local struggles and strengthen the cooperation between individuals, NGOs and indigenous peoples and nations concerned with the protection, restoration and sustainable use of the world' boreal forests by means that ensure the integrity of natural processes and dynamics.

The '''goals''' of the network were 1) Promoting socially beneficial, economically viable and ecologically sound management of the boreal forests; 2) Ensuring Indigenous Peoples rights are respected and local control of resources is guaranteed; 3) Protecting old-growth Northern forests; and 4) Halting destructive extraction and wasteful consumption of products from boreal forests.

== Methods ==

=== Education and Advocacy ===

The network worked to disseminate information among governments, industry, and the general public about boreal forest issues by publishing '''Taiga News''', a quarterly publication covering social and environmental issues relating to the entire boreal region; producing '''fact sheets''' on sensitive areas under particular threat; compiling profiles of key industry players; publishing '''reports and studies''' that critically analyze the trends and challenges facing the boreal region; participating in an ongoing '''dialogue''' with public administrations and the private sector on local, national and international levels to strengthen environmental regulations related to forest protection and sustainable forest management in the boreal region; organizing a '''biennial international conference''' bringing together various stakeholders (scientists, environmental organizations, indigenous peoples support groups, industry, media).

===Campaign Coordination===

TRN promoted cooperation through joint projects among NGOs and indigenous peoples by uniting and informing the NGO and indigenous communities through meetings, conferences and seminars; publishing a monthly internal newsletter The Boreal Bulletin with concise and up to date strategic information; managing several topical email lists to improve project coordination and information exchange; supporting environmentalists and indigenous peoples in the boreal region with small grants.

===Research and Policy Analysis===

The network coordinated NGO input into various national and international processes and facilitate joint position papers outlining the NGO vision for sustainable forestry in the boreal region; monitored the various national and international certification and ecolabelling processes and supported independent, performance based certification, such as the approach promoted by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC); identified forests with high conservation value and work towards their conservation through the establishment of protected areas; and lead the way in mapping trade links of boreal products.

If measured from the ocean floor, it is at 7,500&amp;nbsp;m (24,600&amp;nbsp;ft) the highest volcano in the world base-to-peak outside of the [[Hawaiian Islands]],{{refn |After [[Mauna Kea]]&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/highestpoint.html | title=What is the highest point on Earth as measured from Earth's center? | publisher=[[NOAA]] | work=Ocean Facts | accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mauna Loa]]&lt;ref name="MaunaLoa"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/havo/index.cfm | title=Hawaii Volcanoes National Park | publisher=National Park Service | date=2005 | accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 10.2 km and [[Haleakala]] at 9.1 km&lt;ref name = "NPS"&gt;{{cite web | title = Haleakala National Park Geology Fieldnotes| publisher = U.S. National Park Service | url = https://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/hale/index.cfm | accessdate = 31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;| group = lower-alpha }} and is described by [[UNESCO]] and [[NASA]] as Earth's third-tallest volcanic structure.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASATeide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=88659 | title=Teide, Canary Islands | publisher=[[NASA]] | work=Visible Earth | accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |Teide is Earth's third-tallest volcanic structure only if the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] is considered to be a single structure.| group = lower-alpha }} Teide's elevation makes Tenerife the [[list of islands by highest point|tenth highest island in the world]]. Teide is an [[active volcano|active]] volcano: its most recent eruption occurred in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the northwestern Santiago rift. The United Nations Committee for Disaster Mitigation designated Teide a [[Decade Volcano]]&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/DecadeVolcanoes/ Decade Volcanoes – USGS&lt;/ref&gt; because of its history of destructive eruptions and its proximity to several large towns, of which the closest are [[Garachico]], [[Icod de los Vinos]] and [[Puerto de la Cruz]]. Teide, [[Pico Viejo]] and Montaña Blanca form the Central Volcanic Complex of Tenerife.

The volcano and its surroundings comprise [[Teide National Park]], which has an area of {{convert|18900|ha|acre}} and was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1258|title=Teide National Park|work=World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teide is the most visited natural wonder of Spain, the most visited [[national park]] in Spain and Europe and – by 2015 – the eighth most visited in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespanol.com/ciencia/20160318/110489216_0.html|title=En las entrañas del volcán|website=elespanol.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some 3 million visitors yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webtenerife.com/que-visitar/parque-nacional-del-teide/?tab=1Lang=es|title=Parque Nacional del Teide.

== Name ==
Before the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|1496 Spanish colonization]] of Tenerife, the native [[Guanches]] referred to a powerful figure living in the volcano, which carries light, power and the sun. ''El Pico del Teide'' is the modern Spanish name. Nowadays the name Teide is also used as a personal name.

== Legends ==
[[File:Teide 3d - version2.gif|thumb|left|This 3D panoramic view of Mount Teide was created using [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission|SRTM]] data (160% elevation).]]
Teide was a [[sacred mountains|sacred mountain]] for the aboriginal [[Guanches]], so it was considered a mythological mountain, as [[Mount Olympus]] was to the ancient [[Greeks]]. According to legend, [[Guayota]] (the devil) kidnapped [[Magec]] (the god of light and the sun) and imprisoned him inside the volcano, plunging the world into darkness. The Guanches asked their supreme god [[Achamán]] for clemency, so Achamán fought Guayota, freed Magec from the bowels of the mountain, and plugged the crater with Guayota. It is said that since then, Guayota has remained locked inside Teide. When going on to Teide during an [[eruption]], it was customary for the Guanches to light bonfires to scare Guayota. Guayota is often represented as a black dog, accompanied by his host of demons ([[Tibicena]]s).

The Guanches also believed that Teide held up the sky. Many hiding places found in the mountains contain the remains of stone tools and pottery. These have been interpreted as being ritual deposits to counter the influence of [[evil]] [[spirits]], like those made by the [[Kabyle people|Berbers of Kabylie]]. The Guanches believed the mountain to be the place that housed the forces of evil and the most evil figure, Guayota.&lt;ref name="Sheehan, William 1816"/&gt;

Guayota shares features similar to other powerful deities inhabiting volcanoes, such as the goddess [[Pele (deity)|Pele]] of [[Hawaiian mythology]], who lived in the [[Kīlauea]] volcano and was regarded by the native [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpMxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA458&amp;lpg=PA458&amp;dq=guayota+y+pele&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wSIsIAXqXs&amp;sig=SnsSZX8u3FfhjKYATGbJTFc2sb8&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OzYdULTGGcaa1AXe6IH4CA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=guayota%20y%20pele&amp;f=false|title=Ethnografia y anales de la conquista de las Islas Canarias|publisher=|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
[[File:TNF-NASAmap-Labels.png|thumb|Satellite image of Tenerife with different volcanic massifs labeled]]
[[File:Teideform2.png|thumb|upright|Summary diagram for formation of Tenerife through to current Teide volcano]]
The [[stratovolcano]]es Teide and [[Pico Viejo]] (Old Peak, although it is in fact younger than Teide) are the most recent centres of activity on the volcanic island of [[Tenerife]], which is the largest ({{convert|2058|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and highest ({{convert|3718|m|disp=or|abbr=on}}) island in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]]. It has a complex volcanic history. The formation of the island and the development of the current Teide [[volcano]] took place in the five stages shown in the diagram on the right.

=== Stage one ===
Like the other [[Canary Islands]], and volcanic ocean islands in general, Tenerife was built by accretion of three large [[shield volcano]]es, which developed in a relatively short period.&lt;ref&gt;Guillou, H., Carracedo, J. C., Paris R. and Pérez Torrado, F.J., 2004a. K/Ar ages and magnetic stratigraphy of the Miocene-Pliocene shield volcanoes of Tenerife, Canary Islands: Implications for the early evolution of Tenerife and the Canarian Hotspot age progression. Earth &amp; Planet. Sci. Letts., 222, 599–614.&lt;/ref&gt; This early shield stage volcanism formed the bulk of the emerged part of Tenerife. The shield volcanoes date back to the [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]]&lt;ref&gt;Fúster, J.M., Araña, V., Brandle, J.L., Navarro, J.M., Alonso, U., Aparicio, A., 1968. Geology and volcanology of the Canary Islands: Tenerife. Instituto Lucas Mallada, CSIC, Madrid, 218 pp&lt;/ref&gt; and are preserved in three isolated and deeply eroded [[massif]]s: [[Macizo de Anaga|Anaga]] (to the northeast), [[Macizo de Teno|Teno]] (to the northwest) and [[Macizo de Adeje|Roque del Conde]] (to the south).&lt;ref name="Carracedo and Day 2002"&gt;Carracedo, Juan Carlos; Day, Simon (2002). Canary Islands (Classic Geology in Europe 4). Terra Publishing, 208 pp. {{ISBN|1-903544-07-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each shield was apparently constructed in less than three million years, and the entire island in about eight million years.&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007&gt;Carracedo, J. C., Rodríguez Badioloa, E., Guillou, H., Paterne, M., Scaillet, S., Pérez Torrado, F. J., Paris, R., Fra-Paleo, U., Hansen, A., 2007. "Eruptive and structural history of Teide Volcano and rift zones of Tenerife, Canary Islands." Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, 119(9–10). 1027–1051&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages two and three ===
The initial juvenile stage was followed by a period of 2–3 million years of eruptive quiescence and [[erosion]]. This cessation of activity is typical of the Canaries; [[La Gomera]], for example, is currently at this stage.&lt;ref&gt;Paris, R, Guillou, H., Carracedo, JC and Perez Torrado, F.J., Volcanic and morphological evolution of La Gomera (Canary Islands), based on new K-Ar ages and magnetic stratigraphy:implications for oceanic island evolution, Journal of the Geological Society, May 2005, v.162; no.3; p.501-512&lt;/ref&gt; After this period of quiescence, the volcanic activity became concentrated within two large edifices: the central volcano of Las Cañadas, and the Anaga massif. The Las Cañadas volcano developed over the Miocene shield volcanoes and may have reached {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|4,500|m|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref name="Carracedo 2002"&gt;Carracedo, J.C., Pérez Torrado, F.J., Ancochea, E., Meco, J., Hernán, F., Cubas, C.R., Casillas, R., Rodríguez Badiola, E. and Ahijado, A., 2002. In: Cenozoic Volcanism II: the Canary Islands. The Geology of Spain (W. Gibbons and T. Moreno, eds), pp. 439–472. Geological Society, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stage four ===
Around 160–220 thousand years ago the [[Summit (topography)|summit]] of the Las Cañadas I volcano collapsed, creating the Las Cañadas (Ucanca) [[caldera]].&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt; Later, a new stratovolcano, Las Cañadas II, formed in the vicinity of Guajara and then catastrophically collapsed. Another volcano, Las Cañadas III, formed in the Diego Hernandez sector of the caldera. All of the Las Cañadas volcanoes attained a maximum altitude similar to that of Teide (which is sometimes referred to as the Las Cañadas IV volcano).

Two theories on the formation of the {{convert|16|x|9|km|abbr=on}} caldera exist.&lt;ref name="gvp"&gt;{{cite gvp|name=Tenerife|vnum=1803-03-|accessdate=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first states that the depression is the result of a vertical collapse of the volcano triggered by the emptying of shallow [[magma chamber]]s at around sea level under the Las Cañadas volcano after large-volume [[explosive eruption]]s.&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martí, J., Mitjavila, J., Araña, V., 1994.

The Las Cañadas caldera (Tenerife, Canary Islands): an overlapping collapse caldera generated by magma-chamber migration. J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 103: 167–173&lt;/ref&gt; The second theory is that the caldera was formed by a series of lateral gravitational collapses similar to those described in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. G., 1964.

Slope failures on the flanks of the western Canaested in the embayment itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage five ===
From around 160,000 years ago until the present day, the stratovolcanoes of Teide and Pico Viejo formed within the Las Cañadas caldera.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120413101117.htm ScienceDaily]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical eruptions ==
Teide last erupted in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent,&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt; on the Santiago Ridge. Historical volcanic activity on the island is associated with vents on the Santiago or northwest [[rift]] (Boca Cangrejo in 1492, Montañas Negras in 1706,&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt; Narices del Teide or Chahorra in 1798 and El Chinyero in 1909) and the Cordillera Dorsal or northeast rift (Fasnia in 1704, Siete Fuentes and Arafo in 1705). The 1706 Montañas Negras eruption destroyed the town and principal port of Garachico, as well as several smaller villages.

Historical activity associated with the Teide and Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes &lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt; occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide on the western flank of Pico Viejo. Eruptive material from Pico Viejo, Montaña Teide and Montaña Blanca partially fills the Las Cañadas caldera.&lt;ref name="Carracedo and Day 2002" /&gt; The last explosive eruption involving the central volcanic centre was from Montaña Blanca around 2000 years ago. The last eruption within the Las Cañadas caldera occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide or Chahorra (Teide's Nostrils) on the western flank of Pico Viejo. The eruption was predominantly [[strombolian]] in style and most of the lava was [[ʻAʻā]]. This lava is visible beside the Vilaflor–Chio road.

Christopher Columbus reported seeing "a great fire in the [[Orotava Valley]]" as he sailed past Tenerife on his voyage to discover the New World in 1492. This was interpreted as indicating that he had witnessed an eruption there. Radiometric dating of possible lavas indicates that in 1492 no eruption occurred in the Orotava Valley, but one did occur from the Boca Cangrejo vent.&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt;

The last summit eruption from Teide occurred about the year 850 AD, and this eruption produced the "Lavas Negras" or "Black Lavas" that cover much of the flanks of the volcano.&lt;ref name=Carracedo2007/&gt;

About 150,000 years ago, a much larger explosive eruption occurred, probably of [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] 5. It created the Las Cañadas caldera, a large caldera at about 2,000 m above sea level, around {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from east to west and {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} from north to south. At Guajara, on the south side of the structure, the internal walls rise as almost sheer cliffs from {{convert|2,100|to|2,715|m|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|3,718|m|abbr=on}} summit of Teide itself, and its sister stratovolcano Pico Viejo ({{convert|3,134|m|abbr=on}}), are both situated in the northern half of the caldera and are derived from eruptions later than this prehistoric explosion.

{{Decade Volcanoes Map|center|600}}

==Potential eruptions==
Future eruptions may include [[pyroclastic flow]]s and surges similar to those that occurred at [[Mount Pelée]], [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], [[Vesuvius]], [[Mount Etna|Etna]], [[Soufrière Hills]], [[Mount Unzen]] and elsewhere. During 2003, there was an increase in seismic activity at the volcano and a rift opened on the north-east flank. No eruptive activity occurred but a volume of material - possibly liquid, was emplaced into the edifice and is estimated to have a volume of ~10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Such activity can indicate that magma is rising into the edifice, but is not always a precursor to an eruption.

Teide additionally is considered structurally unstable and its northern flank has a distinctive bulge.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The summit of the volcano has a number of small active [[fumarole]]s emitting [[sulfur dioxide]] and other gases, including low levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].

A scientific assessment in 2006, published in the journal Eos, observed that "in the past 30,000 years, eruptions have occurred at a rate of only four to six per millennium, with a predominance (70%) of very low hazard, basaltic eruptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carracedo|first=Juan Carlos|date=2006|title=Recent Unrest at Canary Islands' Teide Volcano?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2006EO430003/pdf|journal=Eos|volume=87|pages=462–465|via=|doi=10.1029/2006EO430003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors further commented that "the recent eruptive record, combined with the available petrological and radiometric data, provides a rather optimistic outlook on major volcanic hazards related to Teide and its rift zones, posing only very localized threats to the one million inhabitants of Tenerife and the 4.5 million annual visitors to Teide National Park." However, another study in 2009 concluded that Teide will probably erupt violently in the future and that its structure is similar to that of Vesuvius and Etna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laopinion.es/sociedad/2009/10/30/estudio-preve-teide-sufriria-erupciones-violentas/252111.html Un estudio prevé que el Teide sufriría erupciones violentas] (La Opinión.es)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the magnitude of the risk posed by Teide to the public remains a source of debate.

== Major climbs ==
In a publication of 1626, Sir Edmund Scory, who probably stayed on the island in the first decades of the 17th century, gives a description of Teide, in which he notes the suitable paths to the top and the effects the considerable height causes to the travellers, indicating that the volcano had been accessed via different routes before the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Castillo, [http://sederi.org/docs/yearbooks/02/2_5_castillo.pdf The English Renaissance and the Canary Islands: Thomas Nichols and Edmund Scory], Proceedings of the II Conference of SEDERI: 1992: 57-69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1715 the English traveler J. Edens and his party made the ascent and reported their observations in the journal of the Royal Society in London.&lt;ref name="nicolasglemus.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicolasglemus.com/2009/01/el-parque-nacional-del-teide-patrimonio-mundial-de-la-unesco-con-juan-carlos-carracedo-y-manuel-durban/|title=El Parque Nacional del Teide: patrimonio mundial de la UNESCO, con Juan Carlos Carracedo y Manuel Durbán - Nicolás González Lemus|publisher=|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], most of the expeditions that went to East Africa and the Pacific had Teide as one of the most rewarding targets. The expedition of Lord [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|George Macartney]], [[Sir George Staunton, 1st Baronet|George Staunton]] and [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]] in 1792 almost ended in tragedy, as a major snowstorm and rain swept over them and they failed to reach the peak of Teide, just barely getting past Montaña Blanca.&lt;ref name="nicolasglemus.es"/&gt;

The German scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] stopped in Tenerife during his voyage to South America in 1799 and climbed Teide with his travelling companion [[Bonpland|Aim&amp;eacute; Bonpland]] and some local guides.&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, Andrea. ''The Invention of Nature: The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt, the Lost Hero of Science''. John Murray, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

During an expedition to [[Kilimanjaro]], the German adventurer [[Hans Meyer (geologist)|Hans Heinrich Joseph Meyer]] visited Teide in 1894 to observe ice conditions on the volcano. He described the two mountains as "two kings, one rising in the ocean and the other in the desert and steppes".&lt;ref name="nicolasglemus.es"/&gt;

More recently in November 2017, [[Gema Hassen-Bey]] became the first Paralympic athlete in the world in a wheelchair to reach 3,000 meters altitude with only the momentum of her arms. Initially, Gema wanted to reach the top of Teide, although, due to weather conditions, she could not meet this objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/deportes/noticia/hassen-bey-abandona-ascenso-teide-3186009/0/|title=Gema Hassen-Bey abandona el ascenso el Teide a 3.000 metros|first=|last=20Minutos|website=20minutos.es|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==

In contrast, Teide National Park has only a limited variety of [[vertebrate]] fauna.&lt;ref name="Thorpe, R.S. 1994, pp. 230-240"&gt;Thorpe, R.S., McGregor, D.P., Cumming, A.M., and Jordan, W.C., DNA evolution and colonisation sequence of island lizards in relation to geological history: mtDNA RFLP, cytochrome B, cytochrome oxidase, 12s rRNA sequence, and nuclear RAPD analysis, Evolution, 48(2), 1994, pp. 230–240&lt;/ref&gt; Ten species of bird nest there, including the [[blue chaffinch]] (''Fringilla teydea teydea''), [[Berthelot's pipit]] (''Anthus berthelotii berthelotii''), the [[Atlantic canary]] (''Serinus canaria'') and a subspecies of [[kestrel]] (''[[Falco tinnunculus]] canariensis'').&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D., and H.N.

Three endemic [[reptile]] species are found in the park: the Canary Island lizard (''[[Gallotia galloti]] galloti''), the Canary Island wall gecko (''[[Tarentola delalandii]]''), and the Canary Island skink (''[[Chalcides viridanus]] viridanus'').&lt;ref name="Thorpe, R.S. 1994, pp. 230-240"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lever | first = Christopher| title = Naturalized Reptiles and Amphibians of the World | edition = First | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-850771-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The only mammals native to the park are [[bat]]s, the most common of which is Leisler’s bat (''[[Nyctalus leisleri]]''). Other mammals, such as the [[mouflon]], the [[rabbit]], the [[house mouse]], the [[black rat]], the [[feral cat]], and the [[North African hedgehog]], have all been introduced to the park.&lt;ref&gt;Nogales, M., Rodríguez-Luengo, J.L. &amp; Marrero, P.

== The shadow of Teide ==
[[File:Teide Shadow Gomera.jpg|thumb|Shadow of Teide]]
Teide casts the world's largest shadow projected on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volcanoteide.com/es/el_cielo_del_teide/la_sombra_del_teide La sombra del Teide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supranubius.es/2014/08/la-sombra-del-teide.html Suprenubius. La sombra del Teide.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=current sources are a Teide tour company website and a meteorology blog|date=October 2018}} This phenomenon occurs during sunset, and also causes the shadow to partially cover the island of [[Gran Canaria]] or [[La Gomera]] at dawn, more than 40 km away from the mountain. One characteristic is that the shadow has a perfectly triangular shape, even though Teide's silhouette does not; this is an effect of [[Aerial perspective|perspective]].&lt;ref name="NASA_APOD"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110705.html | title=A Triangular Shadow of a Large Volcano | publisher=[[NASA]] | work=Astronomy Picture of the Day | date=5 July 2011 | accessdate=19 October 2018 | author=Nemiroff, R. and Bonnell, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AtmosOptic1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/mtshad.htm | title=Mountain shadow | publisher=atoptics.co.uk | work=Atmospheric Optics | accessdate=19 October 2018 | author=Cowley, L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AtmosOptic2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/mtshform.htm | title=Mountain shadow formation | publisher=atoptics.co.uk | work=Atmospheric Optics | accessdate=19 October 2018 | author=Cowley, L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors and tourists climb to the top of the volcano at sunset to witness this phenomenon.

== Scientific use ==
Teide National Park is a useful volcanic reference point for studies related to [[Mars]] because of the similarities in their environmental conditions and geological formations.&lt;ref name="elmundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/11/03/ciencia/1288783782.html|title=Tenerife se convierte en un laboratorio marciano - Ciencia - elmundo.es|author=Unidad Editorial Internet|date=November 3, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a research team tested the [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] instrument at Las Cañadas del Teide in anticipation of its use in the 2016–2018 [[ExoMars|ESA-NASA ExoMars]] expedition.&lt;ref name="elmundo"/&gt; In June 2011 a team of researchers from the UK visited the park to test a method for looking for life on Mars and to search for suitable places to test new robotic vehicles in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120317002531/http://www.loquepasaentenerife.com/vivir/10-08-2011/buscandomarcianosenelteide Buscando "marcianos" en el Teide] La Laguna, 10 August 2011. (Archived)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
The volcano and its surroundings, including the whole of the Las Cañadas caldera, are protected in the Teide National Park. Access is by a public road running from northeast to southwest across the caldera. [[TITSA]] runs a return service to Teide once a day from both [[Puerto de la Cruz]] and [[Playa de las Americas]]. The park has a [[parador]] (hotel) and a small chapel. A cable car goes from the roadside at {{convert|2,356|m|abbr=on}} most of the way to the summit, reaching {{convert|3,555|m|abbr=on}}, carrying up to 38 passengers (34 in a high wind) and taking eight minutes to reach the summit. Queues can exceed two hours in peak season. Access to the summit itself is restricted; a free permit is required to climb the last {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}}. Numbers are normally restricted to 200 per day.

[[File:Volcano Teide.JPG|thumb|Mount Teide from a distance with a cloud at the top]]

Several footpaths take hikers to the upper cable car terminal, and then onto the summit (with the permit). The most popular route is via the Refugio de Altavista, however these are demanding hikes requiring at least 4–5 hours of ascent.

Because of the altitude, the air is significantly thinner than at sea level. This can cause people (especially with heart or lung conditions) to become light-headed or dizzy, to develop [[altitude sickness]], and in extreme cases to lose consciousness. The only treatment is to return to lower altitudes and acclimatise.

== Astronomical observatory ==
[[File:Obs 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Teide Observatory]]]]
{{main article|Teide Observatory}}
An [[astronomical observatory]] is located on the slopes of the mountain, taking advantage of the altitude (above most clouds), good weather and stable [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]] from the site. The [[Teide Observatory]] is operated by the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]]. It includes solar, radio and microwave telescopes, in addition to traditional optical night-time telescopes.

== Symbol ==
Teide is the main symbol of Tenerife and the most emblematic natural monument of the Canary Islands. An image of Teide appears gushing flames at the centre of Tenerife's coat of arms. Above the volcano appears [[St. Michael]], the patron saint of Tenerife. The [[Flag of Tenerife|flag colors of the island]] are [[Dark blue (color)|dark blue]], traditionally identified with the sea that surrounds the island, and [[white]] for the whiteness of the snow-covered peaks of Mount Teide during winter. The logo of the [[Cabildo de Tenerife]] (governing body of the island) includes a symbol of Teide in eruption.

Teide has been depicted frequently throughout history, from the earliest engravings made by European conquerors to typical Canarian craft objects, on the back of 1000-[[Spanish peseta|peseta]] notes, in oil paintings and on postcards.

In the Canary Islands, especially on Tenerife, Teide has cultural symbolism deeply rooted in traditions and history. It is popularly referred to as ''Padre Teide'' (Father Teide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eldia.es/ultima/2008-04-13/4-cara-menos-conocida-padre-Teide.htm|title=La cara menos conocida del padre Teide -|date=April 13, 2008|website=eldia.es|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laopinion.es/sociedad/2010/05/24/disputa-padre-teide/287165.html|title=Disputa por el padre Teide - La Opinión de Tenerife|first=La Opinión de|last=Tenerife|website=www.laopinion.es|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain of the Moon ==
[[Mons Pico]], one of the [[Montes Teneriffe]] range of lunar mountains in the inner ring of the [[Mare Imbrium]], was named by [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter]] after the ''Pico von Teneriffe'', an 18th-century name for Teide.&lt;ref name="Sheehan, William 1816"&gt;Sheehan, William  &amp; Baum, Richard, Observation and inference: Johann Hieronymous Schroeter, 1745–1816, JBAA 105 (1995), 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeter, Johann Hieronymous, Selenotopographische Fragmente sur genauern Kenntniss der Mondfläche [vol. 1]. – Lilienthal: auf Kosten des Verfassers, 1791&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a [[brown dwarf star]] located in the open [[star cluster]] of the [[Pleiades]] called [[Teide 1]].

'''Tihar''' ({{lang-ne|[[:ne:तिहार|तिहार]]}}) [[Kirat language]] and culture is a five-day-long Nepali festival celebrated in [[Nepal]] and the [[Nepali people]] of Indian states of  [[Sikkim]] including in [[Darjeeling]] district of [[West Bengal]]. It is the festival of lights, as ''[[diya (light)|diya]]s'' are lit inside and outside the houses to make it illuminate at night. It is popularly known as [[Swanti (festival)|''Swanti'']] and Mha worship among the [[Newar people|Newars]] and as ''Deepawali'' among [[Madhesi people|Madhesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toffin|first1=Gerrard|title=The Mwahni (Dasai) Festival and the Caste System|date=2007|publisher=Social Science Baha|isbn=978 99933 43 95 0|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar, the festival begins with Kaag Tihar in Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha and ends with [[Bhai Tika]] in Dwitiya of Kartik Sukla Paksha every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lumbinimedia.com/2017/09/tihar.html|title=Tihar, Dates in Nepal, Kaag Tihar, Kukur Tihar, Gai Tihar, Laxmi Puja, Govardhan Puja, Bhai Tika|last=|first=|date=23 September 2017|work=Lumbini Media|access-date=23 September 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tihar is also known as the festival of light.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

Tihar is the second biggest Nepalese festival after [[Dashain]]. It is considered to be of great importance as it shows a contribution to not just the humans and the gods, but also to the animals like crows, cows, and dogs that maintain an intimate relationship with humans. People make patterns on the floor of living rooms or courtyards using several coloured flowers in ancients days nowadays they use the materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower petals outside their house, called ''[[Rangoli]]'', which is meant to be a sacred welcoming area for the Gods and Goddesses, mainly Goddess Laxmi.&lt;ref name="folklore-2006-p172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Selvamony|2006|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/tihar-begins-kaag-tihar-today/|title=Tihar begins; Kaag Tihar today|last=|first=|date=28 October 2016|work=[[The Himalayan Times]]|access-date=31 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crows and ravens are worshiped by offerings of sweets and dishes placed on the roofs of houses. The cawing of crows and ravens symbolizes sadness and grief in Nepali culture, so devotees offer crows and ravens food to avert grief and death in their homes. Tihar represents the divine attachment between humans and other animals.

Another interesting observation during Tihar days in Nepal is gambling: during the days of the festival, it's allowed to gamble, while the rest of the year it's illegal for Nepalese citizens to gamble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/nepal/tihar|title=Tihar|publisher=rove.me|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kaag Tihar (Day 1)==

Kaag Tihar (Crow Festival) is the first day of Tihar festival of Nepalese, Hindu people. In this particular day the [[crow]] is worshipped. Religious beliefs in Nepal regard the crow as the messenger of Yamraj, god of death. People worship the crow to bring good luck in their houses. People also put on tika and burn fire crackers on Kaag Tihar.

==Kukur Tihar (Day 2)==
[[File:Dog worship in Hinduism.jpg|thumb|A dog after being venerated during the Kukur Tihar festival in Nepal.|163x163px]]

The second day is called Kukur Tihar (Dog Festival).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/kukur-tihar-observed-across-nation-2/|title=Kukur Tihar being observed across the nation|last=|first=|date=29 October 2016|work=[[The Himalayan Times]]|access-date=31 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. People offer garlands, [[tilaka|tika]] and delicious food to dogs and acknowledge the cherished relationship between humans and dogs.

Dogs occupy a special place in every home or street and they get special treatment in this day. As mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]], [[Bhairava]], a fierce manifestation of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva,]] had a dog as a [[vahana]] (vehicle). [[Yama]], the god of death, is believed to own two guard dogs – each with four eyes. The dogs are said to watch over the gates of [[Naraka]], the Hindu concept of [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/iml/iml08.htm |title=Yama, the First Man, and King of the Dead |publisher=sacred-texts.com |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to this belief, this day is also observed as [[Naraka Chaturdashi]].

==Gai Tihar and Laxmi Puja (Day 3)==
[[File:Flower Garlands for Dipavali garnishing.jpg|thumb|Garlands of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s being prepared for the decoration. Houses, offices and commercial complexes are decorated with garlands in the morning of [[Lakshmi puja|Laxmi Puja]].|166x166px]]
[[File:Ravi Varma-Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|Goddess [[Laxmi]], the [[Hindu]] Goddess of wealth and prosperity.|233x233px]]

The morning of the third day is Gai Tihar (worship of the cow). In [[Hinduism]], [[cow]] signifies  prosperity and wealth. In ancient times people benefited a lot from the cow. Its milk, dung, even urine was used for purposes like purification. Thus, on this day people show their gratefulness to the cow by garlanding and feeding them with the best grass. Houses are cleaned and the doorways and windows are decorated with garlands made of Saya Patri ([[Tagetes|marigold]]s) and makhamali (''Gomphrena globosa'') flowers.

In the evening [[Laxmi]], the goddess of wealth is thanked for all the benefits that were bestowed on the families by lighting oil lamps (Diyo) or candles on doorways and windows to welcome prosperity and well being. At night the girls enjoy dancing and visiting all the houses in the neighborhood with musical instruments singing and dancing known as ''[[Bhailo]]'' all night long collecting money as a tip from houses and share the bounty amongst themselves.

From the third day onward Tihar is celebrated with [[Bhailo|''Deusi'' and ''Bhailo'']] with light and fireworks. Deusi is mostly sung by the boys while the Bhailo is sung by the girls. Deusi is balladic and tells the story of the festival, with one person narrating and the rest as the chorus. In return, the home owners give them money, fruit and ''[[Sel roti|selroti]]'' (a Nepali roundel made of rice flour and sugar). Nowadays social workers, politician, and young people visit local homes, sing these songs, and collect funds for welfare and social activities.

Coincidentally, Laxmi Puja also marks the birthday of [[Laxmi Prasad Devkota]], who is widely revered and honoured as the greatest poet of [[Nepali language]].

[[File:Cow dung during Gobardhan Pujā 07.jpg|166x166px|thumb|right|Cow dung during Gobardhan Pujā]]

Background. Mainly ox is worshipped in this day by giving different foods. It is observed as Goru Tihar or Goru Puja (worship of the oxen). People who follow [[Vaishnavism]] perform Govardhan Puja, which is worship towaewar]] community on the night perform [[Mha Puja]] (worship of self). This day is seen as the beginning of the new [[Nepal Sambat]] calendar year of Newari people.

==Bhai Tika (Day 5)==
[[File:सुनुवार दिहार तिहार.jpg|thumb|Bhaitika [[sunuwar]]]]
The fifth and last day of Tihar is called ''Bhai Tika'' . It is observed by sisters applying "tilaka" or "tika" to the foreheads of their brothers to ensure long life and thank them for the protection they provide. It is believed that Yamraj, the God of Death, visited his sister, [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Goddess Yamuna]], on this day during which she applied the auspicious ''tika'' on his forehead, garlanded him and fed him special dishes. Together, they ate sweets, talked and enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content. Upon parting, Yamraj gave the Yamuna a special gift as a token of his affection and, in return, Yamuna gave him a lovely gift which she had made with her own hands. That day Yamraj announced that anyone who receives ''tilak'' from his sister will never die on that day.

Sisters make a special garland for their brothers from a flower that wilts only after a long time, symbolizing the sister's prayer for her brother long live. Brothers sit on the floor while their sisters perform their ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]''. The ''puja'' follows a traditional ritual in which sisters circle brothers, dripping oil on the floor from a copper pitcher and applying oil to their brother's hair, following which a seven-color ''tikas'' is applied on the brother's forehead. Next, brothers give ''tikas'' to their sisters in the same fashion with an exchange of gifts. This ritual is practiced regardless of whether the brother is younger or older than the sister. Those without a sister or brother join relatives or friends for ''tika''. This festival strengthens the close relationship between brothers and sisters.

In addition to these, [[Newar]]s make colourful [[Ashtamangala]] [[mandala]]s and recite chants and procedures in accordance with [[Tantra|Tantric]] rituals. Along with the seven-coloured ''tika'', sisters provide brothers with [[Sagan (ceremony)|Sagun]], sweets, ''Makhamali'' ''([[Gomphrena globosa]])'' garland, and a sacred cotton thread of Tantric importance, similar to [[Janai]] thread meant to protect their bodies.

A '''vacation''' or '''holiday''' is a [[leave of absence]] from a regular occupation, or a specific trip or journey, usually for the purpose of [[recreation]] or [[tourism]]. People often take a vacation during specific [[holiday]] observances, or for specific [[festival]]s or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with [[Friendship|friends]] or [[family]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-summer-vacation-poll-20170621-story.html |title=This is the No. 1 thing Americans want to do on vacation |last=Harpaz |first=Emily Swanson and Beth J. |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=26 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227094306/http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-summer-vacation-poll-20170621-story.html |archive-date=27 February 2018 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A person may take a longer break from work, such as a [[sabbatical]], [[gap year]], or [[career break]].

The concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see [[Grand Tour]]).  In the [[Puritan]] culture of early [[America]], taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging [[spiritual retreat]] and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105545388 |title=The History of the Vacation Examined |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501151342/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105545388 |archive-date=1 May 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], ''vacation'' once specifically referred to the long summer break taken by the [[court|law courts]] and then later the term was applied to universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postgrad.com/editorial/study-in-uk/uk-postgraduate-study/university-holidays/ |title=United Kingdom University Term Times and Vacations |accessdate=5 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113200109/http://www.postgrad.com/editorial/study-in-uk/uk-postgraduate-study/university-holidays/ |archive-date=13 January 2016 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was introduced by [[William the Conqueror]] from [[Normandy]] where it facilitated the grape harvest.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In the past, many [[upper-class]] families moved to a [[summer home]] for part of the year, leaving their usual home vacant.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Impact of digital communications ==
{{Original research section|date=April 2015}}
Recent developments in communication technology—internet, mobile, instant messaging, presence tracking, etc.— have begun to change the nature of vacation. Vacation today means absence from the workplace rather than temporary cession of work. It is now the norm in North America and the United Kingdom to carry on working or remain on call while on vacation rather than abandon work altogether. Office employees [[telecommute]] whilst on vacation. Workers may choose to unplug for a portion of a day and thus create the feeling of a "vacation" by simply separating themselves from the demands of constant digital communications.  Antithetically, workers may take time out of the office to go on vacation, but remain plugged-in to work-related communications networks.  While remaining plugged-in over vacation may generate short-term business benefits, the long-term psychological impacts of these developments are only beginning to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201205/why-it-s-so-hard-unplug-the-digital-world |title=Why It's so Hard to Unplug From the Digital World |first=Ray |last=Williams |work=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 May 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional meaning ==
{{See also|Tourism}}

''Vacation'', in English-speaking [[North America]], describes recreational [[travel]], such as a short pleasure trip, or a journey abroad. People in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries use the term ''holiday'' to describe absence from work as well as to describe a vacation or journey. Vacation can mean either staying home or going somewhere.

[[Canadians]] often use ''vacation'' and ''holiday'' interchangeably referring to a trip away from home or time off work. In [[Australia]] and the [[UK]], ''holiday'' can refer to a vacation or a [[public holiday]].

The Vanderbilts, [[Rockefellers]], Carnegies, [[Collis Potter Huntington|Huntingtons]] and other fabulously wealthy industrialists built their own spectacular "great camps" in the [[Adirondacks]] of [[upstate New York]] where they could spend time with their families in private luxury. The scions of [[New York City]] took to declaring that they would "vacate" their city homes for their lakeside summer retreats, and the term "vacation" replaced the [[British English|British]] "holiday" in common parlance.

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the word ''vakáció'' can mean both a recreational trip, an officially granted absence from work (generally in warmer months), and the summer (longest) school break. For absence from work, the word ''szabadság'' (freedom/liberty) can be used, possibly as ''betegszabadság'' (sickness freedom/sickness liberty) when the reason of absence is medical in nature.

== Family vacation ==
Family vacation refers to recreation taken together by the family.  The intended purpose of family vacation is for family to get away from day-to-day chores and to devote time specifically for the relaxation and unity of family members.  Family vacation can be ritual—for example, annually around the same time—or it can be a one-time event. It can involve travel to a far-flung spot or, for families on a tight budget, a stay-at-home staycation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelingmom.com/making-the-most-of-your-stress-free-budget-staycation/ |title=Making the most of your Stress-free, Budget Staycation |work=Traveling Mom |year=2015 |accessdate=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211054748/http://www.travelingmom.com/making-the-most-of-your-stress-free-budget-staycation/ |archive-date=11 February 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of favorite family vacations might include family cruises, trips to popular theme parks, ski vacations, beach vacations, food vacations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/best-food-cities_n_6054716.html/ |title=Destination Food Towns in America, Suzy Strutner |work=Traveling Mom |year=2014 |accessdate=31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031235206/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/best-food-cities_n_6054716.html |archive-date=31 October 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or similar types of family trips.

== Vacation policy ==
In nearly all countries worldwide, there are minimum requirements as to the [[annual leave]] that must be afforded to an employee (see also [[List of minimum annual leave by country]]).

Even in the United States, where no federal requirements as to minimum annual leave exist, many large corporations have generous vacation policies, some allowing employees to take weeks off and some even allowing unlimited vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vanderkam |first1=Laura |title=Here's why unlimited vacation may be too good to be true |url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/03/unlimited-vacation-policy/ |accessdate=21 May 2016 |work=Fortune |date=3 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514125128/http://fortune.com/2015/10/03/unlimited-vacation-policy/ |archive-date=14 May 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited vacation arrangements may nonetheless come with implicit expectations, for instance, it may be implied that an employee should not take more than about the average number of vacation days taken by others. They normally also have the consequence that employees who leave the company receive no monetary compensation for leave days not taken.

According to the U.S. Travel Association, Americans collectively did not use 662 million vacation days in 2016. More than half of all working people in the [[United States]] forfeited paid time off at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zillman |first=Claire |url=http://fortune.com/2017/05/23/vacation-time-americans-unused/ |title=Americans Are Still Terrible at Taking Vacations |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=24 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524004659/http://fortune.com/2017/05/23/vacation-time-americans-unused/ |archive-date=24 May 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of people still do work while they are on vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2017/05/31/vacation/ |title=Why Americans Aren't Taking Half Of Their Vacation Days |first=Kate |last=Ashford |access-date=3 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204061359/https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2017/05/31/vacation/#21a65804726a |archive-date=4 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Family vacation and vacation in general has become a common theme in many [[books]], films and movies. Writers often draw on common occurrences that take place during a vacation such as bonding and [[disaster]]s.

'''Warren Henry Manning''' (November 7, 1860&amp;ndash;1938) was an American landscape designer and promoter of the informal and naturalistic "wild garden" approach to garden design.  In his designs, Manning emphasized pre-existing flora through a process of selective pruning to create a “spatial structure and character.” (Karson, 1997)  An advocate for the conservation of the American landscape, Manning was a key figure in the formation of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] and a proponent of the [[National Park System]].

==History==
Warren H. Manning was born in [[Reading, Massachusetts]], to Jacob Warren Manning, who owned and operated a nursery.  It was here that Manning developed an extensive knowledge of plant materials.  Jacob Manning nourished his son’s interest in horticulture by including him on botanical expeditions and visits to other nurseries including the Downing nursery, owned by Charles Downing, brother of [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (Karson, 2000).  Manning also credited his mother, Lydia, a watercolorist, for his appreciation of the smaller details found in nature by exposing him to the home garden, pointing out “birds, flowers, toads, butterflies and beetles (Karson, 1997).  Manning wrote that he “modeled in sand and mud hills, valleys, tunnels, houses, roads, and gardens with pools” (Karson, 1997).  In 1884, this exposure, coupled with the internship experience at his father’s nursery, led to his desire to make “America a finer place in which to live” (Karson, 1997) and to choose landscape design as a profession.

By 1884, the 26-year-old Manning was designing landscapes for James Warren Manning’s customers.  During his time as an apprentice, Manning furthered his plant knowledge while attending Harvard’s [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]] designed [[Arnold Arboretum]] for Saturday study sessions, foreshadowing what would eventually be one of Manning’s greatest influences.  During this time, Manning also found time to go on plant hunting trips in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)]] (Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens 2007).

In 1885, Manning married his wife, Nellie Hamblin Pratt.  Three years later, he left his father’s nursery pursuing his goal, seeking the company of the “most eminent man in the landscape profession" (Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens 2007). His searching landed him in the office of one of the most influential landscape architects of his time; [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].

Here Manning’s extensive knowledge of plant materials was utilized in the planting designs of such projects as the [[Chicago Columbian Exposition]] of 1893.  Manning was responsible for the final planting scheme and installation of the horticultural displays of the park (Karson, 1997).  At the Olmsted office, Manning also worked on the planting design of the [[Biltmore Estate]] of [[George Washington Vanderbilt II|George Vanderbilt]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] and extensive park designs in [[Milwaukee]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Chicago]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Washington, D.C.]].  Initially signed on as planting supervisor, his extensive horticultural knowledge quickly expanded his function at the firm, and during his eight-year employment, he participated in 125 projects in 22 states. While working under Olmsted, Manning gained invaluable experience in planned industrial settings, which would play a key role in his later career.  While working with [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]], a partner at the firm, on the Boston Metropolitan Park System, Manning was exposed to thorough and extensive research of a site and the method of overlaying sketches of topography, roads, water features, etc. over sketches of vegetation (Karson 2000).  This method of resource-planning would be used over and over in Manning’s career.

In 1896, Manning left the Olmsted office to begin his own business on Tremont Street near the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]].  Aware that Frederick Olmsted Sr. would pass his business on to both of his sons and partner [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]], Manning decided to start out on his own (Karson, 2000).  When Manning left the firm, Olmsted allowed him to take about 15 jobs with him; one of these clients was [[William Gwinn Mather]].  Mather heartily supported Manning and would employ him on sixty design and planning projects throughout their lives including the design of his home near Cleveland, Ohio (Karson, 1997).  Now completely in charge, Manning was able to pursue designs of styles that interested him.  This was largely an 18th-century English romantic style, adapted to the American landscape.  The product of which was a sprawling, natural design, littered with native plants (Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens 2007).  [[Charles Gillette]] served as an apprentice in his office in 1909-1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/opac/gilletteabout.htm Library of Virginia: About the Charles F. Gillette Photograph Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Birmingham District copy.jpg|125px|right|thumb|City plan of Birmingham, Alabama drawn by Warren Manning.]]
In 1919, Manning’s talents took him to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], where he worked on a new design for the city.  He recommended a radical resource-based plan which included “multiple neighborhood-based centers determined by available resources” (Karson, 2001).  He also makes note of the importance of parks throughout the city stating that “the cities that are best designed have about one-eighth of their area in parks and about one acre to 75 people” (Manning, 1919).  This approach was in direct contrast to the then popular [[City Beautiful movement]] which emphasized monumental civic centers and [[Beaux Arts architecture]] style public buildings (Karson, 2001).  The architectural design of the [[Chicago Columbian Exposition]] was based in the City Beautiful movement, but now, on his own, Manning decided on a different course following his own landscape theories which were based on the natural available resources.  This idea was the basis for his creation of the "wild garden" which he applied to many of his landscape designs.   

During his career, Manning worked on more than 1700 projects including a number of park designs, private estates, city planning, college campuses, subdivisions, golf courses, and government and community projects.  Manning’s brother joined him as a business partner between 1901 and 1904.  [[Bryant Fleming]] (1877-1946) worked for him during this period.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=102935|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Bryant Fleming House|date=October 2009|accessdate=2010-07-14 |author=Eli Schwartzberg and Linda M. Garofalini|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Together they created a revolutionary park design for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania utilizing a new drainage and sanitation system.  During the Depression years Manning’s practice did not do well and by the 1930s he was receiving very few commissions.  In 1938, Manning died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-eight (Karson, 2001). His remaining papers are collected at the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] and [[Iowa State University]]. A state forest located in [[Billerica]], [[Massachusetts]], on land he donated, is named for him.

==Manning's "wild gardens"==
Early on in his career, Manning went against the then popular formalistic approach to landscape design and emphasized a more naturalistic approach of native plants and naturalistic groupings.  The formal gardens of the late nineteenth century relied heavily on a more symmetrical design and an extensive use of ornament.  Manning describes his wild gardening as “that form of floriculture which is concerned with planting in a nature-like manner colonies of hardy plants that require a minimum of care” (Karson, 2001).  In his early, unpublished essay “The Nature Garden,” Manning writes:

:I would have you give your thoughts to a new type of gardening wherein the Landscaper recognizes, first, the beauty of existing conditions and develops this beauty to the minutest detail by the elimination of material that is out of place in a development scheme by selective thinning, grubbing, and trimming, instead of by destroying all natural ground cover vegetation or modifying the contour, character, and water context of existing soil.

This idea of selective thinning and pruning was at the core of Manning’s landscape theory.  He celebrated the smallest details in the landscape, emphasizing lichens and fungi in his design, which was contrary to his counterparts and unusual for this time in landscape design.

==Gwinn: wild garden==
In 1907, [[William Gwinn Mather]], owner of Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company, asked Manning, along with [[Charles A. Platt]] to design his property outside of [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  Manning and Platt were hired to work together, but often with conflicting landscape designs for the same property.  Platt, a more formalist designer, emphasized paths, gates and other architectural elements while Manning based his designs on the "wild garden" approach (Karson, 1995).  Manning inventoried the site’s pre-existing plants, and with selective pruning and thinning, created graceful planting groupings and spaces.  Manning also shipped plants in from neighboring states including wildflowers from [[Michigan]] and [[rhododendron]]s from [[North Carolina]] (Karson, 2004).  In 1912, Mather bought another large piece of property adjacent to the Cleveland location, at which Manning designed another "wild garden".

Privately held since 2007, Gwinn is not open to the public. [http://tclf.org/landscapes/gwinn-estate]

==Notable contributions==
In 1899, three years after leaving the firm of Olmsted Sr., Manning wrote Eliot, seeking help in creating a professional organization for landscape architects.  Eliot, however, was more interested in creating a public association.  The final product of this idea would become the American Civic Association. After this was founded, Manning returned to his desire to create a professional organization.  With the help of the [[Olmsted Brothers]], 11 charter members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] met for the first time in 1899 in [[New York City]].  In 1914, Manning would serve as president (Karson 2000).

In addition to being an influential landscape architect, Manning was also an avid writer and proponent of the conservation of America’s wilderness.  As such, Manning worked on a large mapping project (1915-1916) and wrote a “National Plan” which advocated for the conservation of American’s lands.

Manning was responsible for the restoration of his family's early colonial homestead, the [[Manning Manse]] in [[Billerica, Massachusetts]].  In the 1890s, the property was in decline, and Manning led a carefully documented rehabilition of the c. 1696 homestead.  He occupied it as a summer home until his death.  He also purchased large tracts of land surrounding the homestead, on which he maintained an office for a time.  Much of this land is now for the core of [[Warren H. Manning State Forest]].
