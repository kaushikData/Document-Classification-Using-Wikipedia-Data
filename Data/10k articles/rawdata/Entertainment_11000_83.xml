The '''1986 Pacific Cup''' was the 3rd [[Pacific Cup]], a [[rugby league]] tournament held between Pacific teams. The tournament was hosted in the Cook Islands and eventually won by the [[New Zealand Māori rugby league team|New Zealand Māori]] side, who defeated [[Samoa national rugby league team|Western Samoa]] in the final.

==Background==
The 1986 Pacific Cup was the first to be held after the cancellation of the planned 1979 version. Only the New Zealand Māori side returned from the first two editions, as this Pacific Cup had a more Pacific Island focus than the first two which included Papua New Guinea (who now had Test status) and Australian lower grade sides.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

==Squads==
*The Cook Islands included [[John Whittaker (rugby league)|John Whittaker]], [[George Lajpold]] and [[Riki Cowan]].
*Coached by [[Richard Bolton (rugby league)|Richard Bolton]], the New Zealand Māori squad included [[Gary Mercer]], [[Dave Watson (rugby league)|Dave Watson]], [[Adrian Shelford]], [[Mark Woods (rugby league)|Mark Woods]], [[Anthony Murray (rugby league)|Anthony Murray]], captain [[Sam Stewart (rugby league)|Sam Stewart]], [[Mark Horo]], [[Tawera Nikau]] and [[Mike Kuiti]]. [[Hugh McGahan]], [[Ron O'Regan]], [[Owen Wright]], Tracey McGregor, [[Andrew Vincent]] and [[Brendon Tuuta]] all pulled out of the side due to injury or professional club commitments.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book

It was the first time in over two decades that the Māori side was comprised completely of Māori players, as the side had previously also picked Polynesian players.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;
*Tokelau included [[Sam Panapa]]. The rest of the squad was selected entirely from domestic players, chosen from a population of just over 1000.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;
*Tonga included [[John Fifita]], [[George Mann (rugby league)|George Mann]], [[Dick Uluave]] and [[Robert Fonua]].

===Team of the Tournament===

'''2 A. M. in the Subway''' is a one shot, 53 second-long [[Comedy film|comedy]] filmed, and probably directed, by [[Billy Bitzer]] on 5 June 1905 at the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]]'s (AM&amp;B) studio on [[14th Street (Manhattan)]]  in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tracy|title=Art and the subway : New York underground|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=9780813544526|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYROgc2s2DgC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%222+A.+M.+in+the+Subway%22+film&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=exuU8iSKL6&amp;sig=ZtV8qoxUadWw3xDfgSnUsUop5bA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PBi5VLuSOJSOsQS6rYGwCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%222%20A.%20M.%20in%20the%20Subway%22%20film&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likely intended as a slightly racy, and therefore rather typical, subject for AM&amp;B's peepshow machine, [[Mutoscope|The Mutoscope]], ''2 A. M. in the Subway'' is a [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] of New York City's [[Nightlife|night life]] that still resonates with New Yorkers more than a century later.

==Plot summary==
A tired [[Police officer|cop]] and a subway [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] are seen waiting at a [[Rapid transit|subway]] platform, late at night. The conductor opens the doors to the train at left, and out steps an obviously [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] man carried between two women in [[fancy dress]]. The cop begins to mix it up with the three of them, and they are interrupted by another man in a [[bowler hat]]; he is carrying a large package and steps onto the train to the right after greeting the two women and the drunk man. One of the women steps forward into the frame and lifts up her skirt so that the drunk man can tie her [[Shoelaces|shoe]]. This gets the attention of the cop, who hustles the three of them onto the train; meanwhile what appears to be a pair of [[Bare legs|bare]] legs stick out from a window of a train car and are quickly withdrawn. The cop just manages to notice this, and calls all parties back out to the platform where it is revealed that the man in the bowler hat has a pair of [[Department store#New York City|department store]] [[mannequin|mannequin's]] legs with him.

==Historical background==
On May 21, 1905, [[Billy Bitzer]] had made his film ''Interior N.Y. subway, 14th St. to 42nd St.'' from the front of a [[Composite (New York City Subway car)|New York City Subway car]]; at that point the [[New York City Subway|Subway]] itself had been open only seven months. The very day that subject was submitted for [[copyright]], this one was made at the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph studio]]; it was copyrighted on 20 June. Although the six [[actor]]s involved are unidentified, the action is obviously tightly coordinated in order to get all of the action into such a short subject.
AM&amp;B sent two [[paper print]]s of this film for copyright, and the better of the two copies was rephotographed for [[Film preservation|preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/varsmp/0896.mov&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1847">The '''Afghan Mobile Mini Children's Circus''' (MMCC) is a traveling educational entertainment group in [[Afghanistan]]. MMCC accepts children aged 5–17 to learn [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[acrobatics]], [[singing]], [[comedy]], [[theater]] and [[magic trick]]s.  Their goal is to bring laughter back to the children of the war-torn country. 
 
The Mobile Mini-Circus for Children was established as a nonprofit organization established in 2002 to work with orphaned and traumatized children. After decades of war, the Mobile Mini-Circus for Children aims to unlock the creativity and spirit of fun in Afghan children by bringing tools for storytelling, performance, and public expression to children across Afghanistan. Circus members act as teachers for the children, holding three days of workshops on circus skills such as puppetry, walking on stilts, and juggling. With help from circus trainers and a group of traveling children-artists, mostly orphans, Afghan children create a show for the community over the first two days and then perform it on the third day.

During the summer of 2006, a group of 13 MMCC children artists visited Japan to perform and make friendship across borders.

'''Archie Giant Series''' was a comic book title published by [[Archie Comics]] from [[1954 in comics|1954]] to [[1992 in comics|1992]].  The book featured an ever revolving subtitle. It began in 1954 as ''Archie's Christmas Stocking'', and continued with this title for six issues. Although the ''Christmas Stocking'' title appeared again in later issues, the book began to feature a number of different titles, each with the cover heading ''Archie Giant Series''. Titles included ''World of Archie'', ''World of Jughead'', ''Katy Keene'', ''Betty and Veronica Summer Spectacular'', ''Sabrina's Christmas Magic'' and many others.  One additional interesting item about this title is that it twice skipped in its numbering.  Numbering continued up to #35, then skipped to #136.  Again after reaching #251, the title skipped to #452.  It became a regular 32-page book in the mid-1970s while still keeping "Giant" in the title. Finally the title ended in 1992 with #632 and was replaced with quarterly books ''[[Archie and Friends]]'', ''[[Betty and Veronica Spectacular]]'', and ''[[World of Archie]]''.

'''Behaviour Interactive Inc.''' ({{lang-fr|Behaviour Intéractif Inc.}}, stylized as '''bE HAVIOUR''') is a Canadian video game development studio specializing in the production of 2D and 3D action/adventure games for [[home video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[personal computer]]s.

==History==
The company was founded in 1992 in [[Quebec City]] by Rémi Racine as Megatoon Entertainment Group.&lt;ref name=JoystiqRebrands /&gt;&lt;ref name=GamasutraJobs&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamasutra Jobs - Behaviour Interactive|url=http://jobs.gamasutra.com/company/behaviour-interactive-128823|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Racine co-founded a Montreal-based Multimedia Interactive (MMI) to develop interactive entertainment software for CD-ROM.&lt;ref name=BehaviourHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History |url=http://www.bhvr.com/about-us/our-history/ |publisher=Behaviour Interactive inc. |accessdate=September 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901170653/http://www.bhvr.com/about-us/our-history/ |archivedate=September 1, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies were sold to Malofilm Communications in 1996, and a year later, they were merged into Behaviour Interactive.&lt;ref name=BehaviourHistory /&gt; In 1999, Racine and some investors bought the studio back, but they had to rename it, changing the name in 2000 to Artificial Mind &amp; Movement Inc. (A2M).&lt;ref name=JoystiqRebrands /&gt;&lt;ref name=BehaviourHistory /&gt; In November 2008, the company acquired [[Santiago]]-based [[Behaviour Santiago|Wanako Games]] from [[Activision Blizzard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author1=A2M|title=A2M Acquires Chilean Developer Wanako Games|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aAvba_nfh3fs|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=September 7, 2014|date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first and largest South American game studio.&lt;ref name=BehaviourHistory /&gt; By 2010, the studio's name was reverted to Behaviour Interactive, partly due to increased production of original titles and thus stronger presence in the gaming community, partly due to the availability of the original name, and partly due to [[Ass to mouth|one particular obscene interpretation]] of the initialism "A2M".&lt;ref name=JoystiqRebrands&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Christopher|title=Artificial Mind and Movement rebrands; (re)introducing Behaviour Interactive|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/08/artificial-mind-and-movement-rebrands-re-introducing-behaviour/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=September 7, 2014|date=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bethesda infringement lawsuit ==
On June 21, 2018, [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda Softworks LLC]] sued [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]] and Behaviour Interactive Inc. over Westworld, an Android/iOS mobile game based on the science fiction/thriller TV series &amp; franchise [[Westworld]], alleging that the game is a "blatant rip-off" of [[Fallout Shelter]], another mobile game, co-developed by Behaviour.

In a suit filed in a Maryland U.S. District Court, Bethesda alleges that Westworld — developed by Behaviour — "has the same or highly similar game design, art style, animations, features and other gameplay elements" as Fallout Shelter. Bethesda sued for copyright infringement, breach of contract and misappropriating trade secrets, seeking a jury trial and damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/22/17492806/bethesda-lawsuit-warner-bros-westworld-mobile-game-fallout-shelter|title=Bethesda sues Warner Bros, calls its Westworld game 'blatant rip-off' of Fallout Shelter|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit also alleges that the Westworld game identically reproduces some [[software bug]]s that were originally present in Fallout Shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-sues-warner-for-ripping-off-fallout-shelter-in-its-westworld-game/|title=Bethesda sues Warner for ripping off Fallout Shelter in its Westworld game|publisher=PC Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christmas in July''' is a [[Christmas]] celebration held in the month of [[July]], the nature of which differs by hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://karenlangston.com/2012/07/what-is-christmas-in-july/|title=What is christmas in July|date=2012-07-25|website=karenlangston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''[[Werther]]'', an 1892 French opera with libretto by [[Édouard Blau]], [[Paul Milliet]], and [[Georges Hartmann]], had an English translation published in 1894 by Elizabeth Beall Ginty. In the story, a group of children rehearses a Christmas song in July, to which a character responds: "When you sing Christmas in July, you rush the season." It is a translation of the French: "vous chantez Noël en juillet... c'est s'y prendre à l'avance."&lt;ref&gt;Act I, Scene II.&lt;/ref&gt; This opera is based on [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. Christmas features in the book, but July does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/opera-music/Later-opera-in-France#ref395758|title=opera - Later opera in France {{!}} music|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the National Recreation Association's journal ''Recreation'' described what a Christmas in July was like at a girl's camp, writing that "all mystery and wonder surround this annual event."&lt;ref&gt;"Christmas in July", ''Recreation'', 1935, vol. 29, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, if not the exact concept, was given national attention with the release of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movie comedy ''[[Christmas in July (film)|Christmas in July]]'' in 1940, written and directed by [[Preston Sturges]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0032338/ Christmas in July], Internet Movie Database.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, a man is fooled into believing he has won $25,000 in an advertising slogan contest. He buys presents for family, friends, and neighbors, and proposes marriage to his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sturges|first=Preston|title=Christmas in July|date=1940-10-18|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032338/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, the [[Calvary Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.)|Calvary Baptist Church]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] celebrated Christmas in July with carols and the sermon "Christmas Presents in July".&lt;ref&gt;"Christmas in July Theme of Calvary Church Service", ''The Washington Post'', July 11, 1942, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; They repeated it in 1943, with a Christmas tree covered with donations. The pastor explained that the special service was patterned after a program held each summer at his former church in [[Philadelphia]], when the congregation would present Christmas gifts early to give ample time for their distribution to missions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;"Calvary Baptist Church Holds 'Christmas-in-July' Service", ''The Washington Post'', July 12, 1943, p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; It became an annual event, and in 1945, the service began to be broadcast over local radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianpress.com/opinion/320-christmas-in-july-bah-humbug.html|title=Christmas in July? Bah Humbug!|last=Jones|first=Russ|website=www.christianpress.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] officials, in conjunction with the American advertising and greeting card industries, threw a Christmas in July luncheon in New York in 1944 to promote an early Christmas mailing campaign for service men overseas during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;"'Christmas in July' Luncheon Opens Drive To Speed Gift Mailing to Armed Forces", ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1944, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The luncheon was repeated in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clausnet.com/blogs/entry/443-ever-wonder-where-christmas-in-july-came-from/|title=Ever wonder where Christmas in July came from?|website=ClausNet|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American advertisers began using Christmas in July themes in print for summertime sales as early as 1950.&lt;ref&gt;"It's Christmas in July at Browning King" (advertisement), ''The New York Times'', July 20, 1950, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it is more often used as a marketing tool than an actual holiday. Television stations may choose to re-run Christmas specials, and many stores have Christmas in July sales. Some individuals choose to celebrate Christmas in July themselves, typically as an intentionally transparent excuse to have a party. This is in part because most bargainers tend to sell Christmas goods around July to make room for next year's inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3013713/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/christmas-in-july-for-marketers-looking-to-gain-an-edge-ab|title=Christmas In July?

==Celebrations==
===Southern Hemisphere===
[[File:Christmas in july au.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas in July promotional banner in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].]]
In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], seasons are in reverse to the [[Northern Hemisphere]], with [[summer]] falling in [[December]], [[January]], and [[February]], and with [[winter]] falling in [[June]], [[July]], and [[August]]. Therefore, in some southern hemisphere countries, such as [[Comoros]], [[Madagascar]], [[Bolivia]], [[Angola]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Paraguay]], [[Samoa]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Christmas in July or '''Midwinter Christmas''' events are undertaken in order to have Christmas with a winter feel in common with the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Mountains Yulefest: Christmas in July|url=http://goaustralia.about.com/od/eventsandfestivals/a/yulefest.htm|publisher=goaustralia.about.com|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mid Winter Christmas|url=http://www.guidetoauckland.co.nz/articles/2010/06/mid-winter-christmas/|publisher=guidetoauckland.co.nz|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ho ho how to celebrate Christmas in July|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/christmas-in-july|publisher=capetownmagazine.com|accessdate=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries still celebrate Christmas on December 25, in their summer, like the northern hemisphere.

===Northern Hemisphere===
In the Northern Hemisphere, a Christmas in July celebration is deliberately [[irony|ironic]]; the July climate is typically hot and either sunny or rainy, as opposed to the cold and [[White Christmas (weather)|snowy conditions]] traditionally associated with Christmas celebrations in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Some people throw parties during July that mimic Christmas celebrations, bringing the atmosphere of Christmas but with warmer temperatures. Parties may include [[Santa Claus]], [[ice cream]] and other cold foods, and gifts. [[Nightclubs]] often host parties open to the public. Christmas in July is usually recognized as July 12 but also sometimes celebrated on July 25.

The Hallmark Channel and its companion outlets ([[Hallmark Drama]] and [[Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries]]) run blocks of their original Christmas television films in July to coincide with the release of the Keepsake Ornaments in stores, thus literally making the event a [[Hallmark holiday]] (an accusation that Hallmark Cards officially denies).

Every July, the television home shopping channel [[QVC]] has Christmas in July sales, mostly decor and early gift ideas for children.  What was once a 24-hour block of holiday shopping every July 25 (or the closest weekend day to it) has become a month-long event: generally, the sales begin on July 1 and are showcased throughout the day, with various blocks of holiday sale programming sales throughout the month. Generally during the last week of July, QVC will dedicate entire days to holiday sales.

There is also Christmas in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLs233emC6M|title=Bill Maher - Atheists and Rick Perry's Christmas Law|first=|last=SkepticStream|date=24 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some western countries, July has a limited number of marketing opportunities. In the United States and Canada, for example, there are no national holidays between the first week of July ([[Canada Day]] on July 1 in Canada and [[Independence Day (United States)|American Independence Day]] on July 4 in the United States) and Labor/Labour Day (the first Monday in September for both the [[Labor Day|US]] and [[Labour Day#Canada|Canada]]), leaving a stretch of about two months with no holidays (some Canadian provinces hold a [[Civic Holiday]], but neither Canada nor the United States has ever recognized a national holiday during that month). The late July period provides relatively few opportunities for [[merchandising]], since it is typically after the peak of summer product sales in June and early July, but before the "[[back to school (marketing)|back to school]]" shopping period begins in August. Therefore, to justify sales promotions, shops (such as [[Leon's]] in Canada) will sometimes announce a "Christmas in July" sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/christmas-in-july/|title=Christmas in July Sales Flourish, SMBs Should Take Notice|date=2015-07-15|website=The BigCommerce Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Denmark people may have small Christmas celebrations and put up decorations for what is known as 'Jul i Juli' (translated as 'Christmas in July'). It is a simple play on words that has come to be celebrated by some, although it is not an official holiday.

====Christmas in August (Yellowstone, USA)====
In the 1950s, the Christmas in July celebration became a [[Christmas in August (Yellowstone)|Christmas in August]] celebration at [[Yellowstone National Park]], to accommodate [[A Christian Ministry in the National Parks|ACMNP's]] annual performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60999-c15819/Yellowstone-National-Park:Wyoming:Yellowstone.S.Christmas.In.August.html|title=Yellowstone National Park: Yellowstone’s Christmas in August! - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. W. Waterhouse - Circe Invidiosa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Circe Invidiosa]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] (1892)]]

The sorceress '''[[Circe]]''' is a figure from Greek mythology whose father was the sun ([[Helios]]) and whose mother was an ocean nymph. She appears in three separate stories. The best known is when [[Odysseus]] visits her island of Aeaea on the way back from the [[Trojan War]] and she changes most of his crew into swine. He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her for a year and has a child called [[Telegonus]] by her. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of [[Picus]], an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her fall in love with the sea-god [[Glaucus]], who prefers the nymph [[Scylla]] to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a monster.

In the eyes of those from a later age, this behaviour made her notorious both as a magician and as a type of the sexually free woman. As such she has been frequently depicted in all the arts from the [[Renaissance]] down to modern times. Among women she has been portrayed more sympathetically.

==Literary themes==

===Reasoning beasts===
One of the most enduring literary themes connected with the figure of Circe was her ability to change men into animals. There was much speculation concerning how this could be, whether the human consciousness changed at the same time, and even whether it was a change for the better. In the 1st century, [[Plutarch]] took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his ''[[Moralia]]'' is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human. They then engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Vol. XII of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1957, at the [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Gryllus*.html Chicago University site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gryllus dialogue was taken up by another Italian writer, [[Giovan Battista Gelli]], in his ''La Circe'' (1549). This is a series of ten philosophical and moral dialogues between Ulysses and the humans transformed into various animals, ranging from an oyster to an elephant, in which Circe sometimes joins. Most argue against changing back; only the last animal, a philosopher in its former existence, wants to.&lt;ref&gt;The English translation of 1754 is available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=zrgFAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false GoogleBooks]&lt;/ref&gt; The English poet [[Edmund Spenser]] also makes reference to Plutarch's dialogue in the section of his ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' (1590) based on the Circe episode which appears at the end of Book II. Sir Guyon changes back the victims of Acrasia's erotic frenzy in the Bower of Bliss, most of whom are abashed at their fall from chivalric grace,

:But one above the rest in speciall,
:That had an hog beene late, hight Grille by name,
:Repined greatly, and did him miscall,
:That had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall.&lt;ref&gt;Book 2.12, stanza 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other Italians wrote rather different works that centre on the animal within the human. One was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in his unfinished long poem, ''L'asino d'oro'' (The golden ass, 1516). The author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by Circe's herd of beasts. After spending a night of love with him, she explains the characteristics of the animals in her charge: the lions are the brave, the bears are the violent, the wolves are those forever dissatisfied, and so on (Canto 6). In Canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration: a cat that has allowed its prey to escape; an agitated dragon; a fox constantly on the look-out for traps; a dog that bays the moon; Aesop's [[The Lion in Love (fable)|lion in love]] that allowed himself to be deprived of his teeth and claws. There are also emblematic satirical portraits of various Florentine personalities. In the eighth and last canto he has a conversation with a pig that, like the Gryllus of Plutarch, does not want to be changed back and condemns human greed, cruelty and conceit.&lt;ref&gt;There is a French translation in ''Oeuvres complètes'' X, Paris 1825, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KkgTAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA403#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.401-453]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other Italian author was the esoteric philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who wrote in Latin. His ''Cantus Circaeus'' (The Incantation of Circe) was the fourth work on memory and the association of ideas by him to be published in 1582. It contains a series of poetic dialogues, in the first of which, after a long series of incantations to the seven planets of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic tradition]], most humans appear changed into different creatures in the scrying bowl. The sorceress Circe is then asked by her handmaiden Moeris about the type of behaviour with which each is associated. According to Circe, for instance, fireflies 'are the learned, wise, and illustrious amidst idiots, asses, and obscure men' (Question 32). In later sections different characters discuss the use of images in the imagination in order to facilitate use of the [[art of memory]], which is the real aim of the work.&lt;ref&gt;The original and its English translation is available [http://www.tomaszahora.org/CantusCircaeusTranslation.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

French writers were to take their lead from Gelli in the following century.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the information that follows can be found discussed in Brigitte Urbani, ''Vaut-il "mieux mille fois être ânes qu'être hommes"? Quelques réécritures de La Circe de Giovan Battista Gelli'', INT Chroniques 69/70. 2002 [http://chroniquesitaliennes.univ-paris3.fr/PDF/69-70/69-Urbani.pdf pp. 163-81]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Jacob]] wrote a one-act social comedy in rhyme, ''Les Bestes raisonnables'' (The Reasoning Beasts, 1661) which allowed him to satirise contemporary manners. On the isle of Circe, Ulysses encounters an ass that was once a doctor, a lion that had been a valet, a female doe and a horse, all of whom denounce the decadence of the times. The ass sees human asses everywhere,

:Asses in the town square, asses in the suburbs,
:Asses in the provinces, asses proud at court,
:Asses browsing in the meadows, military asses trooping,
:Asses tripping it at balls, asses in the theatre stalls.
To drive the point home, in the end it is only the horse, formerly a courtesan, who wants to return to her former state.

The same theme occupies [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine's]] late fable, "The Companions of Ulysses" (XII.1, 1690), that also echoes Plutarch and Gelli. Once transformed, every animal (which include a lion, a bear, a wolf and a mole) protest that their lot is better and refuse to be restored to human shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/la_fontaine/jean_de/fables/book12.html#book12.1|title=The Fables of La Fontaine, by Jean de La Fontaine : BOOK XII.|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Dennis shifted this fable to stand at the head of his translation of La Fontaine, ''Select Fables'' (1754), but provides his own conclusion that

[[File:G.B.Trotti Circe.jpg|thumb|An Italian fresco of Circe returning the followers of Ulysses to human form (c. 1610)|alt=|300x300px]]

:When Mortals from the path of Honour stray,
:And the strong passions over reason sway,
:What are they then but Brutes?
:'Tis vice alone that constitutes
:Th'enchanting wand and magic bowl,
:The exterior form of Man they wear,
:But are in fact both Wolf and Bear,
:The transformation's in the Soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CK4iXvnRAXQC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=da54sqh6SF&amp;dq=Denis++choice+of+fables&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=Ulysses&amp;f=false|title=Select fables|first=Charles|last=Denis|date=23 June 2018|publisher=Tonson and Draper|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Fuzelier]] and [[Marc-Antoine Legrand]] titled their comic opera of 1718 ''Les animaux raisonnables''. It had more or less the same scenario transposed into another medium and set to music by [[Jacques Aubert]]. Circe, wishing to be rid of the company of Ulysses, agrees to change back his companions, but only the dolphin is willing. The others, who were formerly a corrupt judge (now a wolf), a financier (a pig), an abused wife (a hen), a deceived husband (a bull) and a flibbertigibbet (a linnet), find their present existence more agreeable.

The Venetian [[Gasparo Gozzi]] was another Italian who returned to Gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose ''Dialoghi dell'isola di Circe'' (Dialogues from Circe's Island) published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764. In this moral work, the aim of Ulysses in talking to the beasts is to learn more of the human condition. It includes figures from fable ([[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The fox and the crow]], XIII) and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island. The philosopher here is not Gelli's elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness, like Bruno's fireflies (VI). The only one who wishes to change in Gozzi's work is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX).

There were two more satirical dramas in later centuries. One modelled on the Gryllus episode in Plutarch occurs as a chapter of [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s late novel, ''[[Gryll Grange]]'' (1861), under the title "Aristophanes in London". Half Greek comedy, half Elizabethan masque, it is acted at the Grange by the novel's characters as a Christmas entertainment. In it [[Spiritualist]] [[mediumship|mediums]] raise Circe and Gryllus and try to convince the latter of the superiority of modern times, which he rejects as intellectually and materially regressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21514?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Gryll Grange by Thomas Love Peacock|publisher=|via=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Italian work drawing on the transformation theme was the comedy by [[:it:Ettore Romagnoli|Ettore Romagnoli]], ''La figlia del Sole'' (The Daughter of the Sun, 1919). [[Hercules]] arrives on the island of Circe with his servant Cercopo and has to be rescued by the latter when he too is changed into a pig. But, since the naturally innocent other animals had become corrupted by imitating human vices, the others who had been changed were refused when they begged to be rescued.

Also in England, [[Austin Dobson]] engaged more seriously with Homer's account of the transformation of Odysseus' companions when, though

:Head, face and members bristle into swine,
:Still cursed with sense, their mind remains alone.&lt;ref&gt;Pope's translation of the Odyssey, Book X, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUoIAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;ots=A2clHXZYnt&amp;dq=%22Head%2C%20face%20and%20members%20bristle%20into%20swine%22&amp;pg=PA233#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Head,%20face%20and%20members%20bristle%20into%20swine%22&amp;f=false lines 279-80]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobson's "[[Wikisource:Littell's Living Age/Volume 127/Issue 1640/The Prayer of the Swine to Circe|The Prayer of the Swine to Circe]]"&lt;ref&gt;''Vignettes in Rhyme and other verses'', US edition 1880, [https://archive.org/stream/vignettesinrhyme00dobsuoft#page/206/mode/2up/search/Circe pp.206-10]&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the horror of being imprisoned in an animal body in this way with the human consciousness unchanged. There appears to be no relief, for only in the final line is it revealed that Odysseus has arrived to free them.

But in [[Matthew Arnold]]'s dramatic poem "The Strayed Reveller" (1849),&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold, ''The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems'', London 1849, [http://www.telelib.com/authors/A/ArnoldMatthew/verse/strayedreveller/strayedreveller.html pp.11-27]&lt;/ref&gt; in which Circe is one of the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet's participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced, he craves for it to be continued.&lt;ref&gt;M. G. Sundell, "Story and Context in "The Strayed Reveller",  Victorian Poetry 3.3, West Virginia University 1965, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20171700?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents pp. 161-170]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual politics===
[[File:Ulisse e Circe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Annibale Carracci]]'s ''Ulysses and Circe'' ({{c.|lk=no|1590}}) in the [[Farnese Palace]]]]

With the Renaissance there began to be a reinterpretation of what it was that changed the men, if it was not simply magic. For [[Socrates]], in Classical times, it had been gluttony overcoming their self-control.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon's ''Memorabilia of Socrates'' [http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Memorabilia.html Book I, 3.7]&lt;/ref&gt; But for the influential emblematist [[Andrea Alciato]], it was unchastity. In the second edition of his ''Emblemata'' (1546), therefore, Circe became the type of the prostitute. His Emblem 76 is titled ''Cavendum a meretricibus''; its accompanying Latin verses mention Picus, Scylla and the companions of Ulysses, and concludes that 'Circe with her famous name indicates a whore and any who loves such a one loses his reason'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/emblem.php?id=A46a016|title=Alciato at Glasgow: Emblem: Cavendum à meretricibus.|website=www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His English imitator [[Geoffrey Whitney]] used a variation of Alciato's illustration in his own ''Choice of Emblemes'' (1586) but gave it the new title of ''Homines voluptatibus transformantur'', men are transformed by their passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/alciato/whit/w082.html|title=Whitney 82|website=www.mun.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains her appearance in the Nighttown section named after her in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 15, Circe|Ulysses]]''. Written in the form of a stage script, it makes of Circe the brothel madam, Bella Cohen. Bloom, the book's protagonist, fantasizes that she turns into a cruel man-tamer named Mr Bello who makes him get down on all fours and rides him like a horse.&lt;ref&gt;The text is at [http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/15 Online Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be a mythical figure. Poets treated her either as an individual or at least as the type of a certain kind of woman. The French poet [[Joseph Albert Alexandre Glatigny|Albert Glatigny]] addresses "Circé" in his ''Les vignes folles'' (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;French text [http://www.mediterranees.net/mythes/ulysse/epreuves/circe/glatigny.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis-Nicolas Ménard]]"'s sonnet in ''Rêveries d'un païen mystique'' (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality.&lt;ref&gt;French text [http://www.mediterranees.net/mythes/ulysse/epreuves/circe/menard.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. [[John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley|Lord de Tabley]]"'s "Circe" (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... With freckled cheeks and splotch'd side serpentine, A gipsy among flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/246/757.html ''A Victorian Anthology''] 1837-95&lt;/ref&gt; That central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of [[T.S.Eliot]]'s student poem "Circe's Palace" (1909) in the [[Harvard Advocate]]. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that 'look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.std.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html|title=T.S. Eliot's 'Harvard Advocate' Poems|website=world.std.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a temptress, she has become an emasculatory threat.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Miller Jnr, ''T.S. Eliot: The Making Of An American Poet'', Pennsylvania State University 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq-lfNXrIDAC&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;ots=XQC16Ht7Cw&amp;dq=%22Circe%22%20%20T.S.Eliot&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Circe%22%20%20T.S.Eliot&amp;f=false p.71]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several women poets make Circe stand up for herself, using the soliloquy form to voice the woman's position. The 19th-century English poet [[Augusta Webster]], much of whose writing explored the female condition, has a dramatic monologue in blank verse titled "Circe" in her volume ''Portraits'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;The whole text can be read on [http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/circe PoemHunter]&lt;/ref&gt; There the sorceress anticipates her meeting with Ulysses and his men and insists that she does not turn men into pigs—she merely takes away the disguise that makes them seem human.

:But any draught, pure water, natural wine,
:out of my cup, revealed them to themselves
:and to each other. Change? there was no change;
:only disguise gone from them unawares.

The mythological character of the speaker contributes at a safe remove to the Victorian discourse on women's sexuality by expressing female desire and criticizing the subordinate role given to women in heterosexual politics.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Sutphin, The representation of women's heterosexual desire in Augusta Webster's "Circe" and "Medea in Athens", Women's Writing 5.3, 1998, pp. 373-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Two American poets also explored feminine psychology in poems ostensibly about the enchantress. Leigh Gordon Giltner's "Circe" was included in her collection ''The Path of Dreams'' (1900), the first stanza of which relates the usual story of men turned to swine by her spell. But then a second stanza presents a sensuous portrait of an unnamed woman, very much in the French vein; once more, it concludes, 'A Circe's spells transform men into swine'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Path of Dreams'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27024/27024-h/27024-h.htm#Page_54 p.54]&lt;/ref&gt; This is no passive victim of male projections but a woman conscious of her sexual power. So too is [[Hilda Doolittle]]'s "Circe", from her collection ''Hymen'' (1921). In her soliloquy she reviews the conquests with which she has grown bored, then mourns the one instance when she failed. In not naming Ulysses himself, H.D. universalises an emotion with which all women might identify.&lt;ref&gt;''Hymen'', [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/doolittle/hymen/1921-circe.html pp.21-2]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the century, the British poet [[Carol Ann Duffy]] wrote a monologue entitled ''Circe'' which pictures the goddess addressing an audience of 'nereids and nymphs'. In this outspoken episode in the war between the sexes, Circe describes the various ways in which all parts of a pig could and should be cooked.&lt;ref&gt;''The World's Wife'', London 1999; the text is on the [http://www.porkopolis.org/library/pig-poetry/carol-ann-duffy Porkopolis site]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dosso Dossi 003.jpg|thumb|[[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Circe and Her Lovers'', c.1525, National Gallery, London|alt=|250x250px]]

Another indication of the progression in interpreting the Circe figure is given by two poems a century apart, both of which engage with paintings of her. The first is the sonnet that [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote in response to [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' "The Wine of Circe" in his volume ''Poems'' (1870). It gives a faithful depiction of the painting's [[Pre-Raphaelite]] mannerism but its description of Circe's potion as 'distilled of death and shame' also accords with the contemporary (male) identification of Circe with perversity. This is further underlined by his statement (in a letter) that the black panthers there are 'images of ruined passion' and by his anticipation at the end of the poem of 'passion's tide-strown shore Where the disheveled seaweed hates the sea'.&lt;ref&gt;Painting and poem are juxtaposed on the [http://preraphaelitesisterhood.com/the-wine-of-circe-by-edward-burne-jones-poem-by-dante-gabriel-rossetti Pre-Raphaelite Sisterhood site]; the letter to Barbara Bodichon is quoted on the [http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/24-1869.raw.html Rossetti Archive site]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian [[A. D. Hope]]'s "Circe - after the painting by Dosso Dossi", on the other hand, frankly admits humanity's animal inheritance as natural and something in which even Circe shares. In the poem, he links the fading rationality and speech of her lovers to her own animal cries in the act of love.&lt;ref&gt;''A Late Picking – poems 1965-74'', quoted in the [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/hope-a-d/circe-0417019 Australian Poetry Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

There remain some poems that bear her name that have more to do with their writers' private preoccupations than with reinterpreting her myth. The link with it in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s "Circe/Mud Poems", first published in ''You Are Happy'' (1974), is more a matter of allusion and is nowhere overtly stated beyond the title. It is a reflection on contemporary gender politics that scarcely needs the disguises of Augusta Webster's.&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Poems'', Boston 1976 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv2dfKp74sAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=circe&amp;f=false pp.201-23]&lt;/ref&gt; With two other poems by male writers it is much the same: [[Louis Macneice]]'s, for example, whose "Circe" appeared in his first volume, ''Poems'' (London, 1935); or [[Robert Lowell]]'s, whose "Ulysses and Circe" appeared in his last, ''Day by Day'' (New York, 1977). Both poets have appropriated the myth to make a personal statement about their broken relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Polden, ''Regeneration: Journey Through the Mid-Life Crisis'', London 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nXSWIIugy_0C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Louis+Macneice,+%22Circe%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9GSBY1K7Nh&amp;sig=uPuMKY4G6oYW1LXCopyl63i9nuU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bZdpUPLFJIXF0QX6x4DQAw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Louis%20Macneice%2C%20%22Circe%22&amp;f=false pp 124-8]; "Ulysses is of course one more surrogate for the poet", Bruce Michelson, ''Lowell Versus Lowell'', Virginia Quarterly Review, Winter 1983, [http://www.vqronline.org/essay/lowell-versus-lowell pp.22-39]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallels and sequels===
Several [[Renaissance]] epics of the 16th century include lascivious sorceresses based on the Circe figure. These generally live in an isolated spot devoted to pleasure, to which lovers are lured and later changed into beasts. They include the following:
*Alcina in the ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (Mad Roland, 1516, 1532) of [[Ludovico Ariosto]], set at the time of [[Charlemagne]]. Among its many sub-plots is the episode in which the [[Saracen]] champion Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress and has to be freed from her magic island.&lt;ref&gt;There is a translation on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/615/pg615.html Gutenberg site]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The lovers of Filidia in ''Il Tancredi'' (1632) by Ascanio Grandi (1567–1647) have been changed into monsters and are liberated by the virtuous Tancred.&lt;ref&gt;Merritt Y. Hughes, ''Spenser's Acrasia and the Circe of the Renaissance'', Journal of the History of Ideas IV.4, 1943, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707165?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents p.383]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Armida]] in [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''La Gerusalemme liberata'' (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', 1566-1575, published 1580) is a Saracen sorceress sent by the infernal senate to sow discord among the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] camped before Jerusalem, where she succeeds in changing a party of them into animals. Planning to assassinate the hero, Rinaldo, she falls in love with him instead and creates an enchanted garden where she holds him a lovesick prisoner who has forgotten his former identity.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fairfax's 1600 translation is available at the [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/392/pg392.html Gutenberg site]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Acrasia in Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, mentioned above, is a seductress of knights and holds them enchanted in her Bower of Bliss.

In addition, it has been argued that [[Titania]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600) is an inversion of Circe.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Olson, Beyond a Common Joy: An Introduction to Shakespearean Comedy, University of Nebraska 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_cJE15y9FmIC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;ots=4KqlmnUV-B&amp;dq=Titania%20%22Circe%22&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=Titania%20%22Circe%22&amp;f=false pp 79-82]&lt;/ref&gt; Titania (daughter of the Titans) was a title by which the sorceress was known in Classical times. In this case the tables are turned on the character, who is queen of the fairies. She is made to love an ass after, rather than before, he is transformed into his true animal likeness.

[[File:Comus with his revellers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.055|William Blake's watercolour of Comus and his animal-headed revellers, 1815]]

It has further been suggested that [[John Milton]]'s [[Comus (John Milton)|''Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle'']] (1634) is a sequel to ''[[Tempe Restored]],'' a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is a reversal of the Greek myth.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Demaray, "Milton's ''Comus:'' The Sequel to a Masque of Circe," ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 29 (1966), pp. 245-54.&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the [[masque]], the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by Bacchus, god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity.&lt;ref&gt;The text is on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19819/19819-h/19819-h.htm Gutenberg site]&lt;/ref&gt; The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.

In the 20th century, the Circe episode was to be re-evaluated in two poetic sequels to the Odyssey. In the first of these, [[Giovanni Pascoli]]'s ''L'Ultimo Viaggio'' (The Last Voyage, 1906), the aging hero sets out to rediscover the emotions of his youth by retracing his journey from Troy, only to discover that the island of Eea is deserted. What in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and Circe's song was now no more than the sound of the sea-wind in autumnal oaks (Cantos 16-17).&lt;ref&gt;The Italian text is at the [http://www.fondazionepascoli.it/Poesie/pc22.htm Fondazioni Pascoli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721115238/http://www.fondazionepascoli.it/Poesie/pc22.htm |date=2009-07-21 }}; there is a discussion of the work in Mario Truglio, ''Beyond the Family Romance: The Legend of Pascoli'', University of Toronto 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nlOvSf7Of4MC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=__Y5Ic6qdw&amp;dq=Pascoli%20%20%22Circe%22&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=Pascoli%20%20%22Circe%22&amp;f=false pp 65-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

This melancholy dispelling of illusion is echoed in ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'' (1938) by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. The fresh voyage in search of new meaning to life recorded there grows out of the hero's initial rejection of his past experiences in the first two sections. The Circe episode is viewed by him as a narrow escape from death of the spirit.
:With twisted hands and thighs we rolled on burning sands,

:a hanging mess of hissing vipers glued in sun!...
:Farewell the brilliant voyage, ended! Prow and soul
:moored in the muddy port of the contented beast!
:O prodigal, much-traveled soul, is this your country?"

His escape from this mire of sensuality comes one day when the sight of some fishermen, a mother and her baby enjoying the simple comforts of food and drink, recalls him to life, its duties and delights.&lt;ref&gt;The translation of Kimon Friar, New York 1958, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/10986184/The-Odyssey-A-Modern-Sequel-by-Nikos-Kazantzakis Book 2, pp.126-9]&lt;/ref&gt; Where the attempt by Pascoli's hero to recapture the past ended in failure, Kazantzakis' Odysseus, already realising the emptiness of his experiences, journeys into what he hopes will be a fuller future.

==Musical treatments==

===Classical ballet===
[[File:Martha Graham's Circe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Circe enchanting Ulysses in the 2012 revival of Martha Graham's ''Circe'']]

After classical ballet separated from theatrical spectacle into a wordless form in which the story is expressed solely through movement, the subject of Circe was rarely visited. It figured as the first episode of three with mythological themes in ''Les Fêtes Nouvelles'' (New shows), staged by Sieur Duplessis le cadet in 1734, but the work was taken off after its third performance and not revived.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine de Léris, ''Dictionnaire des Théâtres'', Paris 1763,[http://operabaroque.fr/DUPLESSIS_FETES.htm online quotation]&lt;/ref&gt; The choreographer [[Antoine Pitrot]] also staged ''Ulysse dans l'isle de Circée'', describing it as a ''ballet sérieux, heroï-pantomime'' in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Marie Quérard, ''La France littéraire, ou Dictionnaire bibliographique", Paris 1835, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rirytt5V00oC&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;ots=5qekVhmm2B&amp;dq=Antoine%20Pitrot%20Ulysse%20dans%20l'isle%20de%20Circ%C3%A9e%2C%20ballet%20s%C3%A9rieux%2C%20heroi-pantomime&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q=Antoine%20Pitrot%20Ulysse%20dans%20l'isle%20de%20Circ%C3%A9e,%20ballet%20s%C3%A9rieux,%20heroi-pantomime&amp;f=false p.196]&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter there seems to be nothing until the revival of ballet in the 20th century.

In 1963 the American choreographer [[Martha Graham]] created her ''Circe'' with a score by [[Alan Hovhaness]]. Its theme is psychological, representing the battle with animal instincts. The beasts portrayed extend beyond swine and include a goat, a snake, a lion and a deer.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Allen's photographs of the ballet are available [http://www.exploredance.com/article.htm?id=514 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme has been described as one of 'highly charged erotic action', although set in 'a world where sexual frustration is rampant'.&lt;ref&gt;Jamake Highwater, ''Dance: Rituals of Experience'', Oxford University 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZOE1wrlweYC&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;ots=QS-3DzM6Nc&amp;dq=Martha%20Graham%20%20%22Circe%22&amp;pg=PA179#v=onepage&amp;q=Martha%20Graham%20%20%22Circe%22&amp;f=false pp. 179-81]&lt;/ref&gt; In that same decade [[Rudolf Brucci]] composed his ''Kirka'' (1967) in Croatia.

There is a Circe episode in [[John Harbison]]'s ''Ulysses'' (Act 1, scene 2, 1983) in which the song of the enchantress is represented by [[ondes Martenot]] and tuned percussion.&lt;ref&gt;There is an excerpt [http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/album/boston-modern-orchestra-project/john-harbison-ulysses/11283351 online]&lt;/ref&gt; After the sailors of Ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell, a battle of wills follows between Circe and the hero. Though the men are changed back, Ulysses is charmed by her in his turn. In 1993, a full scale treatment of the story followed in [[:de:Gerald Humel|Gerald Humel]]'s 2-act ''Circe und Odysseus''. Also psychological in intent, it represents Circe's seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful. The part played by the geometrical set in its Berlin production was particularly notable.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Dieter Schaal: Stage Architecture Stuttgart and London 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=spVLtZMGWO0C&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;ots=uVfc64U1ni&amp;dq=Gerald%20Humel%2C%20%22Circe%20und%20Odysseus%22&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=Gerald%20Humel,%20%22Circe%20und%20Odysseus%22&amp;f=false pp 48-51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantata and song===
Beside the verse dramas, with their lyrical interludes, on which many operas were based, there were poetic texts which were set as secular [[cantata]]s. One of the earliest was [[Alessandro Stradella]]'s ''La Circe'', in a setting for three voices that bordered on the operatic. It was first performed at [[Frascati]] in 1667 to honour Cardinal [[Leopoldo de Medici]] and contained references to its surroundings. In the opening recitative, Circe explains that it was her son Telegonus who founded Frascati. The other characters with whom she enters into dialogue are the south wind (Zeffiro) and the local river Algido.&lt;ref&gt;The entire score can be downloaded from [http://musickshandmade.com/lute/gerbodes/index/La%20Circe/page:1/sort:source/direction:asc Sarge Gerbode's site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130129071116/http://musickshandmade.com/lute/gerbodes/index/La%20Circe/page:1/sort:source/direction:asc |date=2013-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century, [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s cantata ''All'ombra di sospetto'' (In the shadow of doubt, RV 678) is set for a single voice and depicts Circe addressing Ulysses. The [[countertenor]] part is accompanied by [[flute]], [[harpsichord]], [[cello]], and [[theorbo]] and features two [[recitative]]s and two [[aria]]s. The piece is famous for the dialogue created between flute and voice, conjuring the moment of flirtation before the two become lovers.&lt;ref&gt;There is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsG1mSNHOg0&amp;feature=related YouTube]; the score is also available [https://archive.org/stream/imslp-di-sospetto-rv-678-vivaldi-antonio/WIMA.dd52-Vivaldi_cantata_fLsop#page/n0/mode/2up online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most successful treatment of the Ulysses episode in French was [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]]'s poem ''Circé'' (1703), that was specifically written to be a cantata. The different verse forms employed allow the piece to be divided by the musicians that set it in order to express a variety of emotions. The poem opens with the abandoned Circe sitting on a high mountain and mourning the departure of Ulysses. The sorceress then calls on the infernal gods and makes a terrible sacrifice:

:A myriad vapours obscure the light,
:The stars of the night interrupt their course,
:Astonished rivers retreat to their source
:And even Death's god trembles in the dark.

But though the earth is shaken to its core, Love is not to be commanded in this way and the wintery fields come back to life.&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres de Jean-Baptiste Rousseau'', Brussels 1743, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IAQ_AAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;ots=5CNT4IqlSm&amp;dq=jean%20baptiste%20rousseau%20circ%C3%A9&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q=jean%20baptiste%20rousseau%20circ%C3%A9&amp;f=false Volume 1, pp.321-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest setting was by [[:fr:Jean-Baptiste Morin|Jean-Baptiste Morin]] in 1706 and was popular for most of the rest of the century. One of its final moralising [[minuet]]s, ''Ce n'est point par effort qu'on aime'' (Love won't be forced) was often performed independently and the score reprinted in many song collections. The flautist [[Michel Blavet]] arranged the music for this and the poem's final stanza, ''Dans les champs que l'Hiver désole'' (In the fields that Winter wastes), for two flutes in 174.The new setting of the cantata three years later by [[:fr:Francois Collin de Blamont|Francois Collin de Blamont]] was equally successful and made the name of its nineteen-year-old composer. Originally for voice and bass continuo, it was expanded and considerably revised in 1729, with parts for flute, violin and [[viol]] added.&lt;ref&gt;Details are on the [http://philidor3.cmbv.fr/Parcourir/Oeuvres/COLIN-DE-BLAMONT-Francois-1690-1760-CIRCE-1725-cantate-francaise Philidor site] and there is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mN1yx7fh3w YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the century, the choral setting by Georges Granges de Fontenelle (1769–1819) was equally to bring its young composer fame.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical notes on the [http://www.musicologie.org/Biographies/f/fontenelle_granges.html Musicologie site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's poem was also familiar to composers of other nationalities. Set for [[mezzo-soprano]] and full orchestra, it was given almost operatic treatment by the court composer [[Luigi Cherubini]] in 1789. [[:it:Franz Seydelmann|Franz Seydelmann]] set it for soprano and full orchestra in Dresden in 1787 at the request of the Russian ambassador to the [[Saxony|Saxon]] Court, [[Belosselsky-Belozersky family|Prince Alexander Belosselsky]]. Although he spoke highly of Seydelmann's work, it is now judged grandiloquent and banal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Chailley]], "Les dialogues sur la musique d'Alexandre Beloselskij", ''Revue des études slaves'' 45, 1966, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/slave_0080-2557_1966_num_45_1_1911?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard&amp; pp 93-103]&lt;/ref&gt; The later setting by the Austrian composer [[Sigismond von Neukomm]] for soprano and full orchestra (Op. 4 1810) is better regarded.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript score is [http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/15130 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent treatments of the Circe theme include the Irish composer Gerald Victory's radio cantata ''Circe 1991'' (1973–75), David Gribble's ''A Threepenny Odyssey'', a fifteen-minute cantata for young people which includes the episode on Circe's Isle, and Malcolm Hayes' ''Odysseus remembers'' (2003–04), which includes parts for Circe, Anticleia and Tiresias. [[:de:Gerald Humel|Gerald Humel]]'s song cycle "Circe" (1998) grew out of his work on his 1993 ballet with Thomas Höft. The latter subsequently wrote seven poems in German featuring Circe's role as seductress in a new light: here it is to freedom and enlightenment that she tempts her hearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomas-hoeft.de/3.html|title=Thomas Hoeft site|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cycle of ''Seven Songs for High Voice and Piano'' (2008) by the American composer Martin Hennessey includes the poem "Circe's Power" from [[Louise Glück]]'s ''Meadowlands'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinhennessy.net/list2.htm|title=Martin Hennessy: Works Available Through This Site|website=www.martinhennessy.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been treatments of Circe in popular music, in particular the relation of the Odysseus episode in [[Friedrich Holländer]]'s song of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;A performance in German [http://www.discogs.com/Hanne-Wieder-Und-Friedrich-Meyer-Mit-Seiner-Studio-Band-Circe-Wiener-Schmarrn/release/957748 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, text in [[Homeric Greek]] is included in the "Circe's Island" episode in [[David Bedford]]'s ''The Odyssey'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;Track 9, available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=UG&amp;feature=related&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=ZljJBAvQzUo YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the ancestor of several later electronic suites that reference the Odysseus legend, with "Circe" titles among them, having little other programmatic connection with the myth itself.

===Programmatic music===
[[File:Circe by Wright Barker (1889).jpg|thumb|Wright Barker's 1889 painting of Circe as musician|alt=|300x300px]]While operas on the subject of Circe did not cease, they were overtaken for a while by the new musical concept of the [[symphonic poem]] which, whilst it does not use a sung text, similarly seeks a union of music and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Sadie, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', New York, 1980, 13:544&amp;ndash;545.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of purely musical works fall into this category from the late 19th century onwards, of which one of the first was [[Heinrich von Herzogenberg]]'s ''Odysseus'' (Op.16, 1873). A [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] symphony for large orchestra, dealing with the hero's return from the Trojan war, its third section is titled "Circe's Gardens" (''Die Gärten der Circe'').

In the 20th century, [[:de:Ernst Boehe|Ernst Boehe]]'s cycle ''Aus Odysseus Fahrten'' (From Odysseus'Voyage, Op.6, 1903) was equally programmatic and included the visit to Circe's Isle (''Die Insel der Circe'') as its second long section. After a depiction of the sea voyage, a bass clarinet passage introduces an ensemble of flute, harp and solo violin over a lightly orchestrated accompaniment, suggesting Circe's seductive attempt to hold Odysseus back from traveling further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Aus_Odysseus'_Fahrten,_Op.6_(Boehe,_Ernst)|title=Aus Odysseus' Fahrten, Op.6 (Boehe, Ernst) - IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library: Free Public Domain Sheet Music|website=imslp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Hovhaness]]' Circe Symphony (No.18, Op.204a, 1963) is a late example of such programmatic writing. It is, in fact, only a slightly changed version of his ballet music of that year, with the addition of more strings, a second [[timpani]]st and [[celesta]].

With the exception of [[:nl:Willem Frederik Bon|Willem Frederik Bon]]'s prelude for orchestra (1972), most later works have been for a restricted number of instruments. They include Hendrik de Regt's ''Circe'' (Op.44, 1975) for clarinet, violin and piano; [[Christian Manen]]'s ''Les Enchantements De Circe'' (Op.96, 1975) for bassoon and piano; and [[Jacques Lenot]]'s "Cir(c)é" (1986) for [[oboe d'amore]]. The German experimental musician [[Dieter Schnebel]]'s "Circe" (1988) is a work for harp, the various sections of which are titled ''Signale'' (signals), ''Säuseln'' (whispers), ''Verlockungen'' (enticements), ''Pein'' (pain), ''Schläge'' (strokes) and ''Umgarnen'' (snare), which give some idea of their programmatic intent.

Michael Amann (born 1964) provides notes for his "Kirke" for voice, violin, piano and percussion (1995). It is based on four excerpts from Homer's "Odyssey" and emphasises a variety of vocal uses for the mezzo-soprano part. He explains that 'the play between the foreseeable (deep structure) and the unexpected (surface) is for me an analogy of Ulysses (who realises Circe is a sorceress, so that the consequence of her magic is ineffective) and Odysseus' companions, whom Circe's enchantments take by surprise'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-amann.at/?id=11&amp;sprache=de&amp;to_include=werk&amp;artcat=4|title=Michael Amann - Komponist &amp; Musikpädagoge|website=Michael Amann - Komponist &amp; Musikpädagoge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questioned in an interview about how this worked in terms of his composition, he explained that this meant disrupting the musical structure once it was established and that the singer's shift between voice tones, singing and non-communicative vocalisation equates to the movement from solitude to self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikdokumentation-vorarlberg.at/miamt001.htm|title=Vorarlberg musical documentation centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominique Lemaitre's "Circé" for soprano and eight cellos (1998) is equally programmatic. In it the singer's voice floats over the instruments, creating much the same the successive emotional effects as those in settings of Rousseau's poem.&lt;ref&gt;Available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pA4JgQau-0 YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thea Musgrave]]'s "Circe" for three flutes (1996) was eventually to become the fourth piece in her six-part ''Voices from the Ancient World'' for various combinations of flute and percussion (1998). Her note on these explains that their purpose is to 'describe some of the personages of ancient Greece' and that Circe was 'the enchantress who changed men into beasts'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theamusgrave.com/html/voices_from_the_ancient_world.html Composer's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717054620/http://www.theamusgrave.com/html/voices_from_the_ancient_world.html |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent reference is the harpsichordist [[Fernando De Luca]]'s Sonata II for [[viola da gamba]], which is titled "Circe's cave" (''L'antro della maga Circe'').

Scenes from the ''Odyssey'' are common on Greek pottery, the Circe episode among them. The two most common representations have Circe surrounded by the transformed sailors and Odysseus threatening the sorceress with his sword. In the case of the former, the animals are not always boars but also include, for instance, the ram, dog and lion on the 6th century BC Boston [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/T35.6.html|title=Odysseus &amp; Circe - Ancient Greek Vase Painting|website=www.theoi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the transformation is only partial, involving the head and perhaps a sprouting tail, while the rest of the body is human. In describing an otherwise obscure 5th-century Greek bronze in the [[Walters Art Museum]] that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig,&lt;ref&gt;Walters Art Museum, acc. no. 54.1483&lt;/ref&gt; the commentator asks in what other way could an artist depict someone bewitched other than as a man with an animal head.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, "Odysseus' Companions on Circe's Isle" ''The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' '''4''' (1941:119-122) p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In these scenes Circe is shown almost invariably stirring the potion with her wand, although the incident as described in Homer has her use the wand only to bewitch the sailors after they have refreshed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' Book X [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey10.htm#_Toc90267910 lines 198ff]&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is the Berlin [[amphora]] on which the seated Circe holds the wand towards a half transformed man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/T35.4.html|title=Circe - Ancient Greek Vase Painting|website=www.theoi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Odysseus_Circe_Met_41.83.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Odysseus_Circe_Met_41.83.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|220x220px|Circe dropping her cup and fleeing [[Odysseus]] across the lower teir of an [[Attic pottery|Attic]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[krater]] ({{c.|440|lk=no}}{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}})]]

In the second scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer describes it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, as in the Athens [[lekythos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/sites/core/files/images/Untitled16.jpg|title=Columbia College|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Homer reports that it was a bow he had slung over his shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey10.htm#_Toc90267911|title=Homer (c.750 BC) - The Odyssey: Book X|website=www.poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/content/odysseus-and-circe-athenian-red-figure-lekythos-c-470-bce|title=Odysseus and Circe, Athenian red figure lekythos, c. 470 BCE. - The Core Curriculum|website=www.college.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Broudy, ''The Book of Looms'', University Press of New England 1939, [https://books.google.com/books?id=shN5_-W1RzcC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Circe%22%20pottery&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Circe%22%20pottery&amp;f=false p.23]&lt;/ref&gt; at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked.&lt;ref&gt;Book X, lines 198ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century [[skyphos]] from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=1004121&amp;objectid=399970|title=Image gallery: skyphos|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic [[satyr plays]] which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by [[Aeschylus]], [[Ephippus of Athens]] and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Thorburn, ''FOF Companion to Classical Drama'', New York 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k3NnUyqzRNYC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=sq7kt-2MFW&amp;dq=Aeschylus%2C%20%22Circe%22%20%20%22fragment%22&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q=Circe&amp;f=false p.138]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''[[Deipnosophistae]] 1.10e  'By way of denouncing drunkenness the poet [Homer] . . changes the men who visited Kirke into lions and wolves because of their self-indulgence'  (trans. Gullick) [http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Kirke.html quoted on the Theoi site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artefacts depicting the story include the chest of [[Cypselus]] described in the travelogue by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. Among its many carvings "there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I was of opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon the number of the handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which Homer mentions in his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Description of Greece'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias5B.html 5. 19. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; The passage in question describes how one of them "threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top. Another drew silver tables up to the chairs, and laid out golden dishes, while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl, and served it in golden cups. The fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron."&lt;ref&gt;Book X [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Odyssey10.htm#_Toc90267913 lines 348ff]&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a work of considerable detail, while the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] coffin preserved in [[Orvieto]]'s archaeological museum has only four figures. At the centre Osysseus threatens Circe with drawn sword while an animal headed figure stands on either side, one of them laying his hand familiarly on the hero's shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessingimages.com/viewimage.asp?i=10010241+&amp;cr=6&amp;cl=1 Lessing images]&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze mirror relief in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] is also Etruscan and is inscribed with the names of the characters.

===Portraits in character===
[[File:Offor Circe.jpg|thumb|[[Beatrice Offor]]'s ''Circe'' (1911)|alt=|360x360px]]

During the 18th century painters began to portray individual actors in scenes from named plays. There was also a tradition of private performances, with a variety of illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes. Among these was [[Thomas Jefferys]]' ''A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Antient and Modern'' (1757–72) which included a copperplate [[engraving]] of a crowned Circe in loose dress, holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left.&lt;ref&gt;Published from London, [http://www.albion-prints.com/greece-circe-c1760-costume-print-5656-p.asp p.240]&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character, of which one of the earliest was the pastel by Daniel Gardner (1750–1805) of "Miss Elliot as Circe". The artist had been a pupil of both [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], who themselves were soon to follow his example. On the 1778 engraving based on Gardner&lt;nowiki&gt;'s portrait appear the lines from Milton's ‘'Comus''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup
:Whoever tasted, lost his upright shape
:And downward fell into a grovelling swine,

in compliment to the charm of this marriageable daughter of a country house. As in the Jefferys' plate, she wears a silver coronet over tumbled dark hair, with a wand in the right hand and a goblet in the left. In hindsight the frank eyes that look directly at the viewer and the rosebud mouth are too innocent for the role Miss Elliot is playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preraphaeliteoftheforest.tumblr.com/post/11755388956/miss-elliott-as-circe-daniel-gardner|title=Binding with Briars My Joys &amp; Desires|website=preraphaeliteoftheforest.tumblr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects of later paintings impersonating Circe have a history of sexual experience behind them, starting with "Mary Spencer in the character of Circe" by [[William Caddick]], which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter [[George Stubbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Judy |last=Egerton |title=George Stubbs, Painter: Catalogue Raisonné |publisher=[[Yale University]] |year=2007 |url={{Google books |mFrO5o2X2EcC|page=482|plainurl=true}}|pages=95,482 |isbn=9780300125092}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portrait of "Mrs Nesbitt as Circe" by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady's past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee.&lt;ref&gt;''The Smith College Museum of Art: European and American Painting and Sculpture, 1760-1960'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Yq0IRs_ZZwC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=SkA7LRZRgL&amp;dq=%22circe%22%20%22sculpture%22&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circe%22%20%22sculpture%22&amp;f=false pp.108-9]&lt;/ref&gt; While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.

[[File:George_Romney_-_Lady_Hamilton_as_Circe.jpg|left|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Romney_-_Lady_Hamilton_as_Circe.jpg|alt=|thumb|238x238px|[[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]]'s {{c.|1782|lk=no}} portrait of [[Emma Hamilton]] as Circe. It was used to illustrate numerous books, including ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'']]

Soon afterwards, the notorious [[Emma Hamilton]] was to raise this to an art form, partly by the aid of George Romney's many paintings of her impersonations. Romney's preliminary study of Emma's head and shoulders, at present in the [[Tate Gallery]], with its piled hair, expressive eyes and mouth, is reminiscent of Samuel Gardener's portrait of Miss Elliot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/romney-lady-hamilton-as-circe-n05591|title=‘Emma Hart as Circe’, George Romney, c.1782 - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the full-length "Lady Hamilton as Circe" at [[Waddesdon Manor]], she is placed in a wooded landscape with wolves snarling to her left, although the tiger originally there has now been painted out. Her left arm is raised to cast a spell while the wand points downward in her right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Romney_-_Lady_Hamilton_as_Circe_2.jpg|title=Lady Hamilton as Circe|first=George|last=Romney|date=23 June 1782|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Emma moved to Naples and joined Lord Hamilton, she developed what she called her "Attitudes" into a more public entertainment. Specially designed, loose-fitting tunics were paired with large shawls or veils as she posed in such a way as to evoke figures from Classical mythology. These developed from mere poses, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes that she portrayed, into small, wordless charades.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Peakman, Emma Hamilton, London 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lzn6AzBjE7EC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;ots=_-by5D0Gr3&amp;dq=%22pose%20plastique%22%20emma%20hamilton&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pose%20plastique%22%20emma%20hamilton&amp;f=false pp.47-50]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of dressing up in character continued into the following centuries. One of the photographic series by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], a pupil of the painter [[George Frederic Watts]], was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of "Circe" in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character's use of wine to bring a change in personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/16773 Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; The society portrait photographer [[Yevonde Middleton]], also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball as the foundation for her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large Baroque porcelain goblet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitLarge/mw17333/Lady-Alexandra-Henrietta-Louisa-Haig-as-Circe|title=Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Haig as Circe - National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade earlier, the illustrator [[Charles Edmund Brock]] extended into the 20th century what is almost a pastiche of the 18th-century [[conversation piece]] in his "Circe and the Sirens" (1925). In this the Honourable Edith Chaplin (1878–1959), Marchioness of Londonderry, and her three youngest daughters are pictured in a garden setting grouped about a large pet goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/circe-and-the-sirens-a-group-portrait-of-the-honourable-edith-c|title=Art UK - 404 Sorry...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three women painters also produced portraits using the convention of the sitter in character. The earliest was [[Beatrice Offor]] (1864–1920), whose sitter's part in her 1911 painting of Circe is suggested by the vine-leaf crown in her long dark hair, the snake-twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on her left arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vintage-ephemera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/circe-1911.html|title=Vera Violetta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Cecil Allen]] was of Australian origin&lt;ref&gt;There is a fuller biography in the [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/allen-mary-cecil-5005 Australian Dictionary of Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; but was living in the United States at the time "Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe" was painted (1930). Though only a head and shoulders sketch, its colouring and execution suggest the sitter's lively personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/5828|title=Sketch: Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe - Mary Cecil ALLEN - NGV - View Work|website=www.ngv.vic.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosemary Valodon (born 1947), from the same country, painted a series of Australian personalities in her goddess series. "Margarita Georgiadis as Circe" (1991) is a [[triptych]], the central panel of which portrays an updated, naked [[femme fatale]] reclining in tropical vegetation next to a pig's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origemdacomedia.blogspot.com/2010/07/goddess-series.html|title=Origem da Comédia: The Goddess Series|first=Príncipe|last=Myshkin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franz von Stuck Tilla Durieux als Circe.jpg|thumb|Franz von Stuck, The actress Tilla Durieux in the role of Circe, c. 1913]]

One painting at least depicts an actress playing the part of Circe. This is [[Franz von Stuck]]'s striking portrait of "[[:de:Tilla Durieux|Tilla Durieux]] as Circe" (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon's play in 1912 and there is a publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turnofthecentury.tumblr.com/image/1565153826|title=Turn of the Century: Photo|website=turnofthecentury.tumblr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck's enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme [[Geneviève Vix]] as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the [[Opéra-Comique]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/charmainezoe/5362148286|title=1907 Theatre - Mme Genevieve Vix as Circe, an opera comique by the Brothers Hillenacher at the Opera Comique, Paris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of [[Silvana Mangano]] in her part as Circe in the 1954 film "Ulysses", which is as cunningly posed for effect.

"'''Cold Skin'''" is a [[melodic dubstep]] song by American musicians [[Seven Lions]] and Echos. It was released on November 9, 2016 by independent electronic music label [[Monstercat]].

==Background==
Speaking to [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] about the collaboration, Lexi Norton of Echos said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember I was at dinner when Tal called me and told me that Seven Lions wanted to make a track with us. I try to not let myself get excited over much, but imagine getting a phone call saying that one of your favorite artists wants to collaborate with you. That was probably the best feeling in the world."&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7572565/seven-lions-echos-cold-skin-premiere |title=Seven Lions &amp; Echos Serenade Us with 'Cold Skin': Premiere |website=Billboard |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jeff Montalvo, better known as [[Seven Lions]], further stated in an interview with EDMChicago that he wanted to work on a title featuring Norton, which turned into the collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://edmchicago.com/2016/11/14/seven-lions-gives-us-look-behind-scenes-journey-tour/ |title=Seven Lions Gives us a Look Behind The Scenes of The Journey Tour... |last=teechoi |date=November 14, 2016 |website=EDM Chicago |language=en-US |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and release==
Maggie Patinelli of Billboard said the track was "perfect for driving across the Brooklyn Bridge at night with the windows down."&lt;ref name="Billboard" /&gt; Matthew Meadow of YourEDM called the track "a stunning example of melodic bass music with accompanying heavenly vocals – pick your favorite sports metaphor, “hole in one,” “slam dunk,” they all fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2016/11/10/seven-lions-debut-track-monstercat-echos-finally-interview/ |title=Seven Lions Unleashes His Thrilling Monstercat Debut &amp; Teases 2 New Singles [LISTEN] |date=November 10, 2016 |website=Your EDM |language=en-US |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Steer of Earmilk praised the track, calling it "classic Seven Lions with its ethereal sound, little glimmers of bass and stunning guest vocals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://earmilk.com/2016/11/11/seven-lions-echos-premiere-stunning-track-cold-skin-via-monstercat/ |title=Seven Lions &amp; Echos premiere stunning track "Cold Skin" via Monstercat - EARMILK |date=November 11, 2016 |website=EARMILK |language=en-US |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''DC Comics Two Thousand''''', also known as '''''DC Two Thousand''''' and '''''DC 2000''''', is a two-issue miniseries by [[DC Comics]] in which the [[Justice League]] of America and the [[Justice Society of America]] team up, via time travel, to stop the attempts of [[T. O. Morrow]] to alter the present by changing the past. The two issues of the series were released in January and February 2000, in [[prestige format]].

==Synopsis==

===Issue 1===
In the year 2000, T. O. Morrow is the ruler of the world, as a result of using a time-travel machine called M.O.R.R.O.W. to strategically send pieces of modern technology (a [[laptop]], an [[artificial heart]], ''et cetera'') to specific places in the year 1941. In the past, the newly formed Justice Society is investigating the mysterious technological devices they've encountered, when a group of heroes from 2000—The Justice League—arrives, determined to take back the future devices and restore their time-period. The JSA's [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] looks into the JLA members' minds, and sees the worst parts of the future (e.g., the dismantling of [[New Deal]] programs, causing the poor to suffer greatly). Rather than allow that future to occur, The Spectre imprisons the JLA members in 1941.

===Issue 2===
The League members escape their imprisonment and return to 2000, where Morrow's citadel is being attacked by descendents of the JSA; made corrupt by unearned power, the heirs of the Society intend to hijack M.O.R.R.O.W. for their own purposes. In 1941, most of the JSA members plan to use Morrow's technology to improve the world, but The [[Flash (Jay Garrick)]] tries to tell them that it's wrong to do so. Later, Flash stops the future Morrow from killing his own mother in the past; he'd intended to make himself "tougher" by having been an orphan, but Flash shows him that that's a line even Morrow can't cross.

The JSA travels to the year 2000 and sees what has happened to the world as a result of Morrow's efforts and their own. With Morrow's help, they use M.O.R.R.O.W. to take back all the year-2000 devices that had been sent to 1941, thus restoring the future.

'''''Dream High 2''''' ({{lang-ko|드림하이 2}}) is a [[South Korea]]n television drama series broadcast by [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] in 2012. It stars [[Kang So-ra]], [[Got7|GOT7]]'s [[JB (South Korean singer)|JB]] and [[Park Jin-young (entertainer, born 1994)|Jinyoung]], [[2AM (band)|2AM]]'s [[Jeong Jinwoon|Jinwoon]], [[T-ara]]'s [[Park Ji-yeon|Jiyeon]], [[Sistar|SISTAR]]'s [[Hyolyn]], and [[Park Seo-joon]]. Like its prequel, it has 16 episodes which ran from January 30, 2012, until March 20 of the same year but was less successful, only averaging single-digit audience ratings.

==Synopsis==
Like its predecessor ''[[Dream High]]'', it follows a group of students at the Kirin High School of Art stars who pursue their dream of becoming [[K-pop]] stars. However, it has a slight difference in terms of plot with new set of student casts.

After going into financial bankruptcy, Kirin High School is taken over by Oz Entertainment. The company then transfers its own young trainees to circumvent a law requiring underage entertainers to study for a set amount of time. Then, competition brews between the troubled students at Kirin High and the newly transferred Oz Entertainment trainees.

Although Shin Hae-sung ([[Kang So-ra]]) enters Kirin High School with a high exam score, she has no talent in singing. She meets and befriends fellow students, Jin Yoo-jin ([[Jung Jin-woon]]) and [[JB (South Korean singer)|JB]]. Yoo-jin, who originally got into the entertainment industry as a child actor, is now troubled by his dreams of becoming a rock star as he tries to cope with the pain of his parents' divorce. JB, a member of a famous group I:dn (Eden), develops feelings for Hae-sung and dates her later on.

Ri-an ([[Park Ji-yeon|Jiyeon]]), a member of a famous girl group called HershE, chases after JB, who was once her boyfriend. Meanwhile, Yoo-jin, who also likes Hae-sung, tries to separate the couple with Ri-an. Later on, Ri-an and Yoo-jin give up and remain close friends.

Hae-sung leaves for the USA and 8 years after the graduation it is revealed that now she is a famous composer and director, JB, due to his leg injury, gives up on his dream of being a dancer and ends up as a music producer, Ri-an becomes a [[Hallyu|Hallyu idol]], and Yoo-jin becomes a rock music teacher at Kirin High School by day and a rocker by night.

All of them have a reunion performance on stage for Kirin High School's 17 years anniversary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6436">'''ECNAD''' (the reverse spelling of '[[dance]]') is a [[contemporary dance]] [[dance company|company]] founded in 1996 in [[Singapore]] with a multi-disciplinary approach.

== History ==
It was formerly known as '''Dance Dimension Project'''.  ECNAD (http://www.ecnad.org) is one of the first non government professional creative dance company that mushroomed amidst the then cultural desert of Singapore.  This in turn sparks off the formation of many new contemporary dance companies in Singapore, a phenomenon never seem before in the modern cultural history of Singapore.  Its founders and [[artistic director]]s Tan How Choon and Lim Chin Huat (Lim was 2000 Young Artist Award recipient) who are 2 ordinary individuals of indigenous approach to expression despite their western influences in fine arts, dance and sport training backgrounds.

From 1997 to 2000, it initiated a series of outreach site-specific works at fountains and architectural spaces in the urban environment. Suntec City fountain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dansing.org.sg/workfiles/About%20Dance/Singapore%20Dance/SporeDance-Gan.pdf Dancing Bodies: Culture and Modernity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141545/http://www.dansing.org.sg/workfiles/About%20Dance/Singapore%20Dance/SporeDance-Gan.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bugis Junction fountain, Millennia Walk and UOB Plaza Atrium are some of the performance venues. These are projects that aims at facilitating environment and dance aesthetics of the general public through performances that highlight and work with the existing aesthetics of the chosen space.  In fact, this is at that time, one of the first of its kind project by private individuals never seem before by the republic.

ECNAD has performed more than 50 creations over the past 12 years as in year 2008.

In the 1990s to early 2000s, ECNAD focused mainly on:
* providing opportunities and assisting local dance artists to work together and create their dances
* free outreach performances for the general public
* gaining valuable experiences through collaborations with overseas professionals
* nurturing and assisting new talents to fulfil their dreams
* explore working with many production artists besides dancers

The company received both full-house and standing ovation for her tour performances "Floating Mirror" and "a-the-bird" in 35th [[Belgrade International Theatre Festival]] (BITEF),&lt;ref&gt;[http://kultura.krstarica.com/l/pozoriste/35-bitef-o-trupama-i-predstavama/ 35th BITEF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205143854/http://kultura.krstarica.com/l/pozoriste/35-bitef-o-trupama-i-predstavama/ |date=2009-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an audience of 19,700 for "Tales from The Giant Blanket" performances in Festival of Asia in New Zealand in 2001.

*"…, [Ecnad] signalled a new direction for the festival. Their success with New Zealand audiences meant that more contemporary material is likely to be introduced in future years."  ~ Festival of Asia 2001 Report, New Zealand

In 2002, it was commissioned by the National Arts Council of Singapore to perform a multi-disciplinary artistic work entitled "Missing In Tall Pillars"&lt;ref&gt;[http://inkpot.com/theatre/02reviews/02revmisstallpill.html The Flying Inkpot Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008000548/http://inkpot.com/theatre/02reviews/02revmisstallpill.html |date=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Asian Civilisations Museum.

In 2006, ECNAD was commissioned to co-conceptualised and created "Metamorphosis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designtaxi.com/article/174/Mercedes-Benz-Asia-Fashion-Award-2006-Winner/ |title=Mercedes-Benz Asia Fashion Award 2006 Winner |work=[[designtaxi.com]]|accessdate=10 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to open the evening for [[Mercedes-Benz Asia Fashion Award]] (regional final competition).

Its artistic ideal and vision continues to evolve and in March 2008, Artistic Co-Director Tan How Choon staged a multi-disciplinary production entitled In The Name Of Dance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/mpguitars/ecnad_in_the_name_of_dance ITNOD photos]&lt;/ref&gt; that successfully assimilated dance, movement, acting and singing into one cohesive creation.  He has also achieved a unique creative breakthrough by staging Songs For Gaia (2009), showcasing singing dancers assimilating a cappella singing, contemporary dance and his own music into a total and original theatrical experience.

Log on to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdf8m01M0tI for samples of ECNAD songs!

Artistic Co-Director Lim Chin Huat has also achieved outreach breakthrough for the local dance scene through a collaboration with The Arts House and led a unique dance festival titled CampFire 2009 comprising free dance performances, dance photo competition/exhibition, a dance workshop and a dance marathon.  CampFire 2009 is an event in conjunction with the Singapore River Festival 2009.

Both ECNAD Artistic Co-Directors will be working together to create a new production titled BUN &amp; STONE(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crDM8ac6Bo) in March 2010 at The Arts House.

Currently, the company has also designed and programmed its own dance training programs under ECNAD Education filling the gap for keen individuals to receive all-rounded practical dance education on a part-time basis.  ECNAD students' recent creative works were showcased in Part-Time Daydreaming (2008).  In the past, students has been encouraged and supported through other creative showcases such as Bottled Dances and Out-Of-Site.  The tradition of giving generous support and mentorship to keen individuals to creative dance has been practised since the beginning of the company!

The word "ecnad" is now becoming popular worldwide in representing performing arts activities and companies.  It has also been attached with the meaning of "someone who lives for dancing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dogwritingideas.wikispaces.com/Crazy+Dictionary Crazy Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "ecnad" has indeed come a long way since it was invented in 1996 by the Singaporean artists!

ECNAD is a creative sparkle uniquely from Singapore, with a humble beginning and strong aesthetic vision deserving of all supports and recognition!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3563">[[File:Edward Avis.jpg|thumb|Promotional brochure of "Edward Avis" c. 1920]]
'''Edward Avis''' was the stage name of '''Martin E. Sullivan''' (1872 - 1955?), an American violinist and stage performer known for his imitations of birdsongs. He performed on the stage in New England and was referred to by the press as "The Bird Man".&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|page=62| author=Smith, Jacob| title=Eco-Sonic Media| publisher=University of California Press| year =2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was born in [[Enfield, Connecticut]] and as you child he was said to go into the "''woods with his violin and strike up a chorus among the birds''".&lt;ref name=smith /&gt; He learned the songs of birds around the United States and began to write down their songs, whistle them and produce melodies. He performed for gatherings of the Audubon Societies. A review of a performance in January 1908 "An Evening in Birdland" given to members of the Audubon Society at the George Washington University said:&lt;ref name=tipp /&gt;
{{quote|His whistling is a natural gift, but his bird songs are the result of constant study and close companionship with birds. Mr Avis adopts a standard in his study of bird music. As he hears a bird's song, he writes it down, whistles it repeatedly, perfects it by study and practice, and the results are his wonderful little melodies. These melodies were a feature of his lecture last night. Stereopticon pictures were thrown on the screen, Mr Avis would whistle bird songs and one could almost imagine it was summer.}}
[[File:Record_label_Avis.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of a 1927 LP]]
Avis was a careful imitator of birds and he often performed before academic audiences. He also included a mix of his mimicry with the violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=di Liscia, Eleonora| title=Beginnings: The 1920s| journal=Newsletter of the Evanston North Shore Bird Club| url=http://www.ensbc.org/sites/default/files/BirdCalls%20Summer%202009.pdf |year=2009 | pages=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed for blind audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/scrapbookofclipp28perk#page/30/mode/1up/|title=Social circle for blind entertained with bird mimicry|date=12 April 1930|newspaper=Unidentified|location=Salem, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a contemporary of [[Charles Crawford Gorst]], [[Charles Kellogg (naturalist)|Charles Kellogg]] and several others who specialized in the imitation of birds. His promotional brochures included reviews by [[John Burroughs]] and Winthrop Packard. Many recordings were made by Avis for Columbia Records and after the rise in popularity of the radio, he also contributed to radio shows.&lt;ref name=tipp&gt;Tipp, Cheryl (2013) [http://thequietus.com/articles/14019-edward-avis-art-of-mimicry-antidote-to-indifference-caught-by-the-river A True Confluence of Currents]. Caught by the River. An antidote to indifference. Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was interested in conservation and sponsored a 100 dollar reward for anyone who could find an undisturbed nest of the [[passenger pigeon]] in Connecticut as part of a national campaign to rescue the bird from extinction in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1910|title=A last effort to find and save from extinction the Passenger Pigeon|journal=Bird Lore|volume=12|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2193">'''Epanalepsis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐπανάληψις}}, ''epanálēpsis'' "repetition, resumption, taking up again"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Epanalepsis Epanalepsis - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the repetition of the initial part of a [[clause]] or sentence at the end of that same clause or sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smyth | first = Herbert Weir | year = 1920 | title = Greek Grammar | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge MA | isbn = 0-674-36250-0 | page = 673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning and the end of a sentence are two positions of [[Stress (linguistics)|emphasis]], so special attention is placed on the phrase by repeating it in both places. Nested double-epanalepses are [[antimetabole]]s.

==Examples==
* [[The King is dead. Long live the King|'''The king''' is dead; long live '''the king''']].
* '''Severe''' to his servants; to his children, '''severe'''.
* '''History is ours and people make history'''. — [[Salvador Allende]]. 
* '''They bowed down''' to him rather, because he was all of these things, and then again he was all of these things because the '''town bowed down'''. —[[Zora Neale Hurston]], ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''
* '''Beloved''' is mine; she is '''Beloved'''.
* '''Blow''' winds and crack your cheeks! Rage, '''blow'''! — [[Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'', 3.2.1
* '''Once more''' unto the breach, dear friends, '''once more'''; — Shakespeare, ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', 3.1.1
* '''Last''' things first; the slow haul to forgive them ... a telling figure out of rhetoric, | epanalepsis, the same word first and '''last'''. — [[Geoffrey Hill]], ''The Triumph of Love'', Section X
* '''Nice''' to see you, to see you, '''nice'''. — [[Bruce Forsyth]] (As a phrase repeated but inverted, this is also an example of [[antimetabole]].)

'''''Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds''''' is a 2008 American [[Horror film|horror]] [[comedy film]] and a [[sequel]] to the 2005 film ''[[Feast (2005 film)|Feast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Felix, Justin|date=October 24, 2008|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35176/feast-2-sloppy-seconds/|title=Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[John Gulager]] and written by [[Marcus Dunstan]] and [[Patrick Melton]].

The film was followed by ''[[Feast III: The Happy Finish]]'' (2009).

==Plot==
Biker Queen, twin sister of Harley Mom, discovers the severed arm of her sister from the previous film. Upon discovering the surviving Bartender, she tortures him into telling her who killed Harley Mom. He reveals that it was Bozo and points her to a town where he lives. She knocks Bartender out and takes him with her to the town.

Prior to the events of the [[Feast (2005 film)|first film]], the town was overrun by the monsters. A pair of small Mexican wrestlers named Thunder and Lightning were attacked by the monsters and Lightning's girlfriend was killed. Inside the jail, a "Hobo" was in a cell for dealing [[methamphetamine]] and questioned where his school bus (makeshift meth lab) is at. The Sheriff taunted him before being killed. A car salesman named Slasher found evidence of his wife cheating with one of his employees and barely escaped the monsters.

Biker Queen and four of her friends arrive in the deserted town with the Bartender, ignoring the dead bodies as they look for Bozo and cross paths with Slasher, his wife Secrets and the man she has an affair with, Greg. The group is attacked by a monster, which kills one of the biker girls, Tot Girl. The others and the Bartender make their way to Bozo's apartment, where they encounter Honey Pie, the girl who left the group from the first movie behind at the bar. Bartender brutally attacks her and knocks Honey Pie out of the window and onto the street. Honey Pie survives the fall and goes into hiding.

Slasher, Greg and Secrets receive a call from the wrestlers, but before they find them they are ambushed by the bikers. Both groups get to a garage where the brothers and their grandmother are hiding. The group then tries to make it to the jail, but the hobo has sealed himself in.

As the wrestlers try to fashion a skeleton key for the jail house, Greg dissects one of the monsters, gravely injuring the wrestlers' grandmother when the creature vomits. They discover an eye in the creature's intestines that acts like an alarm system, and cause it to make a terrifying howl in the process. As a result, more monsters swarm the garage. The brothers return with the key but the group must go to the roof to escape the monsters. The survivors on the roof hears a baby crying, trapped inside a station wagon Slasher sold prior to the attack. The next morning, Greg tries to save the baby, but when he encounters a monster and his plan backfires, he throws the baby to the air, leaving him to the monster to eat as a distraction when he has trouble escaping.

Meanwhile, Honey Pie, who has spent the night trapped in a store, is ambushed by one of the monsters. She manages to knock it out and uses its claws to make a hole in the bullet-proof glass of the store's door. As she is getting out, the monster regains consciousness and starts to chase her down the street.

Trapped on the roof, the group sacrifices Splat Girl to the monsters and fashion a catapult with Biker Queen's motorcycle and the biker girls' clothes. Using the wrestlers' gravely injured grandmother to test it, they cause her to smash into a wall and die. Thunder gets onto the catapult but is thrown into the street where he is quickly attacked by the monsters and disemboweled. Greg is then severely injured when the bike's tailpipe flies into his head. Meanwhile, Lightning crosses the street under the protection of a trash can. Thunder, missing his legs, crawls away while Lightning picks up the key he had dropped. Lightning reaches the jail house, but as he opens the door the hobo throws a stick of dynamite out. Lightning ducks down in the trashcan to protect himself from the explosion and is launched across the street.

Honey Pie, who made it to the border of the town, is injured by flying shrapnel from the trashcan and falls to the floor, apparently dead. The others watch as the monsters begin breaking onto the rooftop. Suddenly, Honey Pie gets up, grabs her gun and screams in anguish.

'''Feminist children's literature''' is the writing of [[children's literature]] through a feminist lens. Children's literature and [[women's literature]] have many similarities. Both often deal with being weak and placed towards the bottom of a hierarchy. In this way feminist ideas are regularly found in the structure of children's literature. Feminist criticism of children's literature is therefore expected, since it is a type of [[feminist literature]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=Children's Literature as Women's Writing|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1988|volume=13.1|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0264|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature has played a critical role for the [[feminist movement]], especially in the past half century. In her book ''Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; states her belief that all types of media, including writing and children's books, need to promote feminist ideals. She argues "Children's literature is one of the most crucial sites for feminist education for critical consciousness precisely because beliefs and identities are still being formed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell|title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics|date=2000|publisher=South End|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of hooks' book, drawn by Laura DeSantis, depicts children alongside adults, showing the importance of the youth. The presence of feminism in children's literature has evolved over the years, but the overall message and goals have remained consistent.
{{Feminism sidebar}}

==Background==

===Overview===
During the second half of the twentieth century, children's literature and the feminist movement made many improvements together. A currently accepted method of thought for children's literature criticism in the academic world came to life during the 1970s, the same time that the second wave of [[feminist theory]] became popular. Early in the decade, feminist critics like [[Kate Millett]] explained how good writing was based on a belief that being a white male was normal and anyone else was a deviation from the normal.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} At this time, many female characters in children's books "play dead or doormats (as in 'Snow White', 'Cinderella', and 'Sleeping Beauty') or are severely mutilated (as in 'The Little Mermaid')".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Due to the second wave of feminism, [[gender roles]] in all of the classic fairy tales (such as those by Grimm, Andersen, and Perrault) were starting to be questioned. Female heroes of the time were also inadequate. The women were simply "men tricked out in drag" and had the same exact plotlines as the male heroes. The only difference was that instead of needing to be rescued, the heroines did the rescuing.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Lissa|title=Understanding Children's Literature|date=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; More and more studies began emerging from children's literature. All the findings agreed that women were drastically underrepresented and given few options. Boys were overwhelmingly shown to be much more active and have adventures more frequently, while girls were passive and remained in the home with the adult women. Countless studies conducted over the years all had the same or similar results.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wigutoff|first1=Sharon|title=The Feminist Press: Ten Years of Nonsexist Children's Books.|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|date=1979|volume=3.2|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0382|pages=57–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics and studies===
A study conducted in 1976 by the [[Feminist Press]] examined [[picture book]]s for children between the ages of four and eight published from 1972. Books were chosen if they contained the following themes: an active and adventurous girl protagonist, boys expressing multiple emotions and being sensitive, and non-traditional families that reflect multiple aspects of society. The picture books were then examined for [[gender stereotypes]] in primary and secondary characterizations, illustrations, and language. The results showed many instances of sexism. Out of a few thousand picture books published in the five-year span, fewer than 200 met the qualities needed. Although 35 publishers were represented by the books, only about six publishing houses made up the majority. Furthermore, most of the stories only had the first quality, which was a girl as an active protagonist. However, there was a problem in these stories as well. While the young main character could go out on adventures, the mother and grandmother characters were stuck in traditional roles. The study found limited examples of books that showed men as nurturing or of characters in non-traditional families. Only 143 books in the study were decided to be recommendable, 28 were somewhat recommendable, and 22 were not recommendable at all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 1989 a study was done in which the number of female and male characters in children's books was measured. It found that books from 1972 had female characters only 25% of the time, while in 1989 female characters were shown just as frequently as male characters. It also discovered that [[Caldecott]] winners and honor books were becoming more likely to have female characters, and that they were not given stereotyped roles as they were in the 1960s. In the late 1960s, only 1% of animal illustrations in Caldecott books were females. However, by the late 80s that number increased to 22%, and by the late 90s it was at about 72%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Roger|title=Why All The Counting? Feminist Social Science Research On Children's Literature.|journal=Children's Literature in Education|date=2002|volume=33.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three studies done in the late 1970s and early 80s yielded interesting results about what children like to have in their books. In 1975 [[Sally Jennings]] completed a study that found that kids around the age of four remember stories where characters do reversed-stereotyped things more than they remember stories where characters act according to classic gender roles. In 1978, a study by [[Sally Koblinksky]] found that by the age of 10 children better remember stories with stereotyped characters. A study done by [[Jerri Kropp]] and [[Charles Halverston]] in 1983 showed that children in preschool dislike hearing stories in which characters of the opposite gender act along gender stereotypes more than they dislike stories that have characters that do reverse-stereotyped things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the early 1990s several studies were carried out that showed an increase in equality in award-winning children's literature. The research found that only 11.1% of Caldecotts during 1967 to 1971 had female protagonist. During the years 1987 to 1991, however, 43.2% had main characters that were female. By the start of the twenty-first century, reverse-stereotyped roles in the protagonist were as popular as stereotyped roles during the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

By 1992 only 32% of [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prizes for fiction writing]], and a mere 8% of [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizes in literature]], were awarded to women. However, women had won 66% of [[Newbery Medal]]s. The number of female authors producing children's literature was a strong factor in these  statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Beverly|title=Fair Godmothers or Wicked Stepmothers?: The Uneasy Relationship of Feminist Theory and Children's Criticism|journal=Children's Literature Association Quarterly|date=1993|volume=18.4|doi=10.1353/chq.0.0910|pages=171–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of feminist children's literature==
While it is important for females and males to be depicted equally in children's books, that is not the main purpose of feminist children's literature. Children's books often focus on people or animals who do not have power because they are placed at the bottom of a hierarchy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, it is the goal of feminists to promote children's literature that gives children autonomy and the authority to speak and be heard. Books for children need to show how important it is to be able to listen and hear the accounts of others' stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Louise|title=Autonomy And Authorship: Storytelling In Children's Picture Books|journal=Hypatia|date=2010|volume=25.1|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01090.x|pages=174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, feminist theory gives children the right to be included in the literary community, to no longer be oppressed by a hierarchical order of power.&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books"/&gt; A final goal of feminists is to create non-sexist books that show what society is becoming. Promoting feminist theory without being labeled as a "message book" is crucial to the cause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By focusing on these goals, feminist authors hope to get their message across while still producing quality books for children.

==Another perspective==
Beginning in the 1960s, feminism began to appear in many forms of media because of the social changes taking place at the time. Feminists began to use children's books to spread a better understanding of feminism and the stereotypes of women. As children are a main target of the influential stereotypes of patriarchal mass media and important receptors of literature, they can be influenced by feminist literature to help abandon any learned stereotypes. Since [[second-wave feminism]], children's literature has been influenced by feminist theory and ideals, and is still growing as an influential media source in literature in today's society.

In ''Feminism is for Everybody'', [[bell hooks]] expresses her enthusiasm for spreading feminist ideals to everyone to prevent stereotypes and give people new perspectives on feminism. She argues that feminism needs to be shared through many sources of media so that its ideals are easily accessible to everyone. Feminist theory can be found in children's literature. Hooks states, "There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics".&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=hooks|first1=bell|title=Feminism is for Everybody|date=2000|publisher=South End Press|location=Cambridge|pages=vii, x|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist children's literature provides one form of this easy-to-read media. It either acts to highlight women and educate people about their history, or it subtly shares ideas of reversed gender roles where a female character might have more power.

Children's literature can be a valuable media source to influence children's views as they learn gender stereotypes and stereotypes about women in society. Feminism began to have an increasing presence in children's literature after second-wave feminism. According to [[Kinga Varga-Dobai]], second-wave feminist research had a huge impact on media such as children's literature.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"&gt;Kinga Varga-Dobai&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varga-Dobai|first1=Kinga|title=Gender Issues in Multicultural Children's Literature--Black and Third World Feminist Critiques of Appropriation, Essentialism, and Us/Other Binary Oppositions|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=13&amp;sid=8ff93d98-4948-416d-b159-0ce30bcd26c0%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=89660114|website=Multicultural Perspectives|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by [[Abigail Feely]] states, "Children's books published during and after the second-wave feminists movement provide unique clues into the gradual normalization of feminist rhetoric into broader cultural context".&lt;ref name=Feely&gt;Abigail Feely&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feely|first1=Abigail|title=Picturing an Alternate Ending: Teaching Feminism and Social Change with The Paper Bag Princess|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=3edab4bd-e644-4654-857d-f3cc0ef5fdcb%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=90007797|website=Ebscohost|publisher=The History Teacher|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varga-Dobai also states that the 1960s brought about the ideas of multicultural literature because of "shifting social and political perspectives on race, class, and gender." People began to pay more attention to the degree that children were being influenced by any ideologies embedded in children's books. Many feminists noticed that traditional folktales contained female characteristics that feminists did not agree with. Varga-Dobai says that female characters in children's novels began to be portrayed as more daring, active, and independent, in order to provide girls with a new image of an ideal female.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt;

The idea of a strong, independent female character in children's books plays into the topic of gender representation. According to Varga-Dobai, "The study of gender portrayals in children's literature has been closely informed by both cultural and feminist studies because women, as members of culture, have often been represented as the "other" in literature".&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt; Therefore, feminists work to overcome any misrepresentations or stereotypes of gender in children's literature. Feminists want children to be educated through a feminist view so that their opinions are not as skewed when it comes to gender stereotypes and education of influential women. Also according to Varga-Dobai, "From a postconstructural feminist perspective, gender representations should allow for a more complex portrayal of subject positions available for female characters".&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai"/&gt; As second-wave feminism brought social change in women's positions in society, female characters also began to take on a social change, moving away from the traditional female characters.

One example of a children's book that includes feminist ideals that highlight females is ''Rad American Women A-Z'' by [[Kate Shatz]]. Inspired by her two-year-old daughter, Schatz wanted to create a book that educates children on women's history and also teaches them the alphabet. She noticed the gap in feminist-inspired children's literature. The book features inspirational women of different races whose names start with each letter of the alphabet. It highlights influential women, or "feminist heroes," who have made important accomplishments but may not be well known. This book not only intends to fill a hole in feminist literature for children, but also to address and represent race through the women that Schatz includes. This book begins to fulfill the need of "easy to read pamphlets and books" that hooks&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; discusses.&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;Laura Feinstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feinstein|first1=Laura|title=Feminist Heroes to Teach Kids Their ABCs in Badass New Picturebook|url=http://magazine.good.is/articles/illustrated-feminist-heroes-to-teach-children-their-abcs|website=GOOD: A Magazine for the Global Citizen|publisher=GOOD Worldwide Inc|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent example of a feminist children's story that subtly speaks out about the issues of gender stereotypes is ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'' by [[Robert Munsch]]. Some{{who|date=September 2018}} consider this story to be the birth of feminist literature.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is a fairytale that has a strong female character and a feminist ending rather than a traditional story ending. The princess wears a paper bag and puts herself in danger to rescue the prince. However, the prince is ungrateful because she does not look like a real princess in her paper bag. Like many children's books, this story shows reversed roles of male and female characters, which reveals that feminist ideals are seeping into children's literature.

Children's literature can have a significant impact in the classroom. As children learn about issues of culture, feminist lenses are encouraging students to take on different perspectives. Learning through a feminist lens also encourages different views not only about gender representations, but also about race and class. It is believed that feminist theory can transform students' readings by how much they recognize the different gender patterns throughout literature. An article by Feely suggests, "Many radical and incorrect images of feminism persist in the popular imagination. At the same time, ironically, feminism has become so ingrained into mainstream culture that many students don't recognize it".&lt;ref name="Feely"/&gt; Feminism is sometimes skewed in the popular media, but it is also subtly fixed into culture{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} in different ways such as through children's literature. As students learn, they are heavily influenced by mainstream culture, but incorporating children's literature into classroom settings can help expand opinions.

Feminist children's books are becoming more prevalent, but we are still in need of more female children's authors and books, according to hooks.&lt;!-- Lower-case is correct.--&gt; In hooks' opinion, "We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everybody's mind and heart".&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt; She believes that there is still much to be done to spread the correct image of feminism, whether it is done through children's literature or through mainstream media sources. Feminism has become more prevalent in children's books since second-wave feminism, but there is still a gap in children's feminist literature that can continue to be filled.

== Ethics ==
Historically children’s books were written to entertain and educate children. However, new readings of children’s books reveal unethical concepts towards racism, gender and colonialism. New gender and feminist studies endeavour to right these wrongs. The goal is to unlearn previous negative attitudes of race and gender. Children’s learning is to be moulded in diversity and inclusivity is a moral principle and mutual obligation by parents, educators and the community. The ethics in children’s books guide the young reader to form basic concepts and fundamental principles of decent human conduct and essential equality. Ethics help children to shape the way they live, what they do, and how they make choices and values in their world.  
Since the mid -50s it has become vogue to reread and reinterpret classic children’s books. As to what children’s books should accomplish trouble cultural observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Amy E.|date=2011|title="A Novel Approach: the Sociology of Literature, Children's Books, and Inequality."|url=|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|volume=|pages=308|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they agree that the narratives in children’s books must delete unequal social arrangements: and instead of identifying inequality, describe, challenge, and subvert systems of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Amy E.|date=2011|title=“A Novel Approach: The Sociology of Literature, Children’s Books, and Inequality.”|url=|journal=International Journal of Qualitive Methods|volume=|pages=307|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==
Gender stereotypes found in innocent characters in fairy tales and racism and sexism found in the simplistic adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine do not give children positive role models.

The message in the Little Red Hen, teamwork and hard work, is overlooked and its main character has become a racist capitalist who refused to feed the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/10/new-regressive-sport-finding-racism-childrens-books/|title=The New Regressive Sport of Finding Racism and Sexism in Children’s Books.|last=|first=|date=|website=SB|archive-url=|archive-date=1 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Pan saves Tiger Lilly, and his heroic gesture is indicative of her as uneducated and savage because she is a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/06/25/using-tinker-bell-to-shake-magic-into-everything-disney-peter-pan/|title=Using Tinker Bell to Shake Magic into Everything: Disney’s Peter Pan.|last=Ness|first=Mari|date=25 June 2015|website=Tor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture book Rosie’s Walk, written by Pat Hutchinson, about a hen who is unaware that a fox is hunting her in the farmyard is seen as a symbol of ‘stupid womanhood.’ However, critics overlook the humours musings of Rosie’s walk around the farmyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Towenshend|first=John Rowe|date=1976|title="Racism and Sexism in Children's Books"|url=|journal=community|volume=5|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in America suggest a rewriting of Cinderella in a ‘less sexist vein.’ Cinderella is too pretty; she has dishpan hands and flat feet because she does too much housework and Cinderella dances with too many men in one night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townshend|first=John Rowe|date=1976|title=“Racism and Sexism in Children’s Books,”|url=|journal=New Community 5|volume=5|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Famous Five, critics accuse Enid Blyton’s depiction of boys and girls as sexist. It is not enough for Georgina to be a leader if she looks like a girl. The character has to take on the persona of a boy by having short hair and demanding to be called George.

The independent, self-assertive, supergirl, Pippi Longstocking is but a boy in disguise.

These generalizations are counter-productive and divert from the more overtly severe cases, such as Little Black Sambo (1899). However, the author, Helen Bannerman had no obnoxious intentions; by default, she did not have a talent for drawing. Polar, written by Elaine Moss, about a polar bear, was rejected by an American publisher because the bear is ‘explicitly white.’

In an attempt to avoid stereotypes, girls are shown as strong, brave and resourceful, mothers go out to work, boys knit, and fathers cook cakes. Authors write, and editors publish in fear in absurd efforts to avoid giving offence. Another implication of these attitudes is a reverse gender stratification: girls cannot wear pink as it sets a gender norm of the feminine and boys must not wear blue as it sets a gender norm of masculine traits. However, because the unrealistic generalizations of gender representation in the debate on rewriting classic books, stripping them of all negative gender, sexism and racial bias continues.  Sarah Begley, Time (2017), advises parents to read with their children, ‘children are going to encounter it, and a safer way to learn how to counter it is via fiction. If you are reading a sexist/racist children’s book with a child, you can help them read it critically.’ Another critic, Malcolm Jones, cites from the National Coalition Against Censorship, PEN American Center, and the First Amendment Committee of American Society of Journalists and Authors who argued ‘while it is perfectly valid for critics to dispute a book’s historical accuracy and literary merits, the appropriate response is not to withdraw the volume and deprive readers of a chance to evaluate the book and the controversy for themselves.’

Amy Singer suggests children are deprived of great literature, exciting stories, mystery, and adventure in the rewriting of classical children’s books. Furthermore, these books are useful as historical evidence of how and what shaped people’s attitude in the time they were written and supply a source of debate of right and wrong and how we acknowledge that there is a better way to live. Moreover, studies by sociologists focus on the behaviour of boys and girls in books as an ideological reality of individual ability and character. In''Novel Readings''(1990) Marjorie DeVault suggests, ‘readers of a single novel create an individual understanding of that novel, alongside the meanings that the novel’s creator might have intended.’

However, Amy Singer, claims that ‘a subversive story for children will include not only strong role models at an individual level but also connections between social power and inequality.’ The questions Singer asks are how connected are the narratives of the protagonists to the social structures in which they live and do they implicate a subversive representation of the cultural stratification. The questionnaire that Singer developed in her analysis of children’s books takes into consideration the:

Book publication date, publisher, author and the elements of narrative texts. What is the books setting, who is the primary character, is there an implied reader and what is her/his implied body of knowledge?

Moreover, Ewick and Silbey suggest that children’s narratives can ‘support challenges to the status quo by illuminating a set of tactics for future use.' Children’s narratives can inspire change and can provide the exposure of power as a means to reverse that power. When children read books, they look for role models with leadership qualities. Due to the lack of female representation, girls are being denied positive role models to emulate. In order to dispel the belief there is only one way to identify as male or female in children’s books, a variety of characters, personality traits and behaviours are paramount in the writing of children’s books.

More important, children’s narratives can teach children how social arrangements are gendered and how they may determine their fates. The role model that characters play out and their narratives can draw attention to social relationships and teach young readers to think critically about what they read. Furthermore, to expose young readers to social systems and inequality will teach them how the world is organised and how they might be negotiated or challenged.

'''''Fight Club''''' is a 1996 novel by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. It follows the experiences of an [[Anonymity|unnamed]] [[protagonist]] struggling with [[insomnia]]. Inspired by his doctor's exasperated remark that insomnia is not suffering, the protagonist finds relief by impersonating a seriously ill person in several support groups. Then he meets a mysterious man named [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Tyler Durden]] and establishes an underground [[Combat sport|fighting]] club as radical [[psychotherapy]].

In 1999, director [[David Fincher]] adapted the novel into a [[Fight Club|film of the same name]], starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Edward Norton]]. The film acquired a [[cult film|cult following]] despite lower than expected box-office results. The film's prominence heightened the profile of the novel and that of Palahniuk. The sequel ''[[Fight Club 2]]'' was released in comic book form in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Wrap]]|title='Fight Club 2' Sneak Peek Reveals Dark Side of the American Dream|first=Deborah|last=Day|date=March 9, 2015|url=http://www.thewrap.com/fight-club-2-second-issue-sneak-peek-photo-exclusive/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Fight Club'' centers on an [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|anonymous narrator]], who works as a product recall specialist for an unnamed car company. Because of the stress of his job and the [[jet lag]] brought upon by frequent business trips, he begins to suffer from recurring [[insomnia]]. When he seeks treatment, his doctor advises him to visit a support group victims to "see what real suffering is like". He finds that sharing the problems of others—despite not having testicular cancer himself—alleviates his insomnia.

The narrator's unique treatment works until he meets Marla Singer, another "tourist" who visits the support group under false pretenses. The possibly disturbed Marla reminds the narrator that he is a faker who does not belong there. He begins to hate Marla for keeping him from crying, and, therefore, from sleeping. After a confrontation, the two agree to attend separate support group meetings to avoid each other. The truce is uneasy, and the narrator's insomnia returns.

While on a nude beach, the narrator meets [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Tyler Durden]], a charismatic extremist of mysterious means. After an explosion destroys the narrator's [[condominium]], he asks to stay at Tyler's house. Tyler agrees, but asks for something in return: "I want you to hit me as hard as you can."&lt;ref name="palahniukfc46"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men find that they enjoy the ensuing [[Boxing|fistfight]]. They subsequently move in together and establish a "fight club", drawing numerous men with similar temperaments into [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle]] fighting matches, set to the following rules:

&lt;!-- NOTE: The rules are quoted as they appear in the novel (see page citations). The film has a slightly different version. Please don't change this list, or any part of it, to the film version. If you do, your changes will be reverted. --&gt;

{{quote|
# You don't talk about fight club.
# You don't talk about fight club.
# When someone says stop, or goes limp, the fight is over.&lt;ref name="lostrule" group="note"&gt;Shortly after the third rule is introduced, it is dropped from the club and the other rules move up one numbered position. It is mentioned by the Narrator the first time he states the rules, but it is not mentioned by Tyler when he states them. Tyler also adds the eighth rule, which becomes the seventh rule in his version of the rule set. This may have been the result of a [[continuity error]], though it is also possible that Tyler changed the rules to allow the Narrator to break the third rule later in the novel. Another interpretation could be that the first set of rules are easier on combatants than the amended rules (ways out if unconscious and not having to fight compared to no ways out and having to fight), proving the more aggressive Tyler is taking a stronger hold of the Narrator. Palahniuk (1999), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Only two guys to a fight.
# One fight at a time.
# They fight without shirts or shoes.
# The fights go on as long as they have to.
# If this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight.
|''Fight Club'', pages 48–50&lt;ref name="palahniukfc4850"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in the book, a mechanic tells the narrator about two new rules of the fight club: nobody is the center of the fight club except for the two men fighting, and the fight club will always be free.

Marla, noticing that the narrator has not recently attended his support groups, calls him to claim that she has overdosed on [[Alprazolam|Xanax]] in a half-hearted suicide attempt. Tyler returns from work, picks up the phone to Marla's drug-induced rambling, and rescues her. Tyler and Marla embark on an uneasy affair that confounds the narrator and confuses Marla. Throughout this affair, Marla is unaware both of fight club's existence and the interaction between Tyler and the narrator. Because Tyler and Marla are never seen at the same time, the narrator wonders whether Tyler and Marla are the same person.

As fight club attains a nationwide presence, Tyler uses it to spread his [[anti-consumerist]] ideas, recruiting fight club's members to participate in increasingly elaborate pranks on corporate America. He eventually gathers the most devoted fight club members and forms "Project Mayhem", a [[cult]]-like organization that trains itself as an army to bring down modern [[civilization]]. This organization, like fight club, is controlled by a set of rules:

&lt;!-- NOTE: The rules below are given just as they appear in the novel (see page citations). The film has a slightly different version of the rules. Please don't change this list, or any part of it, to the film version. If you do, your changes will be reverted. --&gt;

# You don't ask questions.
# You don't ask questions.
# No excuses.
# No lies.
# You have to trust Tyler.|''Fight Club'', pages 119, 122, 125&lt;ref name="palahniukfc119122125"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, pp. 119, 122 &amp; 125. also pg 69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While initially a loyal participant in Project Mayhem, the narrator becomes uncomfortable with the increasing destructiveness of its activities. He resolves to stop Tyler and his followers when Bob, a friend from the testicular cancer support group, is killed during one of Project Mayhem's sabotage operations. 

The narrator then [[anagnorisis|learns]] that he himself is Tyler Durden.

As the narrator's mental state deteriorated, his mind formed a new personality that was able to escape from the problems of his life. Marla inadvertently reveals to the narrator that he and Tyler are the same person. Tyler's affair with Marla—whom the narrator professes to dislike—was the narrator's own affair with Marla. The narrator's bouts of insomnia had been Tyler's personality surfacing; Tyler was active whenever the  narrator was "sleeping". The Tyler personality not only created fight club, he also blew up the Narrator's condo.

Tyler plans to blow up a skyscraper using [[improvised explosive device|homemade bombs]] created by Project Mayhem; the target of the explosion is the nearby national museum. Tyler plans to die as a [[martyr]] during this event, taking the narrator's life as well. Realizing this, the narrator sets out to stop Tyler, although Tyler is always thinking ahead of him. The narrator makes his way to the roof of the building, where Tyler holds him at gunpoint. When Marla comes to the roof with one of the support groups, Tyler vanishes, as Tyler "was his hallucination, not hers."&lt;ref name="palahniukfc195"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Tyler gone, the narrator waits for the bomb to explode and kill him. The bomb malfunctions because Tyler mixed [[Kerosene|paraffin]] into the explosives. Still alive and holding Tyler's gun, the narrator makes the first decision that is truly his own: he puts the gun in his mouth and shoots himself. Some time later, he awakens in a mental hospital, believing he is in [[Heaven]], and imagines an argument with God over human nature. The book ends with the narrator being approached by hospital employees who reveal themselves to be Project members. They tell him their plans still continue, and that they are expecting Tyler to come back.

== History ==
Palahniuk once had an altercation while camping,&lt;ref name="jemielity"&gt;Jemielity, Sam. "[http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/dotcomversation/palahniuk/ Chuck Palahniuk:The Playboy.comversation]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016235628/http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/dotcomversation/palahniuk/ |date=October 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and though he returned to work bruised and swollen, his co-workers avoided asking him what had happened on the camping trip.  Their reluctance to know what happened in his private life inspired him to write ''Fight Club''.

In 1995, Palahniuk joined a Portland-based writing group that practiced a technique called "dangerous writing".  This technique, developed by American author [[Tom Spanbauer]], emphasizes the use of minimalist prose, and the use of painful, personal experiences for inspiration. Under Spanbauer's influence, Palahniuk produced an early draft of what would later become his novel ''[[Invisible Monsters]]'' (1999), but it was rejected by all publishers he submitted it to.  Palahniuk then decided to write an even darker novel, by expanding upon his short story, "Fight Club".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Palahniuk, Chuck (1962-), An Introduction to." ''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Ed. Lawrence J. Trudeau. Vol. 359. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale, 2014. ''Contemporary Literary Criticism Online''. Web. 30 Mar. 2016. pp. 253-342. http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=ZHWHGQ544011662&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cwru_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=LCO&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=0eaf86a3b8cd35ead5328890e6b88bfc&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially ''Fight Club'' was published as a seven-page short story in the compilation ''Pursuit of Happiness'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pursuit of Happiness: A Left Bank Book| publisher= Blue Heron Publishing|edition= First |date=June 1995|isbn= 0936085304|editor=Linny Stovall }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Palahniuk expanded it to novel length (in which the original short story became chapter six); ''Fight Club: A Novel'' was published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fight Club: A Novel|author=Chuck Palahniuk|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company|edition= 1st |date=August 17, 1996|isbn=0393039765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fight Club: A Novel'' was re-issued in 1999 and 2004; the latter edition includes the author's introduction about the conception and popularity of the novel and movie, in which Palahniuk states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...bookstores were full of books like ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' and ''[[The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood]]'' and ''[[How to Make an American Quilt (novel)|How to Make an American Quilt]]''. These were all novels that presented a social model for women to be together. But there was no novel that presented a new social model for men to share their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Palahniuk, 1997, p. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He later explains: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Really, what I was writing was just ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' updated a little. It was 'apostolic' fiction—where a surviving apostle tells the story of his hero. There are two men and a woman. And one man, the hero, is shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;Palahniuk, 1997, p. XVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One critic has noted that this essay can be seen as Palahniuk's way of interpreting his own novel. According to this critic, Palahniuk's essay emphasizes the communicative and romantic elements of the novel while it deemphasizes its transgressive elements.&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, Mikkel. 2014. ""There had to be some kind of chorus": Re-interpretation by Postscript in ''Fight Club''" in ''Le Post-scriptum ou la rhétorique de l'ajout'' (eds. Christelle Serée-Chaussinand &amp; Sylvie Crinquand) Lyon: Merry World Éditions Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In interviews, the writer has said he is still approached by people wanting to know the location of the nearest fight club. Palahniuk insists there is no such real organization. He has heard of real fight clubs, some said to have existed before the novel. Project Mayhem is lightly based on [[Cacophony Society|The Cacophony Society]], of which Palahniuk is a member, and other events derived from stories told to him.&lt;ref name="palahniukstf228229"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories'', pp. 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fight Club''{{'}}s cultural impact is evidenced by the establishment of fight clubs by teenagers and "techies" in the United States.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;"[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-05-29-fight-club_x.htm Fight club draws techies for bloody underground beatdowns]". [[Associated Press]]. May 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pranks, such as food-tampering, have been repeated by fans of the book, documented in Palahniuk's essay "Monkey Think, Monkey Do",&lt;ref name="palahniukstf212215"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories'', pp. 212–215.&lt;/ref&gt; in the book ''[[Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories]]'' (2004) and in the introduction to the 2004 re-issue of ''Fight Club.'' Other fans have been inspired to prosocial activity, telling Palahniuk the novel had inspired them to return to college.&lt;ref name="tomlinson"&gt;Tomlinson, Sarah.

== Characters ==

=== The Narrator ===
A modern-day [[everyman]] figure as well as an employee specializing in recalls for an unnamed car company, the Narrator—who remains unnamed throughout the novel—is extremely depressed and suffers from insomnia. Some readers call him "Joe", because of his constant use of the name in such statements as, "I am Joe's boiling point". The quotes, "I am Joe's [blank]", refer to the Narrator's reading old ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' articles in which human organs write about themselves in the first person, with titles such as "I Am Joe's Liver". The [[Fight Club|film adaptation]] replaces "Joe" with "Jack", inspiring some fans to call the Narrator "Jack". In the novel and film, the Narrator uses various aliases in the support groups. His subconscious is in need of a sense of freedom, he inevitably feels trapped within his own body, and when introduced to Tyler Durden, he begins to see all of the qualities he lacks in himself: "I love everything about Tyler Durden, his courage, his smarts, and his nerve. Tyler is funny and forceful and independent, and men look up to him and expect him to change their world. Tyler is capable and free, and I am not."&lt;ref name="Palahniukfc174" &gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In the official sequel comic book series also penned by Palahniuk (with art by [[Cameron Stewart]]), ''[[Fight Club 2]]'', it is revealed that the Narrator has chosen to be identified by the name of Sebastian.&lt;ref name="fightclub2"&gt;Fight Club 2 #1, Chuck Palahniuk &amp; Cameron Stewart, Dark Horse Comics, May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tyler Durden ===
"Because of his nature",&lt;ref name="palahniukfc25"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler works night jobs where he sabotages companies and harms clients. He also steals left-over drained human fat from liposuction clinics to supplement his income through soap making and to create the ingredients for bomb manufacturing, which will be put to work later with his fight club. He is the co-founder of Fight Club, as it was his idea to instigate the fight that led to it. He later launches Project Mayhem, from which he and the members commit various attacks on consumerism. Tyler is blond, according to the Narrator's comment "in his everything-blond way". The unhinged but magnetic Tyler becomes the "[[villain]]" of the novel later in the story. The Narrator refers to Tyler as a free spirit who says, "Let that which does not matter truly slide."

=== Marla Singer ===
A woman whom the Narrator meets during a support group. The Narrator no longer receives the same release from the groups when he realizes Marla is faking her problems just as he is. After he leaves the groups, he meets her again when she becomes Tyler's lover. Marla is shown to be extremely unkempt, uncaring, and sometimes even suicidal. At times, she shows a softer, more caring side.

=== Robert "Big Bob" Paulsen ===
The Narrator meets Bob at a support group for [[testicular cancer]]. A former [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], Bob lost his testicles to cancer caused by the [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] he used to bulk up his muscles. He had to undergo testosterone injections, resulting in increased [[estrogen]]. The increased estrogen levels caused him to grow [[Gynecomastia|large breasts]] and to develop a softer voice. Because of his "bitch tits", Bob is the only known member who is allowed to wear a shirt. The Narrator befriends Bob and, after leaving the groups, meets him again in fight club. Bob's death later in the story, while carrying out an assignment for Project Mayhem, causes the Narrator to turn against Tyler because the members of Project Mayhem treat it as a trivial matter instead of a tragedy.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=nv_sr_1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Angel Face ===
A man who joins Fight Club. He is very loyal to Project Mayhem, laughing at the vandalism he and a group of "space monkeys" have caused as their crimes appear on the evening news. Angel Face is considered very beautiful, hence his name. The blond-haired beauty suffers a savage beating at the Narrator's hands during a Fight Club session; the Narrator states that he "wanted to destroy something beautiful." The next time Angel Face is heard of in the novel, he is described as not being quite as beautiful anymore. Whereas in the book it is that excessive beating which triggers the foundation of Project Mayhem (Fight Club no longer being a sufficient outlet), in the movie the beating seems to be caused primarily by the Narrator's jealousy.

== Motifs ==
At two points in the novel, the Narrator claims he wants to "wipe [his] ass with the [[Mona Lisa]]"; a mechanic who joins fight club repeats this to him in one scene.&lt;ref name="palahniukfc124141200"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, pp. 124, 141 &amp; 200.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[motif (literature)|motif]] shows his desire for chaos, later explicitly expressed in his urge to "destroy something beautiful". Additionally, he mentions at one point, "Nothing is static. Even the Mona Lisa is falling apart."&lt;ref name="palahniukfc49"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This is most explicitly stated in the scene the mechanic appears in:

{{quote|
The mechanic says, "If you're male and you're [[Christian]] and living in America, your father is your model for God. And if you never know your father, if your father bails out or dies or is never at home, what do you believe about God?&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
How Tyler saw it was that getting God's attention for being bad was better than getting no attention at all. Maybe because God's hate is better than His indifference.&lt;br /&gt;
If you could be either God's worst enemy or nothing, which would you choose?&lt;br /&gt;
We are God's middle children, according to Tyler Durden, with no special place in history and no special attention.&lt;br /&gt;
Unless we get God's attention, we have no hope of damnation or redemption.&lt;br /&gt;
Which is worse, hell or nothing?&lt;br /&gt;
Only if we're caught and punished can we be saved.&lt;br /&gt;
"Burn the [[Louvre]]," the mechanic says, "and wipe your ass with the [[Mona Lisa]]. This way at least, God would know our names."|''Fight Club'', page 141&lt;ref name="palahniukfc141"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Fight Club'', 1999, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kennett further argues that Tyler wants to use this chaos to change history so that "God's middle children" will have some historical significance, whether or not this significance is "damnation or redemption".&lt;ref name="kennett5152"&gt;Kennett, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; This will figuratively return their absent fathers, as judgment by future generations will replace judgment by their fathers.

After seeing ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' articles written from the perspective of the organs of a man named Joe,&lt;!-- This is correct: The name Joe was used in the novel. Do not change this to Jack, the name used in the film. --&gt; the Narrator begins using similar quotations to describe his feelings. He often replaces organs with feelings and things involved in his life (such as "I am Joe's smirking revenge").

The color [[cornflower blue]] first appears as the color of the Narrator's boss's tie and later is requested as an icon color by the same boss.&lt;ref name="palahniukfc49" /&gt; Later, it is mentioned that his boss has eyes the same color. These mentions of the color are the first of many uses of cornflower blue in Palahniuk's books.

[[Isolationism]], specifically directed towards material items and possessions, is a common theme throughout the novel. Tyler acts as the major catalyst behind the destruction of our vanities, which he claims is the path to finding our inner selves. "I'm breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions," Tyler whispered, "because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit."

Jesse Kavadlo, a professor at [[Maryville University]] of St. Louis, argues that the Narrator's opposition to emasculation is a form of projection, and the problem that he fights is himself.&lt;ref name="kavadlo5"&gt;Kavadlo, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that Palahniuk uses [[existentialism]] in the novel to conceal subtexts of [[feminism]] and romance, in order to convey these concepts in a novel that is mainly aimed at a male audience.&lt;ref name="kavadlo7"&gt;Kavadlo, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an essay titled "''Fight Club'' and the Disneyfication of Manhood," Cameron White and Trenia Walker suggest that Project Mayhem's ultimate goal, through the destruction of financial institutions, is to shatter what society deems "real" manhood, reducing manhood to survival instincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tooning In: Essays on Popular Culture and Education|last=White|first=Cameron|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0742559707|location=Lanham, MD|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Skinner has also echoed this sentiment, stating, "the anger and dissatisfaction of the male characters is against one type of masculinity being suppressed by post-industrial consumerist society".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Paul. ''Fighting for Their Place: Constructing Masculinity in Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club''. Thesis. University of Nebraska, 2011. Ann Arbor: Proquest LLC, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palahniuk gives a simpler assertion about the theme of the novel, stating "all my books are about a lonely person looking for some way to connect with other people."&lt;ref name="palahniukstfxv"&gt;Palahniuk, ''Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories'', p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Kennett argues that because the Narrator's fights with Tyler are fights with himself, and because he fights himself in front of his boss at the hotel, the Narrator is using the fights as a way of asserting himself as his own boss. These fights are a representation of the struggle of the [[Proletariat|proletarian]] at the hands of a higher capitalist power; by asserting himself as capable of having the same power he thus becomes his own master. Later when fight club is formed, the participants are all dressed and groomed similarly, allowing them to symbolically fight themselves at the club and gain the same power.&lt;ref name="kennett5354"&gt;Kennett, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler becomes nostalgic for patriarchal power giving him control and creates Project Mayhem to achieve this. Through this proto-fascist power structure, the Narrator seeks to learn "what, or rather, who, he might have been under a firm patriarchy."&lt;ref name="kennett55"&gt;Kennett, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his position as leader of Project Mayhem, Tyler uses his power to become a "God/Father" to the "space monkeys" (the other members of Project Mayhem), although by the end of the novel his words hold more power than he does, as is evident in the space monkeys' threat to castrate the Narrator when he contradicts Tyler's rule. According to Kennett, this creates a paradox in that Tyler pushes the idea that men who wish to be free from a controlling father-figure are only [[self-actualization|self-actualized]] once they have children and become a father themselves, thus becoming controllers themselves in an endless cycle of patriarchal repression.&lt;ref name="kennett56"&gt;Kennett, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johannes Hell argues that Palahniuk's use of the Narrator's somnambulism is a simple attempt at emphasizing the dangerous yet daring possibilities of life. Hell enforces the importance of the Narrator's sleepwalking and intense deprivation, for they have a firm influence on suffering readers,"&lt;ref name="Hell3"&gt;Hell, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; from a twisted perspective this is solace for everybody who suffers from somnambulism in a sense, that things could be worse, much worse in fact.&lt;ref name="Hell3"&gt;Hell, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Mayhem's terrorism in ''Fight Club'' has been analyzed within the context of the terrorist attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11th, 2001]].  In 2007, Ruth Quiney examined this link, stating that ''Fight Club'''s depiction of disaffected Western men joining a homegrown terrorist group anticipated some aspects of the [[War on Terror]]''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Jesse Kavadlo, in his essay "With Us or Against Us: Chuck Palahniuk's 9/11," claims that Palahniuk was almost prophetic in predicting future acts of terror.  He writes, "Palahniuk's work demonstrates the disturbing intersections between the multiple meanings of the word "plot": narrative, conspiratorial, and funereal, the word reminding us of the linguistic connections between our stories, our secrets, and our entombment."&lt;ref&gt;Kavadlo, Jesse. "With Us or Against Us: Chuck Palahniuk's 9/11". ''Reading Chuck Palahniuk: American Monsters and Literary Mayhem''. Ed. Cynthia G. Kuhn and Lance Rubin. New York: Routledge, 2009. Print. pp. 103-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
At the time of its publication, ''Fight Club'' was well-received critically.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It was called "brilliantly creepy" by ''[[The Washington Post]],'' and "unsettling and nerve-chafing" by ''[[The Seattle Times]].  [[The Baltimore Sun]]'' commended its very publication, stating, "bravo to Norton for having the courage to publish it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffert|first=Barbara|date=15 March 1997|title=Fight Club|url=|journal=Library Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many critics, ''Fight Club'' is considered the embodiment of Palahniuk's writing style and thematic concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "forecasts" section of a 1996 ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised the novel:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;Writing in an iconic deadpan and including something to offend everyone, Palahniuk is a risky writer who takes chances galore, especially with a particularly bizarre plot twist he throws in late in the book. Caustic, outrageous, bleakly funny, violent, and always unsettling, Palahniuk's utterly original creation will make even the most jaded reader sit up and take notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 June 1996|title=Forecasts|url=|journal=Publishers Weekly|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Some critics have condemned ''Fight Club'' because of its violent, heteronormative themes and cult philosophy. Peter Matthews, however, argues that these critics often overlook the novel's ironic critique of its characters' violent worldview.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The book received critical interest and eventually generated cinematic-adaptation interest. In 1999, screenwriters [[Jim Uhls]], [[August Olsen]], and co-producers [[Conor Strait]] and [[Aaron Curry (producer)|Aaron Curry]] joined director [[David Fincher]]. The film "failed" at the box office,&lt;ref&gt;Linson, Art (Fight Club producer), What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line (New York: Grove Press, 2008) pp. 125–127.&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[Cult film|cult following]] emerged with the DVD edition and as a result, an original, hardcover edition of the novel is now a collector's item.&lt;ref name="offman"&gt;Offman, Craig. "[http://archive.salon.com/books/log/1999/09/03/fight_club/ Movie makes "Fight Club" book a contender]". [[Salon.com]]. September 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its film adaptation, the novel gained popularity among young, male American readers.  Critics have attributed ''Fight Club'''s popularity with this audience to its critique of an emasculating consumerist culture, and to the implied message that modern men need revert to their primal, aggressive nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''The Evening Standard'' said the novel was the origin of the term "[[special snowflake|snowflake]]". "I coined 'snowflake' and I stand by it", Palahniuk said in 2017. "Every generation gets offended by different things but my friends who teach in high school tell me that their students are very easily offended ... The modern Left is always reacting to things. Once they get their show on the road culturally they will stop being so offended."&lt;ref name="es20170124"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/londoners-diary-chuck-palahniuk-i-coined-snowflake-and-i-stand-by-it-a3448226.html |title=Londoner's Diary: Fight Club's Chuck Palahniuk: "I coined 'snowflake' and I stand by it" |date=2017-01-24 |newspaper=The Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
Palahniuk was convinced to continue ''Fight Club'' in comics form by fellow novelist [[Chelsea Cain]] and comic writers [[Brian Michael Bendis]], [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbitalcomics.com/orbital-in-conversation-episode-150-talking-fight-club-with-chuck-palahniuk/] Orbital in Conversation with Chuck Palahniuk&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], Palahniuk announced that [[Fight Club 2 (comic book)|a sequel to ''Fight Club'']] is in the works and will take the form of a serialized graphic novel. According to Palahniuk, "It will likely be a series of books that update the story ten years after the seeming end of Tyler Durden. Nowadays, Tyler is telling the story, lurking inside Sebastian, and ready to launch a come-back. Sebastian is oblivious. Marla is bored. Their marriage has run aground on the rocky coastline of middle-aged suburban boredom. It's only when their little boy disappears, kidnapped by Tyler, that Sebastian is dragged back into the world of Mayhem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://herocomplex.latimes.com/books/comic-con-chuck-palahniuk-announces-fight-club-sequel/#/0|title=Comic-Con: Chuck Palahniuk announces 'Fight Club' sequel |last1= Gettell|first1= Oliver|date= July 22, 2013|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dark Horse Comics]] is publishing this new story in a 10-issue maxi series, written by Palahniuk and illustrated by [[Cameron Stewart]], starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/fight-club-2-is-coming-in-2015-1608619346/+jesusdiaz|title=Fight Club 2 is coming in 2015 |last=Diaz|first=Jesus|date= July 21, 2014|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[David W. Mack]], who is friends with Palahniuk, will be illustrating the covers for the series and has said of the material, "The twists and turns are just primo artifacts of Chuck Palahniuk's brain material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviebuzzers.com/comic-con-2/new-york-comic-con/nycc-2014-fight-club-2-interview-artists-cameron-stewart-david-mack|work=Moviebuzzers.com|title=NYCC 2014 Fight Club 2 Interview|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A teaser was released by [[Dark Horse Comics]] for [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2015, with ''[[Fight Club 2]]'' #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores [[Joseph Campbell]]'s concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, which is something that has always fascinated Palahniuk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbitalcomics.com/orbital-in-conversation-episode-150-talking-fight-club-with-chuck-palahniuk/] Orbital in Conversation Episode 150&lt;/ref&gt;

On the ''Orbital In Conversation'' podcast, Chuck stated that he is already working on ''Fight Club 3'', which will also be in comic form. He also confirmed that he is working on a series of original short stories for comics which will appear as one-shots before eventually being collected into a single book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbitalcomics.com/orbital-in-conversation-episode-150-talking-fight-club-with-chuck-palahniuk/] Orbital Comics podcast with Chuck Palahniuk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filmi''' ("of films") music soundtracks are produced for India's mainstream motion picture industry and written and performed for [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]]. In cinema, [[List of Indian film music directors|music directors]] make up the main body of composers; the songs are performed by [[playback singer]]s and the genre represents 72% of the music sales market in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8405891.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plans to start India music awards | date=10 December 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2010 | first=Prachi | last=Pinglay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmi music tends to have appeal across India, Nepal and overseas, especially among the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. Songs are often in different languages depending on the target audience, for example in Hindi or Tamil. Playback singers are usually more noted for their ability to sing rather than their charisma as performers. Filmi playback singers level of success and appeal is tied to their involvement with film soundtracks of cinema releases with the highest box office ratings.

At the "Filmi Melody: Song and Dance in Indian Cinema" archive presentation at [[UCLA]], filmi was praised as a generally more fitting term for the tradition than 'Bombay melody' "  suggesting that the exuberant music and melodrama so closely identified with the Hindi commercial cinema produced in Bombay (Mumbai) is truly pan-Indian."&lt;ref&gt;UCLA International Institute. 2005. Screening - Nayakan (Hero). Available from: http://www.international.ucla.edu/showevent.asp?eventid=3700. Accessed 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{See|Music of Bollywood}}

In the earliest years, filmi music was generally Indian (classical Carnatic, Hindustani, and village folk) in inspiration; over the years, Western elements have increased significantly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} However, film soundtracks continue to be very diverse, sometimes fusing genres or reverting to entirely classical music. Examples of this can be found throughout the history of filmi music.

==Music directors==
{{Main|Indian film music directors}}
R. C. Boral, Harishchandra Bali, [[Pankaj Mullick]], Anil Biswas, [[Naushad Ali]], [[Khwaja Khurshid Anwar]] and [[S. Rajeswara Rao]] were noteworthy music directors of the 1940s. Rao, who scored the 1948 Tamil ''[[Chandralekha (1948 film)|Chandralekha]]'', the first all-India hit, continued music directing in Chennai until the 1980s. The 1950s and 1960s, included music composers like [[Shankar Jaikishan]], [[S. D. Burman]], [[O. P. Nayyar]], [[Madan Mohan]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[C. Ramchandra]], [[Roshan (music director)|Roshan]], [[Vasant Desai]], [[Kalyanji–Anandji]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://arpjournal.com/858/the-cultural-economy-of-sound-reinventing-technology-in-indian-popular-cinema/ Carlo Nardi (July 2011). "The Cultural Economy of Sound: Reinventing Technology in Indian Popular Cinema". ''Journal on the Art of Record Production'', Issue 5], {{ISSN|1754-9892}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mohammed Zahur Khayyam|Khayyam]] in Hindi film music. [[K. V. Mahadevan]], Vishwanathan-Ramamoorthy, [[Laxmikant–Pyarelal]], [[G. Devarajan]], [[V. Dakshinamoorthy]] and [[M. S. Viswanathan]] were active music directors for more than 35 years from the 1950s.

As Indian cinema segued into the 1960s and 1970s, pop artists like [[R. D. Burman]], [[Bappi Lahiri]] and duos like [[Nadeem–Shravan]] and [[Jatin–Lalit]] gave filmi a stronger western flavor with composers [[Ilaiyaraaja]] and [[Raveendran]] who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s in Tamil film music.

Major musical forces in the 1990s and 2000s have included [[A. R. Rahman]], [[Nadeem–Shravan]], [[Pritam]], [[Himesh Reshammiya]], [[Harris Jayaraj]], [[Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy]], [[Vishal–Shekhar]], [[Vidyasagar (composer)|Vidyasagar]], [[M. Jayachandran]], [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], [[Deepak Dev]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]], [[Anu Malik]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Salim–Sulaiman]], [[Devi Sri Prasad]] etc. A. R. Rahman, who was described by ''Time'' magazine as "India's most prominent movie songwriter,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Corliss|Corliss, Richard]]. (January 1, 2005).

==Playback singers==
{{Main|List of Indian playback singers|Playback singer}}

A playback singer is a singer who pre-records songs for use in films. The singer records the song and the actors or actresses [[lip-sync]] the song in front of the cameras, a form of singing that is characteristic of the Indian subcontinent. The songs of a film, the quality of the music and its music director (composer), lyricist and singer have often determined the success of a film. Film soundtracks are sometimes released before the film itself, resulting in a disparity between the soundtrack and the songs appearing in the film.

In the 1950s and '60s, lyricists like [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]], [[Hasrat Jaipuri]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Raja Mehdi Ali Khan]], [[Rajendra Krishan]], [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], [[Bharat Vyas]], [[Shakeel Badayuni]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[Anand Bakshi]], [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]] and [[S. H. Bihari]] wrote lyrics of many classic filmi songs. Lyrics tended towards the literary and drew heavily on contemporary [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] poetry. The south has seen poets like [[Kannadasan]], [[Vairamuthu]] and [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]] rise to prominence, in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetry and literature alongside [[Vayalar Ramavarma]], [[P. Bhaskaran]], [[O. N. V. Kurup]] in the [[Malayalam music#Malayalam film music|Malayalam music industry]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Popularity ratings==
[[Binaca Geetmala]], [[Ameen Sayani]]'s popular [[Hindi language]] radio show before [[satellite television]] took over in India sometime in the 1990s, gave weekly popularity ratings of Hindi film songs (akin to the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] list of songs). It ran in various incarnations from 1952 to 1993, and annual lists of the most popular songs were played at year-end. The list was compiled on the basis of record sales in [[India]].&lt;ref name=Screen&gt;Reliving the Geetmala lore. ''S.K. Screen'', Friday, 22 September 2000, transcript at {{cite web |url=http://www.ameensayani.com/reviews/review_4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905081633/http://www.ameensayani.com/reviews/review_4.htm |archivedate=2005-09-05 |df= }}, accessed 2006-7-29&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Hindi filmi songs are sold on tape and CD compilations, played as promos and in programs on various television channels and radio stations, with different popularity ratings claiming different songs as being on the top. In an annual exercise, a net-based effort [http://awards.giitaayan.com/ RMIM Puraskaar] lists all important Hindi film songs of the year, in addition to awarding songs for various categories.

==Accusations of plagiarism==
Because popular music directors score a great many films over the course of a year, accusations of plagiarizing abound. For example, one production number in ''[[Dil]]'' (1990) is based on [[Carl Perkins]]' ''[[Blue Suede Shoes]]'', sung with [[Hindi]] lyrics. Of late the Indian film industry has been gaining visibility outside India, and the legal risks of plagiarism have been gaining importance. Some producers have actually paid for the musical rights to popular Western songs, as in ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'''s (2003) song, "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]". Plagiarism has also existed within India, with several music directors in Bombay cinema lifting tunes from other "regional" industries.

There have also been accusations of plagiarism against foreigner musicians borrowing from Hindi filmi songs. For example, "[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]] was largely based on two 1970s filmi songs: "Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana" from ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978)  and "Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan" from ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name=Apradh&gt;{{YouTube|id=fWsSXjIDL3Q|title=ae naujawan hai sub kuchh yahan - Apradh 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both songs were originally composed by [[Kalyanji Anandji]] and sung by [[Asha Bhosle]].&lt;ref name=Denselow&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Denselow|title=Kalyanji Anandji, The Bollywood Brothers|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2 May 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/02/worldmusic1|accessdate=2009-03-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is "[[Addictive (song)|Addictive]]" sung by [[Truth Hurts]], which is lifted from [[Lata Mangeshkar]]'s "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" from ''Jyoti'' (1981). This led to the copyright holders of the original song filing a lawsuit against [[DJ Quik]] and [[Dr. Dre]], the producers of "Addictive".&lt;ref name="VH1"/&gt; ''Filmi'' music composed by [[A. R. Rahman]] (who would later win two [[Academy Award]]s for the [[Slumdog Millionaire (soundtrack)|''Slumdog Millionaire'' soundtrack]]) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the [[Singapore]]an artist [[Kelly Poon]], the [[Music of Uzbekistan|Uzbek artist]] Iroda Dilroz, the French rap group [[La Caution]], the American artist [[Ciara]], and the [[Germany|German]] band [[Löwenherz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=afpx7qJB_ag|title=Löwenherz - Bis in die Ewigkeit}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

==Wider success==
Filmi is also making converts and exerting influence beyond the usual [[Desi]] audiences, with many Western music stores today carrying Indian music compilations. As early as 1978, the [[synthpop]] pioneers [[Haruomi Hosono]] and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] of the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] produced an [[Electronic music|electronic]] album ''Cochin Moon'' based on an [[Experimental music|experimental]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] between electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dominique Leone|date=July 19, 2005|title=Hosono &amp; Yokoo: Cochin Moon|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1988, [[Devo]]'s hit song "Disco Dancer" was inspired by the song "I am a Disco Dancer" from the Bollywood film ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=T-BGltttqaE|title=DEVO - disco dancer with commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baz Luhrmann]] showcases the song "Chamma Chamma" from ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]'' (1998) in his [[2001 in film|2001]] movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!|Moulin Rouge]]''. Another 2001 film ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' featured [[Mohammed Rafi]]'s song "[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]" from the 1965 film ''[[Gumnaam]]''. The 2002 song "[[Addictive (song)|Addictive]]", sung by Truth Hurts and produced by [[DJ Quik]] and [[Dr. Dre]], was lifted from [[Lata Mangeshkar]]'s "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" from ''Jyoti'' (1981).&lt;ref name=VH1&gt;{{cite web|title=Truth Hurts |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=2002-09-19 |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1457672/09192002/truth_hurts.jhtml |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413172839/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1457672/09192002/truth_hurts.jhtml |archivedate=April 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' [[Grammy Award]] winning 2005 song "[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]" was inspired by two 1970s Bollywood songs: "Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana" from ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978) and "Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan" from ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name="Apradh"/&gt; Both songs were originally composed by [[Kalyanji Anandji]], sung by [[Asha Bhosle]], and featured the dancer [[Helen (actress)|Helen]].&lt;ref name=Denselow /&gt; The songs "Mera Man Tera Pyasa" from the movie ''[[Gambler (film)|Gambler]]'' (1971) performed by [[Mohammed Rafi]], "Tere Sang Pyar Main" from the movie ''[[Nagin (1976 film)|Nagin]]'' (1976) performed by [[Lata Mangeshkar]], and "Wada Na Tod" also by Lata Mangeshkar from the movie ''[[Dil Tujhko Diya]]'' (1987) were featured in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (soundtrack)|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004). Scores from [[Tamil cinema|Chennai Tamil films]] have appeared in productions such as ''[[Lord of War]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Accidental Husband]]'' (2008). [[Ilaiyaraaja]] won the Gold Remi Award for Best Music Score jointly with film composer [[M. S. Viswanathan]] at the WorldFest-Houston Film Festival for the Tamil film ''[[Vishwa Thulasi]]'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;IMDb.com. Undated. [http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/WorldFest_Houston/2005 WorldFest Houston: 2005]. Accessed 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Rahman]] rose to fame from the Chennai film industry to become one of the most popular international music directors and has had a musical''[[Bombay Dreams]]'', playing in London and New York, and scored several projects outside India. He has won two Academy awards and two Grammy awards, even numerous international awards and accolades. The song "[[Chaiyya Chaiyya]]", originally composed by A. R. Rahman for ''[[Dil Se..]]'' (1998), has also been well received around the world, making several top 10 world music lists and has even been featured in several American movies. The song was in both the opening scene and credits of [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Inside Man]]''. Rahman's earlier [[Roja (soundtrack)|soundtrack for ''Roja'']] (1991) was included in [[Time magazine's "All-TIME" 100 best movies|TIME's 10 Best Soundtracks]] of all time in 2005.

'''''Fire Emblem Fates'''''{{efn|Known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Fire Emblem If'''''|ファイアーエムブレム if|Faiā Emuburemu Ifu||}}}} is a [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]] video game for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[handheld video game console]], developed by [[Intelligent Systems]] and [[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. It was released in June 2015 in Japan, then released internationally in 2016. It is the fourteenth game in the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series,{{efn|Sources disagree on the exact numbering: it is variously called the 12th,&lt;ref name="FEnumberA"/&gt; 14th including remakes,&lt;ref name="FEnumberB"/&gt; and 15th including all video game titles to that date.&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt;}} and the second to be developed for Nintendo 3DS after ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]''. ''Fates'' was released in three versions, each following a different storyline centered around the same characters: '''''Birthright'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''White Night Kingdom'''''&lt;ref name="VersionTitles1"/&gt;|白夜王国|Byakuya Ōkoku}}}} and '''''Conquest'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Dark Night Kingdom'''''&lt;ref name="VersionTitles1"/&gt;|暗夜王国|Anya Ōkoku}}}} as physical releases, and '''''Revelation'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|'''''Invisible Kingdom'''''&lt;ref name="VersionTitles2"/&gt;|インビジブルキングダム|Inbijiburu Kingudamu}}}} as [[downloadable content]].

The overarching story follows the protagonist, a customizable Avatar created by the player, as they are unwillingly drawn into a war between the Kingdoms of Hoshido (their birthplace) and Nohr (their adopted home), and must choose which side to support. In ''Revelation'', the Avatar rallies both sides against the true mastermind behind the war. The gameplay, which revolves around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, although some elements are unique to each scenario.

After the critical and commercial success of ''Awakening'', development began on ''Fates'', with the staff of ''Awakening'' returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from some fans. To this end, writer [[Shin Kibayashi]] was brought in. To show all sides of the story and provide players with different ''Fire Emblem'' experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: ''Birthright'' was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, ''Conquest'' was praised for its challenge, while ''Revelation'' was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.

== Gameplay ==
In ''Fire Emblem Fates'', the player begins by customizing the main character. Their gender, appearance, and name can be changed to the player's preference. At the game's beginning, there are three difficulties: Normal, Hard, and Lunatic. There are also modes that dictate the fate of characters in battle should they be defeated. In Classic Mode, a fallen unit is subject to [[permanent death]], a recurring mode in the ''Fire Emblem'' series that removes fallen characters from the rest of the game. Casual Mode enables units to be revived at the end of a battle. The new Phoenix mode revives units on the following player turn.&lt;ref name="FEFmodes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNpreview"/&gt; Each version of ''Fates'' is focused around a different gameplay style. The gameplay of ''Birthright'' is similar to the prior installment ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]'' and features opportunities to gain extra gold and experience. In contrast, ''Conquest'' rewards players limited experience and currency per completed map. Also included are additional objectives in battle such as defending a base or suppressing enemy forces, and some levels have a limited number of turns.&lt;ref name="4Ginterview"/&gt; ''Revelation'' uses a mixture of elements from ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'': while offering opportunities for gold and experience as with ''Birthright'', it provides varied objectives and strategic elements similar to ''Conquest''.&lt;ref name="IGNreviewRevelation"/&gt;

A new feature introduced to the series is "My Castle", in which the player is able to create a base for their army, where they can establish shops, buy weapons and items, and interact with allied characters. Shops can be leveled up, which allows the player to choose from a wider range of items to buy. Players can run a farm in their base, allowing them to make food. At the restaurant in the base, they can serve food, which will grant characters who eat it positive effects; however, some foods can also have negative effects. The player's personal quarters are also located here; the player can use them to interact with detailed models of other characters and the Avatar's spouse (if applicable). Players are able to visit other players' bases using the [[StreetPass]] functionality of the Nintendo 3DS. During a visit, they can fight the other player's army, buy items, and recruit characters. As different items are available in the two versions of the game, this allows players access to items that normally would be unavailable.&lt;ref name="SilMycastle"/&gt;

===Battle system===
[[File:FE Fates screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Screenshot of a battle in ''Fire Emblem Fates'', showing two characters about to fight one another. The basic mechanics of the battle system are all displayed.]]
Battles take place on a grid-based battlefield, with turns being given for players and enemies. During an attack, the view transitions from a [[top-down perspective]] to a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person view]]. Environments and terrain vary between levels, ranging from mountainous regions to flatlands. A unique ability members of each kingdom's royal family have is the ability to use Dragon Veins, which are special map tiles that enable them to alter the environment in favor of their side.&lt;ref name="FEgameplay"/&gt; Like previous games in the series, ''Fire Emblem Fates'' features a "weapon triangle" – a system where certain weapons have advantages over others. However, in ''Fates'' the triangle differs from previous installments, with swords and magic defeating axes and bows, axes and bows besting lances and hidden weapons, and lances and hidden weapons overpowering swords and magic. Weapons in ''Fates'' do not have a limited number of uses before they break; instead, stronger weapons will lower some of the user's abilities. For instance, while the Brave Sword allows its user to attack twice, it also lowers their defense and magic defense stats.&lt;ref name="SilTriangle"/&gt;

Units are assigned a unique [[character class]]: in battle, each unit's usable weapon types and range of movement are pre-determined by their class.&lt;ref name= "FEgameplay"/&gt; Each character begins the game with a starting class: the main protagonist begins as a Nohr Prince/Princess, while Azura begins as a Songstress. The classes of each version of ''Fates'' are also distinct from each other, drawing from their respective nation's aesthetics.&lt;ref name="FamCharacters"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "RPGFclasses"/&gt; Using special items known as "Seals", classes can be evolved or changed: effects of various Seals range from upgrading a character's class, changing class completely, raising their experience level, or altering their stats.&lt;ref name="PolyReview"/&gt; Character relationships are developed during and between battle, also known as Support, which can be viewed in conversations via the Support menu outside of battle. Battling with an adjacent or paired-up unit gives advantages, such as blocking an attack or attacking alongside the currently controlled unit. Outside battle, relationships between characters can be fostered to the point of marriage and children. These children's appearance and abilities are determined by their parents.&lt;ref name="FEgameplay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFmarriage"/&gt; Using a particular Seal, child characters can also take on additional skills from parents.&lt;ref name="PolyReview"/&gt;

The game features [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]]. Having five maps as standard, matches can be carried out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with special limitations. The Fog of War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes.&lt;ref name="FEFmulti"/&gt; In addition, ''Fates'' features [[Amiibo]] support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier ''Fire Emblem'' games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of ''Fire Emblem Awakening''{{'}}s Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.&lt;ref name="FEFamiPlay"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
&lt;!-- The player protagonist is referred to by developers and in promotional material as Avatar, never being given any kind of formal name or gender. Please do not use the default name "Corrin/Kamui" in the text. --&gt;
''Fates'' is primarily set in the territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line of descent from ancient [[dragon]]s, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist in a state of war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref name="IFguide"/&gt; In the ''Hidden Truths'' DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.&lt;ref name="IFguide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFhidden"/&gt;

The central character is the Avatar, named [[Corrin (Fire Emblem)|Corrin]] by default, (voiced by [[Cam Clarke]], [[Yuri Lowenthal]], [[Stephanie Lemelin]], Marcella Lentz-Pope or Danielle Judovits&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Emblem: Fates – Characters/Actors Images|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/video-games/Fire-Emblem-Fates/side-by-side/|website=Behind The Voice Actors|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whose name, gender, and appearance can be customized by the player. A member of the Hoshidan royal family, they were captured by Nohr at a young age. They have the unique ability of transforming into a dragon. The other central character is Azura (voiced by Rena Strober&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;), a member of the Nohrian royal family who was kidnapped by Hoshido as part of their efforts to rescue the Avatar. Holding power over water, she is one of the companions to join the Avatar in whichever story route they choose. The main characters among the Hoshidan royal family include the Avatar's siblings Ryoma (voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]]&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;), Takumi (voiced by [[Roger Rose]]&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;), Hinoka (voiced by [[Elizabeth Daily]]&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;), and Sakura (voiced by Brianna Knickerbocker&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;). Ryoma and Takumi wield the Legendary Weapons of Hoshido, the Raijinto [[katana]] and the Fujin [[Yumi]]. The main characters from the Nohrian kingdom include the Avatar's guardian, Gunter (voiced by [[D. C. Douglas]]&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;), and their adoptive siblings Xander (voiced by David Stanbra), Camilla (voiced by [[Paula Tiso]]), Leo (voiced by [[Max Mittelman]]&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;), and Elise (voiced by [[Natalie Lander]]). Xander and Leo respectively wield the Legendary Weapons of Nohr: the sword Siegfried and the tome Brynhildr.&lt;ref name="FamCharacters"/&gt; Other characters include the Avatar's mother, Queen Mikoto of Hoshido (voiced by Marisha Ray&lt;ref name="behindthevoiceactors.com"/&gt;); King Garon of Nohr (voiced by [[Travis Willingham]]); Sumeragi (voiced by David Stanbra), the former king of Hoshido and husband of Mikoto; and Anankos (voiced by Travis Willingham in his dragon form and Cam Clarke in human form), the dragon ruler of Valla and blood father of the Avatar.&lt;ref name="IFguide"/&gt;

Several years prior to the start of the game, Hoshido's King Sumeragi is ambushed by Nohr's King Garon during a fake peace treaty talk between the nations and is killed. King Garon kidnaps Sumeragi's young child, the Avatar, and decides to raise them to serve his purposes. Meanwhile, back in Hoshido, without their king, Sumeragi's wife Mikoto becomes the new ruler of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="IFguide"/&gt;

===Plot===
After coming of age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan fortress above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes a battle with the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them at the cost of her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.&lt;ref name="IFguide"/&gt;

In the ''Birthright'' route, the Avatar helps their Hoshidan kin defend their country from invasion by Nohr. After confrontations with the Avatar, Camilla and Leo's lives are spared. With the help of Elise and Shura, the man who kidnapped Azura from Nohr, the Avatar and their company invade the Nohrian capital. Elise is killed when she attempts to stop the Avatar and Xander from fighting, and Xander falls into despair and forces the Avatar to kill him. The Avatar then faces Garon, killing him with the Yato after it is infused with added power from Ryoma and Takumi's Legendary Weapons. However, Azura dies after having overused her singing powers to weaken Garon. In the epilogue, Ryoma is crowned king of Hoshido and Leo is crowned king of Nohr, and peace is forged between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref name="FEFbirthright"/&gt;

In the ''Conquest'' route, the Avatar both fights in the war against Hoshido, and works with their adoptive family to change Nohr's brutal reputation from within. After Azura reveals that King Garon has been replaced by an impostor, the Avatar decides to have Garon sit upon the magical throne of Hoshido, which will remove the false Garon's disguise. During the invasion of Hoshido, the Nohrians spare Hinoka and capture Sakura, while Takumi, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent throughout the war, apparently dies by jumping off of a rampart. Garon orders the Avatar to kill Ryoma. After their fight, Ryoma spares the Avatar the pain of killing their own brother by [[Seppuku|killing himself]]. Infusing the Yato with the power of Xander and Leo's Legendary Weapons, the Avatar confronts and kills the false Garon. However, a crazed Takumi suddenly appears and attacks them, and it is revealed he has been long dead and his body is possessed. The Avatar destroys Takumi's body to free his soul. Azura overuses her powers as in the ''Birthright'' route, but her death is not seen and she is instead marked as missing. In the epilogue, Hinoka is crowned queen of Hoshido and Xander is crowned king of Nohr, and a peaceful alliance between the two kingdoms is formed.&lt;ref name="FEFconquest"/&gt;

In the ''Revelation'' route, the Avatar rejects both Hoshido and Nohr, and is denounced as a traitor by both. They flee with Azura and one of their retainers through the Bottomless Canyon to the kingdom of Valla. Azura explains that the king of Valla, the dragon Anankos, has plans for humanity's destruction; he is the one who killed and replaced Garon, and he is responsible for Takumi's descent into madness in the ''Conquest'' route. Azura also reveals her history as the daughter of the king Anankos usurped, and that a curse placed by Anankos will kill them if they reveal Valla's existence to anyone outside its borders. The two decide to kill Anankos. Fleeing Valla with Gunter, who survived his fall into the chasm, Azura reveals that they must unite the Avatar's twin families before a natural event which will seal the passage for decades. The Avatar travels through Hoshido and Nohr, gradually gaining the trust and allegiance of their hereditary and adopted families. They also learn that their sword Yato is the "Seal of Flames", which when combined with the other families' Legendary Weapons will become the Fire Emblem, capable of killing Ananakos. Once the group enter Valla, the party heads to confront Anankos. During their journey, they battle the resurrected bodies of Mikoto, Azura's mother Arete, and Sumeragi, the latter of whom is revealed to be Mikoto's assassin. During their battle with Mikoto, the Avatar learns that they and Azura are maternal cousins, making the Avatar heir to Valla's throne. The group is eventually betrayed by Gunter, who was possessed by Anankos since first coming to Valla, but the Avatar succeeds in freeing Gunter from Anankos' control. When they face Anankos, they are initially helpless, but Ryoma, Takumi, Xander, and Leo feed the power of their Legendary Weapons into Yato, transforming it into the Fire Emblem. Near death after being defeated, Anankos summons and eats the impostor Garon to regain his strength, but is finally destroyed with the Fire Emblem. In the aftermath, Valla is reestablished on the surface, Azura crowns the Avatar its new ruler, and an everlasting peace is established between the three kingdoms.&lt;ref name="FEFrevelation"/&gt;

Paid additional content was released alongside the games, in the form of extra levels used to improve the units' strength or gather exclusive resources. A series of additional storylines were also released to expand on the main narrative. The first is ''Before Awakening'', in which the Avatar is transported to Ylisse, the setting of ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]'', and aids its heroes Chrom, Frederick, and Lissa in fighting off the forces of Valla. The second, ''Hidden Truths'', centers around ''Awakening'' characters Owain, Inigo, and Severa as they are contacted by a mysterious figure who asks for their help in saving Valla. To this end, they are given new powers and names: Odin, Laslow, and Selena. The trio ultimately join with the kingdom of Nohr as retainers.

The ''Heirs of Fate'' saga, released after the rest of the DLC, focuses around the game's child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into killing each other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, breaks the illusion and bands the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to defeat Anankos one final time.

==Development==
The previous title in the series, ''Fire Emblem Awakening'', was planned to be the last in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. ''Fates'' was co-developed by regular ''Fire Emblem'' developer [[Intelligent Systems]] and [[Nintendo Software Planning &amp; Development|Nintendo SPD]], with the main staff of ''Awakening'' returning to their respective roles for ''Fates'': they were Intelligent Systems's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer [[Yūsuke Kozaki]]. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles X]]''. Masahiro Higuchi, ''Awakening''{{'}}s project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed ''Awakening'' assuming it would be the last in the series.&lt;ref name="IwataInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEifDream"/&gt; During its early design stages, ''Fates'' was given the working title ''Fire Emblem 3DS II''.&lt;ref name="FEFmaking"/&gt; The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic.&lt;ref name="FEFanima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFspooky"/&gt; To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.&lt;ref name="USGinterview"/&gt;

The gameplay was refined and expanded from the version they used in ''Awakening''. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda as an alternative activity for players, and to provide a means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions.&lt;ref name="IwataInterview"/&gt; The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until ''Awakening'' and improved for ''Fates''.&lt;ref name="FamInterview"/&gt; For the first time in the ''Fire Emblem'' series, the option for the main character to [[Same-sex marriage|marry a character of the same sex]] was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in ''Conquest'' and ''Birthright'', and both appear in ''Revelation''. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.&lt;ref name="PolyInterview"/&gt;

The two kingdoms were based upon different cultures: Hoshido was themed after [[Japan]], while Nohr used a Medieval European setting similar to earlier ''Fire Emblem'' games.&lt;ref name="FamInterview"/&gt; The kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr were designed to contrast each other in a variety of ways, with the most obvious being its architecture: Hoshido was themed around light and air, while Nohr was themed around darkness and stone.&lt;ref name="NinTaleBirthright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NinTaleConquest"/&gt; When development first started, the team unanimously decided to ask Kozaki to return as character designer, as he had been for ''Awakening''. The sheer number of characters this approach entailed made the staff worry about whether Kozaki would be willing to return.&lt;ref name="FamInterview"/&gt; The Hoshido characters' clothing were influenced by Japanese culture and character designs drew inspiration from well-known people in Japan: a main instance was Ryoma, whose clothing was based on [[samurai]], including historical figures such as [[Takeda Shingen]], along with incorporating animal motifs such as lions. The colors used in their clothing were varied and mainly bright to emphasize the country's focus on light.&lt;ref name="NinTaleBirthright"/&gt; For Nohr, a "vampire-like taste" equivalent to [[dark fantasy]] was used to highlight it as a kingdom where the sun did not shine. Kozaki used black and purple as key colors in character designs to create a cold and unified image. The nobility of Nohr were given similar design elements to represent their familial connections.&lt;ref name="NinTaleConquest"/&gt; The first character Kozaki designed was the Avatar. Kozaki did not put much thought into their general appearance, but took care about their clothing so that it was not overtly styled after either Hoshido or Nohr, keeping the neutrality of the player up to the main story decision point. They were given bare feet due to the animalistic impression Kozaki had after hearing of their strong ties to dragons, along with creating a "hook" for players equivalent to other characters in the game.&lt;ref name="NinTaleConquest"/&gt; The main key artwork, showing the two families together, was described by Kozaki as "a pain to draw" due to their clashing designs, and was the point of much discussion by staff before it was finalized. Azura was not included in artwork for the two physical editions, but she was more prominently presented in artwork surrounding ''Revelation'' as she played a much larger role in the story.&lt;ref name="NinTaleRevelation"/&gt;

===Scenario===
During the initial planning stage, the team reviewed how fans and critics had responded to ''Awakening''. While the gameplay and graphics were positively received, the story had been criticized for being too simple by some long-time fans, even though new players approved of it. To that end, they decided to write a story that would appeal to series veterans as well as newcomers. The concept of the story changing depending on which protagonists the main character sided with, originated from Yamagami's memories of the [[Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light|first ''Fire Emblem'']], which allowed for choosing different protagonists but did not change the story. Wanting to play from both sides of a conflict and show both sides as neither good nor evil, the team decided to create multiple versions of the game. Initially, the plan was just for a choice between one kingdom or the other, but Yamagami wanted a neutral path where neither side was chosen, so a third version of the game was planned. The game's Japanese title, "''If''", came from the sheer number of choices featured for players in the game. The English title "''Fates''" referred to the concept of the main character shaping and changing their fate by choosing a side.&lt;ref name="IwataInterview"/&gt; After the creation of the three storylines, the team needed to make the decision to divide ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' into separate physical releases. This was because packaging them as a single release would have necessitated raising the game's price to the equivalent of a two-game bundle, which would not benefit people who wanted to play one single version. Another reason for this decision was how easy it had become to add the other versions on as cheaper [[downloadable content]] (DLC). This opened up the option for players to run through the game until the crucial decision point in Chapter 6, then buy the alternate routes as downloadable content so they had different choices. Each route was estimated to have the same amount of gameplay and story content as ''Awakening''.&lt;ref name="4Ginterview"/&gt;

As the plans for three different versions of the game appeared, the staff realized that it was impossible to write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was [[Shin Kibayashi]], who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project by the staff in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight work schedule, but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of ''Awakening'' provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for ''Birthright'' extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for ''Conquest'' and ''Revelation'', driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' were written in [[kanji]], the third storyline's title was written in [[katakana]] to distinguish it from the other two.&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; A great deal of the character traits for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi.&lt;ref name="USGinterview"/&gt; After he had done his work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work.&lt;ref name= "KibayashiTwitter"/&gt; The main scenario writer for the ''Revelation'' storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the ''[[Senran Kagura]]'' series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest''.&lt;ref name="FEFkitajima"/&gt; One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on ''Awakening''.&lt;ref name="FEifDream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFmaking"/&gt;

===Music===
The game's soundtrack was created by multiple composers. Intelligent System's Hiroki Morishita and T's Music's Rei Kondoh previously worked on ''Awakening'', while ''[[WarioWare]]'' composers Takeru Kanazaki and Yasuhisa Baba of Intelligent Systems, and ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' composer Masato Kouda of Design Wave joined the team as newcomers. Longtime series composer [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]] acted as a supervisor.&lt;ref name="FEFmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt; Morishita and Kanazaki wrote the majority of the game's tracks. Arrangements were handled by Morishita, Kanazaki, Kondoh and Kouda. Many of Tsujiyoko's tracks for earlier ''Fire Emblem'' titles were remixed for use in ''Fates''.&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt;

The game's theme song, "Lost in Thoughts All Alone",{{efn|{{nihongo||if～ひとり思う|If~Hitori Omou|lit. "If~ One's Thoughts"&lt;ref name="SongTranslation"/&gt;}}}}&lt;ref name="SongTranslation"/&gt; was written by Morishita, with lyrics by Maeda, and sung by Japanese pop singer [[Renka (singer)|Renka]], who also provided Azura's in-game singing voice.&lt;ref name="FEFmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt; The developers were looking for a singer who could do justice to their vision for the character, and when they heard Renka's audition, they instantly decided that she was right for the role. According to music personnel, several among them cried when they first heard her performance.&lt;ref name="FEFmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFvoiceA"/&gt; Multiple versions were used throughout the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt; Azura's normal voice work is performed by Japanese voice actress Lynn. In the English version, Azura's speaking and singing voice were provided by Rena Strober.&lt;ref name="FEFvoiceB"/&gt; The lyrics were adapted into English by Audrey Drake.&lt;ref name="FEFcredits"/&gt;

An official soundtrack album, ''Fire Emblem if Official Soundtrack'', released on April 27, 2016 through the Symphony No. 5 label of Tablier Communications. The album contains seven discs of music from all three versions of ''Fates'', and a booklet featuring commentary from the composers. Also included is a special DVD containing remixes of tracks from both ''Fates'' and previous ''Fire Emblem'' games, high-definition versions of the three opening cinematics, and cutscenes from ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' featuring alternate versions of a dance sequence with Azura.&lt;ref name="FEFostRelease"/&gt; The soundtrack, having eight disks in total, is one of the largest single game official soundtracks ever released.&lt;ref name="FEFostSize"/&gt; "Lost in Thoughts All Alone", Renka's debut single, was released as a regular CD edition and a special DVD edition featuring a music video on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref name="FEFmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFvoiceA"/&gt; It was also included as part of the main soundtrack release.&lt;ref name="OSTliners"/&gt;

==Release==
''Fates'' was announced for all regions via a Nintendo Direct broadcast in January 2015. It was announced in Japan as ''Fire Emblem if''.&lt;ref name="FEFannounced"/&gt; Its English title was revealed during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015]].&lt;ref name="FEFenglish"/&gt; ''Fates'' was released in multiple versions. ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' both received a physical release on June 25, 2015 in Japan, which was announced for a 2016 release in the west.&lt;ref name="PolyInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "GemVersions"/&gt; Players who purchase a physical copy of either version can download the other version as DLC for a smaller price.&lt;ref name= "GemVersions"/&gt; ''Revelation'' was released exclusively as downloadable content on July 9, two weeks after the physical release of ''Fates''.&lt;ref name="FEFrevJP"/&gt; In addition to the standard releases was a special edition giving access to ''Conquest'', ''Birthright'' and ''Revelation''.&lt;ref name= "GemVersions"/&gt; The western release also follows the release pattern used in Japan. In North America, the physical versions were released first in February, with the third storyline coming later as DLC in March.&lt;ref name="PolyInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SilNinMessage"/&gt; In Europe, the physical editions were released on May 20, with ''Revelation'' following as DLC on June 9.&lt;ref name="FatesEU"/&gt; A special edition, containing all three storylines and an art book, was made available in both regions alongside the initial physical releases.&lt;ref name="FatesEU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFwestRelease"/&gt; In Australia, the physical versions launched on May 21, while ''Revelation'' launched on June 10.&lt;ref name="FEFau"/&gt;

The Japanese release was promoted by a ''Fire Emblem'' themed [[trading card game]] and a ''Awakening'' themed [[manga]].&lt;ref name="FEFtrading"/&gt; Two "starter packs" for the trading cards come with codes that allow players access to the characters Marth and Lucina in the game in the form of DLC. Similarly, the "booster box" will come with a code for the character Minerva.&lt;ref name="FEFmarthDLC"/&gt; The game also supports ''Fire Emblem'' amiibo created for ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'', with the characters associated with the figures appearing in the game as combatants in My Castle. Defeating them enables them to be recruited as characters.&lt;ref name="SilAmiibo"/&gt; A special [[New Nintendo 3DS]] changeable cover based on ''Fates'' was released in Japan alongside the game's physical release.&lt;ref name="FEF3dsTheme"/&gt; After release, a manga based on the game was announced, beginning serialization in the September issue of ''Monthly Young Magazine''. It is written by Kibayashi and illustrated by Kozaki.&lt;ref name="FEFmanga"/&gt; To promote the game internationally, the Avatar of ''Fates'', under the name Corrin, was added as a playable character via downloadable content to ''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U'' in February 2016.&lt;ref name="FEFsmash"/&gt; After release, multiple DLC maps were released between July and September 2015: these ranged from story-related maps to optional maps featuring characters from other ''Fire Emblem'' games.&lt;ref name="FEFdlcJP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFdlcJP2"/&gt; This DLC was released between February and April 2016 in North America.&lt;ref name="FEFdlcWest"/&gt; In Europe, the DLC launched between mid May and late July.&lt;ref name="FatesEuroDLC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FatesEuroDLC2"/&gt;

The game's localization was done by Nintendo's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse.&lt;ref name="NinLocalFan"/&gt; The game underwent alterations for its western release: in the Japanese version, a support conversation between the male avatar and a character named Soleil was criticized for elements some deemed similar to [[gay conversion therapy]]. In the western release, these elements were removed from the characters' support conversations to avoid causing controversy.&lt;ref name="SilNinMessage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFwestChange1"/&gt; Elements of a mini-game exclusive to the My Castle area, involving "petting" a chosen character's face on the lower touch screen to build up affection, was also removed from the western versions. While the 2D interactions and the support increases were present, the stylus-based touch screen element was removed.&lt;ref name="FEFwestChange2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FEFwestChange3"/&gt; The option for Japanese voiceovers, present in ''Awakening'', was also removed from ''Fates''.&lt;ref name="FEFvoice"/&gt; According to an official statement by Nintendo, other unspecified changes were also made where it was deemed necessary.&lt;ref name="SilNinMessage"/&gt; These changes, among others pointed out through comparisons by fans between the English and Japanese versions, generated controversy over the Internet in the wake of the game's release, culminating in complaints being sent directly to Nintendo.&lt;ref name="NinLocalFan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNfates"/&gt; It also prompted a group dubbed "Team If" to start work on a more faithful [[fan translation]], though it was ultimately cancelled shortly after the game's official release.&lt;ref name="NinLocalFan"/&gt;

The different versions of ''Fates'' received high scores on aggregate site [[Metacritic]]. ''Birthright'' scored 86/100 based on sixteen critic reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaBirthright"/&gt; ''Conquest'' received a slightly higher score of 88/100, again based on sixteen reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaConquest"/&gt; ''Revelation'' scored 89/100 based on five reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaRevelation"/&gt; Reviews for all versions of ''Fates'' generated a score of 88/100 based on seventeen reviews.&lt;ref name="MetaAll"/&gt; ''[[Famitsu]]'', which reviewed both physical versions in tandem, praised them for their drama and characters, despite noting that the inter-character relations of the two versions were complicated, and only playing one side of the story might leave players unsatisfied. They praised the various battle functions, relationship mechanics and easy-to-use interface. The "My Castle" feature, while starting out as feeling incomplete, was a satisfying experience.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; Martin Robinson of [[Eurogamer]] praised the game as a sound continuation of the mechanical improvements of ''Awakening'': he positively noted the grey morality of the characters and story, and singled out ''Conquest'' as the "cooler" of the two physical versions due to its challenge and cast. His main criticism was its multi-part release, which he called "needlessly convoluted" and stated might alienate fans attracted to the series by ''Awakening''. He also faulted Nintendo's translation work as less "characterful" than the localization of ''Awakening'' by [[8-4]], along with the "clumsy" removal of the Japanese original's petting mechanic.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;

Chris Carter of [[Destructoid]] called ''Birthright''{{'}}s story "relatively open and shut" despite keeping complex character relationships intact, while generally citing it as the best starting place for series newcomers.&lt;ref name="DesReviewBirthConq"/&gt; Javy Gwaltney of ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the story of ''Birthright'' "a surprisingly dark tale", praised the improvements made to the gameplay over ''Awakening'', and was overall positive despite some criticism of its poor tutorial systems. He also liked the game's music and graphics, although he critiqued the latter a little due to low-res battle models.&lt;ref name="GIreviewBirthright"/&gt; Meghan Sullivan of [[IGN]] called the story, music and visuals "great", and greatly enjoyed the gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow online interface.&lt;ref name="IGNreviewBirthright"/&gt; Alexa Ray Corriea of [[GameSpot]] greatly enjoyed the changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps, and enjoyed the character interactions while noting that the dialogue became overly melodramatic in places.&lt;ref name="GSreviewBirthright"/&gt; Kimberley Keller of Nintendo World Report, reviewing all versions of the game, generally praised the game as a whole while calling ''Birthright'' the "perfect way to start [''Fates'']" due to its traditional ''Fire Emblem'' elements.&lt;ref name="NWRreview"/&gt; Griffin McElroy and Allegra Frank of [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]], reviewing all versions of the game, were generally positive about the gameplay and the interplay between versions, while criticizing the overly complicated character class system. They referred to ''Birthright'' as a "straightforward march for vengeance, where victory almost always entails defeating an entire platoon or its leader".&lt;ref name="PolyReview"/&gt; Both Connor Sheridan of [[GamesRadar]] and Ray Carsillo of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' shared many points of praise with other reviewers about the general gameplay: Sheriden called ''Birthright'' a familiar experience when compared to the other titles, while Carsillo recommended it as a good starting point.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRreview"/&gt;

Carter found ''Conquest'' a much tougher experience from a gameplay perspective, being geared towards dedicated tactical battles within pre-set limits, while finding its story more intriguing than that of ''Birthright''.&lt;ref name="DesReviewBirthConq"/&gt; Gwaltney called ''Conquest'' a "dark fantasy epic" that asked difficult moral questions, and generally cited the gameplay as harder and consequently more rewarding than that of its counterparts despite sharing tutorial deficiencies with ''Birthright''. He also shared his opinions on the music and graphics with ''Birthright''.&lt;ref name="GIreviewConquest"/&gt; Jose Otero, writing for IGN, frequently noted the game's challenge, while generally sharing his praises with Sullivan's review of ''Birthright'', including slow online elements. A point of praise not shared with ''Birthright'' was its mission variety.&lt;ref name="IGNreviewConquest"/&gt; Peter Brown, reviewing the game for GameSpot, praised the gameplay variety and the characters' development and meaningful use in battle, while critiquing the plot for being "fairly middle of the road" and did not like the lack of optional side missions.&lt;ref name="GSreviewConquest"/&gt; Keller noted the harder gameplay structure of ''Conquest'', while noting that its story had a far more comedic tone with its characters.&lt;ref name="NWRreview"/&gt; McElroy and Frank referred to ''Conquest'' as the more challenging of the two physical releases, an opinion shared by Carsillo and Sheridan: the latter added that the game would not make players feel like a hero.&lt;ref name="PolyReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRreview"/&gt; Robinson called ''Conquest'' the "cooler" of the two physical releases, noting its steeper challenge and more engaging cast.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt;

Carter considered ''Revelation'' to be a good middle ground between ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'', and praised its story after moving beyond the conceit of its premise.&lt;ref name="DesReviewRevelation"/&gt; Corriae was highly positive about the game: while finding the initial premise rather contrived, she greatly enjoyed the resultant drama and found the story better than that of ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest''. She also praised the game for its gameplay and variety.&lt;ref name="GSreviewRevelation"/&gt; Keller said the story of ''Revelation'' "keeps players on their toes", while praised the gameplay for finding a middle ground between the two physical releases. She called it "a fulfilling conclusion" to ''Fates''.&lt;ref name="NWRreview"/&gt; While generally positive about the game as a whole, Sheridan was rather critical of the fact that players needed to buy ''Revelation'' as DLC to get the whole story.&lt;ref name="GRreview"/&gt; Gwaltney was less favorable than he was about ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'': while he enjoyed the early tension of a limited party, the ability to expand and strengthen the party sapped away the tension, while he found the story "rather ho-hum and generic" after the more impactful stories of the first two versions.&lt;ref name="GIreviewRevelation"/&gt; Sullivan of IGN greatly enjoyed the combination of characters and gameplay from ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'', but shared her opinion of the central plot device with Corriae.&lt;ref name="IGNreviewRevelation"/&gt; Carsillo found ''Revelation'' the most satisfying due to the obscuring of key plot points in the other versions despite ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' offering greater character insight, along with positively noting its gameplay balance between the two physical releases.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt;

===Sales===
Shortly after pre-orders for the special edition were announced, it sold out within a day. Following complaints from fans, Nintendo created a second run for the edition.&lt;ref name="FEFspecialJP"/&gt; In its week of release, ''Fates'' topped sales charts, with initial sales of both versions totaling 260,675 copies. The game's special edition sold a further 42,991 copies, bringing total sales to 303,666 copies.&lt;ref name="FEFjpRankA"/&gt; ''Birthright'' was the better-selling of the physical versions, with ''Conquest'' coming in second place.&lt;ref name="FEFjpRankB"/&gt; It remained at the top of the charts the following week, selling a further 54,896 copies.&lt;ref name="FEFjpRankC"/&gt; ''Birthright'' remained at the top, while ''Conquest'' dropped to fourth place.&lt;ref name="FEFjpRankD"/&gt; By the third week, both versions of ''Fates'' had dropped to fourth place, selling a further 29,682 copies and bringing total sales to 345,253 copies.&lt;ref name="FEFjpRankE"/&gt; ''Famitsu''{{'}}s sales estimates were slightly higher, with their sales figures for the game totaling 353,201 copies, and going on to sell 71,550 and 41,400 copies over the next two weeks, bringing total recorded sales to 456,274 copies.&lt;ref name="FEFjpRankF"/&gt; In July, Kibayashi reported via [[Twitter]] that ''Fates'' was the current best-selling video game on Amazon Japan.&lt;ref name= "KibayashiTwitter"/&gt; By the end of 2015, according to ''Famitsu'', both physical versions had sold a combined total of 538,669 units, coming in at No. 10 of the year's top-selling video games.&lt;ref name="FEFjpTotal"/&gt;

Prior to its western release, pre-orders for the Special Edition holding all three versions were high, resulting in it selling out by December 2015. After this, a glitch in [[GameStop]]'s ordering system meant that copies of the Special Edition were reserved after stocks were empty, and they gave orders the option of cancelling or transferring their order to a different Special Edition offer.&lt;ref name="FEFwestSpecial"/&gt; On release in North America, the game became the fastest-selling game in the series' history, selling over 300,000 units during its opening weekend: this was estimated as being five times the debut sales of ''Awakening'' during a similar period. ''Birthright'' was the better-selling of the two versions, with ''Conquest'' said to be "close behind".&lt;ref name="FEFusDebutA"/&gt; According to the February [[NPD Group]] report, ''Fates'' sold nearly 400,000 copies across physical and digital versions, with both versions reaching places in the top ten gaming chart. In addition, combined sales of all versions including the Special Edition placed the game third overall in software sales, tripling the equivalent first-month sales of ''Awakening''.&lt;ref name="FEFusDebutB"/&gt; When the physical versions released in the UK, ''Birthright'' was the better-selling edition, coming in at No. 5 in the all-format charts behind multi-platform releases ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Homefront: The Revolution]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]''. ''Conquest'' came in at No. 11 in the all-format charts. In platform-specific charts, ''Birthright'' and ''Conquest'' reached No. 6 and No. 8 respectively.&lt;ref name="UKsales"/&gt; In a financial briefing at the end of the 2015–2016 fiscal year, the physical versions were said to have sold a combined total of 1.84&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref name="FEFtotalA"/&gt; The title's DLC sales were also strong, coming in fifth in the top-five best-selling DLC content for Nintendo products.&lt;ref name="FEFdlcSales"/&gt; As of March 2017, the game's total physical and download sales across all regions have come to 1.6&amp;nbsp;million copies: sales of 500,000 units were recorded for Japan, while the remaining 1.1 million were recorded overseas.&lt;ref name="FEFtotalB"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
Although there is no score for the series, it still features a large collection of music. Much of it represents music that was popular among the American populace in late [[2002 in music|2002]] and early [[2003 in music|2003]]. The newer music (in the show's context) serves to illustrate pop-culture during the time of the invasion. All of the songs are sung [[a cappella]] by cast members, with the exception of Johnny Cash's "The Man Comes Around", and Josh Ray Person's "Re-Up Time".

'''Gina Marie Marks''' (born January 25, 1973) is an American "[[psychic]]" and convicted [[fraudster]].  Using the [[pseudonym]] of '''Regina Milbourne''',{{R|trav550}} she co-authored ''[[Miami Psychic: Confessions of a Confidante]]'', a memoir published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2006.{{R|psych-job}}{{R|Miller1}}{{R|regina-milbourne}}{{R|fred-grimm}}{{R|Prediction}}

In August 2018, Marks' career as a psychic con-artist, and the decade-long pursuit by detective [[Bob Nygaard]] to bring her to justice, were portrayed on an episode of the CBS series ''Pink Collar Crimes'' titled "The Psychic Didn't See Him Coming".{{R|TVGuide}}{{R|Observer}}{{R|MSNPink}}

In 2018 Marks pleaded guilty to [[Fraud|defrauding]] five victims out of more than $340,000, but blamed her prosecution on racism against people she referred to as "[[Romani people|gypsies]]".{{R|Patheos2018}} In September 2018, she was sentenced to six years in prison.{{R|NBCWash2}}{{R|WashPost1}}

==Criminal activity==
Marks has had numerous arrests and convictions in [[Florida]] for defrauding clients out of large sums of money while claiming to use "psychic" powers to help them:
*In 2007, Marks pleaded no contest to grand theft charges related to an agreement to "cleanse souls" for a total of $65,000. She was then put on probation for eighteen months and ordered to return the money back to her clients.  In 2009, she was arrested again for a similar crime.{{R|Prediction}}

*In 2010, she was again arrested in Florida for a defrauding of over $300,000 and for violating probation.{{R|sun_sentinel}} A month later, while still in Broward County Jail, she was arraigned again on further fraud charges which involved another victim who came forward due to media exposure following Marks' earlier arrest.{{R|new-charges}}

*On September 1, 2010, Marks pleaded guilty to grand theft and two counts of organized fraud. In addition she admitted to violating her probation. At her sentencing, Marks handed over a $400,000 check to partially repay her former clients.{{R|chait_investigation}} Marks was paroled in June 2011 from Gadsden Correctional Facility.  She served nine of her eighteen-month sentence and was sentenced to probation for eight years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

*On April 2, 2014, in another case, Marks was sentenced to 10 years of probation.{{R|sentenced-to-10}}{{R|swindle-sentencing}}{{R|Swindling-85}}

*In 2018, Marks was convicted of stealing more than $340,000 from five victims over three years using the pseudonym Natalie Miller. Although she pleaded guilty to psychic fraud charges, Marks blamed her misfortune on racism against "gypsies", saying "They're racist on my culture. We do have power. We’re not allowed to talk about it."{{R|Patheos2018}}

Investigating a psychic fraud case involving Marks in 2008 marked the beginning of South [[Florida]] [[private investigator]] [[Bob Nygaard|Bob Nygaard's]]  "psychic hunting" career. Nygaard also brought Marks to justice in 2010 and 2016, culminating in her 2018 conviction for the theft of over $340,000.{{R|Patheos2018}}{{R|ABC10-1}}{{R|NBCWash1}}{{R|Patheos1}} In September 2018, Marks was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to her victims, with the judge stating that Marks' actions were premeditated and she preyed on vulnerable people.{{R|NBCWash2}}{{R|WashPost1}}

"'''God Save the Queen'''" is a song by the British [[punk rock]] band the [[Sex Pistols]]. It was released as the band's second single and was later included on their only album, ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]''. The song was released during [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] in 1977.  The record's lyrics, as well as the cover, were controversial at the time, and both the [[BBC]] and the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] refused to play the song. The original title for the song was "No Future", with the lyrics themselves being a general expression of the band's view of the [[British Monarchy|Monarchy]] or any individual or establishment commanding general [[obligation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/sex-pistols-break-down-never-mind-the-bollocks-track-by-track-204277/  ''rollingstone.com'' 27 October 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song reached No.1 on the ''[[NME]]'' charts in the [[United Kingdom]], and made it to No. 2 on the official [[Official Charts Company|UK Singles Chart]] as used by the BBC. This led to accusations by some that the charts had been "fixed" to prevent the song from reaching No.1.&lt;ref name="Bragg"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2010060.stm|title= Bragg attacks Pistols' royal views|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|website=[[BBC News Online]]|date=27 May 2002|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The single was released on 27 May 1977, and was regarded by many of the general public as an assault on [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]]. The title is taken directly from "[[God Save the Queen]]", the [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom. At the time it was highly controversial, firstly for its equation of the Queen with a "[[Fascism|fascist]] regime", and secondly for the lyric "there is no future in England's dreaming".  According to [[Glen Matlock]], who had co-written the song—although he was no longer a member of the band by the time it was released—the bass was inspired by [[The Move]]'s "[[Fire Brigade (song)|Fire Brigade]]".

Although many believe it was created because of the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the band have denied it, with [[Paul Cook]] saying that "it wasn't written specifically for the Queen's Jubilee. We weren't aware of it at the time. It wasn't a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lydon |first= John |year= 1995 |title= Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs |publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=I82LM4-CwRkC&amp;pg=PA234 |isbn= 0-312-11883-X |page= 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] has explained the lyrics as follows: "You don't write 'God Save The Queen' because you hate the English race. You write a song like that because you love them, and you're fed up with them being mistreated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= John Lydon |year= 2007 |title= Sex Pistols Vinyl Reissues 2007: God Save The Queen |work= John Lydon.com |url= http://www.johnlydon.com/press/pistols.html |accessdate= 29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to evoke sympathy for the [[English people|English]] [[working class]], and a general [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|resentment towards the monarchy]].

On 7 June 1977—the Jubilee holiday itself—the band attempted to play the song from a boat named the ''Queen Elizabeth'' on the [[River Thames]], near the [[Palace of Westminster]]. After a scuffle involving attendee [[Jah Wobble]] and a cameraman, eleven people, including [[Malcolm McLaren]], the man who organised the concert, and several other members of the band's entourage, were arrested when the boat docked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Allan Jones |year= 2007 |title= The Sex Pistols' Jubilee Boat Trip |work= Uncut.co.uk |url= http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/the-sex-pistols-jubilee-boat-trip-41602 |accessdate= 4 June 2018 |authorlink= Allan Jones (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song peaked at No. 2 (below [[Rod Stewart]]'s "[[I Don't Want to Talk About It]]" released as a [[double A-side]] budget single along with "[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]") on the official [[Official Charts Company|UK Singles Chart]] used by the [[BBC]], though there have been persistent rumours that it was actually the biggest-selling single in the UK at the time, and was kept off No. 1 because it was felt that it might cause offence.&lt;ref name="Bragg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-04-19/god-save-the-queen-the-sex-pistols-take-on-a-charity-track-for-the-jubilee-top-spot/|title=God Save the Queen: The Sex Pistols take on charity track|last=|first=|date=2012-04-19|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-01-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/god-save-queen-40-sex-pistols-made-controversial-song-history/|title=God Save the Queen at 40: how the Sex Pistols made the most controversial song in history|last=Hall|first=James|date=2017-05-27|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sources state that it was indeed the highest-selling single of the week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/03/1022982662884.html|title=Melbourne &amp; punk: 25 years on|last=Donovan|first=Patrick|date=3 June 2002|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/21804|title=When the oppressed express themselves|last=Munckton|first=Stuart|date=2 August 2000|work=[[Green Left Weekly]]|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a ban by the BBC and some major retailers&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt; and, in order to prevent it from reaching the top of the "official" [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1970s|BMRB chart]], for one week compilers "decreed that shops which sold their own records could not have those records represented in the chart", and thus sales from [[Virgin Megastores]] were not counted. &lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-charting-the-number-ones-that-somehow-got-away-1145809.html|title=Music: Charting the number ones that somehow got away|last=Leigh|first=Spencer|date=20 February 1998|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the BBC, the single was also banned by the Independent Broadcasting Authority which regulated [[Independent Local Radio]]. On at least one singles chart for the period, TOP 20 POPS, the song's position at No. 2 was represented by a blank line. In March 2001, the BBC published an article that said "God Save The Queen reached number one in the UK in 1977 despite being banned by the BBC and marked a defining moment in the punk revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1219770.stm|title=Sex Pistols cover tops chart|last=|first=|date=2001-03-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''NME'' magazine chart did in fact place the single at number-one during the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/02/monarchy.jubilee1|title=Is the UK OK?|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|date=2 June 2002|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GOQVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1900,2474983|title=Infectious Rage of Punk|last=Murthi|first=R. S.|date=9 May 1993|work=[[New Straits Times]]|page=17|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "no future", the song's closing refrain, became emblematic of the punk rock movement. The lyric provided the title of [[Jon Savage]]'s 1991 history of the Sex Pistols and punk rock, ''England's Dreaming''.

Before the group signed to Virgin, a small number of copies of "God Save the Queen" had been pressed on the [[A&amp;M Records|A&amp;M]] label. These are now among the most valuable records ever pressed in the UK, with a resale value as of 2006 of between £500 to £13,000 a copy, depending on condition of the disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Ebay auction results 2006 |url= http://www.popsike.com/php/detaildata.php?itemnr=4838165513 |publisher= Popsike.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest recorded sale price of £13,000 was achieved in 2006 by UK collector Marshal Peters who sold a copy of the single complete with its [[A&amp;M Records|A&amp;M]] card envelope, of which only nine copies are known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= There is a future after all...Sex Pistols single sells for $22,154.63 |url= http://www.isleofwrite.com/stories/SexPistols.pdf |publisher= Isleofwrite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-side of the A&amp;M single was "No Feeling", an early rough mix or performance of "No Feelings". (A later version was released on the Pistols' debut album.)  ''[[Record Collector]]'' magazine named the A&amp;M single the most collectable record of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Hamilton |first= Sean |title= Record Collector magazine compiles list of top twenty most valuable vinyl albums |newspaper= [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date= 2011-04-22 |url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3540881/Record-Collector-magazine-compiles-list-of-top-twenty-most-valuable-vinyl-albums.html |accessdate= 2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"God Save the Queen" was featured on the band's only album, ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]'', and several compilation albums.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked "God Save the Queen" number 175 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-sex-pistols-god-save-the-queen-20110526 |title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Sex Pistols, 'God Save the Queen' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is also one of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0150472.html |title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock |work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine's Single of the Year in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Sounds Single of the Year 1977 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/sounds.html#1977 |publisher= Rocklist.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, it was eighteenth in the list of ''NME'' writers' all-time top 150 singles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= NME Writers all time top 150 singles |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_singles.htm#150_1987 |publisher= Rocklist.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in 2002 ranked it first on its list of "The 50 Most Exciting Tunes Ever..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Q 50 Most Exciting Tunes Ever |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#50%20Most%20Exciting |publisher= Rocklist.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and third on its list of "100 Songs That Changed The World" in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 100 Songs That Changed The World |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#100%20Songs%20That%20Changed%20The%20World |publisher= Rocklist.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, ''NME'' launched a campaign to get the song to number 1 in the British charts and encouraged readers to purchase or download the single on 8 October. However, it only made number 42. In 2010, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed it as one of the "Top 20 Political Songs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2010/03/sex-pistols-god-queen |title= Top 20 Political Songs: God Save The Queen |first= Ian K |last= Smith |work= [[New Statesman]] |date= 25 March 2010 |accessdate= 25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the song was ranked amongst the top 10 most controversial songs of all time, in a poll conducted by [[PRS for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Smack my Bitch Up Voted Most Controversial Song |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2010/11/24/smack-my-bitch-up-voted-most-controversial-pop-song-115875-22736076/ |publisher= Mirror UK |date= 24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the song was re-released to coincide with the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]], whereupon the single charted in the top 20. In 2012, it was announced that the single would be re-released on 28 May 2012, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the original release and the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/news/sex-pistols/63259 |title= Sex Pistols announce plans to re-release 'God Save The Queen' |publisher= ''[[New Musical Express]]'' |date= 16 April 2012 |accessdate= 16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: "I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push 'God Save The Queen' for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. This is not my campaign.

The song could be heard during ''Journey along the Thames'', a two-minute film directed by [[Danny Boyle]] and played at the beginning of the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], an event opened by the Queen, and held during her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]]. A camera traverses the route the band took in the boat the ''Queen Elizabeth'', between Tower Bridge and Westminster, as the song plays.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 3 November 2016, [[Andrew Rosindell]], a right-wing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, argued in an [[early day motion]] for a return to the broadcasting of the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem (named "God Save the Queen")]] at the end of [[BBC One]] transmissions each day (The practice was dropped in 1997, ostensibly due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] overnight, rendering [[closedown]] obsolete),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Laura|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/03/tory-mp-calls-for-bbc-1-to-mark-brexit-with-national-anthem-at-t/|title=Tory MP calls for BBC 1 to mark Brexit with national anthem at the end of each day|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to commemorate the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit vote]] and [[Brexit|Britain's subsequent withdrawing]] from the [[European Union]]. At the evening of the same day, [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme ended its nightly broadcast with a statement that it was happy to accede to Rosindell's request, before playing out to a clip of the Sex Pistols' similarly named song, much to Rosindell's discontent.&lt;ref name="metro-gstq-troll"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/04/bbc-just-trolled-a-conservative-mp-brilliantly-with-god-save-the-queen-6234486/ | title = BBC just trolled a conservative MP brilliantly with God Save the Queen | first = Simon | last = Robb | newspaper = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date = 4 November 2016 | accessdate = 4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cover version by the English [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Motörhead]] was released as a single in 2000 to promote their album, ''[[We Are Motörhead]]''.

The cover art gives further reference to the Sex Pistols by using the same cut-out words to form the title as the Sex Pistols' single cover.

A performance of the song recorded during the band's twenty-fifth anniversary concert at [[Brixton Academy]], on 22 October 2000, appears on their [[25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker]] DVD.

===The ''SCTV'' satire===
On the 18 March 1983 episode of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' in the ''Mel's Rock Pile'' segment, Mel Slirrup ([[Eugene Levy]]) has a tribute to punk rock featuring a number by the band The Queenhaters—[[Martin Short]] (lead singer), [[Andrea Martin]] (lead guitarist/back-up vocals), [[Eugene Levy]] (secondary guitarist), [[Joe Flaherty]] (bass), and [[John Candy]] (drummer)—performing "I Hate The Bloody Queen", a sound-alike song that almost matches the original it is spoofing, with references to the [[Falklands War]] ("I'd like to drown the Queen/Off the coast of Argentine/Throw her off a battleship/With her Falkland war machine!") and the problems that [[Princess Diana]] was, and would be soon having with her in-laws ("I feel sorry for you, Lady Di/Having a mother-in-law like that!"). This spoof of The Sex Pistols' "God Save the Queen" even has its own cover version by [[Mudhoney]] on the tribute album ''Oh Canaduh! 2''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2185">'''Gravy''', (born '''Labon Kenneth Blackburn Leeweltine Buckonon Benjamin''' in 1955)&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;http://content-www.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/268597.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a former entertainer, famous throughout the cricket world, for 12 years of voluntary entertaining of the crowd through a variety of antics at the [[Antigua Recreation Ground]] in St John's, Antigua.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

==Performances==
For 12 years from 1988, Gravy entertained the crowd with a variety of costumes and performances in (and sometimes above) the crowd at the stadium: "Gravy is a performer. He cross-dresses and dances and writhes and swings from the rafters and puts on a show that you will not ever forget."&lt;ref name="Cric"&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricinfoat20/content/story/669389.html&lt;/ref&gt;

His act began by chance:  "It started to rain during the presentation ceremony, and the podium was left open. "Something told me, Gravy, this is your time. I went down on the podium, in the rain, and started dancing. Everybody was excited about it. They loved it.""&lt;ref name="Cric"/&gt; He was unpaid for his activities. When he retired in 2000, he did so while wearing a white wedding dress.&lt;ref name="Cric"/&gt; Since retirement, he runs a hardware stall in St John's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/614351.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting incident==
In February 2004, Gravy was shot in the arm. He was driving home at 2am when, in his own words "a car overtook me and rang out four shots at me, and then I felt a burning on my arm". Gravy believes it was a case of mistaken identity, and has stated "I thought they took me for the wrong person. I don't know anybody who could point a finger at me".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/136991.html |title='Gravy' recovers after shooting in Antigua |author=Wisden Cricinfo staff |date=22 February 2004 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |accessdate=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glaspalast München 1883 064.jpg|thumb|An 1883 German illustration of children playing house]]

'''House''', also referred to as "'''playing house'''" or "'''play grown up'''", is a traditional children's game. It's a form of [[make believe]] where players take on the roles of a [[nuclear family]]. Common roles include parents, children, a newborn, and pets.
[[File:Mamy role game by an Iranain kid and a little girl toy.jpg|thumb|Iranian "Mamy" game with a little girl playing the mother and a little doll in the role of her daughter]]

The game often involves props, such as toy food. Additionally, [[doll|dolls]] can play the role family members. Model houses and play kitchens are toys which are often specifically intended for playing house.
The game is played both at home and in [[kindergarten]] or [[day care]].

==In other cultures==
*In [[Persian Language|Persian]], the common term (خاله بازی or مامان بازی) means '''Mother play''' or '''Auntie play''', highlighting that the game is stereotypically played by girls.
*Similarly in [[Russian Language|Russian]], the game is called ''играть в дочки-матери'' (to play daughters-and-mothers).
*In [[German Language| German]], the game is called "Mutter, Vater, Kind" (mother, father, child).
*In [[Chinese language| Chinese]], the game is called "扮家家酒" or "过家家" (playing/living a family).&lt;ref&gt;https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%BF%87%E5%AE%B6%E5%AE%B6/82098&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">In theater, film and television production, an '''intimacy coordinator''' is a staff member who ensures the wellbeing of [[actor]]s who participate in [[sex scene]]s or other intimate scenes.

==Function==
According to Intimacy Directors International, a nonprofit organization founded in 2016 by [[Alicia Rodis]] that advocates for the function, an intimacy coordinator is expected to ensure that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2016|title=Pillars of safe intimacy: Rehearsal and performance practice |url=http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/924101_924a4af5ad7d47aa9d357d70450de14f.pdf |website=Intimacy Directors International |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*all staff and actors are aware of the context of the intimacy as part of the story,
*communication about the intimacy takes place among participants and avenues for reporting harassment are available,
*actors continually consent to all scenes of intimacy,
*all scenes of intimacy are performed according to a previously agreed-to [[choreography]], and
*actors are encouraged to mark the end of a scenes of intimacy with a moment to signal the return to real-life interaction.

The role of intimacy coordinator is not to be confused with that of an "intimacy choreographer", who specializes in the techniques of staging intimate scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collins-Hughes |first1=Laura |title=Need to Fake an Orgasm? There’s an ‘Intimacy Choreographer’ for That |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/theater/need-to-fake-an-orgasm-theres-an-intimacy-choreographer-for-that.html |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Demand for the role grew in the U.S. entertainment industry after the 2017 [[Weinstein scandal]] and the #[[MeToo movement]] highlighted the often routine nature of sexual harassment and misconduct in the industry. Actors such as [[Emily Meade]] began to demand professional safeguards for their wellbeing on set, noting that given the structure of power in a production, actors (particularly young, inexperienced ones) might otherwise not feel able to speak up if directors, staff members or other actors disregarded their consent or previous agreements regarding intimate scenes.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone 24 October 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kerr |first1=Breena |title=How HBO Is Changing Sex Scenes Forever |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/the-deuce-intimacy-coordinator-hbo-sex-scenes-739087/ |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2018, the television network [[HBO]] adopted a policy of using intimacy coordinators for all its series and films with intimate scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinelli |first1=Marissa |title=HBO Will Use “Intimacy Coordinators” for All of Its Sex Scenes |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/hbo-sex-scenes-the-deuce-watchman-intimacy-coordinators.html |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Slate Magazine |date=29 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy coordinators and intimacy workshop teaching best practices for shooting intimate scenes were also beginning to be used in London theaters as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Strick |first1=Katie |title=How an actors' workshop is establishing the rules of intimacy on stage |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/up-close-but-not-too-personal-the-intimacy-workshops-giving-actors-guidelines-for-sex-scenes-a3828901.html |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Evening Standard |date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tinkers' Heart campaign ==
In 2012 [[scheduled monument]] status for the Tinkers' Heart was proposed however the application was declined as [[Historic Scotland]] indicated that it did not meet the criteria for a monument of national importance. In 2014 Smith launched a campaign to have this decision overturned, and in June 2015 the Heart became a scheduled monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29413463|title=MSPs seek action over Tinkers' Heart|date=2014-09-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Resort''' is a proposed entertainment complex in [[Swanscombe]], [[Kent]]. The project was announced on 8 October 2012 and it is estimated to open by around 2023.

== Resort proposal ==
The proposed plan for London Resort included an entertainment street, a water park, a theme park, approximately 5,000 hotel rooms and a monorail service linking the resort to [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International station]].

== Development ==
The site straddles the border of the [[Dartford (borough)|Dartford]] and [[Gravesham]] boroughs and both authorities have pledged their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/reaction-to-2bn-paramount-theme-a59898/ |title=Reaction to £2bn Paramount theme park for Kent |newspaper=Kent Messenger |date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 the first community consultation was held with a short series of exhibitions in the area around the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paramount Park: London Resort Company Holdings to host a series of public exhibitions on plans for the £2bn theme park on Swanscombe Peninsula |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/paramount-park-to-unveil-plans-19496/ |last1=Price |first1=Chris |newspaper=Kent Messenger |date=1 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timetable for delivery, including the planning application process and construction timetable, is geared towards completion and opening in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214560/Paramount-Pictures-open-huge-2bn-theme-park-near-London-rival-Disneyland-Paris-create-27-000-jobs.html |title=Hollywood comes to Kent: Developers unveil plans for £2bn Paramount theme park to rival Disneyland Paris that will create 27,000 jobs |newspaper=Daily Mail |last=Webb |first=Sam |date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A planning application to Dartford Borough Council is expected to be made in 2015.&lt;ref name="Price 2019"&gt;{{cite news |title=Paramount Park developers reveal goal to begin construction in 2016 and open in summer 2019 as public exhibitions on plans open |url=https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/paramount-team-construction-19946/ |date=10 July 2014 |last1=Price |first1=Chris |newspaper=Kent Messenger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project leader is Tony Sefton of London Resort Company Holdings.

In April 2013 newspaper reports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paramount-theme-park-on-hold-after-discovery-of-rare-jumping-spiders-8560373.html |title=Paramount theme park on hold after discovery of rare jumping spiders |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 April 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed development may be delayed by the discovery of a rare species of spider. Mr. Sefton pledged to remove the colony of distinguished jumping spiders ([[Sitticus distinguendus]]) to another suitable site.

The following month, the ''Kent Messenger'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.kentonline.co.uk/gravesend/news/paramount-park-980/ |title=Paramount Park project on Swanscombe Peninsula could be scuppered by new river crossing plan |date=21 May 2013 |last=Sturgess |first=Trevor}}&lt;/ref&gt; that plans for the theme park could be endangered if a new [[Lower Thames Crossing|lower Thames road crossing]] is sited over the Swanscombe Peninsula and quoted Mr. Sefton as saying "It could really scupper plans. We are in the final throes of negotiating a very large investment and this makes it very difficult." However, the proposal was rejected in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Luke |url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/10872560.Option_B_thrown_out_in_Lower_Thames_Crossing_debate/?ref=nt| title=Option B thrown out in Lower Thames Crossing debate |newspaper=Echo News |date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park may spur the development of a new [[Garden city movement|Garden City]] development at nearby [[Ebbsfleet Valley|Ebbsfleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26600689 |title=15,000-home garden city to be built at Ebbsfleet |newspaper=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Price 2019" /&gt;
== Infrastructure and transport ==
The closest station to the proposed site is {{rws|Swanscombe}} served by Southeastern services from [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]] via {{rws|Sidcup}} and {{rws|Dartford}} to {{rws|Gravesend}}. A short distance away, {{rws|Ebbsfleet International}} is a [[High Speed 1]] station. Trains run from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] (17 minutes), [[Gare du Nord|Paris Gare du Nord (North)]], {{rws|Brussels-South}} and in the future, {{rws|Amsterdam Centraal}}; London Resort Company holdings predict the park will add two to three million passengers a year to the HS1 line. A new monorail may take passengers from Ebbsfleet International station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebbsfleetinternational.co.uk/?station=paramount-theme-park|title=London Paramount resort to rival Disneyland park, Paris|last1=International|first1=Ebbsfleet|website=Ebbsfleet International|publisher=Ebbsfleet International|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the New Paramount resort. A further 250,000 people may travel directly to the park from central London by 'water taxis' along the [[River Thames]]; project leader Tony Sefton has said he aims for the park to have the "lowest modal mix" of car park spaces of any similar resort in the world.&lt;ref name="Price 2019" /&gt;

Changes to local infrastructure will be necessary to accommodate millions of additional visitors annually to [[North West Kent]], though it is possible the route of a planned [[Lower Thames Crossing|new Thames road crossing]] may have been in part decided as a result of this development.

[[Crossrail]]'s route may be altered to run as far east as [[Hoo Junction]], just beyond [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], [[Kent]]; there are no firm plans to run trains beyond {{rws|Abbey Wood}} in south east London. It is not known if the plans for Paramount London will create a viable case for Crossrail services to serve the park.  The Hoo Peninsula was also one of the proposed [[London Britannia Airport|Thames Estuary airport sites]], although this was rejected in 2014 in favour of expansion at either [[Heathrow]] or [[Gatwick]] airports. There are also plans to create a road joining the theme park onto the A2 in Kent.

== Environmental concerns ==
The development would be built on 872 acres of mostly [[Salt marsh|saltmarsh]] (and a small amount of [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] land) on the [[Swanscombe]] peninsula, part of the [[Environmentally Sensitive Area]] known as [[North Kent Marshes]], and be twice the size of the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] in East London. The development would lie in the floodplain of the [[River Thames|Inner Thames]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=562500.0&amp;y=174500.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=Northfleet,%20Kent&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off#x=560547&amp;y=175516&amp;lg=1,2,10,&amp;scale=9|title=Environment Agency – Flood map, Northfleet (Kent)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=the Environment Agency (HM Govt.)|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; using up one of the few remaining patches of the floodplain that is wild and undeveloped, and which is also used to accept floodwaters in order to reduce the pressure on the critical flood defences of the river. There is also concern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saveswanscombemarshes.com/about-swanscombe-marshes/|title=About Swanscombe Marshes |website=Save Swanscombe Marshes |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/save-swanscombe-marshes-say-no-to-london-paramount |title=Save Swanscombe Marshes - Say NO to London Paramount |website=38 Degrees  |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/stoplondonparamount |title=Stop London Paramount / Save Swanscombe Marshes|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the marshland in question is home to several species which are endangered in the UK, including; the [https://www.buglife.org.uk/bugs-and-habitats/distinguished-jumping-spider Distinguished Jumping Spider], [[European water vole|Water Vole]], and [[Western marsh harrier|Marsh Harrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/m/marshharrier/ |title=Marsh Harrier |website=rspb.org.uk |publisher=Royal Society for the Protection of Birds |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Paramount withdrew from the project, London Resort Company Holdings insisted the project would continue as planned but without the Paramount brand.

'''Marrying Irving''' is a [[metaphor]] coined by a participant in ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Gene Weingarten]]'s weekly online chat, "Chatological Humor" on February 8, 2005.&lt;ref name=WaPo-MarryingIrving-2005&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weingarten|first1=Gene|title=Chatological Humor* (Updated 2.11.05)|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54186-2005Feb1.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=8 February 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020191307/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54186-2005Feb1.html|archivedate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term specifically references the comic strip [[Cathy (comic strip)|''Cathy'']] by [[Cathy Guisewite]].  On [[Valentine's Day]], February 14, 2004 Irving, Cathy's long-time love-interest proposed marriage.  They were married almost a year later on February 5, 2005; the strip, which had been in print since 1976, ended October 3, 2010.

This term indicates the specific strip or storyline in which a [[cartoonist]] uses a plot tactic or stunt that seems to run completely counter to the long-standing vision for the comic (in the case of ''Cathy'', the strip for most of its existence had centered on the title character's struggles as a single, early-middle-age, slightly overweight woman).  As such, fans and long-time readers may notice a decline in quality for subsequent comics, though this is not always true.  Quality may remain adequate (or on-par with prior work) but the overall vision for the comic may be too drastically altered for it to retain its original attraction.  It is the print [[comic]] and [[webcomic]] version of [[jumping the shark]].

"Marrying Irving" moments in comics may be seen as desperate attempts to retain readers and newspaper distribution by completely breaking with tradition and/or creating a news-worthy event.  They may be seen as "it's about time" events in a comic strip's course where an event, long-time avoided, is finally allowed to occur.

A '''[[microphone]] gaffe''', sometimes referred to as an '''open microphone''' (in [[aviation]], a '''stuck mic''') or a '''hot mic''', is an apparent error whereby a microphone is switched on in proximity of a subject who is unaware that their remarks are being recorded. The error allows unintended listeners to hear parts of private conversations. Errors usually involve live broadcasting in radio or television, and sometimes material is recorded and played back via media outlets. Such events can cause embarrassment for the person or organization involved, sometimes resulting in serious confrontations and employment termination.

*Following the [[1994 State of the Union Address]], Ohio Congressman [[Martin Hoke]] was preparing to be interviewed for a live broadcast for a local [[Cleveland]] television station. After being outfitted with a microphone by a female producer, Hoke remarked to another congressman that "She's got ze beega breasts" in a mock [[Italian language|Italian]] accent.

{{History_of_animation_in_the_United States}}
'''Modern animation of the United States''' from the late 1980s and 1990s onward is sometimes referred to as the "renaissance age of American animation". During this period, many large American entertainment companies reformed and reinvigorated their [[animation]] departments following a general decline during the 1970s and 1980s. The United States has had a profound effect on animation worldwide. Since the late 1990s and the 2000s traditional animation would lose interest against digital and Flash animation, naming this current period as the "millennium age of American animation".

===Disney {{anchor|The Return of Disney}}===
{{main|Disney Renaissance}}

At the start of the 1980s, [[The Walt Disney Company]] had been struggling since [[Walt Disney]]'s death in 1966, and the 1979 departure of [[Don Bluth]] and eleven other associates from the animation department dealt Disney a major blow. Bluth formed a new studio, in direct competition with Disney.

Disney's "[[Nine Old Men]]", the animators responsible for Disney's most famous earlier works, and their associates began to hand their traditions down to a new generation of Disney animators. New faces such as [[Glen Keane]], [[Ron Clements]], [[John Musker]], [[Andreas Deja]], and others came to the studio in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period that produced such features as ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'' (a live-action/animation hybrid), and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'', as well as the featurettes ''[[The Small One]]'' (Bluth's only Disney-directed credit) and ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (the first screen appearance of [[Mickey Mouse]] since 1953).

At the same time, animator [[Steven Lisberger]] brought to the studio a concept about a computer programmer who is launched into a computerized world. The film would mix live action sequences with computer animation, which had not yet been used to such an extent. The studio was impressed with the idea; the result was an ambitious $17 million film (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|17000000|1982|r=-2}}}} in today's dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} entitled ''[[Tron]]''. While Disney's stock dropped four percent after a screening for unenthusiastic investment analysts,&lt;ref name="Potts"&gt;{{Cite news

and in spite of only moderate grosses at the box office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Tron (1982) |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tron.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Tron'' received enthusiastic praise from film critic [[Roger Ebert]],&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = ''Tron'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = January 1, 1982 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/201010350/1023 | accessdate =July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a cult favorite and turned out—many years later—to have a greater influence on animation (at Disney and elsewhere) than expected.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1984, Disney became the target of a [[corporate raid]] by [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]], who intended to break up the company piece by piece. At the same time, [[Roy E. Disney]], who had already resigned as President in 1977, relinquished his spot on the Board of Directors in order to use his clout to change the status quo and improve the company's declining fortune. Disney escaped Steinberg's attempt by paying him [[greenmail]], but in its aftermath CEO [[Ron W. Miller]] resigned, to be replaced by [[Michael Eisner]]. Roy Disney, now back on the Board as its Vice-Chairman, convinced Eisner to let him supervise the animation department, whose future was in doubt after the disappointing box office performance of its big-budget PG-rated feature, ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Cauldron (1985) |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blackcauldron.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio's next release, ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', fared better in relation to its significantly smaller budget, but it was overshadowed by [[Don Bluth]]'s ''[[An American Tail]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 1986 Yearly Box Office Results |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1986&amp;p=.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; another film featuring mice characters that competed directly with ''Mouse Detective'' in theaters.

In [[1988 in film|1988]], the studio collaborated with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Robert Zemeckis]], producing ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', a comedic detective caper that mixed live action and animation while paying homage to the Golden Age of Cartoons. Disney characters appeared with characters from [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and other rival studios for the first time in animation history. The film was a huge box-office success, winning four [[Academy Awards]], reviving interest in animation made for theaters, and popularizing the in-depth study of the history and techniques of animation. Several aging legends in the business, such as [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Friz Freleng]], suddenly found themselves the center of attention, receiving acclaim and accolades after decades of being virtually ignored by audiences and industry professionals alike. Additionally, the release of many older Disney features and short cartoons on home video, and the 1983 launch of the [[Disney Channel]], renewed interest in the studio.

Disney followed up ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and its commercially successful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver &amp; Company (1988) |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=oliverandcompany.htm |work=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1988 fully animated feature ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]'' with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', an adaptation of the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fairy tale with songs by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] composers [[Alan Menken]] and [[Howard Ashman]]. ''Mermaid'' was a huge critical and commercial success, won two [[Academy Awards]] for its song score, and became the first of a series of highly successful new Disney animated features.

The studio invested heavily in new technology, creating the [[Computer Animation Production System]] to be used in tandem with traditional animation techniques. The first film to use this technology, ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', only grossed $27,931,461&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Yearly Box Office Results |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990&amp;p=.htm |work=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|27931461|1990|r=-2}}}} in today's dollars), not even equalling the take of the original 1977 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rescuers (1977) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=rescuers.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the films that followed it, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', won rave reviews, received multiple Oscars, and topped the box office charts. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' would eventually become the first animated feature to win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]] and the first animated feature to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], followed by 2009's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''.

In 1993, Disney released ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', the first feature-length [[stop motion|stop-motion]] animated film. Disney's success peaked in [[1994 in film|1994]], when ''[[The Lion King]]'' grossed $328,541,776 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|328541776|1994|r=-2}}}} in today's dollars). As of 2010, ''The Lion King'' ranked as the 22nd highest grossing motion picture of all time in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Time Domestic Box Office Results |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Disney films such as ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' were box office and critical successes as well, albeit modestly so when compared to Disney's early-1990s releases.

In 1994, the death of Disney President and Chief Operating Officer [[Frank Wells]], and the departure of studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] to co-found [[DreamWorks]], left Michael Eisner in full control of the company. At the turn of the century, films such as ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', and ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'' failed to meet the critical and commercial expectations set by the 1990s phenomena, in spite of exceptions such as ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'' and ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''. At the same time, the high level of popular acclaim bestowed upon ''[[Toy Story]]'', the first film animated entirely using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), sparked an industry trend. Based on the commercial success of [[Pixar]]'s computer-generated animated films and other CGI fare (especially DreamWorks' ''[[Shrek]]'', which contained numerous jabs at Katzenberg's former workplace and boss), Disney came to believe that CGI was what the public wanted—so it ceased producing traditional two-dimensional animation after ''Home on the Range'', and switched exclusively to CGI starting with 2005's ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]''.

Public rifts grew between the animation staff and management, as well as between Michael Eisner and Roy E. Disney. Roy resigned from the board of directors in 2003 with a scathing letter that called the company "rapacious and soulless", adding that he considered it to be "always looking for the quick buck."&lt;ref name="Fonda"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fonda |first=Daren |author2=Sean Gregory |author3=Julie Rawe |author4=Jeffrey Ressner |author5=Chris Taylor |title=Eisner's Wild, Wild Ride |work=Time Magazine |date=December 15, 2003 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1006430-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then launched the internet site SaveDisney.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save Disney |url=http://www.savedisney.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20040131234901/http://www.savedisney.com/ |archivedate=January 31, 2004 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to preserve the integrity of the company and to oust Eisner, who resigned in 2005 after public opinion turned against him.

[[Robert Iger]] succeeded Eisner; one of his first acts as CEO was to regain the rights to Walt Disney's first star [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] from [[NBCUniversal]] (Iger did so by offering NBC the services of [[Al Michaels]], a play-by-play host then under contract to Disney subsidiary [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]], as a trade). After Disney's acquisition of Pixar in 2006, Pixar executive producer [[John Lasseter]] became Chief Creative Officer at both Pixar and Disney, with a plan to reintroduce two-dimensional animation, starting with ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' in 2009.

====Television animation {{See also|Disney Television Animation}} {{Anchor|Television and Direct to Video Sequels}}====
After 30 years of resisting offers to produce television animation, Disney finally relented once Michael Eisner, who had a background in TV, took over. The first TV cartoons to carry the Disney name, CBS' ''[[The Wuzzles]]'' and NBC's ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', both premiered in the fall of 1985. Breaking from standard practice in the medium, the productions enjoyed substantially larger production budgets than average, allowing for higher-quality writing and animation, in anticipation of recouping profitably in rerun syndication. While ''The Wuzzles'' only lasted a season, ''The Gummi Bears'' was a sustained success with a six-season run.

In 1987, the TV animation division adapted [[Carl Barks]]' [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic books for the small screen with the syndicated hit ''[[DuckTales]]''. Its success spawned a 1990 theatrical film entitled ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'' and an increased investment in syndicated cartoons. The result of this investment was ''[[The Disney Afternoon]]'' in 1990, a two-hour syndicated television programming block of such animated shows as ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]'' (1989–91), ''[[TaleSpin]]'' (1990–91), ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' (1991–93, also airing on ABC), ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992–94, also airing on ABC), ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'' (1993–94), and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (1994-96). TV animation also brought some animated feature film characters to Saturday morning, including ''The Little Mermaid'' and ''Aladdin'' both on CBS.

====Direct to video sequels====
[[DisneyToon Studios]] was founded in Paris in the late 1980s to produce ''DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp'', which is not considered by the studio to be part of the Disney animated "canon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Walt Disney Animation Studios: History |publisher=Walt Disney Animation Studios |url=http://www.disneyanimation.com/aboutus/history.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203140624/http://www.disneyanimation.com/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of making non-canon [[direct-to-video]] sequels to canon films began in 1994 with ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', a sequel to ''Aladdin''. This was a reversal of the long-standing studio policy against sequels to animated films (which did not apply to live-action films); Walt Disney has often been quoted on the subject as saying "you can't top pigs with pigs", a reference to how the ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]'' short managed to get more than three sequels.&lt;ref name="Von Busack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Von Busack |first=Richard |title=In Walt's Vaults |work=Metroactive |date=May 24, 2006 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.24.06/disneyland-0621.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of strong video sales, the studio continued to make these films in spite of negative critical reaction; 2002's ''[[Cinderella II: Dreams Come True]]'' received a rare 11% rating from the review-aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinderella II: Dreams Come True |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cinderella_ii_dreams_come_true/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under John Lasseter, the studio has brought this practice to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney To Halt DVD Sequels |work=The Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2007-06-21/ |date=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fritz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritz |first=Ben |author2=Dade Hayes |title=Disney unveils animation slate |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117983709.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |date=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DisneyToon also produced several non-canon entries that ''did'' receive theatrical releases, such as ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' and ''[[The Tigger Movie]]''. The latter brought the [[Sherman Brothers]] back to the studio for their first Disney feature film score since ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' in 1971.

===Don Bluth {{Anchor|Don Bluth: Triumphs, Trials, and Tribulations}}===
{{See also|Sullivan Bluth Studios}}
[[Don Bluth]]'s company had been driven to bankruptcy twice: once, as [[Don Bluth Productions]], after the disappointing box office take of ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' coincided with an animator's strike; and again, as the Bluth Group, after the [[Video game crash of 1983]]—when [[Cinematronics]], in an attempt to cut its losses, charged fees and royalties of over $3 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3000000|1984}}}} adjusted for inflation) to Bluth's company while it was working on a sequel to the laserdisc-based animated arcade videogame ''[[Dragon's Lair]]''.

Bluth formed [[Sullivan Bluth Studios]] with backing from businessman [[Morris Sullivan]], while film director [[Steven Spielberg]]—a long-time animation fan who was interested in producing theatrical animation—helped Bluth to produce 1986's ''[[An American Tail]]''. The film was a hit, grossing $47,483,002 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|47483002|1986}}}} in today's dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An American Tail (1986) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=americantail.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its production, the studio relocated to Ireland, taking advantage of government tax breaks for film production. Bluth's 1988 follow-up ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' was a slightly bigger hit, grossing $48,092,846 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|48092486|1988}}}} in today's dollars)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Land Before Time (1988) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=landbeforetime.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spawning [[The Land Before Time (series)|12 sequels]] and a [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|TV series]]. Neither Bluth nor Spielberg were involved with any of the ''Land Before Time'' sequels; Spielberg produced the 1991 sequel ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'' without Bluth.

In order to gain more creative control, Bluth parted company with Spielberg on his next film, the 1989 release ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]''. While the film had the misfortune of opening the same day as Disney's ''The Little Mermaid'', it fared much better on home video.{{sfn|Lenburg|2006|page=32}}

The early 1990s were difficult for the studio; it released several box office failures. In 1992, ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' was panned by critics and ignored by audiences; its dismal box-office performance of $11,657,385 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|11657385|1992}}}} in today's dollars)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock-a-Doodle (1992) |work=Box Office Mojo |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=rock-a-doodle.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to Sullivan Bluth's bankruptcy. Bluth's next feature, 1994's ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'' fared a little better critically but even worse commercially, while ''[[A Troll in Central Park]]'', also released in 1994, barely got a theatrical release, grossing $71,368 against a budget of $23,000,000 (or ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|71368|1994}}}} against ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|23000000|1994|r=-2}}}} in current terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Troll in Central Park (1994) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=troll_in_central_park.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluth and his partner [[Gary Goldman]] pulled out of 1995's ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' before it was completed due to disagreements with its distributor, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The remaining work needed to complete the film—thirty percent of the total—was finished by a Hungarian studio, and Bluth and Goldman took their names off the film.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Sullivan Bluth Studios closed in 1995. Bluth and Goldman returned to the United States a year earlier to discuss the creation of a feature-animation division at [[20th Century Fox]]; the studio's three previous animated films (''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'', and the live-action/animation combo ''[[The Pagemaster]]'') had all failed. ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'', a musical remake of the [[Anastasia (1956 film)|1956 film]] with [[Ingrid Bergman]], did far better than any Bluth film since ''All Dogs Go To Heaven'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anastasia (1997) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=anastasia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 2000 release of ''[[Titan A.E.]]'', a film far different from the ones Bluth had been making up until then, was a flop. [[Fox Animation Studios]] closed soon afterwards; nearly all [[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox feature animation]] was produced by its [[Blue Sky Studios]] unit until the Fox Animation Studios imprint was revived, without Bluth or Goldman, in 2009.

===Warner Bros. {{anchor|A New Generation of Warner Bros. Cartoons}}===
{{See also|Warner Bros. Animation}}
After parting ways with Bluth, Spielberg turned to television animation, working with the [[Warner Bros.]] Entertainment Co. to bring back its animation department, which it had abandoned in the 1960s. A team of former [[Hanna-Barbera]] employees led by [[Tom Ruegger]] formed a new studio, [[Warner Bros. Animation]], to produce ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]],'' an animated series that paid homage to the Warner Bros. cartoons of [[Termite Terrace]]. The popularity of ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' among young TV viewers made the studio a contender once again in the field of animated cartoons. ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' was followed by ''[[Animaniacs|Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs]]'' and its spinoff ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''. Not only did these cartoons bring in new viewers to Warner Bros., they also captured the attention of older viewers. Warner Bros., minus Spielberg, continued with work such as ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. ''Batman'' quickly received wide acclaim for its animation and mature writing, and it also inspired [[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|a feature film]]. Combined, these four Warner Bros. series won a total of 17 [[Daytime Emmy Awards]].

When Disney's feature animation surged in the 1990s, Warner Bros. tried to capitalize on their rival's success with animated feature films of their own, without the assistance of Spielberg. Their films—''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' and ''[[The Iron Giant]]''—failed to come close to Disney's success, although ''Cats Don't Dance'' and ''The Iron Giant'' both received critical praise and developed cult followings. The 2001 live action/animation hybrid ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', starring [[Bill Murray]], was a costly commercial failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osmosis Jones (2001) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=osmosisjones.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its home video performance proved successful enough for the studio's TV animation department to produce a short-lived spin-off series called ''[[Ozzy and Drix]]''.

The perennially-popular ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters made a comeback. While the older shorts continued to enjoy countless reruns and compilation specials (and a few compilation films), new ''Looney Tunes'' short features were made in the 1990s. Inspired by the success of Disney's ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and a series of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[McDonald's]] commercials teaming the characters with basketball superstar [[Michael Jordan]], the studio produced the live-action/animation combo ''[[Space Jam]]'' in 1996. The film received mixed reviews, but was a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Jam (1996) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another 2003 feature, ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', was a box-office flop, grossing about three-quarter of its $80 million budget worldwide (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|80000000|2003|r=-2}}}} in current terms),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Looney Tunes: Back In Action (2003) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=looneytunesbackinaction.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but received more positive critical reviews. Other modern ''Looney Tunes'' projects were in a different vein. Unlike the original shorts, ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' (1991-1995) and ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' (2001-2006) were aimed primarily at young children, while ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'' (2005-2007) was a controversial revamping of the characters in the distant future. ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995-2000) and ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'' (2003-2005) were very well received shows and were relatively more faithful to the original shorts. ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' (2011-2014) was a modern more adult-oriented sitcom and ''[[Wabbit: A Looney Tunes Production]]'' (2015-) was a modernized series of Bugs Bunny shorts in the ''Looney Tunes'' tradition, but both shows still got a slightly better reception from audiences than ''Baby Looney Tunes'' or ''Loonatics Unleashed''.

===Ralph Bakshi {{Anchor|Bakshi returns}}===
[[Ralph Bakshi]], director of ground-breaking animated films like ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' and the original ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|Lord of the Rings]]'' film, returned to animation after taking a short break in the mid-1980s. In 1985, he teamed up with young [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born-and-raised animator [[John Kricfalusi]] to make a hybrid live-action/animated music video for [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''The Harlem Shuffle'', which was released in early 1986.

The music video put together a production team at Bakshi Animation whose next project was the short-lived TV series ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]''. Bakshi and company worked on several other projects in the late 1980s, but his biggest project, 1992's ''[[Cool World]]'', was a critically panned commercial disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cool World (1992) |work=Box Office Mojo |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=coolworld.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Bakshi announced that he would begin working on another feature film, ''[[Last Days of Coney Island]]'', which he is financing himself and producing independently. Bakshi suspended production on the film in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview

===Outsourcing animation===
The major reason for the increase in the quantity of American animation was the ability to [[outsource]] the actual physical animation work to cheaper animation houses in countries in South and Southeast Asia. Writing, character design, and storyboarding would be done in American offices. Storyboards, model sheets, and color guides would then be mailed overseas. This would sometimes cause troubles as none of the final product would be seen until the completed cels were mailed back to the United States.

While budget became much less of an issue, overseas production houses would be chosen on a per-episode—or even per-scene—basis depending on the amount of money that was available at the moment. This resulted in obviously different levels of quality from episode to episode. This was particularly noticeable in shows like ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', where at times characters would appear wildly off-model, requiring scenes to be redone to the dismay of their directors.

==First-run syndicated animation==
{{Main|Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.#The 1970s and 1980s#Animated series}}

The older Bugs Bunny and Popeye cartoons made way for first-run [[Television syndication|syndicated]] cartoons such as ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'', ''[[Rambo: The Force of Freedom]]'', ''[[ThunderCats]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1986 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[My Little Pony]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Voltron]]'', and reruns of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' and ''[[Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]]'', among many others.

In 1987, [[The Walt Disney Company]] tried its luck at syndication; ''[[DuckTales]]'' went on the air that September and lasted 100 episodes. The success of ''DuckTales'' paved the way for a second series two years later, ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''. The following year, the two shows aired together under the umbrella title ''[[The Disney Afternoon]]''. In 1991, Disney added another hour; the block aired in syndication until 1999.

These cartoons initially competed with the nationally broadcast ones. In the 1980s, national TV only aired [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday mornings]], not competing with the weekday and Sunday blocks of syndication aired by local independent stations but; however, by the 1990s, Fox and then WB started airing weekday afternoon blocks. By the end of the 1990s, both syndicated and national TV ended up losing most of its children's market to the rise of [[Cable television|cable]] TV channels like [[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]] and [[Cartoon Network]] which provided appealing children's entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours.

==The fall of Saturday morning==

===From Hanna-Barbera to Cartoon Network===
{{See also|Hanna-Barbera|Cartoon Network}}
The late 1980s and 1990s saw huge changes in the Saturday-morning landscape. By now, the once-prosperous [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was beleaguered by several factors. First of all, its dominance over the networks' schedules was broken by other studios' shows. Second, when ''[[The Smurfs]]'' was cancelled by NBC in 1990, Hanna-Barbera had no other hits on the air. Finally, its ability to successfully exploit older characters like ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' with new shows was coming to an end; ''Scooby-Doo'' would end a near-continuous 22-year first-run after its most recent [[Younger and junior versions of cartoon characters|juniorized]] version, ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ended its run in 1991. The 1990 theatrical release of ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'' was a success for the fading studio and earned $20 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|20000000|1990|r=-2}}}} in today's dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jetsons: The Movie (1990) |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jetsonsthemovie.htm |work=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, [[American Financial Group|Great American Insurance Company]] owner [[Carl Lindner, Jr.]] became the majority shareholder of Hanna-Barbera's parent company, [[Taft Broadcasting]], renaming it Great American Communications.

Great American wanted out of the entertainment business, and Hanna-Barbera was sold to the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in 1991. Ted Turner had expressed that he mainly wanted ownership of the studio's back catalog; its launch of [[Cartoon Network]] on October 1, 1992 provided a new audience for Hanna-Barbera cartoons, both old and new.

In 1989, producer [[Tom Ruegger]] had led an exodus of Hanna-Barbera staffers to restart [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. At first, the studio was constantly under threat of closure.&lt;ref name="Strike 1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Strike |first=Joe |title=The Fred Seibert Interview, Part 1 |work=Animation World Magazine |date=July 15, 2003 |url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;category2=&amp;article_no=1800&amp;page=3 |page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under [[Fred Seibert]]'s guidance, Hanna-Barbera's new staff (whose ranks included [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Butch Hartman]], and [[Genndy Tartakovsky]]) created a new generation of Hanna-Barbera cartoons in the 1990s such as ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. Alongside these Hanna-Barbera cartoons, shows from other companies also premiered on the channel such as ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy]]'' and ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. These shows were designed to appeal to adults as well as children, and thus incorporated plenty of "adult humor", such as pop-culture references and veiled sexual innuendos.

[[Time Warner]] acquired Turner in 1996, and thus inherited the rights to all of Hanna-Barbera's creative properties. This allowed Cartoon Network to begin airing all of the classic ''Looney Tunes'' shorts as well (previously, Turner had owned only the ''Looney Tunes'' shorts produced before August 1948, which had become part of the MGM/UA library).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Balio|first=Tino|title=United Artists, Volume 2, 1951–1978: The Company That Changed the Film Industry, Volume 2
|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299230139|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoon Network's success with original programming lead them to move the reruns of old Hanna-Barbera and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons to their spin-off channel [[Boomerang (channel)|Boomerang]].

In 1997, Fred Seibert left Hanna-Barbera to found [[Frederator Studios|his own studio]].&lt;ref name = "Strike 2"&gt;{{cite web|last =Strike |first=Joe |title=The Fred Seibert Interview, Part 2 |work=Animation World Magazine |page=1 |date=August 4, 2003 |url= http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=1825}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Hanna-Barbera moved to the same building as Warner Bros. Animation; the use of the Hanna-Barbera name for new productions ended with William Hanna's death in 2001. Hanna and Barbera continued to work as Time Warner employees and consultants until their respective deaths in 2001 and 2006; the name is still used for productions based on properties originally created during the Hanna-Barbera era. [[Cartoon Network Studios]] now handles most original animation for the network.

===Nickelodeon===
In 1991, [[Nickelodeon]] introduced ''[[Ren &amp; Stimpy|The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]''. ''Ren &amp; Stimpy'' was a wild and off-beat series that violated all the restrictions of Saturday morning cartoons, instead favoring the outrageous style of the shorts from the Golden Age period. The series' creator, [[John Kricfalusi]]—a [[Ralph Bakshi]] protege—was largely influenced by the classic works of [[Bob Clampett]]. In spite of the show's popularity, the show was beset with production delays and censorship battles with Nickelodeon, which fired Kricfalusi in 1992. The show continued under the production of the network-owned Games Animation company until 1996, though many animators departed with Kricfalusi. [[Spike (TV network)|TNN]] revived the show in [[Ren &amp; Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"|a more risqué form]] in 2003, with Kricfalusi receiving more creative freedom, but it only lasted ten episodes.

[[Nickelodeon]] also gave birth to hit shows such as ''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'', ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Angry Beavers]]'', ''[[CatDog]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. Many of these shows spawned successful theatrical films as well, most notably ''Rugrats'' (which garnered 3 films), ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' (which has garnered 2 theatrical films and several TV movies) and ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' (which garnered both a [[The Legend of Korra|sequel series]] and a live action film.)

===Other cable networks===
The [[Disney Channel]] switched from pay-cable to basic cable in the late 1990s, and launched a number of successful animated shows such as ''[[The Proud Family]]'' and ''[[Kim Possible]]''. Around the same time, it launched [[Toon Disney]], a channel specifically intended for animation (which has since been replaced by [[Disney XD (United States)|Disney XD]]). Their current most successful series are ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', ''[[Wander Over Yonder]]'', and ''[[Star vs. the Forces of Evil]]''.

On [[Cable television|cable TV]], [[Nickelodeon]], the [[Disney Channel]], and the [[Cartoon Network]] grew to a point where they were competitive with the broadcast networks.

===Broadcast networks===
As the 1990s began, the "Big Three" networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) were no longer a three-way [[oligopoly]]. The fledgling [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] launched their [[Fox Kids]] programming block on weekdays and Saturdays in 1990, while [[Kids' WB|The WB]] joined the competition with a kid's programming block shortly after the network's 1995 launch.

When NBC compared the success of the live-action youth sitcom ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' to the paucity of their animated hits, they gave up on cartoons in 1992, instead concentrating on live-action teenage shows with their Saturday-morning [[Teen NBC|TNBC]] block. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was purchased by Disney in 1996, and Disney transformed ABC's Saturday schedule into a series of Disney-produced animated cartoons collectively named [[One Saturday Morning]]. [[CBS]] was simply never able to come up with any new hits once the shows that anchored its late 1980s/early 1990s Saturday morning lineup—''[[Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', etc.—ran their respective courses. When CBS was purchased by [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]], which also owned Nickelodeon, Viacom simply repurposed much of the [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] lineup—in addition to adding a Saturday edition of the CBS morning-news program ''[[The Early Show]]''.

As a result of years of activism by [[Action for Children's Television]] and others against shows they believed blurred the line between entertainment and advertising, the [[Children's Television Act]] was passed in 1990. It began to be strictly enforced in 1996. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] began requiring three hours a week of educational and informational program intended explicitly for children, at times when children were awake. Since this required three hours to be "off limits" to programs aimed at the general public, the networks naturally chose to air them on Saturday morning, when children were already watching. As a result, almost every Saturday-morning network show is required to contain some educational content. Fox and The WB worked around this problem by airing short one-hour weekday children's blocks instead of morning news shows, but those weekday blocks no longer exist (with the notable exception of PBS, which continues to have large weekday children's programming blocks as of 2010). Nonetheless, there were still a few toy-based children's programs in the 1990s, particularly ''[[Power Rangers]]'' and ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]''.

Cable networks were not subject to these—or most other—FCC requirements, which allowed their series to have more leeway with content than network shows. The impact of the new regulations was almost instantaneous: by 1997, Nickelodeon had rocketed past its broadcast competitors to become the most-watched network on Saturday mornings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NICK RETAINS SATURDAY CROWN|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-75761403.html|work=Broadcasting &amp;Cable|accessdate=October 30, 2013|date=June 18, 2001}} {{subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animation for adults==
{{main|Adult animation}}
The 1990s saw the beginnings of a new wave of animated series targeted primarily to adults and sometime teens, after a lack of such a focus for over a decade.

===''The Simpsons'' and Fox===
In 1987, "[[The Simpsons shorts|The Simpsons]]", an animated short cartoon segment of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', debuted. [[Matt Groening]]'s creation gained its own [[The Simpsons|half-hour series]] in 1989, the first prime-time animated series since ''[[The Flintstones]]''. Although 70 percent of the [[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|first episode's]] animation had to be redone, pushing the series premiere back three months, it became one of the first major hit series for the fledgling [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]. ''The Simpsons'' caused a sensation, entering popular culture and gaining wide acclaim for its satirical handling of American culture, families, society as a whole, and the human condition.

The show has won dozens of awards, including 24 [[Emmy Award]]s, 26 [[Annie Award]]s and a [[Peabody Award]]. ''[[TIME|Time]]'' magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series. A [[The Simpsons Movie|film version]] grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simpsons Movie (2007) |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=simpsons.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2009, Fox renewed ''The Simpsons'' for an additional two years, "...which will secure its place as TV's longest-running prime-time series."&lt;ref name="simpsons-2009-renewal"/&gt; Its 21st season began on September 27, 2009, breaking the 20-season record it once shared with ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.&lt;ref name="simpsons-2009-renewal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox renews 'The Simpsons' |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-02-26-simpsons_N.htm |date=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''The Simpsons'' led Fox to develop other animated series aimed at adults, including ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (created by [[Mike Judge]]), ''[[Futurama]]'' (also by Groening), ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' (all created by [[Seth MacFarlane]]). ''King of the Hill'' was an instant success, running 13 seasons. Both ''Futurama'' and ''Family Guy'' were cancelled by the network; after strong DVD sales and ratings in re-runs, both returned to the air—''Family Guy'' on Fox, and ''Futurama'' on Comedy Central.&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoesMattGroenigClarifiesFuture&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1648183/|title=Groening's Bargain to Yield Four ''Futurama'' Movies|publisher=Reuters|date=January 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spike and Mike===
In 1989, a festival of animation shorts, organized by Craig "Spike" Decker and Mike Gribble (known as "Spike &amp; Mike") and originally based in [[San Diego]], began showcasing a collection of short subject animated films. Known as the ''Classic Festival of Animation'', it played in theatrical and non-theatrical venues across the country.

The collections were largely made up of Oscar-nominated shorts, student work from the [[California Institute of the Arts]], and experimental work funded by the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. Early festivals included work by [[John Lasseter]], [[Nick Park]], [[Mike Judge]], and [[Craig McCracken]]. Judge's piece, ''Frog Baseball'', marked the first appearance of his dimwitted trademark characters [[Beavis and Butt-head]], while McCracken's short ''The Whoopass Girls in A Sticky Situation'' featured the introduction of the trio of little girl superheroes that would later gain popularity under their new moniker ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''.

The festival gradually turned into a program of films called ''[[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]]'', an underground movement for adult humor and subject matter.

===Cartoon Network &amp; Adult Swim===
{{Main|Adult Swim}}
In 1994, the U.S. cable television network [[Cartoon Network]] approved a new series entitled ''[[Space Ghost: Coast to Coast]]''. In a particularly postmodern twist, this show featured live-action celebrity interviews mixed with animation from the original ''[[Space Ghost]]'' cartoon. It was the beginning of the now common practice of using old Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters for new edgier productions, such as the surrealistic ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', based on the short-lived early 1970s environmentally themed cartoon ''[[Sealab 2020]]''. ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' was about a lackluster superhero, Birdman—originally the star of ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]''—who has become a lawyer. His clientele, as well as most of the other characters on the show, are made up entirely of old Hanna-Barbera characters.

[[Adult Swim]], a scheduling block of adult-oriented cartoons appearing on Cartoon Network beginning after primetime, premiered in 2001. Originally limited to Sunday nights, as of 2018, Adult Swim now remains on the air every night until 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern time. Animated series produced exclusively for Adult Swim include ''[[The Brak Show]]'', ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'', ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]'', ''[[Stroker and Hoop]]'', ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Metalocalypse]]''. In addition to western animation, Adult Swim also runs popular [[anime]] series such as ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Eureka Seven]]'', the ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' series, ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', and ''[[InuYasha]]''.

===Other cartoons for adults===
Other TV networks also experimented with adult-oriented animation. [[MTV]] produced several successful animated series especially for its young adult audience, including ''[[Liquid Television]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'', ''[[Æon Flux]]'', ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (and its spin-off ''[[Daria]]''), and ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]''. [[USA Network]]'s ''[[Duckman]]'', starring the voice of [[Jason Alexander]], found a cult following.

Another successful adult-oriented animated series was Comedy Central's ''[[South Park]]'', which saw its beginnings in 1995 with the short cartoon ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]''. Like ''The Simpsons'', ''Beavis and Butt-head'' and ''South Park'' were given the big screen treatment as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'' and ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' both of which met with box office success.

==The rise of computer animation==
The 1990s saw major growth in the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to enhance both animated sequences and live-action special effects, allowing elaborate computer-animated sequences to dominate both. This new form of animation soon dominated [[Hollywood]] [[special effects]]; the films ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' included [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Oscar-winning]] special effects sequences which made extensive use of CGI. After decades of existing as related-but-separate industries, the barrier between "animation" and "special effects" was shattered by the popularization of computerized special effects—to the point where computer enhancement of Hollywood feature films became second-nature and often went unnoticed. The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994) depended heavily on computerized special effects to create the illusion of [[Tom Hanks]] shaking hands with Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and to make [[Gary Sinise]] convincingly appear to be a double amputee, winning a special-effects Oscar. The film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' used computer effects in nearly every scene of its three-hour running time; one of the film's 11 Oscars was for special effects.

While Disney had made the film ''[[Tron]]''—which extensively mixed live action, traditional animation, and CGI—in 1982, and introduced the [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] system to enhance traditional animation in 1990s ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', a completely computer-animated feature film had yet to be made. In 1995, Disney partnered with [[Pixar]] to produce ''[[Toy Story]]'', the first feature film made entirely using CGI. The film's success was so great that other studios looked into producing their own [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] films. Computer-animated films turned out to be wildly popular, and animated films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all film genres in the 2004-2013 timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDuling|first1=John|title=Hollywood Is Giving Up on Comedy|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/07/the-completely-serious-decline-of-the-hollywood-comedy/373914/|accessdate=July 20, 2014|work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|date=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer animation also made inroads into television. The Saturday morning animated series ''[[ReBoot]]'' won a large cult following among adults; it was the first of a number of CGI-generated animated series, including ''[[Beast Wars]]'', ''War Planets'', and ''Roughnecks''. The quality of the computer animation improved considerably with each successive series. Many live-action TV series (especially [[science fiction]] TV series such as ''[[Babylon 5]]'') invested heavily in CGI production, creating a heretofore-unavailable level of special effects for a relatively low price.

===Pixar===
{{See also|Pixar}}
The most popular and successful competitor in the CGI race turned out to be [[Pixar]]. It originated in 1979 when [[George Lucas]]' [[Lucasfilm]] was able to recruit [[Edwin Catmull]] from the [[New York Institute of Technology]] to start the Graphics Group of its special-effects division. In late 1983, Catmull was able to bring in as a freelance independent contractor a Disney animator, [[John Lasseter]], not long after Lasseter (then unbeknownst to Catmull) had been fired by the [[Walt Disney Company]] for his vigorous advocacy of computer animation; Lasseter was hired as a full-time employee about a year later.

Lucas experienced cash flow issues after his 1983 divorce, and in 1986 Pixar was spun off from Lucasfilm as a separate corporation with $10 million in capital from [[Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. At that time, Pixar primarily developed computer animation hardware, but Lasseter helped the company make a name for itself by creating acclaimed CGI short films such as ''[[The Adventures of André and Wally B.]]'' (1984). After the spin-off, he would go on to produce ''[[Tin Toy]]'' (1988), which won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. The company transitioned into TV commercial production and projects such as the [[Computer Animation Production System]] for Disney. After the success of ''Tin Toy'', Pixar made a deal with Disney to produce feature films. The first of these films, 1995's ''[[Toy Story]]'', was a smash hit, which in turn led to additional successful films such as ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. By then, Jobs had become the owner of Pixar by keeping it alive with additional investments over the years; he had often considered selling it but changed his mind after ''Toy Story''.

Pixar's string of critical and box-office successes continued with ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Cars (2006 film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' all receiving rave reviews, earning huge profits, winning awards, and overshadowing Disney's in-house offerings until ''[[Cars 2]]'' in 2011 ended the streak when it proved a critical disappointment, albeit still a commercial success. Disney produced a CGI/live action feature film of its own without Pixar (''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]''), but the film received a mixed reaction, even though it was a financial success. During the later years of Michael Eisner's management, friction between Disney and Pixar grew to a point that Pixar considered finding another partner when they could not reach an agreement over profit sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pixar Dumps Disney |work=Money |publisher=money.cnn.com |date=January 29, 2004 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/29/news/companies/pixar_disney/}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Eisner stepped down in 2005, his replacement, [[Robert Iger]], arranged for Disney to buy Pixar in a $7.4 billion all-stock deal (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|7400000000|2005|r=-2}}}} in today's dollars) that turned Steve Jobs into Disney's largest individual shareholder.&lt;ref name = "Holson"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Holson |first=Laura M. |title=Disney Agrees to Acquire Pixar in a $7.4 Billion Deal |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 25, 2006 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/business/25disney.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was structured so that Disney Animation and Pixar Animation would continue to operate as completely separate studios under the Disney corporate umbrella; Lasseter was placed in charge of greenlighting all new animated films for both studios in his new role as Chief Creative Officer.

===DreamWorks===
{{See also|DreamWorks Animation}}
When [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] left Disney to become a co-partner of Steven Spielberg and [[David Geffen]] in the new studio [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]], the studio naturally became interested in animation. Its first film, ''[[Antz]]'', did not do as well as the Disney-Pixar releases but was a critical success. However, DreamWorks succeeded in its partnership with the British [[stop motion animation]] studio [[Aardman Animations]] with ''[[Chicken Run]]'' in 2000, and later the Oscar-winning ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' in 2006.

Furthermore, DreamWorks finally had their own success in 2001 with the [[computer animated]] feature film ''[[Shrek]]'', a gigantic box-office hit that overpowered Disney's summer release for that year, ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire|Atlantis]]''. ''Shrek'' established DreamWorks as Disney's first major competitor in feature-film animation. DreamWorks' commercial success continued with three ''Shrek'' sequels, ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]'', ''[[Bee Movie]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' and ''[[The Croods]]''. DreamWorks Animation eventually became a separate company from its parent; it is now owned by [[Universal Studios]] through its parent company [[NBCUniversal]]/[[Comcast]] as of 2016.

===Disney Animation===
{{See also|Walt Disney Animation Studios}}
In 2003, noting the growing success of studios that relied on computer animation, executive [[Bob Lambert (executive)|Bob Lambert]]&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Verrier|title= Digital media trailblazer and ex-Disney exec Bob Lambert dies |url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-lambert-20120911,0,7751768.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] Company Town |date=September 11, 2012 |accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced Walt Disney Feature Animation would be converted into a CGI studio.

Two years later, ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', the first computer-animated film from the studio, was released to moderate success in the box office and mixed critical reception. On January 24, 2006, Disney announced that it would be acquiring [[Pixar]] (the deal successfully closed that May),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia|title=Deal Ends Quarrel Over Pixar Sequels|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/26/business/fi-pixarent26|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of the acquisition, executives [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[John Lasseter]] assumed control of Walt Disney Feature Animation as [[President (corporate title)|President]] and [[Chief Creative Officer]], respectively.&lt;ref name=nbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney buying Pixar for $7.4 billion|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11003466/ns/business-us_business/t/disney-buying-pixar-billion/#.US6qMzAQZqA|accessdate=February 28, 2013|newspaper=NBC News|date=January 1, 2006|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasseter later acknowledged that there had been discussions back in 2006 about closing Feature Animation as redundant since Disney now owned Pixar, which he and Catmull flatly rejected ("Not on our watch. We will never allow that to happen."); they resolved to try to save Walt Disney's creative legacy by bringing his animation studio "back up to the creative level it had to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=At Disney, a Celebration That Was a Long Time Coming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/business/media/at-disney-a-celebration-that-was-a-long-time-coming.html|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wloszczyna"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title='Wreck-It Ralph' is a Disney animation game-changer|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/31/wreckitralph-disney-movie-animation/1667373/|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain the separateness of Disney and Pixar (even though they share common ownership and senior management), it was outlined that each studio is to remain solely responsible for its own projects and is not allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bell |first=Chris |title=Pixar's Ed Catmull: interview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/10719241/Pixars-Ed-Catmull-interview.html |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahed"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|title=An Interview with Disney/Pixar President Dr. Ed Catmull |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/an-interview-with-disneypixar-president-dr-ed-catmull/|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=Animation Magazine |date=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the studio released ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', which experienced a poor response at the box office despite the lukewarm critical and audience reception. The following film, 2008's ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since ''Lilo &amp; Stitch'', and became a moderate success. An adaptation of the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s "[[Rapunzel]]" tale entitled ''[[Tangled]]'' was released in 2010, earning $591 million in worldwide box office revenue, and signified a return by the studio to fairytale-based features common in the traditional animation era. This trend was followed in 2013's global blockbuster hit ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', a film inspired by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' tale, which released to widespread acclaim and was the first Disney animated film to earn over $1 billion in worldwide box office revenue&lt;ref name=NYTwin&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=At Disney, a Celebration That Was a Long Time Coming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/business/media/at-disney-a-celebration-that-was-a-long-time-coming.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 5, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|title=Is 'Frozen' a New, Bona Fide Disney Classic?|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/11/frozen-new-bona-fide-disney-classic/71243/|accessdate=December 20, 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic Wire|date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-milestone-frozen-crosses-684847|title=Box Office Milestone: 'Frozen' Crosses $1 Billion Worldwide|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently [[List of highest-grossing animated films|the highest-grossing animated film of all time]], surpassing Pixar's ''Toy Story 3''.

===Independents and others===
Other studios attempted to get into the CGI game. After ending its relationship with Don Bluth, [[20th Century Fox]] released a hugely successful CGI-animated feature in early 2002 entitled ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]''. Also in 2002, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] offered ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', [[The Weinstein Company|TWC]] offered ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' in 2005, and Columbia produced ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'' in 2006. [[Warner Brothers]] had a major success in 2006 with the Oscar winning feature film, ''[[Happy Feet (film)|Happy Feet]]'', while [[Universal Studios]] attempted several times to become a viable participant in the market, finally achieving the goal in 2010 with ''[[Despicable Me]]''. STX Entertainment will offer Uglydolls in 2019.

In spite of all its success, computer animation still relies on cartoon and stylized characters. 2001 saw the first attempt to create a fully animated world using photorealistic human actors in ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', which met with moderate critical success but did not do well at the box office.

In 2004, the live-action film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' was released. It was notable for being filmed entirely in front of a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]], with the background being completely computer generated; only the actors and some props were real. [[Robert Zemeckis]]' film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'', starring [[Tom Hanks]] in five roles, was completely CGI animation, but used [[performance capture]] technology to animate the characters. Zemeckis followed ''The Polar Express'' with two other motion capture films: ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' and [[Disney's A Christmas Carol|Disney's ''A Christmas Carol'']].

The use of CGI special effects in live-action film increased to the point where [[George Lucas]] considered his 2002 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' to be primarily an animated film that used real-life actors. A growing number of family-oriented films began to use entirely computer-generated characters that interacted on the screen with live-action counterparts, such as Jar-Jar Binks in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', [[Gollum]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and the title character of ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]''. While computer generated characters have become acceptable to moviegoers, there have yet to be any fully animated films featuring virtual human actors, or "synthespians".

==Rise of Internet and Flash animation==
{{See also|Flash animation}}
The late 1990s saw the rise of [[Flash animation]]—animated films created using the [[Adobe Flash]] animation software—produced in the U.S. and elsewhere, and distributed through the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name = "Waldron"&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldron |first=Rick |title=The Flash History |work=Flash Magazine |date=November 20, 2000 |url=http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/the_flash_history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Flash animation" refers not only to the file format, but to a certain kind of movement and visual style that is seen in many circles as simplistic or unpolished.{{By whom|date=September 2010}} There are dozens of Flash-animated television series, countless more Flash animated television commercials, and award-winning online shorts in circulation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Some popular Flash animated cartoons include ''[[Joe Cartoons]]'', ''[[Weebl and Bob]]'', ''[[Happy Tree Friends]]'', ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', the ''[[Brackenwood]]'' Series, ''[[Making Fiends (web cartoon)|Making Fiends]]'' and ''[[Salad Fingers]]''.

==The decline of traditional animation==
At the start of the 2000s, traditionally animated feature-films were starting to fall from favor from audiences as a result of the increasing successes of computer animated CG movies. In 2000, [[Fox Animation Studios]] closed down due to the box office failure of ''[[Titan A.E.]]'' which cost between $75 and $90 million, but only earned $38.8 million worldwide. As a result, [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] cut ties with Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and moved animation services to [[Blue Sky Studios]], where they worked on their first feature, ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' in 2002. 

Around 2001, the notable successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and, ''Shrek'', respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' and ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' led to a growing perception that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In 2002, even with the box office success of Disney's ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'', the failure of their much-hyped ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' seemed to ensure that there would be major cutbacks at Disney's animation studio. In March of that year, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, closed down the [[Disney Animation France]] studio in 2003 and then the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida]] in 2004; downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. In 2004, Disney released what it announced to be its last traditionally animated film, ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]''. The film received mixed reviews and was not successful at the box office. After the failure of the film, Disney officially abandoned traditional animation altogether, and moved on to work on computer animated films starting with ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' in 2005.

In 2003, DreamWorks Animation also stopped working on traditional animated features after the domestic failure of ''[[Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas]]'', and the studio moved on to only work on CGI features since then.

However, the release of ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' in 2009, both nominated for an [[Academy Award]], marked a renewed interest in traditional animation. In the same year, ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (also Academy Award nominated) renewed interest in stop motion animation.

However, in 2011, Disney's ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'', while critically acclaimed, was only a moderate success in the box office, and as of now, there are no traditionally animated films planned for Walt Disney Animation Studios for the foreseeable future.

Today, traditionally animated feature films are rare in America, but is still widespread all around the world, from Europe to Japan. In recent years, there are some traditional animated features released later in the 2010s, with ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' in 2015, ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (2017 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]'' in 2017, and ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]'' in 2018, coincidentally all based on animated TV shows.

==Animation accolades==

===Recognition by the Oscars===
Historically, despite the continuation of the Best Animated Short Subject category, animated feature films seldom received much recognition from the [[Academy Awards]] for anything other than musical scores. The unprecedented nomination of Disney's ''Beauty and the Beast'' for Best Picture and five other awards changed things, even though it only won two Oscars for its song score. Animation had become so widely accepted by the beginning of the 21st century that, in 2001, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] introduced a new [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].

The three contenders for first honoree in this award were both CGI feature films: ''[[Shrek]]'', by DreamWorks, ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', by Disney and Pixar, and ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', by Nickelodeon and Paramount. The award that year went to ''Shrek''. Films that year which were passed up included the acclaimed adult oriented film ''[[Waking Life]]'' and the photorealistic CGI film ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''.

[[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s critically acclaimed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' won the Oscar in 2002. Disney/Pixar's ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' received the 2003 award, defeating nominees ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' and ''Brother Bear''. Since then, Pixar has won the most awards in this category with the current exceptions being ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' in 2005, ''[[Happy Feet]]'' in 2006, ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]'' in 2011, ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' in 2013, ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' in 2014, and ''[[Zootopia]]'' in 2016.

In 2013, the March 7 issue of [[The Hollywood Reporter]] magazine published the ballots of eight different Oscar voters in the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feinberg|first1=Scott |title=Oscar Voter Reveals Brutally Honest Ballot|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscar-voter-reveals-brutally-honest-682957 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those eight, four voters abstained in the Best Animated Feature category due to inadequate knowledge of the subject. They admitted to not having seen all of the nominations, one person stating “that ended when I was 6.” Such disregard for animated films is often criticized by American animators, who claim that “Hollywood doesn’t care or know the first thing about animated films.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Definitive Proof That Academy Voters Are Ignorant About Animation|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/definitive-proof-that-academy-voters-are-ignorant-about-animation-96680.html|website=Cartoon Brew|publisher=Cartoon Brew, LLC|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Murderers' Row''''' (sometimes incorrectly punctuated ''Murderer's Row'') is a 1966 American comedy [[spy-fi (neologism)|spy-fi]] film starring [[Dean Martin]] as [[Matt Helm]]. It is the [[Matt Helm#Films|second of four films]] in the Matt Helm series, and is very loosely based upon the [[spy fiction|spy novel]] ''[[Murderers' Row (novel)|Murderers' Row]]'' by [[Donald Hamilton]], which was published in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matthelmbooks.com/murder.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann-Margret]] and [[Karl Malden]] co-star in this sequel to ''[[The Silencers (film)|The Silencers]]''.

==Plot==
The film begins with a shot of the [[United States Capitol]] being destroyed. It is actually a scale model being used in the demonstration of a heliobeam&lt;ref&gt;[http://heliobeam.com/ Heliobeaming&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129062144/http://www.heliobeam.com/ |date=2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; weapon in the headquarters of the Bureau of International Government and Order ("BIG O"). BIG O is a secret organization with the goal of [[world domination]] that previously appeared in ''[[The Silencers (film)|The Silencers]]''.

With the aid of a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], BIG O conducts a worldwide assassination campaign against various secret agents working for ICE (Intelligence Counter Espionage). Matt Helm fakes his own death in preparation for investigating the scheme undetected.

Helm meets his boss, Mac, for a mission briefing. Helm is to track down the missing Dr. Solaris, who has developed the powerful heliobeam weapon, a device that uses the concentrated power of sunlight for mass destruction. Helm is told if he can not rescue Solaris he is to kill him, and if captured to kill himself, lest BIG O [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] him.

Posing as a Chicago [[gangster]] named Jim Peters, an alias of "Lash" Petroni, Helm travels to the [[French Riviera]] to follow his only lead, Solaris's daughter, Suzie. Concerned about her father's disappearance, Suzie helps Matt infiltrate the island lair of the diabolical Julian Wall, blow it up, and thereby save Washington, D.C. from being destroyed.

==Production==
The film was the second of four produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]]'s former partner [[Irving Allen]] and Martin's Meadway-Claude Production company for [[Columbia Pictures]] in the mid-1960s starring Martin as [[secret agent]] Matt Helm. [[Euan Lloyd]], a former [[Warwick Films]] publicity specialist and producer of ''[[The Poppy Is Also a Flower]]'', assisted Allen in production chores.

Like its predecessor ''[[The Silencers (film)|The Silencers]]'', it took a much more light-hearted approach to the source material, treating it more as a gadget-laden [[parody|spoof]] of [[James Bond]] films than Hamilton's original serious spy story. Unlike Hamilton's world weary professional, Martin plays Helm with his own [[persona]], a fun-loving, wise-cracking alcoholic playboy.

Co-starring is [[Karl Malden]] as Dr. Julian Wall, whom ''[[New York Times]]'' [[film critic]] [[Bosley Crowther]] describes as a "Kansas type [[Julius No|Dr. No]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F07E7D8123CE43BBC4A51DFB467838D679EDE&lt;/ref&gt; Malden had the idea that his character speaking in a different accent every time he spoke would be amusing.&lt;ref&gt;Malden, Karl. ''When Do I Start?'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the film are Tom Reese as his [[Oddjob]]-type henchman named "Ironhead" and [[Beverly Adams]] returns as [[secretary]] Lovey Kravezit, as do the Slaygirls, a group of beautiful and dangerous women. Columbia [[actor|starlet]] [[Camilla Sparv]] plays Malden's assistant Coco Duquette and [[Soon Tek-Oh]] makes a brief appearance as a Japanese agent killed in his bath.

The first script was by Oscar Saul, who had written ''The Silencers''. [[Herbert Baker (screenwriter)|Herbert Baker]], who had received a screen credit after he wrote the final version of ''The Silencers'' script, was brought in to rewrite Saul's first draft of ''Murderers' Row'' and received sole credit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1779q0j5&amp;doc.view=entire_text&amp;brand=oac Finding Aid for the Herbert Baker Papers, 1939-1978&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Baker had written several [[Martin and Lewis]] screenplays and was a writer for ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''.

Filming began 18 July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;'Row' Role for Ann-Margret
Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 04 July 1966: d15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was originally intended to be shot totally on location, but Martin, who also co-produced the film, refused to go to Europe.  [[Second unit]] teams shot sequences in [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]], [[Monte Carlo]] and the [[Isle of Wight]] for the [[hovercraft]] and helicopter &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmfriends.org.uk/brisganfhbig.htm&lt;/ref&gt; sequences instead.  The then new [[Saunders-Roe]] [[SR.N6]] [[hovercraft]] appearing in the film's sea sequences (with the land chase through the streets of [[Monte Carlo]] and scenes with Martin using a [[mock up]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 333 Weaver, Tom ''Tom Reese Interview'' ''A Sci-fi Swarm and Horror Horde: Interviews with 62 Filmmakers'' McFarland 2010&lt;/ref&gt;) was provided by Hoverwork Hovercraft as their first assignment&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartiesworld.co.uk/hovercraft/cushioncraft.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201138.html&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Cushioncraft]] CC5 appearing as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartiesworld.co.uk/hovercraft/cushioncraft.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Levin (film director)|Henry Levin]] had previously directed the [[Dino DeLaurentiis]] [[superspy]] film ''[[Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die]]'' for Columbia. He would also direct the following Matt Helm film, ''The Ambushers''. The [[Film title design|titles]] are again by [[Wayne Fitzgerald]], and [[James Curtis Havens]] continued in the series as [[second unit director]].

Like its predecessor, the film is full of jokes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060728/quotes Murderers' Row (1966) - Memorable quotes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; bizarre secret weapons like a Hy Hunter Bolomauser modified [[AR-7]] pistol configuration that only fires ten seconds after the trigger is pulled, plenty of beautiful women, and fashionable [[mod (subculture)|mod]] 1966 costumes by [[Moss Mabry]]. Karl Malden's character uses a [[Gyrojet]] spearfiring pistol and a [[volley gun]] type pistol.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadly Zip Gun for the Missile Age'' ''Life'' Magazine  27 May 1966 - Page 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deathwind.com/gw7.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Helm kills a guard with a dart fired out of a cigarette; a weapon also used in ''You Only Live Twice''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=QM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=black+belt+gyrojet+cigarette&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G8ng-zmkE1&amp;sig=386CHc2HmPr58aatQ_pt2zkxaGI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_2WBTdyuDMvJcYHm9KQD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's Helm drove a 1966 [[Ford Thunderbird]] [[Landau (automobile)|landau]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle.php?id=289005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://automotivemileposts.com/movietvbirdssixties.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Released only ten months after ''The Silencers'', ''Murderers' Row'' was the eleventh highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;p.41 Lisanti, Tom; Paul, Louis; O'Neill, Eileen ''Film Fatales: Women in Espionage Films and Television 1962-1973'' 2002 McFarland&lt;/ref&gt; The film received 1967 second place [[Producers Guild of America|Laurel]] Awards for Best Action Drama and Best Action Performance for Martin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060728/awards Murderers' Row (1966) - Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Murderers' Row'' was followed by ''[[The Ambushers (film)|The Ambushers]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' (1969). A fifth film, ''The Ravagers'' with [[Sharon Tate]] reprising her ''Wrecking Crew'' character and Dean Martin doing a dual role, was announced but never produced. Martin refused to make ''The Ravagers'' so Columbia reportedly held up Martin's share of the profits on ''Murderers' Row''.&lt;ref&gt;Tosches, Nick ''Dino Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams'' 1999 Delta&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s Helm spoofs (as well as the two Derek Flint movies with James Coburn, the first of which came out the same year as the first Helm feature) seemed to become the template of the 1970s Bond films and in some cases Helm film [[setpiece]]s were copied by the later Bonds. In ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', [[SPECTRE]] threatens the world with a heliobeam device from an orbiting [[satellite]].  The electromagnetic demise of Ironhead in the film happens to the giant "Jaws" villain in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', the hovercraft chase on sea and land reoccurs with a gadget-filled [[gondola]] in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' with that film's evil mastermind [[Hugo Drax]] making jokes similar to Julian Wall.

== Soundtrack ==
{{Main|Murderer's Row (soundtrack)}}
The [[film score]] is by  [[Lalo Schifrin]], replacing [[Elmer Bernstein]].  In addition to the driving main theme and spy time score, Schifrin includes some jazz pieces, with one having a [[cover version]] by [[Bud Shank]], as well as a song with lyrics by [[Howard Greenfield]] ("I'm Not the Marrying Kind") for Martin that, due to contractual rights, didn't appear on the [[soundtrack album]].  It did, however, appear on Martin's LP, ''Happiness is Dean Martin''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpdiscography.com/m/Martind/martin_happiness.htm LP Discography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930075207/http://www.lpdiscography.com/m/Martind/martin_happiness.htm |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billy Strange]] slightly changed Schifrin's main title to be an "original" composition entitled "Spanish Spy" on his ''James Bond Double Feature'' album.

The pop group [[Dino, Desi &amp; Billy]] (which featured Martin's son, [[Dean Paul Martin]], who calls Helm "Dad" in the film) makes an appearance and sings the [[Boyce &amp; Hart]] song, "If You're Thinkin' What I'm Thinkin'".

{{About|imagination|the album by Washed Out|Paracosm (album)}}

A '''paracosm''' is a detailed [[imaginary world]]. Paracosms are thought generally to originate in childhood and to have one or numerous creators. The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood.&lt;ref name="petrella"&gt;Kristin Petrella, "[http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1440&amp;context=honors_capstone A Crucial Juncture: The Paracosmic Approach to the Private Worlds of Lewis Carroll and the Brontës]". In ''Surface'', Syracuse University Honors Program, Spring 2009-05-01. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origin and usage ==
The concept was first described by a researcher for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], Robert Silvey, with later research by British psychiatrist Stephen A. MacKeith and British [[psychologist]] David Cohen. The term "paracosm" was coined by Ben Vincent, a participant in Silvey's 1976 study and a self-professed paracosmist.&lt;ref&gt;The Paracosm: a special form of fantasy, in Morrison, D.C. (Ed.), ''Organizing Early Experience: Imagination and cognition in Childhood''. New York: Baywood, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen and Stephen MacKeith, ''The Development of Imagination: The Private Worlds of Childhood'' (Concepts in Developmental Psychology). Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alexander"&gt;Christine Alexander, "Playing the author: children's creative writing, paracosms and the construction of family magazines." In Kate Darian-Smith, Carla Pascoe (eds.), ''Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage''. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrists Delmont Morrison and Shirley Morrison mention paracosms and "paracosmic fantasy" in their book ''Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection'', in the context of people who have suffered the death of a loved one or some other tragedy in childhood. For such people, paracosms function as a way of processing and understanding their early loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Delmont C. and Shirley L., ''Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection: Unsuccessful Childhood Grieving and Adult Creativity''. Baywood, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89503-309-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite [[James M. Barrie]], [[Isak Dinesen]] and [[Emily Brontë]] as examples of people who created paracosms after the deaths of family members.

Marjorie Taylor is another child development psychologist who explores paracosms as part of a study on [[imaginary friend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Marjorie, ''Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them ''. Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-514629-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Adam Gopnik]]'s essay, "Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli", he consults his sister, a child psychologist, about his three-year-old daughter's imaginary friend. He is introduced to Taylor's ideas and told that children invent paracosms as a way of orienting themselves in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Adam, "Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli: A Theory of Busyness, and Its Hero". In ''The Best American Magazine Writing 2003'', ed. by the American Society of Magazine Editors (Harper Perennial, 2003), p. 251. Originally appeared in the ''New Yorker'' September 30, 2002, and also found in Gopnik's collection of autobiographical essays, ''Through the Children's Gate: A Home in New York'' (Vintage Canada, 2007). {{ISBN|1-4000-7575-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, creativity scholar Michele Root-Bernstein discusses her daughter's invention of an imaginary world, one that lasted for over a decade, in the 2014 book, ''Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity''.&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, Michele, ''Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity Across the Arts and Sciences''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1-4758-0979-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paracosms are also mentioned in articles about types of childhood creativity and problem-solving. Some scholars believe paracosm play indicates high intelligence. A Michigan State University study undertaken by Root-Bernstein revealed that many [[MacArthur Fellows Program]] recipients had paracosms as children, thus engaging in what she calls worldplay. Sampled MacArthur Fellows were twice as likely to have engaged in childhood worldplay as MSU undergraduates. They were also significantly more likely than MSU students to recognize aspects of worldplay in their adult professional work.&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, M. &amp; Root-Bernstein, R. 2006. Imaginary Worldplay in Childhood and Maturity and Its Impact on Adult Creativity, ''Creativity Research Journal'', 18(4): 405-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, paracosm play is recognized as one of the indicators of a high level of creativity, which educators now realize is as important as intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Po Bronson and Ashley Merrin, [http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/10/the-creativity-crisis.html The Creativity Crisis]. In ''Newsweek'', 2010-07-10, page found 2010-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the ''International Handbook on Giftedness'', Root-Bernstein writes about paracosm play in childhood as an indicator of considerable creative potential, which may "supplement objective measures of intellectual giftedness ... as well as subjective measures of superior technical talent."&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, Michele, "Imaginary Worldplay as an Indicator of Creative Giftedness". In the ''International Handbook on Giftedness'', ed. by Larissa Shavinina. Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a chapter on paracosm play in the 2013 textbook ''Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage'', written by Christine Alexander. She sees it, along with independent writing, as attempts by children to create [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] for themselves.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;

Paracosms are one of the subjects of interest to the emerging field of literary [[juvenilia]], studying the childhood writings of well-known and lesser-known authors. Joetta Harty in her essay "Imagining the Nation, Imagining an Empire: A Tour of Nineteenth-Century British Paracosms" contextualizes the paracosms of 19th-century British children, including the [[Brontë family]], [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s Gombroon and [[Hartley Coleridge]]'s Ejuxria, with then-current events. Nike Sulway in "'A Date with Barbara': Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett" explores adult reaction to [[Child prodigy|children perceived as prodigies or geniuses]], focusing on how their biographies often focus on their imaginations and paracosmic creations rather than on their daily lives, citing as an example adult reactions to child author [[Barbara Newhall Follett]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nike Sulway, "'A Date with Barbara: Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett." In Dallas John Baker, Donna Lee Brien and Nike Sulway, eds., ''Recovering History through Fact and Fiction: Forgotten Lives''. Cambridge Scholars, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;In ''Home and Away: The Place of the Child Writer'', ed. by David Owen and Lesley Peterson. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of paracosms include:

* [[Middle-earth]], the highly detailed fantasy world created by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as expressed in his novels ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', as well as a sizable body of writings published posthumously containing fictional histories, languages and other reference material. Tolkien had been  [[Conlang|inventing languages]] since his teen years, only later imagining the people who spoke them or their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically referred to as a paracosm by Joseph P. Laycock in ''Dangerous Games:  What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds'' (Univ. of California Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter, ''Tolkien: A Biography.'' Houghton-Mifflin, June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}
* [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]], Angria, and Gaaldine, the fantasy kingdoms created and written about in childhood by Emily, Anne, and Charlotte [[Brontë]], and their brother Branwell, and maintained well into adulthood.

'''Radio Okapi''' is a [[radio network]] that operates in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].  On an annual budget of USD$4.5 million, a staff of 200 provide news and information to the entire urban population of the DRC. Radio Okapi provides programming in French and in the four national languages of Congo: [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Kituba language|Kituba]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]]  and [[Luba-Kasai language|Tshiluba]],

==History==
Radio Okapi was created by the [[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo]] (MONUC) and the [[Swiss]] [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Fondation Hirondelle. The agreement between MONUC and the Congolese government foresaw the creation of a radio network to inform the Congolese population of the MONUC's efforts. MONUC and the Fondation Hirondelle submitted a plan in 2001 to the [[United Nations]], and the radio network went live on 25 February 2002.&lt;ref name="Quisommes"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station takes its name from the endangered [[Okapi]], the majestic yet shy and elusive mammal native to the Ituri rainforest in the Congo.

In 2011 ''[[The Economist]]'' said that Radio Okapi was "one of Africa’s most admirably independent radio services".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/node/21540303 Congo’s election: That sinking feeling: A general election in the Democratic Republic of Congo may end in tears]", [[The Economist]], dated 26 Nov 2011. Retrieved on 15 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Myers, in the essay "Well-Informed Journalists Make Well-Informed Citizens: Coverage of Governance Issues in the Democratic Republic of Congo," said that the radio station "raised the bar for other indigenous radio and TV stations in the country."&lt;ref name="Odugbemi155"&gt;Myers, Mary.

Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 15 February 2012. 0821385569, 9780821385562.&lt;/ref&gt; Other area radio stations copied Radio Okapi's news gathering techniques, program concepts, and formats. Myers also said "Although Radio Okapi can be a thorn in the government's side at times, its stance of promoting peace and democracy and the strong role it plays in civic education have led to its recognition, even by the Minister of Information, as a national asset that the Democratic Republic of Congo{{sic}} could ill afford to lose."&lt;ref name="Odugbemi155"/&gt;

Serge Maheshe a journalist for Radio Okapi was shot on June 13, 2007. Maheshe was the editor in chief in Bukavu for the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2007/serge-maheshe.php|title=Serge Maheshe - Journalists Killed - Committee to Protect Journalists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
La création de Radio Okapi coïncide avec le début à [[Sun City (Afrique du Sud)|Sun City]] en [[Afrique du Sud]], du dialogue inter-congolais, qui a conduit aux accords de paix et à la transition vers la démocratie. L'objectif de Radio Okapi est de donner accès à une information vérifiée dans le contexte d'un pays divisé par la guerre des grands lacs.

Rapidement, Radio Okapi qui se définit comme la «fréquence de la paix», s’est imposée au premier plan des organes d’information en RDC.  Le studio principal de [[Kinshasa]] a été complété de huit stations régionales décentralisées, une vingtaine d’émetteurs couvrent une grande partie du territoire national. Les émissions sont diffusées dans les principales langues du Congo.  La diffusion des programmes sur Internet lui permet de toucher également les communautés congolaises de l’étranger.

Par son professionnalisme et son indépendance, le nouveau média s’est imposé comme le plus écouté du pays.

Bien que la vocation première de Radio Okapi soit d’apporter à ses auditeurs une information impartiale, et rigoureuse sur les réalités du pays et le processus de transition, en favorisant le dialogue entre les Congolais  ses émissions traitent également de la vie quotidienne, sans oublier la culture et les loisirs.

Radio Okapi joua un rôle important pendant les élections présidentielle et législatives de 2006 donnant accès équitablement aux différents candidats et partis politiques, garantissant ainsi un accès plural à l'information.

==Plot==
Shiva ([[Mahesh Babu]]), an officer in the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau office]], spies on people's calls and messages to help them if needed. He developed a software to listen to the needing ones by tracking their phones. On the night of 16 March, he listens to Charlie/Shalini ([[Rakul Preet Singh]]) talking about her wish on getting 98% in her exams from 96% to get a USA scholarship with her friend. In order to do that, she decides to get concentration by sleeping with a guy. Shiva follows her, and she starts to fall in love, but he does not.

On the night of 28 April, he listens in on a young girl asking her friend for help as she is alone in her house and scared because there is no electricity in her house whilst everyone else on her street has it. Shiva sends his friend, new police constable Renuka ([[Himaja]]), to help the girl. However the next day, a news channel declares that the two women had been killed. They were undressed, chopped into different pieces, and were mixed together. Shiva goes to the crime scene and finds it has been a brutal murder. He resigned from his job stating, "I didn't help them and I should've never sent out Renuka," but his father ([[Jayaprakash]]) encourages him to find the murderer. To find out who murdered them, he sets out to 'spy' the girl's chats and whereabouts.

He finds that a guy followed her at a cafe. Through technology, he finds someone who knows the guy. He then travels to the village where the guy grew up, through the person who knew the guy. From an elderly villager, he learns the past about the guy, Bhairavudu/Sudalai ([[S. J. Surya]]). He suffers from [[sadistic personality disorder]] and has an unusual desire to kill people and see the victims' family grieving. One day, a village kid sees him killing a person and tells the other villagers. They decide to burn Bhairavudu/Sudalai's house, which his parents died from. Angry, he left the village to continue his killing spree with his younger brother ([[Bharath (actor)|Bharath]]). Shiva manages to catch him, but instead he reveals to be his brother. Bhairavudu/Sudalai reveals he killed 23 people and hid their bodies in 23 pillars of a bridge and threatens the citizens to leave his brother unscathed. He also reveals that he plans to destroy a hospital. Shiva kills Bharaivadu’s/Sudalai’s brother in front of the 40 people's families, including an angry Bhairavudu/Sudalai.

Bhairavudu/Sudalai plans to kill Shiva's family. Shiva finds out when his mother ([[Dheepa Ramanujam]]) calls him and tells him she is scared because there is no current in their house whilst everyone else on the street does, exactly the same as what the girl had said earlier. Shiva manages to save his family. Bhairavudu/Sudalai tries to kill Shiva on his way home, and Shiva gets impaled on a truck. He slowly recovers and gets back on getting Bhairavadu/Sudalai. Because Shiva had shot him before he fell unconscious, he thinks Bhairavudu/Sudalai has hidden himself in a house where he can heal, but he has imprisoned the owners. Shiva finds Bhairavudu/Sudalai and arrests him, but Bhairavudu/Sudalai tells him that he had already planned a big rock fall in the city. Shiva manages to stop the big rock. Meanwhile, Bhairavudu/Sudalai escapes from police and continues with his plan on destroying a hospital. Charlie/Shalini finds out which hospital but refuses to tell Shiva. Shiva tracks down her taxi, and she tells him which hospital it is, and he rushes there and starts evacuating everyone. He saved as many as he could but could not save some patients, which he feels heartbroken over. Shiva finally kills Bhairavudu/Sudalai and tells the media, "We have only killed the patient but not the disease. Helping people you don’t know is the greatest happiness in the world. We shouldn’t use technology all the time because we don’t have time to spend with others." He also tells them that there are other people who may have the same exact disease. The movie ends with Shiva walking with Charlie/Shalini out of the crowd.

{{Theosophy}}

'''St. Germain''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Master Rakoczi''' or '''Master R''') is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] and post-Theosophical teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]] and identified with the '''[[Count of St. Germain]]''' (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a [[courtier]], [[adventurer]], [[charlatan]], inventor, [[Alchemy|alchemist]], pianist, violinist and amateur composer.

==Legend==
Some write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin ''[[Sanctus Germanus]]'', meaning "Holy Brother".&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 – 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 – 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, pages 312 – 322&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the ''Master R'', or the ''Master Rakóczi'', is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.

==Literature about St. Germain==

===Biographies===
There are several "authoritative" biographers who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are [[Isabel Cooper-Oakley]]'s ''The Count of St. Germain'' (1912) and [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy'' (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book ''The Great Secret – St. Germain'' is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life including his conflation with Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and the author of the [[Shakespeare]]an opus. [[Manly Palmer Hall]] in his ''[[Manly Palmer Hall#Works|The Secret Teachings of All Ages]]'', describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.

There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ''Der Wiedergänger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain'' by [[Peter Krassa]], ''Le Comte de Saint-Germain'' by [[Marie-Raymonde Delorme]] and ''L'énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain'' by [[Pierre Ceria]] and [[François Ethuin]].

===Occult biography===
A book titled ''The Great Secret, Count St. Germain'', by Dr. Raymond Bernard purports that St. Germain was actually [[Francis Bacon]] by birth, and later [[Baconian theory|authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare]]. He also contends, as does the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] in Schaumburg, Illinois, that [[Francis Bacon]] was the child of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Lord Dudley]] but that it was kept quiet. According to the theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family. Yet, throughout the [[Shakespeare]]an canon, there are numerous hints that the author knows of his true birth, as revealed in the explicit clues in the text of the plays themselves, in pictures, as well as the [[Bacon's cipher|cipher code that he employed]].

===Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain===
Saint Germain is the central figure in the Saint Germain Series of Books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, ''Unveiled Mysteries'' and ''The Magic Presence'', written by [[Guy Ballard]] as "Godfré Ray King" describe Saint Germain as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]], like [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, he discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and some other works referenced above. The third volume, ''The 'I AM' Discourses'', contains material that is foundational to the [[sacred scripture]]s of the "I AM" Religious Activity, founded in 1930, the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.

There are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the "Green Books." Another work of great importance, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, ''a.k.a.'' the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the "I AM" Religious Activity.

===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===
Several [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: 
* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.
* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, "the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears "a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guy Ballard]], founder of the [["I AM" Activity]], claimed that he met Saint Germain on [[Mount Shasta]] in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his "training" and experiences with other [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edgar Cayce]], the "Sleeping Prophet", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: "When needed." (From reading # 254–83 on 2/14/1935.)
* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.
* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.
* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice 23.5.2014.
*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973 St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California, USA. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meeting with him as well as other Masters.
*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on June 10, 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book: Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age .&lt;ref&gt;"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY" (Meru Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric activities===
Many groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.

The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. (See [[Hall, Manly P.|Manly Palmer Hall]]'s ''Secret Teachings of All Ages.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' "An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on "St. Germain"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the "Chohan of the Seventh Ray"&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80–90 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called "The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is "The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]."  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the "Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]".

In the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rakóczi'' or the ''Master R.''&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three – Division A – Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  (In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi [ otherwise known as the Great Divine Director ] is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters.) Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that "sometime after AD 2025," the Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would "externalise"&lt;!--British spelling of externalize--&gt;, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530&lt;/ref&gt; Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the "manager of the executive council of the Christ"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508&lt;/ref&gt;(Theosophists regard "the Master Jesus" and "Christ" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which "Christ" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]]). According to certain Theosophists, "Christ" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the "executive council of the Christ" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.

===Previous incarnations===
According to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as: (see notes 1, 2, and 3 for sources): (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)

* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called "The City of the Sun"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].
* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].
* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.
* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).
* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427–347 BC).
* [[St. Joseph|Saint Joseph]], 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.
* [[Saint Alban]], late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr – he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.
* [[Proclus]], c. 410 – 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.
* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.
* [[Roger Bacon]], c. 1220–1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named "[[Christian Rosenkreuz]]" was inspired by his efforts.
* [[Christopher Columbus]], 1451–1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in America in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain
* [[Francis Bacon]], 1561–1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].

===Ascension into masterhood===
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and he even attended his own "funeral" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rakóczi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth [ the sixth level of Initiation]) at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name "Saint Germain."&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biologographical sketch of history of Saint Germain, pages 80–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

'''''The Narrative Corpse''''' is a [[chain novel|chain story]], or [[comic jam]], by 69 all-star cartoonists based on ''Le Cadavre Exquis'' (see [[Exquisite corpse]]), a popular game played by [[André Breton]] and his [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] friends to break free from the constraints of rational thought.

Edited by [[Art Spiegelman]] and [[Robert Sikoryak]], ''The Narrative Corpse'' features contributions from some of the most notable cartoonists of its time from the worlds of [[underground comix]], [[alternative comics]], and [[European comics]] (as well as [[Will Eisner]] and [[Mort Walker]]).

The ''Narrative Corpse'' [[graphic novel]], co-published by Gates of Heck and [[Raw (magazine)|Raw Books]], had a limited run in 1995 of 9,500 copies. It was the winner of the 1996 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Best Graphic Novel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Firecracker+Alternative+Book+Award "Book awards: Firecracker Alternative Book Award,"] Library Thing. Accessed Jan. 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story structure ==
The creative process was designed as follows: a cartoonist would begin the story with three black-and-white comic-book panels, starring an innocent [[stick figure]] named "Sticky." This cartoonist passes his or her three panels on to the next cartoonist, who continues the story in any manner he or she wants with three more panels. The next cartoonist receives only the previous cartoonists's part of the story, and so on.

Although the "story" oscillates without beginning or end, it can be said to start (after some creative editing by Spiegelman and Sikoryak) with the panels done by [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], and end with the ones done by [[Richard McGuire]]:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Some contributors featured [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] by their own well-established characters (for example [[Mort Walker]]'s [[Beetle Bailey|Sarge]], [[S. Clay Wilson]]'s [[the Checkered Demon]], [[Will Eisner]]'s [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]], [[Matt Groening]]'s [[Akbar &amp; Jeff]], and [[Bill Griffith]]'s [[Zippy the Pinhead]]). It is also of interest that background or guest characters seldom last more than three contributions in a row.

== Publication history ==
The idea was first conceived of in May 1990, as a project for ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'' magazine. To expedite the project, two strands were started simultaneously, one in [[New York City]] by project co-editor [[R. Sikoryak]], the second in [[London]] by [[Savage Pencil]]. Nevertheless, the project kept growing (outliving ''RAW'' itself, which ceased publication in 1991) until it was forcibly brought to an end five years after its inception.

In order to bridge the two strands, R. Sikoryak's original opening panels were cut, although he later drew the oddly-shaped "splash panel" that now begins the narrative. Spiegelman himself drew the three panels that link Strand 1 to Strand 2 (bridging the contributions of [[Joe Sacco]] and [[Savage Pencil]]),&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Brian. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236763033_Art_and_Evolution_Spiegelman's_The_Narrative_Corpse "Art and Evolution: Spiegelman's The Narrative Corpse,"] ''Philosophy and Literature'' 32(1):31-57 (April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard McGuire]] was brought in to link Strand 2 back to Strand 1 (bridging the contributions of Carol Swain and [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]]).&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, ''The Narrative Corpse'' (Raw Books/Gates of Heck, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Chaundler''' (1418–1490) was an [[England|English]] [[playwright]] and [[illustrator]].

A manuscript at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], depicts Chaundler presenting one of his plays to the [[Bishop of Bath]], [[Thomas Beckynton]], in 1460.

==Life==
He was born about 1418 in the parish of [[Church of St Cuthbert, Wells|St. Cuthbert's, Wells]].
At the end of May 1430, he was admitted scholar of [[Winchester College]], and on 1 May 1435 he was elected scholar of [[New College, Oxford]].
He became fellow on 1 May 1437, graduated B.A. and M.A., and in 1444 served the office of proctor.
He was admitted B.D. on 8 February 1449-50, and on 18 November following was elected warden of Winchester College.
On 9 March 1450 – 1451 he supplicated for the degree of B. Can. L., and on 15 July 1452 he was collated by his friend and fellow Wykehamist, [[Thomas Beckington]], to the chancellorship of Wells Cathedral.
On 22 February 1453 – 1454, Chaundler was elected [[List of Wardens of New College, Oxford|Warden]] of New College ; on 22 October following he supplicated for the degree of B.C.L., but 'vacat' is noted on the margin of the register, and on 3 March 1454-5, as warden of New College, he graduated D.D.
On 6 July 1457, on the resignation of [[George Neville (bishop)|George Neville]], Chaundler was elected [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]] of Oxford University; he held the office until 15 May 1461, when Neville was again appointed, and from 1463 to 1467 Chaundler acted as [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]].{{sfn|Pollard|1901}}

Outside the university, Chaundler held many ecclesiastical preferments.
He was rector of [[Hardwick, Buckinghamshire|Hardwick]], [[Buckinghamshire]], parson of [[Meonstoke]], [[Hampshire]], and [[prebendary]] of Bole in [[York Cathedral]] in 1466.
On 25 February 1466-7, he was admitted chancellor of York, and in the same month he was granted a canonry and prebend in St. Stephen's, Westminster.
Soon afterwards he became chaplain to [[Edward IV]], and on 18 December 1467 was granted the rectory of [[All Hallows, London]].
He resigned this living in 1470, and on 15 August 1471 was collated to the prebend of Cadington Major in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].
He gave up this prebend in 1472, and on 4 June was re-elected chancellor of Oxford University, George Neville having sided against Edward IV during Warwick's revolt.
Chaundler held the chancellorship until 1479, serving during the same period on the commission of the peace for Oxford ; he resigned the wardenship of New College in 1475.
On 27 January 1475-6, he was collated to the prebend of Wildland in St. Paul's Cathedral, and in the following month he exchanged the prebend of Cadington Major for that of South Muskham in Southwell Church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1225">'''Transferable utility''' is a concept in [[Cooperative game|cooperative]] [[game theory]] and in [[economics]]. [[Utility]] is ''transferable'' if one player can losslessly transfer part of its utility to another player. Such transfers are possible if the players have a common [[currency]] that is valued equally by all. Note that being able to transfer [[cash]] [[Payoff matrix|payoffs]] does not imply that utility is transferable: wealthy and poor players may derive a different utility from the same amount of money.

Transferable utility is assumed in many [[cooperative game]]s, where the [[Payoff matrix|payoffs]] are not given for individual players, but only for coalitions. In this case the assumption implies that irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff, members of the coalition enjoy the same total [[utility]].

==Plot==
Thomas is a writer-director of a new play, an adaptation of the 1870 novel ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' by Austrian author [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. Alone in a Parisian theatre after a day of auditioning actresses for the lead character, Wanda von Dunayev, Thomas laments on the phone of the poor performances to come through. As he is preparing to leave the theatre, an actress named Vanda arrives disheveled. In a whirlwind of energy and unrestrained aggression, Vanda persuades the director to let her read for the part. To Thomas's amazement, Vanda shows great understanding of the character and knows every line by heart. As the audition progresses, the intensity is redoubled and the attraction of Thomas turns into obsession.

==Cast==
* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Vanda Jourdain
* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Thomas Novacheck

==Production==
In September 2012, it was announced that [[Roman Polanski]] would direct an adaptation of [[David Ives]]' 2010 play entitled ''[[Venus in Fur]]''. At that time, [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] and [[Louis Garrel]] were attached in the lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|title=Roman Polanski To Helm Screen Version Of ''Venus In Fur''|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/09/roman-polanski-to-helm-screen-version-of-venus-in-fur/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=18 November 2013|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While filming was scheduled to begin in November 2012, production was delayed until January 2013 and Garrel was replaced by [[Mathieu Amalric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Mathieu Amalric Replaces Louis Garrel In Roman Polanski's 'Venus In Fur'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/mathieu-amalric-replaces-louis-garrel-in-roman-polanskis-venus-is-fur-20130117|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[SnagFilms]]|accessdate=18 November 2013|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Sundance Selects/[[IFC Films]] acquired the U.S. rights to the film following its premiere at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2013/film/news/roman-polanskis-venus-in-fur-gets-u-s-distribution-1200492639 "Roman Polanski's ''Venus in Fur'' Gets U.S. Distribution"], ''Variety'', Accessed online, 30 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Working from a French translation of the play (which was widely acclaimed when it ran on and off Broadway a few years ago), Mr. Polanski has marked the text with his own fingerprints. One of the two characters—the splendidly volatile Vanda, an actress—is played by Emmanuelle Seigner, his wife. Her foil—a writer and theater director named Thomas—is played by Mathieu Amalric in a performance that is very close to a Polanski impersonation."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=A.

''[[PopMatters]]'' magazine wrote, "''Venus in Fur'' is fascinating to the point that (subtitles or not), you simply cannot look away from the screen. There is always something to see, hear and feel."&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title='Venus in Fur' Blurs the Lines Between Character, Actor, and Director|author=Maçek III, J.C.|date=1 December 2014|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/188442-venus-in-fur/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ZeroGravity''' is a [[stunt team]] based in southern [[California]]. They were founded in 1998 by Tony Chu and Kerry Wong. Their first performance was in the Specialties Act division of the 1998 Pinnacle Fantasy Productions Talent Spokesmodel Showcase and continued to perform martial arts stage shows for several years. ZeroGravity is also known for their independent martial arts films and being the motion capture actors for ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' and ''[[Devil May Cry 3]]''.

==History==
ZeroGravity began by performing martial arts stage shows at various cultural festivals, talent showcases, and import car shows. In 2000, they branched into the [[Independent film|indie]] film genre by making short martial arts, action films. At this point, their focus began to shift more from stage shows to their film projects. Other early projects included stunt work in an indie martial arts film starring [[Ho Sung Pak]] titled ''Epoch of the Lotus''. In 2001, Kerry Wong moved to Los Angeles and founded a new division of the stunt group named ZeroGravity South. At that time The original group was renamed ZeroGravity North. Shortly after, Kerry Wong established relationships with ACT, an action stunt training group in Los Angeles. Through this new relationship Reuben Langdon and other members of ACT joined ZeroGravity South. After the release of Title Pending 2 and Damn 3, the group began devoting their efforts to breaking into the film business as stunt performers. Several members have also done motion capture for some well known video games, like ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' and ''[[Devil May Cry 3]]''. Some members even provided voice overs for characters in Devil May Cry 3, with Reuben Langdon returning as the voice of Dante in ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]''.  In addition, Langdon was featured in the tokusatsu ''[[B-Fighter Kabuto]]'', as well as stunt work for ''[[Power Rangers]]''.  Lateef Crowder was also a villain in the 2005 [[Tony Jaa]] film, [[Tom-Yum-Goong (film)|Tom-Yum -Goong]]. Other works include small bit parts (mostly martial arts or fighting oriented) in the TV series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' and ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''. Reuben Langdon and Aaron Toney are planned to be villains in the American TV series [[Kamen Rider Dragon Knight]].  The team was also featured on [[Animal Planet]]'s [[Most Extreme]].

==Independent films==
Their first film, ''Title Pending'', featured no dialogue or sound effects but instead played music, much like silents films from the early 20th century. The films run from 10 to 20 minutes in length and had many lengthy fight sequences. They were distributed largely over the internet where they gained popularity. Other early films included a series called ''Damn'', ''Kid Gusto vs The Matrix'', and ''US vs HK''. After producing their earlier films, the group began to release films less frequently but increased the production level by using higher-quality cameras, adding more dialogue and incorporating more plot elements than before.

==Members==
ZeroGravity has had numerous members join since its inception. Some members joined for single projects and left shortly afterwards. Members also sometimes participate in other projects and collaborations with other stunt groups. With a large influx of members interested in their film projects, ZeroGravity began a screening process which consisted of a 3-hour test of stunt work, acrobatics, and [[stage combat|fight choreography]]. This screening process is no longer in use.
