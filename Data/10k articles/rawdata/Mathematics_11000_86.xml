      <comment>/* Quadratic algorithm */ presented algorithm was wrong (or rather, it was right, by virtue of two wrongs making a right). If the values provided in the array are distinct then b == S[start + 1] will never be true, so it's pointless (although the algorithm still works because end is decremented, and then on the next run of the while loop, start is therefore incremented). If this is considering distinct values then it will miss cases with pairs of duplicate values (e.g. [ -5, 2, 2, 3, 3] ).</comment>

{{unsolved|computer science|Is there an algorithm to solve the 3SUM problem in time  &lt;math&gt;O(n^{2-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;?}}
In [[computational complexity theory]], the '''3SUM''' problem asks if a given set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real numbers contains three elements that sum to zero.  A generalized version, ''k''-SUM, asks the same question on ''k'' numbers. 3SUM can be easily solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time, and matching &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^{\lceil k/2 \rceil})&lt;/math&gt; lower bounds are known in some specialized [[models of computation]] {{harv|Erickson|1999}}.

It was widely conjectured that any deterministic algorithm for the 3SUM requires &lt;math&gt; \Omega(n^2) &lt;/math&gt; time.
In 2014, the original 3SUM conjecture was refuted by Allan Grønlund and Seth Pettie who gave a deterministic algorithm that solves 3SUM in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 / ({\log n} / {\log \log n})^{2/3})&lt;/math&gt; time .{{sfn|Grønlund|Pettie|2014}}
Additionally, Grønlund and Pettie showed that the 4-[[Decision tree model#Linear decision tree|linear decision tree]] complexity of 3SUM is &lt;math&gt; O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}) &lt;/math&gt;.
These bounds were subsequently improved;
the current best known algorithm for 3SUM runs in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 / ({\log n} / {\log \log n}))&lt;/math&gt; time, {{sfn|Freund|2017}}{{sfn|Gold|Sharir|2017}} and the randomized 4-[[Decision tree model#Linear decision tree|linear decision tree]] complexity of 3SUM is &lt;math&gt;O(n^{3/2})&lt;/math&gt; .{{sfn|Gold|Sharir|2017}}
It is still conjectured that 3SUM is unsolvable in &lt;math&gt;O(n^{2-\Omega(1)})&lt;/math&gt; expected time.&lt;ref name=kpp14/&gt;

When the elements are integers in the range &lt;math&gt;[-N, \dots, N]&lt;/math&gt;, 3SUM can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n + N\log N)&lt;/math&gt; time by representing the input set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Bit array|bit vector]], computing the set &lt;math&gt;S+S&lt;/math&gt; of all pairwise sums as a [[Convolution#Discrete convolution|discrete convolution]] using the [[Fast Fourier transform]], and finally comparing this set to &lt;math&gt;-S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms|edition=3}} Ex. 30.1–7, p.&amp;nbsp;906.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quadratic algorithm==

Suppose the input array is &lt;math&gt;S[0..n-1]&lt;/math&gt;.  In integer ([[word RAM]]) models of computing, 3SUM can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time on average by inserting each number &lt;math&gt;S[i]&lt;/math&gt; into a [[hash table]], and then for each index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, checking whether the hash table contains the integer &lt;math&gt;-(S[i]+S[j])&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to solve the problem in the same time in a [[Comparison (computer programming)|comparison]]-based model of computing or [[real RAM]], for which hashing is not allowed. The algorithm below first sorts the input array and then tests all possible pairs in a careful order that avoids the need to [[binary search]] for the pairs in the sorted list, achieving worst-case &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time, as follows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ti.inf.ethz.ch/ew/courses/CG09/materials/v12.pdf Visibility Graphs and 3-Sum] by Michael Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt;
  sort(S);
  '''for''' i=0 '''to''' n-2 '''do'''
     a = S[i];
     start = i+1;
     end = n-1;
     '''while''' (start &lt; end) '''do'''
        b = S[start]
        c = S[end];
        '''if''' (a+b+c == 0) '''then'''
           '''output''' a, b, c;
           // Continue search for all triplet combinations summing to zero.
           // We need to update both end and start together since the array values are distinct.
           start = start + 1;
           end = end - 1;
        '''else''' '''if''' (a+b+c &gt; 0) '''then'''
           end = end - 1;
        '''else'''
           start = start + 1;
     '''end'''
  '''end'''

The following example shows this algorithm's execution on a small sorted array. Current values of '''a''' are shown in green, values of '''b''' and '''c''' are shown in blue.
  &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-25&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;-10&lt;/span&gt; -7 -3 2 4 8 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;  (a+b+c==-25)
  &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-25&lt;/span&gt; -10 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;-7&lt;/span&gt; -3 2 4 8 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;  (a+b+c==-22)
  . . .
  &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-25&lt;/span&gt; -10 -7 -3 2 4 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;  (a+b+c==-7)
  -25 &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;-7&lt;/span&gt; -3 2 4 8 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;  (a+b+c==-7)
  -25 &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-10&lt;/span&gt; -7 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;-3&lt;/span&gt; 2 4 8 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;  (a+b+c==-3)
  -25 &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-10&lt;/span&gt; -7 -3 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; 4 8 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;  (a+b+c==2)
  -25 &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;-10&lt;/span&gt; -7 -3 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; 4 &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; 10  (a+b+c==0)

The correctness of the algorithm can be seen as follows. Suppose we have a solution a + b + c = 0. Since the pointers only move in one direction, we can run the algorithm until the leftmost pointer points to a. Run the algorithm until either one of the remaining pointers points to b or c, whichever occurs first. Then the algorithm will run until the last pointer points to the remaining term, giving the affirmative solution.

==Variants==

=== Non-zero sum ===
Instead of looking for numbers whose sum is 0, it is possible to look for numbers whose sum is any constant ''C'' in the following way:
* Subtract ''C''/3 from all elements of the input array.
* In the modified array, find 3 elements whose sum is 0.

For e.g., if A=[1,2,3,4] and if you are asked to find 3sum for C=4, then subtract all the elements of A by 4/3 and solve it in the usual 3sum way, i.e., (a-C/3) + (b-C/3) + (c-C/3) = 0

=== 3 different arrays ===
Instead of searching for the 3 numbers in a single array, we can search for them in 3 different arrays. I.e., given three arrays X, Y and Z, find three numbers {{math|''a''∈''X'', ''b''∈''Y'', ''c''∈''Z''}}, such that {{tmath|a+b+c{{=}}0}}. Call the 1-array variant 3SUM&amp;times;1 and the 3-array variant 3SUM&amp;times;3.

Given a solver for 3SUM&amp;times;1, the 3SUM&amp;times;3 problem can be solved in the following way (assuming all elements are integers): 
* For every element in ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'', set: {{tmath|X[i] \gets X[i]*10+1}}, {{tmath|Y[i] \gets Y[i]*10+2}}, {{tmath|Z[i] \gets Z[i]*10-3}}.
* Let ''S'' be a concatenation of the arrays ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''.
* Use the 3SUM&amp;times;1 oracle to find three elements {{tmath|a' \in S,\ b' \in S,\ c' \in S}} such that {{tmath|a'+b'+c'{{=}}0}}.
* Return {{tmath|a \gets (a'-1)/10,\ b \gets (b'-2)/10,\ c \gets (c'+3)/10}}. 
By the way we transformed the arrays, it is guaranteed that {{math|''a''∈''X'', ''b''∈''Y'', ''c''∈''Z''}}.&lt;ref&gt;For a reduction in the other direction, see [http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/37888/variants-of-the-3-sum-problem Variants of the 3-sum problem].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convolution sum ===
Instead of looking for arbitrary elements of the array such that:
:&lt;math&gt;S[k]=S[i]+S[j]&lt;/math&gt;
the ''convolution 3sum'' problem (Conv3SUM) looks for elements in specific locations:&lt;ref name=patrascu10&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/1806689.1806772| title = Towards polynomial lower bounds for dynamic problems| conference = Proceedings of the 42nd ACM symposium on Theory of computing - STOC '10| pages = 603| year = 2010| last1 = Patrascu | first1 = M. | isbn = 9781450300506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S[i+j]=S[i]+S[j]&lt;/math&gt;

==== Reduction from Conv3SUM to 3SUM ====
Given a solver for 3SUM, the Conv3SUM problem can be solved in the following way.&lt;ref name=patrascu10/&gt;
* Define a new array ''T'', such that for every index ''i'': &lt;math&gt;T[i]=2n S[i]+i&lt;/math&gt; (where ''n'' is the number of elements in the array, and the indices run from 0 to ''n''-1).
* Solve 3SUM on the array ''T''.

Correctness proof:
* If in the original array there is a triple with &lt;math&gt;S[i+j]=S[i]+S[j]&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T[i+j]=2n S[i+j]+i+j = (2n S[i] + i) + (2n S[j] + j)=T[i]+T[j]&lt;/math&gt;, so this solution will be found by 3SUM on ''T''.
* Conversely, if in the new array there is a triple with &lt;math&gt;T[k]=T[i]+T[j]&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;2n S[k] + k = 2n(S[i]+S[j]) + (i+j)&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;i+j&lt;2n&lt;/math&gt;, necessarily &lt;math&gt;S[k] = S[i]+S[j]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=i+j&lt;/math&gt;, so this is a valid solution for Conv3SUM on ''S''.

==== Reduction from 3SUM to Conv3SUM ====
Given a solver for Conv3SUM, the 3SUM problem can be solved in the following way.&lt;ref name=kpp14&gt;{{Cite arXiv|eprint=1407.6756|last1=Kopelowitz|first1=Tsvi|title=3SUM Hardness in (Dynamic) Data Structures|last2=Pettie|first2=Seth|last3=Porat|first3=Ely|class=cs.DS|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patrascu10/&gt;

The reduction uses a [[hash function]]. As a first approximation, assume that we have a linear hash function, i.e. a function ''h'' such that:
:&lt;math&gt;h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)&lt;/math&gt;
Suppose that all elements are integers in the range: 0...''N''-1, and that the function ''h'' maps each element to an element in the smaller range of indices: 0...''n''-1. Create a new array ''T'' and send each element of ''S'' to its hash value in ''T'', i.e., for every ''x'' in ''S'':
:&lt;math&gt;T[h(x)] = x&lt;/math&gt;
Initially, suppose that the mappings are unique (i.e. each cell in ''T'' accepts only a single element from ''S''). Solve Conv3SUM on ''T''. Now:
* If there is a solution for 3SUM: &lt;math&gt;z=x+y&lt;/math&gt;, then: &lt;math&gt;T[h(z)]=T[h(x)]+T[h(y)]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(z)=h(x)+h(y)&lt;/math&gt;, so this solution will be found by the Conv3SUM solver on ''T''.
* Conversely, if a Conv3SUM is found on ''T'', then obviously it corresponds to a 3SUM solution on ''S'' since ''T'' is just a permutation of ''S''.

This idealized solution doesn't work, because any hash function might map several distinct elements of ''S'' to the same cell of ''T''. The trick is to create an array ''T*'' by selecting a single random element from each cell of ''T'', and run Conv3SUM on ''T*''. If a solution is found, then it is a correct solution for 3SUM on ''S''. If no solution is found, then create a different random ''T*'' and try again. Suppose there are at most ''R'' elements in each cell of ''T''. Then the probability of finding a solution (if a solution exists) is the probability that the random selection will select the correct element from each cell, which is &lt;math&gt;(1/R)^3&lt;/math&gt;. By running Conv3SUM &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt; times, the solution will be found with a high probability.

Unfortunately, we do not have linear perfect hashing, so we have to use an [[almost linear hash function]], i.e. a function ''h'' such that:
:&lt;math&gt;h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)&lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)+1&lt;/math&gt;
This requires to duplicate the elements of ''S'' when copying them into ''T'', i.e., put every element &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt; both in &lt;math&gt;T[h(x)]&lt;/math&gt; (as before) and in &lt;math&gt;T[h(x)]-1&lt;/math&gt;. So each cell will have 2''R'' elements, and we will have to run Conv3SUM &lt;math&gt;(2R)^3&lt;/math&gt; times.

== 3SUM-hardness ==
A problem is called '''3SUM-hard''' if solving it in [[subquadratic time]] implies a subquadratic-time [[algorithm]] for 3SUM.  The concept of 3SUM-hardness was introduced by {{harvtxt|Gajentaan|Overmars|1995}}. They proved that a large class of problems in [[computational geometry]] are 3SUM-hard, including the following ones. (The authors acknowledge that many of these problems are contributed by other researchers.)

*Given a set of lines in the plane, are there three that meet in a point?
*Given a set of non-intersecting axis-parallel line segments, is there a line that separates them into two non-empty subsets?
*Given a set of infinite strips in the plane, do they fully cover a given rectangle?
*Given a set of triangles in the plane, compute their measure.
*Given a set of triangles in the plane, does their union have a hole?
*A number of visibility and motion planning problems, e.g.,
**Given a set of horizontal triangles in space, can a particular triangle be seen from a particular point?
**Given a set of non-intersecting axis-parallel line segment obstacles in the plane, can a given rod be moved by translations and rotations between a start and finish positions without colliding with the obstacles?

By now there are a multitude of other problems that fall into this category. An example is the decision version of [[X + Y sorting]]: given sets of numbers {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} of {{mvar|n}} elements each, are there {{mvar|''n''²}} distinct {{math|''x'' + ''y''}} for {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X'', ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}}?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Erik |last1=Demaine |authorlink1=Erik Demaine |first2=Jeff |last2=Erickson |first3=Joseph |last3=O'Rourke |title=Problem 41: Sorting X + Y (Pairwise Sums) |date=20 August 2006 |accessdate=23 September 2014 |website=The Open Problems Project |url=http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/TOPP/P41.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abstract index notation''' is a mathematical notation for [[tensor]]s and [[spinor]]s that uses indices to indicate their types, rather than their components in a particular basis.  The indices are mere placeholders, not related to any basis and, in particular, are non-numerical. Thus it should not be confused with the [[Ricci calculus]]. The notation was introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] as a way to use the formal aspects of the [[Einstein summation convention]] to compensate for the difficulty in describing [[tensor contraction|contraction]]s and [[covariant derivative|covariant differentiation]] in modern abstract tensor notation, while preserving the explicit [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance]] of the expressions involved.

Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]], and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; its [[dual space|dual]].  Consider, for example, an order-2 [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor 
&lt;math&gt;h\in V^*\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;.  Then ''h'' can be identified with a [[bilinear form]] on ''V''.  In other words, it is a function of two arguments in ''V'' which can be represented as a pair of ''slots'':

: &lt;math&gt;h = h(-,-).&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract index notation is merely a ''labelling'' of the slots with Latin letters, which have no significance apart from their designation as labels of the slots (i.e., they are non-numerical):

: &lt;math&gt;h = h_{ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[tensor contraction]] (or trace) between two tensors is represented by the repetition of an index label, where one label is contravariant (an ''upper index'' corresponding to a tensor in ''V'') and one label is covariant (a ''lower index'' corresponding to a tensor in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).  Thus, for instance,

: &lt;math&gt;{t_{ab}}^b&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace of a tensor ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; over its last two slots.  This manner of representing tensor contractions by repeated indices is formally similar to the [[Einstein summation convention]].  However, as the indices are non-numerical, it does not imply summation: rather it corresponds to the abstract basis-independent trace operation (or duality pairing) between tensor factors of type ''V'' and those of type ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Abstract indices and tensor spaces ==

A general homogeneous tensor is an element of a [[tensor product]] of copies of ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, such as

:&lt;math&gt;V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

Label each factor in this tensor product with a Latin letter in a raised position for each contravariant ''V'' factor, and in a lowered position for each covariant ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; position.  In this way, write the product as

:&lt;math&gt;V^a V_b V_c V^d V_e&lt;/math&gt;

or, simply

:&lt;math&gt;{{{V^a}_{bc}}^d}_e.&lt;/math&gt;

The last two expressions denote the same object as the first.  Tensors of this type are denoted using similar notation, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;{{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \in {{{V^a}_{bc}}^d}_e = V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*.&lt;/math&gt;

==Contraction==
{{See also|Tensor contraction}}
In general, whenever one contravariant and one covariant factor occur in a tensor product of spaces, there is an associated ''contraction'' (or ''trace'') map.  For instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{12} : V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^* \to V^* \otimes V\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace on the first two spaces of the tensor product.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{15} : V\otimes V^*\otimes V^* \otimes V\otimes V^* \to V^* \otimes V^*\otimes V&lt;/math&gt;

is the trace on the first and last space.

These trace operations are signified on tensors by the repetition of an index.  Thus the first trace map is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{12} : {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \mapsto {{{h^a}_{ac}}^d}_e&lt;/math&gt;

and the second by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}_{15} : {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_e \mapsto {{{h^a}_{bc}}^d}_a.&lt;/math&gt;

==Braiding==
To any tensor product on a single vector space, there are associated [[braided monoidal category|braiding maps]].  For example, the braiding map
:&lt;math&gt; \tau_{(12)} : V\otimes V \rightarrow V\otimes V&lt;/math&gt;
interchanges the two tensor factors (so that its action on simple tensors is given by &lt;math&gt;\tau_{(12)} (v \otimes w) = w \otimes v&lt;/math&gt;).  In general, the braiding maps are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the [[symmetric group]], acting by permuting the tensor factors.  Here, we use &lt;math&gt;\tau_\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to denote the braiding map associated to the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (represented as a product of disjoint [[cyclic permutation]]s).

Braiding maps are important in [[differential geometry]], for instance, in order to express the [[Bianchi identity]].  Here let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the Riemann tensor, regarded as a tensor in &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V^* \otimes V^* \otimes V&lt;/math&gt;.  The first Bianchi identity then asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;R+\tau_{(123)}R+\tau_{(132)}R = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Abstract index notation handles braiding as follows.  On a particular tensor product, an ordering of the abstract indices is fixed (usually this is a [[lexicographic order]]ing).  The braid is then represented in notation by permuting the labels of the indices.  Thus, for instance, with the Riemann tensor
:&lt;math&gt;R={R_{abc}}^d\in {V_{abc}}^d = V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V,&lt;/math&gt;
the Bianchi identity becomes
:&lt;math&gt;{R_{abc}}^d+{R_{cab}}^d+{R_{bca}}^d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Antisymmetrization and Symmetrization ==
A general tensor may be antisymmetrized or symmetrized, and there is according notation.

We demonstrate the notation by example. Let's antisymmetrize the type-(0,3) tensor &lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric group on three elements.

&lt;math&gt;\omega_{[abc]} := \frac{1}{3!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} (-1)^{\text{sgn}(\sigma)} \omega_{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we may symmetrize:

&lt;math&gt;\omega_{(abc)} := \frac{1}{3!} \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_3} \omega_{\sigma(a)\sigma(b)\sigma(c)}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7180">The '''activity selection problem'''  is a [[combinatorial optimization]] problem concerning the selection of non-conflicting [[task (project management)|activities]] to perform within a given [[time frame]], given a set of activities each marked by a start time (s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and finish time (f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). The problem is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person or [[machine]], assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time. The '''activity selection problem''' is also known as the [[Interval scheduling|Interval scheduling maximization problem (ISMP)]], which is a special type of the more general [[Interval scheduling|Interval Scheduling]] problem.

A classic application of this problem is in scheduling a room for multiple [[competing]] events, each having its own time requirements (start and end time), and many more arise within the framework of [[operations research]].

==Formal definition==
Assume there exist ''n'' activities with each of them being represented by a start time ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and finish time ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Two activities ''i'' and ''j'' are said to be non-conflicting if ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''f&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''s&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The activity selection problem consists in finding the maximal solution set (S) of non-conflicting activities, or more precisely there must exist no [[solution set]] S' such that |S'| &gt; |S| in the case that multiple maximal solutions have equal sizes.

==Optimal solution==
The activity selection problem is notable in that using a [[greedy algorithm]] to find a solution will always result in an [[optimal solution]]. A [[pseudocode]] sketch of the iterative version of the algorithm and a proof of the optimality of its result are included below.

===Algorithm===

&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
Greedy-Iterative-Activity-Selector(A, s, f): 

    Sort A by finish times stored in f
    
    S = {A[1]} 
    k = 1
    
    n = A.length
    
    for i = 2 to n:
       if s[i] ≥ f[k]: 
           S = S U {A[i]}
           k = i
    
    return S
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Explanation ====

'''Line 1:''' This    algorithm is called ''Greedy-Iterative-Activity-Selector'', because it is first of all a greedy algorithm, and then it is iterative. There's also a recursive version of this greedy algorithm.
*&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an array containing the ''activities''. 
* &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is an array containing the ''start times'' of the activities in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  is an array containing the ''finish times'' of the activities in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that these arrays are indexed starting from 1 up to the length of the corresponding array.

'''Line 3:''' Sorts in ''increasing order of finish times'' the array of activities &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by using the finish times stored in the array &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. This operation can be done in &lt;math&gt;O(n \cdot \log_2 n)&lt;/math&gt; time, using for example merge sort, heap sort, or quick sort algorithms.

'''Line 5:''' Creates a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to store the ''selected activities'', and initialises it with the activity &lt;math&gt;A[1]&lt;/math&gt; that has the earliest finish time.

'''Line 6:''' Creates a variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that keeps track of the index of the last selected activity.

'''Line 10:''' Starts iterating from the second element of that array &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; up to its last element.

'''Lines 11,12:''' If the ''start time'' &lt;math&gt;s[i]&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;ith&lt;/math&gt; activity (&lt;math&gt;A[i]&lt;/math&gt;) is greater or equal to the ''finish time'' &lt;math&gt;f[k]&lt;/math&gt; of the ''last selected activity'' (&lt;math&gt;A[k]&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;A[i]&lt;/math&gt; is compatible to the selected activities in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and thus it can be added to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Line 13:''' The index of the last selected activity is updated to the just added activity &lt;math&gt;A[i]&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof of optimality===
Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{1, 2, \ldots , n\}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of activities ordered by finish time. Assume that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution, also ordered by finish time; and that the index of the first activity in ''A'' is &lt;math&gt;k\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., this optimal solution ''does not'' start with the greedy choice. We will show that &lt;math&gt;B = (A \setminus \{k\}) \cup \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, which begins with the greedy choice (activity 1), is another optimal solution. Since &lt;math&gt;f_1 \leq f_k&lt;/math&gt;, and the activities in A are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] by definition, the activities in B are also disjoint. Since ''B'' has the same number of activities as ''A'', that is, &lt;math&gt;|A| = |B|&lt;/math&gt;, ''B'' is also optimal.

Once the greedy choice is made, the problem reduces to finding an optimal solution for the subproblem. If ''A'' is an optimal solution to the original problem ''S'', then &lt;math&gt;A^\prime = A \setminus \{1\}&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution to the activity-selection problem &lt;math&gt;S' = \{i \in S: s_i \geq f_1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Why? If we could find a solution ''B''′ to ''S''′ with more activities than ''A''′, then adding 1 to ''B''′ would yield a solution ''B'' to ''S'' with more activities than ''A'', contradicting the optimality.

===Weighted activity selection problem===
The generalized version of the activity selection problem involves selecting an optimal set of non-overlapping activities such that the total weight is maximized. Unlike the unweighted version, there is no greedy solution to the weighted activity selection problem. However, a [[dynamic programming]] solution can readily be formed using the following approach:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/cs423/lectures/dynamic-programming-4up.pdf Dynamic Programming with introduction to Weighted Activity Selection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider an optimal solution containing activity {{mvar|k}}. We now have non-overlapping activities on the left and right of {{mvar|k}}. We can recursively find solutions for these two sets because of optimal sub-structure. As we don't know {{mvar|k}}, we can try each of the activities. This approach leads to an &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; solution. This can be optimized further considering that for each set of activities in &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt;, we can find the optimal solution if we had known the solution for &lt;math&gt;(i, t)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|t}} is the last non-overlapping interval with {{mvar|j}} in &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt;. This yields an &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; solution. This can be further optimized considering the fact that we do not need to consider all ranges &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt; but instead just &lt;math&gt;(1, j)&lt;/math&gt;. The following algorithm thus yields an &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; solution:

&lt;source lang="c" line&gt;
Weighted-Activity-Selection(S):  // S = list of activities

    sort S by finish time
    opt[0] = 0
   
    for i = 1 to n:
        t = binary search to find activity with finish time &lt;= start time for i
        opt[i] = MAX(opt[i-1], opt[t] + w(i))
        
    return opt[n]
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Andrews curve for Iris data set.png|thumb|360px|Andrews curve for Iris data set]]

In [[data visualization]], an '''Andrews plot''' or '''Andrews curve''' is a way to visualize structure in high-dimensional data. It is basically a rolled-down, non-integer version of the Kent–Kiviat [[radar chart|radar m chart]], or a smoothened version of a [[parallel coordinates|parallel coordinate plot]].

A value &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Real coordinate space|high-dimensional datapoint]] if it is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^d &lt;/math&gt;. We can represent high-dimensional data with a number for each of their dimensions,  &lt;math&gt;x = \left \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.  To visualize them, the Andrews plot  defines a finite [[Fourier series]]:

: &lt;math&gt;f_x(t) = \frac{x_1}{\sqrt 2} + x_2 \sin(t) + x_3 \cos(t) + x_4 \sin(2t) + x_5 \cos(2t) + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

This function is then plotted for &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; t &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Thus each data point may be viewed as a line between &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This formula can be thought of as the projection of the data point onto the vector:

: &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}, \sin(t), \cos(t), \sin(2t), \cos(2t), \ldots \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

If there is structure in the data, it may be visible in the Andrews' curves of the data.

These curves have been utilized in fields as different as [[biology]], [[neurology]], [[sociology]] and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing. Some of their uses include the [[quality control]] of products, the detection of period and [[outlier]]s in [[time series]], the visualization of learning in [[artificial neural network]]s, and correspondence analysis.

Theoretically, it is possible to project them onto an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]. The projection onto the circle results in the aforementioned [[Radar chart]]. This could prove to be a powerful computer-aided multivariable visualization method if, upon projection onto the common tridimensional sphere, the layers are given some degree of transparency on their [[alpha channel]] so as to allow to see through.

In [[group theory]], '''Cayley's theorem''', named in honour of [[Arthur Cayley]], states that every [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] acting on ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood as an example of the [[group action]] of ''G'' on the elements of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|p=72, ex. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[permutation]] of a set ''G'' is any [[bijective]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] taking ''G'' onto ''G''; and the set of all such functions forms a group under [[function composition]], called ''the symmetric group on'' ''G'', and written as Sym(''G'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayley's theorem puts all groups on the same footing, by considering any group (including infinite groups such as ('''''R''''',+)) as a [[permutation group]] of some underlying set. Thus, theorems that are true for subgroups of permutation groups are true for groups in general. Nevertheless, [[Jonathan Lazare Alperin|Alperin]] and Bell note that "in general the fact that finite groups are imbedded in symmetric groups has not influenced the methods used to study finite groups".&lt;ref name="AlperinBell1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. L. Alperin|author2=Rowen B. Bell|title=Groups and representations|year=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-94525-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular action used in the standard proof of Cayley's theorem does not produce the representation of ''G'' in a ''minimal''-order permutation group. For example, &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, itself already a symmetric group of order 6, would be represented by the regular action as a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_6&lt;/math&gt; (a group of order 720).&lt;ref name="Cameron2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Cameron|title=Introduction to Algebra, Second Edition|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-852793-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of finding an embedding of a group in a minimal-order symmetric group is rather more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2373739| jstor = 2373739| title = Minimal Permutation Representations of Finite Groups| journal = American Journal of Mathematics| volume = 93| issue = 4| pages = 857| year = 1971| last1 = Johnson | first1 = D.

== History ==
While it seems elementary enough, it should be noted that at the time, the modern definitions didn't exist, and when Cayley introduced what are now called ''groups'' it wasn't immediately clear that this was equivalent to the previously known groups, which are now called ''permutation groups''. Cayley's theorem unifies the two.

Although Burnside&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Burnside | first = William | author-link = William Burnside | title = Theory of Groups of Finite Order | page = 22  | location = Cambridge | year = 1911 | edition = 2 | url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4062919;view=1up;seq=52;size=125 | isbn = 0-486-49575-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
attributes the theorem 
to [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jordan | first = Camille | author-link = Camille Jordan | title = Traite des substitutions et des equations algebriques | publisher = Gauther-Villars | location = Paris | year = 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Eric Nummela&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Nummela | first = Eric | title = Cayley's Theorem for Topological Groups | journal = American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | year = 1980 | pages = 202–203 | doi = 10.2307/2321608 | jstor = 2321608 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
nonetheless argues that the standard name&amp;mdash;"Cayley's Theorem"&amp;mdash;is in fact appropriate.  Cayley, in his original 1854 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Cayley | first = Arthur | author-link = Arthur Cayley | title = On the theory of groups as depending on the symbolic equation θ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=1 | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 7 | issue = 42 | pages = 40–47 | year = 1854 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_LYConosISUC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
showed that the correspondence in the theorem is one-to-one, but he failed to explicitly show it was a homomorphism (and thus an embedding).  However, Nummela notes that Cayley made this result known to the mathematical community at the time, thus predating Jordan by 16 years or so.

The theorem was later published by [[Walther Dyck]] in 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=von Dyck | year=1882 | first=Walther | author-link=Walther Dyck | title=Gruppentheoretische Studien |trans-title=Group-theoretical Studies | url=https://archive.org/stream/mathematischean54behngoog#page/n38/mode/1up | doi=10.1007/BF01443322 | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | issn=0025-5831 | volume=20 | issue=1 | page=30}}. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is attributed to Dyck in the first edition of Burnside's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Burnside | first = William | author-link = William Burnside | title = Theory of Groups of Finite Order | page = 22  | location = Cambridge | year = 1897 | edition = 1 | url = https://archive.org/stream/cu31924086163726#page/n43/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proof of the theorem ==
If ''g'' is any element of a group ''G'' with operation ∗, consider the function {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''G'' → ''G''}}, defined by {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''g'' ∗ ''x''}}. By the existence of inverses, this function has a two-sided inverse, &lt;math&gt;f_{g^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. So multiplication by ''g'' acts as a [[bijective]] function. Thus, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is a permutation of ''G'', and so is a member of Sym(''G'').

The set {{nowrap|1=''K'' = {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''g'' ∈ ''G''} }} is a subgroup of Sym(''G'') that is isomorphic to ''G''. The fastest way to establish this is to consider the function {{nowrap|''T'' : ''G'' → Sym(''G'')}} with {{nowrap|1=''T''(''g'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for every ''g'' in ''G''. ''T'' is a [[group homomorphism]] because (using · to denote composition in Sym(''G'')):

:&lt;math&gt; (f_g \cdot f_h)(x) = f_g(f_h(x)) = f_g(h*x) = g*(h*x) = (g*h)*x = f_{g*h}(x) ,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' in ''G'', and hence:
:&lt;math&gt; T(g) \cdot T(h) = f_g \cdot f_h = f_{g*h} = T(g*h) .&lt;/math&gt;
The homomorphism ''T'' is [[injective]] since {{nowrap|1=''T''(''g'') = id&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the identity element of Sym(''G'')) implies that {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∗ ''x'' = ''x''}} for all ''x'' in ''G'', and taking ''x'' to be the identity element ''e'' of ''G'' yields {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''g'' ∗ ''e'' = ''e''}}, i.e. the kernel is trivial. Alternatively, ''T'' is also [[injective]] since {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∗ ''x'' = ''g''′ ∗ ''x''}} implies that {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''g''′}} (because every group is [[cancellative]]).

Thus ''G'' is isomorphic to the image of ''T'', which is the subgroup ''K''.

''T'' is sometimes called the ''regular representation of'' ''G''.

=== Alternative setting of proof ===
An alternative setting uses the language of [[group action]]s. We consider the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as a G-set, which can be shown to have permutation representation, say &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

Firstly, suppose &lt;math&gt;G=G/H&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H=\{e\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the group action is &lt;math&gt;g.e&lt;/math&gt; by [[group action|classification of G-orbits]] (also known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem).

Now, the representation is faithful if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is injective, that is, if the kernel of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is trivial. Suppose &lt;math&gt;g\in\ker\phi&lt;/math&gt; Then, &lt;math&gt;g=g.e=\phi(g).e&lt;/math&gt; by the equivalence of the permutation representation and the group action. But since &lt;math&gt;g \in \ker\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=e&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;\ker\phi&lt;/math&gt; is trivial. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Im} \phi &lt; G&lt;/math&gt; and thus the result follows by use of the [[first isomorphism theorem]].

==Remarks on the regular group representation==
The identity group element corresponds to the identity permutation. All other group elements correspond to a permutation that does not leave any element unchanged. Since this also applies for powers of a group element, lower than the order of that element, each element corresponds to a permutation that consists of cycles all of the same length: this length is the order of that element. The elements in each cycle form a right [[coset]] of the subgroup generated by the element.

==Examples of the regular group representation==
Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1} with addition modulo 2; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (12). E.g. 0 +1 = 1 and 1+1 = 0, so 1 -&gt; 0 and 0 -&gt; 1, as they would under a permutation.

Z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1,2} with addition modulo 3; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (123), and group element 2 to permutation (132). E.g. 1 + 1 = 2 corresponds to (123)(123)=(132).

Z&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = {0,1,2,3} with addition modulo 4; the elements correspond to e, (1234), (13)(24), (1432).

The elements of [[Klein four-group]] {e, a, b, c} correspond to e, (12)(34), (13)(24), and (14)(23).

S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[dihedral group of order 6]]) is the group of all permutations of 3 objects, but also a permutation group of the 6 group elements, and the latter is how it is realized by its regular representation.

== More general statement of the theorem==

A more general statement of Cayley's theorem consist of considering the [[Core (group)|core]] of an arbitrary group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In general if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup with &lt;math&gt;|G:H|&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G/Core_G(H)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{|G:H|}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a finite group and we set &lt;math&gt;H=1&lt;/math&gt; then we get the classic result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3480">In [[projective geometry]], the '''circular points at infinity'''  (also called '''cyclic points''' or '''isotropic points''') are two special [[point at infinity|points at infinity]] in the [[complex projective plane]] that are contained in the [[complexification]] of every real [[circle]].

==Coordinates==
A point of the complex projective plane may be described in terms of [[homogeneous coordinates]], being a triple of [[complex number]]s {{nowrap|(''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'')}}, where two triples describe the same point of the plane when the coordinates of one triple are the same as those of the other aside from being multiplied by the same nonzero factor.  In this system, the points at infinity may be chosen as those whose ''z''-coordinate is zero.  The two circular points at infinity are two of these, usually taken to be those with homogeneous coordinates
:{{nowrap|(1 : i : 0)}} and {{nowrap|(1 : &amp;minus;i : 0)}}.

==Complexified circles==
A real circle, defined by its center point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and radius ''r'' (all three of which are [[real number]]s) may be described as the set of real solutions to the equation
:&lt;math&gt;(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=r^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Converting this into a [[homogeneous equation]] and taking the set of all complex-number solutions gives the complexification of the circle. The two circular points have their name because they lie on the complexification of every real circle. More generally, both points satisfy the homogeneous equations of the type 
:&lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + Ay^2 + 2B_1xz + 2B_2yz - Cz^2 = 0. &lt;/math&gt; 
The case where the coefficients are all real gives the equation of a general  circle (of the [[real projective plane]]). In general, an [[algebraic curve]] that passes through these two points is called [[Circular algebraic curve|circular]].

==Additional properties==
The circular points at infinity are the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]] of the [[isotropic line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Springer (1964) ''Geometry and Analysis of Projective Spaces'', page 141, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;
They are [[Fixed point (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[translation]]s and [[rotation]]s of the plane.

The concept of [[angle]] can be defined using the circular points, [[natural logarithm]] and [[cross-ratio]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Duncan Sommerville]] (1914) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ABN6053.0001.001/1?rgn=works;view=pdf;rgn1=author;q1=Sommerville Elements of Non-Euclidean Geometry], page 157, link from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;
:The angle between two lines is a certain multiple of the logarithm of the cross-ratio of the pencil formed by the two lines and the lines joining their intersection to the circular points.
Sommerville configures two lines on the origin as &lt;math&gt;u : y = x \tan \theta, \quad u' : y = x \tan \theta ' .&lt;/math&gt; Denoting the circular points as ''&amp;omega;'' and &amp;omega;''′, he obtains the cross ratio
:&lt;math&gt;(u u' , \omega \omega ') = \frac{\tan \theta - i}{\tan \theta + i} \div \frac{\tan \theta ' - i}{\tan \theta ' + i} ,&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \theta ' - \theta = \tfrac{i}{2} \log (u u', \omega \omega ') .&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6930">'''Competitive altruism''' is a possible mechanism for the persistence of [[cooperation|cooperative behaviors]], specifically those that are performed unconditionally. The theory of [[reciprocal altruism]] can be used to explain behaviors that are performed by a donor who receives some sort of benefit in the future. When no such compensation is received, however, [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] fails to explain [[altruism|altruistic behavior]].

==Characteristics==

To explain competitive altruism, Roberts&lt;ref name="rob98"&gt;Roberts, G. 1998. Competitive altruism: from reciprocity to the handicap principle. Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B 265: 429-430.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the example of [[preening]] among birds. Because certain birds cannot reach [[parasite]]s on all parts of their bodies, particularly their necks, they benefit from preening one another. For any given bird, there is an entire [[Flock (birds)|flock]] of potential preeners, who compete in hopes of establishing a beneficial relationship. Cheaters, or those birds that try to be preened without preening others, do not compete and thus are excluded from these relationships. Their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is lowered because they are ostracized by members of the flock.

McNamara et al.&lt;ref name="McNamara08"&gt;McNamara, J., Z. Barta, L. Fromhage, and A. Houston. 2008. The coevolution of choosiness and cooperation. Nature 451: 189-192.&lt;/ref&gt; quantitatively analyzed this theory. Like [[Robert Axelrod]], they created a [[computer program]] to simulate repeated interactions among individuals. The program involved players with two genetically determined [[Trait (biology)|traits]], a ‘cooperative trait’ and a ‘choosiness trait.’ They found the following results:&lt;blockquote&gt;
‘Paradoxical’ trait combinations yield particularly low payoffs: individuals with low choosiness but high effort tend to get exploited by their co-players; individuals with high choosiness but low effort waste their time searching for better co-players, which are, however, unlikely to accept them. The positive correlation between choosiness and cooperativeness leads to a positive assortment between cooperative types – an essential feature of all mechanisms that promote cooperation.&lt;ref name="McNamara08" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of such cooperation requires variation in the degree of cooperation and choosiness, which the researchers attributed to [[mutation|genetic mutation]] and [[Genetic diversity|variation]]. McNamara et al. also determined that since a period of searching is required for ‘mutually acceptable’ players to find one another, competitive altruism is more likely to arise in animals with long life spans.&lt;ref name="McNamara08" /&gt;

==The prisoner's dilemma==
To relate this condition to the [[prisoner's dilemma]], an individual may benefit the most in a one-time interaction with another by defecting (i.e. receiving benefits without incurring any cost to itself). However, in an iterated prisoner's dilemma, where individuals interact more than once, if the act of defecting makes the individual less likely to attract a [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] mate in the future, then cooperative behavior will be selected for.&lt;ref name="rob98" /&gt;

This selection for cooperation is even stronger if an individual's action in an interaction is observed by third-party individuals, for the possibility of forming a [[reputation]] arises. [[Amotz Zahavi]], famous for his work with the altruistic [[Arabian babbler]], suggests that this level of "social prestige" will affect which individuals interact with one another and how they behave.&lt;ref&gt;Zahavi, A. 1995. Altruism as a handicap: the limitations of kin selection and reciprocity. J. Avian Biol. 26 (1): 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Competitive altruism has been demonstrated repeatedly in studies with humans. For instance, individuals are more generous when their behaviour is visible to others and altruistic individuals receive more social status and are selectively preferred as collaboration partners and group leaders...&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, C. &amp; Van Vugt, M. (2006). Nice guys finish first: The competitive altruism hypothesis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32,1402-1413&lt;/ref&gt; Adding insights from sexual selection theory research has also found that men behave more altruistically in the presence of an (attractive) female and altruistic males are selectively preferred as long-term sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;Iredale, W., Van Vugt, M. &amp; Dunbar, R (2008). Showing off: Male generosity as mate signal. Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The handicap principle==
The theory of competitive altruism also helps one connect such behavior to the [[handicap principle]]. With competitive altruism, cooperation is considered a trait that provides a [[Signalling theory|signaling]] benefit, and thus is subject to [[sexual selection]]. Like a [[peacock|peacock's tail]], cooperation persists and is magnified, even though it carries a cost to the individual. Cooperation must be significantly costly to the individual, such that only a limited proportion of the population is fit enough to partake.&lt;ref&gt;Lotem, A., M. Fishman, and L. Stone. 2003. From reciprocity to unconditional altruism through signaling benefits. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 270: 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts&lt;ref name="rob98" /&gt; builds on the idea of altruism as a signaling benefit with his "free gift theory". Because the recipient gains some benefit from the interaction with the donor, there is an incentive to pay attention to the signal. For example, some male birds will offer food to a potential mate. Such behavior, called [[courtship feeding]], not only benefits the female, who receives a meal without expending any energy, but also conveys the ability of the male to forage. Consequently, the signal is kept true (i.e. it remains a correct reflection on the fitness of the mate).

However, the connection between competitive altruism and signaling is not without criticism. Wright&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J. 1999. Altruism as a signal - Zahavi's alternative to kin selection and reciprocity. Journal of Avian Biology 30: 109&lt;/ref&gt; raises the point that an altruistic signaling behavior like gift giving would cause a "flow of fitness from the higher quality individual to the lower quality one" and reduce the veracity of the signal. To account for this likely trend, Wright stipulates that the altruistic behavior must be directed at a mate or ally. In order for the theory to hold true, the signaling benefit would have to be shown to improve the individual's fitness beyond the benefit gained from the "investment" in the partner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12999">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[order theory]], '''completeness properties''' assert the existence of certain [[infimum|infima]] or [[supremum|suprema]] of a given [[partially ordered set]] (poset). The most familiar example is the [[completeness of the real numbers]]. A special use of the term refers to [[complete partial order]]s or [[complete lattice]]s. However, many other interesting notions of completeness exist.

The motivation for considering completeness properties derives from the great importance of [[suprema]] (least upper bounds, [[Join (mathematics)|joins]], "&lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;") and [[infima]] (greatest lower bounds, [[meet (mathematics)|meets]], "&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;") to the theory of partial orders. Finding a supremum means to single out one distinguished least element from the set of upper bounds. On the one hand, these special elements often embody certain concrete properties that are interesting for the given application (such as being the [[least common multiple]] of a set of numbers or the [[union (set theory)|union]] of a collection of sets). On the other hand, the knowledge that certain types of subsets are guaranteed to have suprema or infima enables us to consider the computation of these elements as ''total operations'' on a partially ordered set. For this reason, [[poset]]s with certain completeness properties can often be described as [[algebraic structure]]s of a certain kind. In addition, studying the properties of the newly obtained operations yields further interesting subjects.

==Types of completeness properties==

All completeness properties are described along a similar scheme: one describes a certain class of subsets of a partially ordered set that are required to have a supremum or infimum. Hence every completeness property has its [[duality (order theory)|dual]], obtained by inverting the order-dependent definitions in the given statement. Some of the notions are usually not dualized while others may be self-dual (i.e. equivalent to their dual statements).

===Least and greatest elements===

The easiest example of a supremum is the empty one, i.e. the supremum of the [[empty set]]. By definition, this is the least element among all elements that are greater than each member of the empty set. But this is just the [[least element]] of the whole poset, if it has one, since the empty subset of a poset P is conventionally considered to be both bounded from above and from below, with every element of P being both an upper and lower bound of the empty subset. Other common names for the least element are bottom and zero (0). The dual notion, the empty lower bound, is the [[greatest element]], top, or unit (1).

Posets that have a bottom are sometimes called pointed, while posets with a top are called unital or topped. An order that has both a least and a greatest element is bounded. However, this should not be confused with the notion of ''bounded completeness'' given below.

===Finite completeness===

Further simple completeness conditions arise from the consideration of all non-empty finite sets. An order in which all non-empty finite sets have both a supremum and an infimum is called a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. It suffices to require that all suprema and infima of ''two'' elements exist to obtain all non-empty finite ones. A straightforward [[mathematical induction|induction]] shows that every finite non-empty supremum/infimum can be decomposed into a finite number of binary suprema/infima. Thus the central operations of lattices are binary suprema &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; and infima {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;.}} It is in this context that the terms meet for &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and join for &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; are most common.

A poset in which only non-empty finite suprema are known to exist is therefore called a [[semilattice|join-semilattice]]. The dual notion is [[semilattice|meet-semilattice]].

===Further completeness conditions===

The strongest form of completeness is the existence of all suprema and all infima. The posets with this property are the [[complete lattice]]s. However, using the given order, one can restrict to further classes of (possibly infinite) subsets, that do not yield this strong completeness at once.

If all [[directed set|directed subsets]] of a poset have a supremum, then the order is a [[directed complete partial order|directed-complete partial order]] (dcpo). These are especially important in [[domain theory]]. The seldom-considered dual notion of a dcpo is the filtered-complete poset. Dcpos with a least element ("pointed dcpos") are one of the possible meanings of the phrase [[complete partial order]] (cpo).

If every subset that has ''some'' upper bounds has also a least upper bound, then the respective poset is called [[bounded complete]]. The term is used widely with this definition that focuses on suprema and there is no common name for the dual property. However, bounded completeness can be expressed in terms of other completeness conditions that are easily dualized (see below). Although concepts with the names "complete" and "bounded" were already defined, confusion is unlikely to occur since one would rarely speak of a "bounded complete poset" when meaning a "bounded cpo" (which is just a "cpo with greatest element"). Likewise, "bounded complete lattice" is almost unambiguous, since one would not state the boundedness property for complete lattices, where it is implied anyway. Also note that the empty set usually has upper bounds (if the poset is non-empty) and thus a bounded-complete poset has a least element.

One may also consider the subsets of a poset which are [[total order|totally ordered]], i.e. the [[Total order#Chains|chains]]. If all chains have a supremum, the order is called [[chain complete]]. Again, this concept is rarely needed in the dual form.

==Relationships between completeness properties==

It was already observed that binary meets/joins yield all non-empty finite meets/joins. Likewise, many other (combinations) of the above conditions are equivalent.

* The best-known example is the existence of all suprema, which is in fact equivalent to the existence of all infima. Indeed, for any subset ''X'' of a poset, one can consider its set of lower bounds ''B''. The supremum of ''B'' is then equal to the infimum of ''X'': since each element of ''X'' is an upper bound of ''B'', sup ''B'' is smaller than all elements of ''X'', i.e. sup ''B'' is in ''B''. It is the greatest element of ''B'' and hence the infimum of ''X''. In a dual way, the existence of all infima implies the existence of all suprema.
* Bounded completeness can also be characterized differently. By an argument similar to the above, one finds that the supremum of a set with upper bounds is the infimum of the set of upper bounds. Consequently, bounded completeness is equivalent to the existence of all non-empty lower-bounded infima.
* A poset is a complete lattice [[if and only if]] it is a cpo and a join-semilattice. Indeed, for any subset ''X'', the set of all finite suprema (joins) of ''X'' is directed and the supremum of this set (which exists by directed completeness) is equal to the supremum of ''X''. Thus every set has a supremum and by the above observation we have a complete lattice. The other direction of the proof is trivial.
* The following equivalence requires the [[Axiom of Choice]]:
:: A poset is chain-complete if and only if it is a dcpo.

==Completeness in terms of universal algebra==

As explained above, the presence of certain completeness conditions allows to regard the formation of certain suprema and infima as total operations of an ordered set. It turns out that in many cases it is possible to characterize completeness solely by considering appropriate [[algebraic structure]]s in the sense of [[universal algebra]], which are equipped with operations like &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;. By imposing additional conditions (in form of suitable [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]) on these operations, one can then indeed derive the underlying partial order exclusively from such algebraic structures. Details on this characterization can be found in the articles on the "lattice-like" structures for which this is typically considered: see [[semilattice]], [[lattice (order)|lattice]], [[Heyting algebra]], and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. Note that the latter two structures extend the application of these principles beyond mere completeness requirements by introducing an additional operation of ''negation''.

==Completeness in terms of adjunctions==

Another interesting way to characterize completeness properties is provided through the concept of (monotone) [[Galois connection]]s, i.e. adjunctions between partial orders. In fact this approach offers additional insights both in the nature of many completeness properties and in the importance of Galois connections for order theory. The general observation on which this reformulation of completeness is based is that the construction of certain suprema or infima provides left or right adjoint parts of suitable Galois connections.

Consider a partially ordered set (''X'', ≤). As a first simple example, let 1 = {*} be a specified one-element set with the only possible partial ordering. There is an obvious mapping ''j'': ''X'' → 1 with ''j''(''x'') = * for all ''x'' in ''X''. ''X'' has a least element [[if and only if]] the function ''j'' has a lower adjoint ''j''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: 1 → ''X''. Indeed the definition for Galois connections yields that in this case ''j''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(*) ≤ ''x'' if and only if * ≤ ''j''(''x''), where the right hand side obviously holds for any ''x''. Dually, the existence of an upper adjoint for ''j'' is equivalent to ''X'' having a greatest element.

Another simple mapping is the function ''q'': ''X'' → (''X'' x ''X'') given by ''q''(''x'') = (''x'', ''x''). Naturally, the intended ordering relation for (''X'' x ''X'') is just the usual [[product order]]. ''q'' has a lower adjoint ''q''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; if and only if all binary joins in ''X'' exist. Conversely, the join operation &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;: (''X'' x ''X'') → ''X'' can always provide the (necessarily unique) lower adjoint for ''q''. Dually, ''q'' allows for an upper adjoint if and only if ''X'' has all binary meets. Thus the meet operation &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, if it exists, always is an upper adjoint. If both &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; exist and, in addition, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; is also a lower adjoint, then the poset ''X'' is a [[Heyting algebra]]—another important special class of partial orders.

Further completeness statements can be obtained by exploiting suitable [[completion (order theory)|completion]] procedures. For example, it is well known that the collection of all [[lower set]]s of a poset ''X'', ordered by [[subset|subset inclusion]], yields a complete lattice '''D'''(''X'') (the downset-lattice). Furthermore, there is an obvious embedding ''e'': ''X'' → '''D'''(''X'') that maps each element ''x'' of ''X'' to its [[ideal (order theory)|principal ideal]] {''y'' in ''X'' | ''y'' ≤ ''x''}. A little reflection now shows that ''e'' has a lower adjoint if and only if ''X'' is a complete lattice. In fact, this lower adjoint will map any lower set of ''X'' to its supremum in ''X''. Composing this with the function that maps any subset of ''X'' to its [[lower set|lower closure]] (again an adjunction for the inclusion of lower sets in the [[powerset]]), one obtains the usual supremum map from the powerset 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X''. As before, another important situation occurs whenever this supremum map is also an upper adjoint: in this case the complete lattice ''X'' is ''constructively completely distributive''. See also the articles on [[completely distributive lattice|complete distributivity]] and [[distributivity (order theory)]].

The considerations in this section suggest a reformulation of (parts of) order theory in terms of [[category theory]], where properties are usually expressed by referring to the relationships ([[morphism]]s, more specifically: adjunctions) between objects, instead of considering their internal structure. For more detailed considerations of this relationship see the article on the [[categorical formulation of order theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10121">In [[mathematics]], the '''curve complex''' is a [[simplicial complex]] ''C''(''S'') associated to a finite type [[Surface (topology)|surface]]  S, which encodes the combinatorics of [[simple closed curve]]s on&amp;nbsp;''S''. The curve complex turned out to be a fundamental tool in the study of the geometry of the Teichmüller space, of mapping class groups and of Kleinian groups.

== Curve complexes ==

=== Definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a finite type connected oriented surface. More specifically, let &lt;math&gt;S=S_{g,b,n}&lt;/math&gt; be a connected oriented surface of genus &lt;math&gt;g\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; boundary components and &lt;math&gt;n\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; punctures.

The ''curve complex''  &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the simplicial complex defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Farb and Margalit, Ch. 4.1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

*The vertices are the free [[homotopy class]]es of essential (neither homotopically trivial nor peripheral) simple closed curves on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;
*If &lt;math&gt;c_1, \ldots, c_n&lt;/math&gt; represent distinct vertices of &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt;, they span a simplex if and only if they can be homotoped to be pairwise disjoint.

=== Examples ===

For surfaces of small complexity (essentially the [[torus]], punctured torus, and four-holed sphere), with the definition above the curve complex has infinitely many connected components. One can give an alternate and more useful definition by joining vertices if the corresponding curves have minimal intersection number. With this alternate definition, the resulting complex is isomorphic to the [[Farey graph]].

== Geometry of the curve complex ==

=== Basic properties ===

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact surface of genus &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; boundary components the dimension of &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\xi(S) = 3g - 3 + b&lt;/math&gt;. In what follows, we will assume that &lt;math&gt;\xi(S) \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. The complex of curves is never locally finite (i.e. every vertex has infinitely many neighbors). A result of Harer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harer|first=John L.|date=1986-02-01|title=The virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group of an orientable surface|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01388737|journal=Inventiones mathematicae|language=en|volume=84|issue=1|pages=157–176|doi=10.1007/BF01388737|issn=0020-9910|bibcode=1986InMat..84..157H}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is in fact it is [[Homotopy equivalence|homotopically equivalent]] to a [[wedge sum]] of spheres.

=== Intersection numbers and distance on ''C''(''S'') ===

The combinatorial distance on the 1-skeleton of &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the intersection number between simple closed curves on a surface, which is the smallest number of intersections of two curves in the isotopy classes. For example{{sfn|Schleimer|2006|loc=Lemma 1.21}}

: &lt;math&gt;d_S (\alpha, \beta) \le 2 \log_2 (i(\alpha, \beta)) + 2&lt;/math&gt;

for any two nondisjoint simple closed curves &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt;. One can compare in the other direction but the results are much more subtle (for example there is no uniform lower bound even for a given surface) and harder to prove.{{sfn|Bowditch|2006}}

=== Hyperbolicity===

It was proved by [[Howard Masur|Masur]] and [[Yair Minsky|Minsky]]{{sfn|Masur|Minsky|1999}} that the complex of curves is a [[Gromov hyperbolic space]]. Later work by various authors gave alternate proofs of this fact and better information on the hyperbolicity.{{sfn|Bowditch|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aougab | first=Tarik | title=Uniform hyperbolicity of the graphs of curves | journal=Geom. Topol. | volume=17 | date=2013 | pages=2855–2875 | mr=3190300 | doi=10.2140/gt.2013.17.2855| arxiv=1212.3160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation with the mapping class group and Teichmüller space ==

=== Action of the mapping class group ===

The [[mapping class group]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; acts on the complex &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; in the natural way: it acts on the vertices by &lt;math&gt;\phi\cdot\alpha = \phi_*\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and this extends to an action on the full complex. This action allows to prove many interesting properties of the mapping class groups.{{sfn|Ivanov|1992|loc=Chapter 7}}

While the mapping class group itself is not an [[hyperbolic group]], the fact that &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; is hyperbolic still has implications for its structure and geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manganas | first=Johanna | title=Uniform uniform exponential growth of subgroups of the mapping class group | journal=Geom. Funct. Anal. | volume=19 | date=2010 | pages=1468–1480 | mr=2585580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dahmani|first1=François|last2=Guirardel|first2=Vincent|last3=Osin|first3=Denis|title=Hyperbolically embedded subgroups and rotating families in groups acting on hyperbolic spaces|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1111.7048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with Teichmüller space ===

There is a natural map from [[Teichmüller space]] to the curve complex, which takes a marked hyperbolic structures to the collection of closed curves realising the smallest possible length (the [[Systolic geometry|systole]]). It allows to read off certain geometric properties of the latter, in particular it explains the empirical fact that while Teichmüller space itself is not hyperbolic it retains certain features of hyperbolicity.

== Applications to 3-dimensional topology ==

=== Heegaard splittings ===

A simplex in &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; determines a "filling" of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to a handlebody. Choosing two simplices in &lt;math&gt;C(S)&lt;/math&gt; thus determines a [[Heegaard splitting]] of a three-manifold,{{sfn|Hempel|2001}} with the additional data of an Heegaard diagram (a maximal system of disjoint simple closed curves bounding disks for each of the two handlebodies). Some properties of Heegaard splittings can be read very efficiently off the relative positions of the simplices:

*the splitting is reducible if and only if it has a diagram represented by simplices which have a common vertex;
*the splitting is weakly reducible if and only if it has a diagram represented by simplices which are linked by an edge.

In general the minimal distance between simplices representing diagram for the splitting can give information on the topology and geometry (in the sense of the [[geometrisation conjecture]] of the manifold) and vice versa.{{sfn|Hempel|2001}} A guiding principle is that the minimal distance of a Heegaard splitting is a measure of the complexity of the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Abrams | first1=Aaron | last2=Schleimer | first2=Saul | title=Distances of Heegaard splittings | journal=Geom. Topol. | volume=9 | date=2005 | pages=95–119 | mr=2115669 | doi=10.2140/gt.2005.9.95| arxiv=math/0306071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kleinian groups ===

As a special case of the philosophy of the previous paragraph, the geometry of the curve complex is an important tool to link combinatorial and geometric propertoes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and hence it is a useful tool in the study of Kleinian groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowditch | first=Brian H. | chapter=Hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the geometry of the curve complex | title=European Congress of Mathematics | pages=103–115 | publisher=Eur. Math. Soc. | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been used in the proof of the [[ending lamination conjecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minsky|first=Yair|date=2010|title=The classification of Kleinian surface groups, I: models and bounds|url=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2010/171-1/p01|journal=Annals of Mathematics|language=en-US|volume=171|issue=1|pages=1–107|doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.1|issn=0003-486X|arxiv=math/0302208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brock|first=Jeffrey|last2=Canary|first2=Richard|last3=Minsky|first3=Yair|date=2012|title=The classification of Kleinian surface groups, II: The Ending Lamination Conjecture|url=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/176-1/p01|journal=Annals of Mathematics|language=en-US|volume=176|issue=3|pages=1–149|doi=10.4007/annals.2012.176.1.1|issn=0003-486X|arxiv=math/0412006}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Random manifolds ===

A possible model for random 3-manifolds is to take random Heegaard splittings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dunfield | first1=Nathan M. | last2=Thurston | first2=William P. | title=Finite covers of random 3-manifolds | journal=Invent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">'''Ebenezer Cunningham''' (7 May 1881, [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London]] &amp;ndash; 12 February 1977)
was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] who is remembered for his research and exposition at the dawn of [[special relativity]].

==Biography==
Cunningham went up to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1899 and graduated [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1902, winning the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CNNN899E|name=Cunningham, Ebenezer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, as a lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]], he began work on a new theorem in [[Principle of relativity|relativity]] with fellow lecturer [[Harry Bateman]]. They brought the methods of [[inversive geometry]] into electromagnetic theory with their transformations ([[spherical wave transformation]]):
:Each four-dimensional solution [to Maxwell's equations] could then be inverted in a four-dimensional ''hypersphere of pseudo-radius K'' in order to produce a new solution. Central to Cunningham's paper was the demonstration that Maxwell's equations retained their form under these transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, page 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked with [[Karl Pearson]] in 1907 at [[University College London]].
Cunningham married Ada Collins in 1908.

In August 1911 he returned to St John's College where he made his career. When drafted for the war in 1915 he did alternative service growing food and in an office at the YMCA. He held a university lectureship from 1926 to 1946.

His book ''The Principle of Relativity'' (1914) was one of the first treatises in English about special relativity, along with those by [[Alfred Robb]] and [[Ludwik Silberstein]]. He followed with ''Relativity and the Electron Theory'' (1915) and ''Relativity, Electron Theory and Gravitation'' (1921). McCrea writes that Cunningham had doubts whether general relativity produced "physical results adequate return for mathematical elaboration."

He was an ardent pacifist, strongly religious, a member of [[Emmanuel United Reformed Church, Cambridge]] and chairman of the [[Congregational Union of England and Wales]] for 1953–54.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7164">In [[matroid theory]], an '''Eulerian matroid''' is a matroid whose elements can be partitioned into a collection of disjoint circuits.

==Examples==
In a [[uniform matroid]] &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt;, the circuits are the sets of exactly &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt; elements. Therefore, a uniform matroid is Eulerian if and only if &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt; is a divisor of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-point lines &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_n&lt;/math&gt; are Eulerian if and only if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by three.

The [[Fano plane]] has two kinds of circuits: sets of three collinear points, and sets of four points that do not contain any line. The three-point circuits are the [[complement (set theory)|complements]] of the four-point circuits, so it is possible to partition the seven points of the plane into two circuits, one of each kind. Thus, the Fano plane is also Eulerian.

==Relation to Eulerian graphs==
Eulerian matroids were defined by {{harvtxt|Welsh|1969}} as a generalization of the [[Eulerian graph]]s, graphs in which every vertex has even degree. By [[Veblen's theorem]] the edges of every such graph may be partitioned into simple cycles, from which it follows that the [[graphic matroid]]s of Eulerian graphs are examples of Eulerian matroids.&lt;ref name="w69"&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 6
 | year = 1969
 | doi=10.1016/s0021-9800(69)80033-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of an Eulerian graph above allows graphs that are disconnected, so not every such graph has an Euler tour. {{harvtxt|Wilde|1975}} observes that the graphs that have Euler tours can be characterized in an alternative way that generalizes to matroids: a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has an Euler tour if and only if it can be formed from some other graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and a cycle &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, by [[graph minor|contracting]] the edges of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; that do not belong to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. In the contracted graph, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; generally stops being a simple cycle and becomes instead an Euler tour. Analogously, Wilde considers the matroids that can be formed from a larger matroid by [[matroid minor|contracting]] the elements that do not belong to some particular circuit. He shows that this property is trivial for general matroids (it implies only that each element belongs to at least one circuit) but can be used to characterize the Eulerian matroids among the [[binary matroid]]s, matroids [[Matroid representation|representable]] over [[GF(2)]]:
a binary matroid is Eulerian if and only if it is the contraction of another binary matroid onto a circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Duality with bipartite matroids==
For [[planar graph]]s, the properties of being Eulerian and [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] are dual: a planar graph is Eulerian if and only if its [[dual graph]] is bipartite. As Welsh showed, this duality extends to binary matroids: a binary matroid is Eulerian if and only if its [[dual matroid]] is a [[bipartite matroid]], a matroid in which every circuit has even cardinality.&lt;ref name="w69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | volume = 110
 | year = 1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For matroids that are not binary, the duality between Eulerian and bipartite matroids may break down. For instance, the uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_6&lt;/math&gt; is Eulerian but its dual &lt;math&gt;U{}^4_6&lt;/math&gt; is not bipartite, as its circuits have size five. The self-dual uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^3_6&lt;/math&gt; is bipartite but not Eulerian.

==Alternative characterizations==
Because of the correspondence between Eulerian and bipartite matroids among the binary matroids, the binary matroids that are Eulerian may be characterized in alternative ways. The characterization of {{harvtxt|Wilde|1975}} is one example; two more are that a binary matroid is Eulerian if and only if every element belongs to an odd number of circuits, if and only if the whole matroid has an odd number of partitions into circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational complexity==
Any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is Eulerian, given access to the matroid via an [[matroid oracle|independence oracle]], must perform an exponential number of oracle queries, and therefore cannot take polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Eulerian extension==
If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a binary matroid that is not Eulerian, then it has a unique '''Eulerian extension''', a binary matroid &lt;math&gt;\bar M&lt;/math&gt; whose elements are the elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; together with one additional element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, such that the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\bar M&lt;/math&gt; to the elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The dual of &lt;math&gt;\bar M&lt;/math&gt; is a bipartite matroid formed from the dual of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; by adding &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; to every odd circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;math&gt;A_{f}(\infty) = F_\infty &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the filled-in Julia set is the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the unbounded [[Classification of Fatou components|Fatou component]]: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K(f) = F_\infty^C.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation between Julia, filled-in Julia set and attractive basin of infinity==
{{Wikibooks|Fractals }}

The [[Julia set]] is the common [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the filled-in Julia set and the [[Basin of attraction|attractive basin]] of [[Point at infinity|infinity]] &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;J(f)\, = \partial K(f) =\partial  A_{f}(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where : &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A_{f}(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Basin of attraction|attractive basin]] of [[Point at infinity|infinity]]  = exterior of filled-in Julia set = set of escaping points for   &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A_{f}(\infty) \  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \  \{ z \in  \mathbb{C}  : f^{(k)} (z)  \to  \infty\  as\  k \to \infty \}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the filled-in Julia set has no [[Interior (topology)|interior]] then the [[Julia set]] coincides with the filled-in Julia set. This happens when all the critical points of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are pre-periodic.  Such critical points are often called [[Misiurewicz point]]s.

==Spine ==

The most studied polynomials are probably [[Complex_quadratic_polynomial|those of the form]] &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2 + c&lt;/math&gt;, which are often denoted by &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is any complex number.  In this case, the spine &lt;math&gt;S_c\,&lt;/math&gt; of the filled Julia set &lt;math&gt;\ K \,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as [[Arc (projective geometry)|arc]]  between &lt;math&gt;\beta\,&lt;/math&gt;[[Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|-fixed point]] and &lt;!-- its preimage --&gt; &lt;math&gt;-\beta\,&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;S_c = \left [ - \beta , \beta  \right ]\,&lt;/math&gt;

with such properties:
*spine lies inside &lt;math&gt;\ K \,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rochester.edu/u/faculty/doug/oldcourses/215s98/lecture10.html Douglas C.

'''Frank Harary''' (March 11, 1921 – January 4, 2005) was an American [[mathematician]], who specialized in [[graph theory]].  He was widely recognized as one of the "fathers" of modern graph theory.&lt;ref name=sigact/&gt;
Harary was a master of clear exposition and, together with his many doctoral students, he standardized the terminology of graphs.  He broadened the reach of this field to include physics, psychology, sociology, and even anthropology.  Gifted with a keen sense of humor, Harary challenged and entertained audiences at all levels of mathematical sophistication.  A particular trick he employed was to turn theorems into games - for instance, students would try to add red edges to a graph on six vertices in order to create a red triangle, while another group of students tried to add edges to create a blue triangle (and each edge of the graph had to be either blue or red).  Because of the [[theorem on friends and strangers]], one team or the other would have to win.

==Biography==
Frank Harary was born in [[New York City]], the oldest child to a family of [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Syria]] and [[Morocco]]. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1941 and 1945 respectively&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/harary.html Frank Harary 1921-2005 - Columbia University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105120806/http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/harary.html |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Ph.D.]], with supervisor [[Alfred Foster (mathematician)|Alfred L. Foster]], from [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] in 1948.

Prior to his teaching career he became a research assistant in the Institute of Social Research at the [[University of Michigan]].

Harary's first publication, "Atomic Boolean-like rings with finite radical", went through much effort to be put into the ''[[Duke Mathematical Journal]]'' in 1950.  This article was first submitted to the American Mathematical Society in November 1948, then sent to the ''Duke Mathematical Journal'' where it was revised three times before it was finally published two years after its initial submission.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Harary began his teaching career at the University of Michigan in 1953 where he was first an assistant professor, then in 1959 associate professor and in 1964 was appointed as a [[professor]] of mathematics, a position he held until 1986.

From 1987 he was [[Professor]] (and Distinguished [[Professor Emeritus]]) in the Computer Science Department at [[New Mexico State University]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. He was one of the founders of the ''[[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Graph Theory]]''.&lt;ref name=sigact&gt;[http://sigact.acm.org/harary.htm Frank Harary], a biographical sketch at the ACM [[SIGACT]] site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Harary published ''On the algebraic structure of knots''.  Shortly after this publication in 1953 Harary published his first book (jointly with George Uhlenbeck) ''On the number of Husimi trees''.  It was following this text that Harary began to build up a worldwide reputation for his work in graph theory.  In 1965 Harary's first book ''Structural models: An introduction to the theory of directed graphs'' was published, and for the rest of his life Harary's interest would be in the field of [[Graph Theory]].

While beginning his work in graph theory around 1965, Harary began buying up property in [[Ann Arbor]] to supplement income for his family.  Harary and his wife Jayne had six children together, Miriam, Natalie, Judith, Thomas, Joel and Chaya.

From 1973 to 2007 Harary jointly wrote five more books, each in the field of graph theory.  In the time before his death, Harary traveled the world researching and publishing over 800 papers (with some 300 different co-authors),  in mathematical journals and other scientific publications, more than any mathematician other than George Pólya.  Harary recorded that he lectured in 166 different cities around the United States and some 274 cities in over 80 different countries.  Harary was particularly proud that he had given lectures in cities around the world beginning with every letter of the alphabet, even including "X" when he traveled to [[Xanten]], Germany. Harary also played a curious role in the award-winning film [[Good Will Hunting]]. The film displayed formulas he had published on the enumeration of trees, which were supposed to be fiendishly difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Queena N. Lee-Chua (October 13, 2001) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20011013&amp;id=H6hjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hiUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2902,20087044&amp;hl=en The Father of Modern Graph Theory], [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], link from [[Google News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in 1986 at the age of 65 that Harary retired from his professorship at the University of Michigan.  Harary did not take his retirement lightly however, following his retirement Harary was appointed as a ''Distinguished Professor of Computer Sciences'' at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.  He held this position until his death in 2005.  The same year as his retirement Harary was made an honorary fellow of the National Academy of Sciences of India, he also served as an editor for about 20 different journals focusing primarily on graph theory and combinatorial theory.  It was following his retirement that Harary was elected as an honorary lifetime member of the [[Calcutta Mathematical Society]] and of the South African Mathematical Society.

He died at [[Memorial Medical Center (Las Cruces)|Memorial Medical Center]] in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in Las Cruces other members of the department of Computer Science felt the loss for the great mind that once worked beside them.  The head of the department of Computer Science at the time of Harary's death Desh Ranjan had this to say, "Dr. Harary was a true scholar with a genuine love for graph theory which was an endless source of new discoveries, beauty, curiosity, surprises and joy for him till the very end of his life."

==Mathematics==
Harary's work in graph theory was diverse.  Some topics of great interest to him were:

* [[Graph enumeration]], that is, counting graphs of a specified kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* [[Signed graph]]s.  Harary invented this branch of graph theory,&lt;ref&gt;Harary, F. (1953-54) "On the notion of balance of a signed graph", [[Michigan Mathematical Journal]] 2: 143-146 and addendum preceding p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

* Applications of graph theory in numerous areas, especially to social science such as [[balance theory]] and the theory of [[tournament (graph theory)|tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Among over 700 scholarly articles Harary wrote, two were co-authored with [[Paul Erdős]], giving Harary an Erdős number of 1.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of people by Erdős number]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He lectured extensively and kept alphabetical lists of the cities where he spoke.

Harary's most famous classic book ''Graph Theory'' was published in 1969 and offered a practical introduction to the field of graph theory.  It is evident that Harary's focus in this book and amongst his other publications was towards the varied and diverse application of graph theory to other fields of mathematics, physics and many others.  Taken from the preface of ''Graph Theory,'' Harary notes ...

"''...there are applications of graph theory to some areas of physics, chemistry, communication science, computer technology, electrical and civil engineering, architecture, operational research, genetics, psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, and linguistics.''"&lt;ref&gt;Frank Harary (1969) ''Graph Theory'', [[Addison–Wesley]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harary quickly began promoting inquiry based learning through his texts, apparent by his reference to the tradition of the [[Moore method]].  Harary made many unique contributions to graph theory as he explored more and more different fields of study and successfully attempted to relate them to graph theory.  Harary's classic book ''Graph Theory'' begins by providing the reader with much of the requisite knowledge of basic graphs and then dives right into proving the diversity of content that is held within graph theory.  Some of the other mathematical fields that Harary directly relates to graph theory in his book begin to appear around chapter 13, these topics include [[linear algebra]], and [[abstract algebra]].

==Tree square root==
One motivation for the study of graph theory is its application to [[sociogram]]s described by [[Jacob L. Moreno]]. For instance the [[adjacency matrix]] of a sociogram was used by Leon Festinger.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1949) "The analysis of sociograms using matrix algebra", ''Human Relations'' 2: 152–8&lt;/ref&gt; Festinger identified the graph theory [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] with the social [[clique]] and examined the diagonal of the cube of a groups’ adjacency matrix to detect cliques. Harary joined with Ian Ross to improve on Festinger's clique detection.&lt;ref&gt;F. Harary &amp; Ian Ross (1957) "A procedure for clique detection using the group matrix", ''Sociometry'' 20: 205–15 {{mr|id=0110590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The admission of powers of an adjacency matrix led Harary and Ross to note that a [[complete graph]] can be obtained from the square of an adjacency matrix of a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. Relying on their study of clique detection, they described a class of graphs for which the adjacency matrix is the square of the adjacency matrix of a tree.&lt;ref&gt;F. Harary &amp; Ian Ross (1960) ) The square of a tree, [[Bell System Technical Journal]] 39(3):641 to 47 {{mr|id=0115937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* If a graph G is the square of a tree, then it has a unique tree square root
* Some vocabulary necessary to understand this proof and the methods used here are provided in Harary's ''The Square of a Tree'': (Cliqual, unicliqual, multicliqual, cocliqual, neighborhood, neighborly, cut point, block)
*How to determine if some graph G is ''the square of a tree''.
::Iff a graph G is complete or satisfies the following 5 properties then G = T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:: (i) Every point of G is neighborly and G is connected.
:: (ii) If two cliques meet at only one point b, then there is a third clique with which they share b and exactly one other point.
:: (iii) There is a 1-1 correspondence between the cliques and the multicliqual points b of G such that clique C(b) corresponding to b contains exactly as many multicliqual points as the number of cliques which include b.
:: (iv) No two cliques intersect in more than two points.
:: (v) The number of pairs of cliques that meet in two points is one less than the number of cliques.

* Algorithm for finding the tree square root of a graph G.
::Step 1: Find all the cliques of G.
::Step 2: Let the cliques of G be C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, and consider a collection of multicliqual points  b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to these cliques in accordance with condition iii.  The elements of this collection are the nonendpoints of T.  Find all of the pairwise intersections of the n cliques and form the graph S by joining the points b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; by a line if and only if the corresponding cliques C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; intersect in two points.  S is then a tree by condition v.
::Step 3: For each clique C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of G, let n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of unicliqual points.  To the tree S obtained in step 2, attach n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; endpoints to b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, obtaining the tree T which we sought.

Once we have the tree in question we can create an adjacency matrix for the tree T and check that it is indeed to correct tree which we sought.  Squaring the adjacency matrix of T should yield an adjacency matrix for a graph which is isomorphic to the graph G which we started with.  Probably the simplest way to observe this theorem in action is to observe the case which Harary mentions in ''The Square of a Tree.'' Specifically the example in question describes the tree corresponding the graph of K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

"''Consider the tree consisting of one point joined with all the others.  When the tree is squared, the result is the complete graph.  We wish to illustrate... T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''"

Upon squaring of the adjacency matrix of the previously mentioned tree, we can observe that this theorem does in fact hold true.  We can also observe that this pattern of setting up a tree where "one point joined with all the others" will always indeed yield the correct tree for all complete graphs.

'''Generative systems''' are technologies with the overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zittrain|first=Jonathan |last2= |first2= |date= May 2006|title=The Generative Internet |jstor= 4093608 |journal= Harvard Law Review|publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When generative systems provide a common platform, changes may occur at varying layers (physical, network, application, content) and provide a means through which different firms and individuals may cooperate indirectly and contribute to innovation.&lt;ref name="TeiglandPower2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Teigland|author2=Dominic Power|title=The Immersive Internet: Reflections on the Entangling of the Virtual with Society, Politics and the Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5mx4Ei2cHwC&amp;pg=PA204|date=25 March 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28302-3|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the rules, the patterns can be extremely varied and unpredictable.  One of the more well-known examples is [[Conway's Game of Life]], a [[cellular automaton]]. Another example is [[Boids]]. More examples can be found in [[generative music]], [[generative art]], and, more recently, in video games such as [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">'''Geraldine Claudette Darden''' (born July 22, 1936) is an  American mathematician. She was the fourteenth African American woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Black Women in Mathematics|url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/wohist.html|publisher=Mathematics Department of The State University of New York at Buffalo|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in [[Nansemond County, Virginia]].  Darden earned her degrees in mathematics from [[Hampton Institute]] (B.S., 1957) an historically black institute; an M.S. (1960) [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], and her M.S. (1965) and a Ph.D. (1967) from [[Syracuse University]]. Her dissertation was completed under the auspices of James Reid, Ph.D., entitled, "On the Direct Sums of Cyclic Groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Wini Mary Edwina|title=Hearts and Minds: Black Women Scientists in the United States, 1900 to 1960|year=1997|publisher=Indiana University|pages=379–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Darden taught at S.H. Clarke Junior High School in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], immediately after receiving her undergraduate degree in 1957. In the summer of 1958, Darden saw an opportunity for aspiring mathematicians created by the launch of Russian satellite [[Sputnik]] and ensuing US interest in mathematics and science a year earlier, and she applied for and received a [[National Science Foundation]] grant to attend the Summer Institute in Mathematics held at [[North Carolina Central University]]. Here she met [[Marjorie Lee Browne]], the mathematician who directed the Institute, who would encourage Darden to go on to graduate school at Syracuse.

In addition to teaching, Darden also co-wrote selected papers on pre-calculus, with textbook author [[Tom Apostol]], Gulbank D. Chakerian, and John D. Neff.

==Early life==

He was born in [[Cambridge]] the son of Henty Baker, a butler, and Sarah Ann Britham.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

He was educated at [[The Perse School]] before winning a scholarship to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in October 1884. Baker graduated as [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1887, bracketed with 3 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BKR883HF|name=Baker, Henry Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Baker was elected Fellow of St John's in 1888 where he remained for 68 years.

In June, 1898 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27baker%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he gave the presidential address to the [[London Mathematical Society]].

In January 1914 he was appointed [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean Professor of Astronomy]].

[[Gordon Welchman]] recalled that in the 1930s before the war [[Dennis Babbage]] and he were members of a group of geometers known as Professor Baker’s "Tea Party", who met once a week to discuss the areas of research in which we were all interested''. .&lt;ref&gt;''The Hut Six Story: Breaking the Enigma Codes'' by Gordon Welchman (1982, Allen Lane, London) pp 35, 85, 126  {{ISBN|0 7139 1294 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married twice. Firstly in 1893 to Lilly Isabella Hamfield Klopp, who died in 1903, then he remarried in 1913, to Muriel Irene Woodyard.

He died in Cambridge and is buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]], with his second wife Muriel (1885 - 1956).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3692">In [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], a branch of mathematics, '''Hilbert's inequality''' states that

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\sum_{r\neq s}\dfrac{u_{r}\overline{u_{s}}}{r-s}\right|\le\pi\displaystyle\sum_{r}|u_{r}|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

for any sequence ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... of complex numbers. It was first demonstrated by [[David Hilbert]] with the constant 2{{pi}} instead of {{pi}}; the sharp constant was found by [[Issai Schur]]. It implies that the [[Hilbert transform#Discrete Hilbert transform|discrete Hilbert transform]] is a bounded operator in ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Formulation==

Let (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of complex numbers. If the sequence is infinite, assume that it is square-summable:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_m |u_m|^2 &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;

Hilbert's inequality (see {{harvtxt|Steele|2004}}) asserts that

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\sum_{r\neq s}\dfrac{u_{r}\overline{u_{s}}}{r-s}\right|\le\pi\displaystyle\sum_{r}|u_{r}|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==

In 1973, [[#MV|Montgomery &amp; Vaughan]] reported several generalizations of Hilbert's inequality, considering the bilinear forms

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{r\neq s}u_r\overline u_s\csc\pi(x_r-x_s) &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{r\neq s}\dfrac{u_r\overline u_s}{\lambda_r-\lambda_s},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct real numbers modulo&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. they belong to distinct classes in the [[quotient group]] '''R'''/'''Z''') and ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct real numbers. [[#MV|Montgomery &amp; Vaughan]]'s generalizations of Hilbert's inequality are then given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\sum_{r\neq s} u_r \overline{u_s}\csc\pi(x_r-x_s)\right|\le\delta^{-1}\sum_r |u_r|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\sum_{r\neq s}\dfrac{u_r\overline{u_s}}{\lambda_r-\lambda_s}\right|\le\pi\tau^{-1} \sum_r |u_r|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\delta={\min_{r,s}}{}_{+}\|x_{r}-x_{s}\|, \quad \tau=\min_{r,s}{}_{+}\|\lambda_r-\lambda_s\|, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\|s\|= \min_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}|s-m|&lt;/math&gt;

is the distance from ''s'' to the nearest integer, and min&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the smallest positive value. Moreover, if

:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;\delta_r \le {\min_s}{}_{+}\|x_r-x_s\| \quad \text{and} \quad 0&lt;\tau_{r}\le {\min_{s}}{}_{+}\|\lambda_r-\lambda_s\|,&lt;/math&gt;

then the following inequalities hold:

: &lt;math&gt;
\left|\sum_{r\neq s} u_r\overline{u_s}\csc\pi(x_r-x_s)\right|\le\dfrac{3}{2} \sum_r |u_r|^2 \delta_r^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\left|\sum_{r\neq s}\dfrac{u_r \overline{u_s}}{\lambda_r-\lambda_s}\right|\le \dfrac{3}{2} \pi \sum_r |u_r|^2\tau_r^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8344">In [[mathematics]], '''Hilbert's program''', formulated by [[Germans|German]] mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in the early part of the 20th century, was a proposed solution to the [[foundational crisis of mathematics]], when early attempts to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]] were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies. As a solution, Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of [[axiom]]s, and provide a proof that these axioms were [[consistent]]. Hilbert proposed that the consistency of more complicated systems, such as [[real analysis]], could be proven in terms of simpler systems. Ultimately, the consistency of all of mathematics could be reduced to basic [[arithmetic]].

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], published in 1931, showed that Hilbert's program was unattainable for key areas of mathematics. In his first theorem, Gödel showed that any consistent system with a computable set of axioms which is capable of expressing arithmetic can never be complete: it is possible to construct a statement that can be shown to be true, but that cannot be derived from the formal rules of the system. In his second theorem, he showed that such a system could not prove its own consistency, so it certainly cannot be used to prove the consistency of anything stronger with certainty. This refuted Hilbert's assumption that a finitistic system could be used to prove the consistency of itself, and therefore anything else.

==Statement of Hilbert's program==
The main goal of Hilbert's program was to provide secure foundations for all mathematics. In particular this should include:
*A formulation of all mathematics; in other words all mathematical statements should be written in a precise formal language, and manipulated according to well defined rules.
*Completeness: a proof that all true mathematical statements can be proved in the formalism.
*Consistency: a proof that no contradiction can be obtained in the formalism of mathematics. This consistency proof should preferably use only "finitistic" reasoning about finite mathematical objects.
*Conservation: a proof that any result about "real objects" obtained using reasoning about "ideal objects" (such as uncountable sets) can be proved without using ideal objects.
*Decidability: there should be an algorithm for deciding the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement.

==Gödel's incompleteness theorems==

{{Main|Gödel's incompleteness theorems}}

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that most of the goals of Hilbert's program were impossible to achieve, at least if interpreted in the most obvious way. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem shows that any consistent theory powerful enough to encode addition and multiplication of integers cannot prove its own consistency. This presents a challenge to Hilbert's program:

*It is not possible to formalize '''all''' mathematical true statements within a formal system, as any attempt at such a formalism will omit some true mathematical statements. There is no complete, consistent extension of even [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]] based on a recursively enumerable set of axioms.
*A theory such as Peano arithmetic cannot even prove its own consistency, so a restricted "finitistic" subset of it certainly cannot prove the consistency of more powerful theories such as set theory.
*There is no algorithm to decide the truth (or provability) of statements in any consistent extension of Peano arithmetic. Strictly speaking, this negative solution to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] appeared a few years after Gödel's theorem, because at the time the notion of an algorithm had not been precisely defined.

==Hilbert's program after Gödel==
Many current lines of research in [[mathematical logic]], such as [[proof theory]] and [[reverse mathematics]], can be viewed as natural continuations of Hilbert's original program.  Much of it can be salvaged by changing its goals slightly (Zach 2005), and with the following modifications some of it was successfully completed:
*Although it is not possible to formalize '''all''' mathematics, it is possible to formalize essentially all the mathematics that anyone uses. In particular [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], combined with [[first-order logic]], gives a satisfactory and generally accepted formalism for almost all current mathematics.
*Although it is not possible to prove completeness for systems at least as powerful as Peano arithmetic (at least if they have a computable set of axioms), it is possible to prove forms of completeness for many other interesting systems. The first big success was by Gödel himself (before he proved the incompleteness theorems) who proved the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness theorem]] for [[first-order logic]], showing that any [[logical consequence]] of a series of axioms is provable. An example of a non-trivial theory for which completeness has been proved is the theory of algebraically closed fields of given characteristic.
*The question of whether there are finitary consistency proofs of strong theories is difficult to answer, mainly because there is no generally accepted definition of a "finitary proof". Most mathematicians in proof theory seem to regard finitary mathematics as being contained in Peano arithmetic, and in this case it is not possible to give finitary proofs of reasonably strong theories. On the other hand, Gödel himself suggested the possibility of giving finitary consistency proofs using finitary methods that cannot be formalized in Peano arithmetic, so he seems to have had a more liberal view of what finitary methods might be allowed. A few years later, [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gentzen]] gave a [[Gentzen's consistency proof|consistency proof]] for Peano arithmetic. The only part of this proof that was not clearly finitary was a certain [[transfinite induction]] up to the [[ordinal number|ordinal]] ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If this transfinite induction is accepted as a finitary method, then one can assert that there is a finitary proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic. More powerful subsets of second order arithmetic have been given consistency proofs by [[Gaisi Takeuti]] and others, and one can again debate about exactly how finitary or constructive these proofs are. (The theories that have been proved consistent by these methods are quite strong, and include most "ordinary" mathematics.)
*Although there is no algorithm for deciding the truth of statements in Peano arithmetic, there are many interesting and non-trivial theories for which such algorithms have been found. For example, Tarski found an algorithm that can decide the truth of any statement in [[analytic geometry]] (more precisely, he proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable). Given the [[Cantor–Dedekind axiom]], this algorithm can be regarded as an algorithm to decide the truth of any statement in [[Euclidean geometry]]. This is substantial as few people would consider Euclidean geometry a trivial theory.

In [[mathematics]], an '''implicit equation''' is a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]  of the form &lt;math&gt;R(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of several variables (often a [[polynomial]]). For example, the implicit equation of the [[unit circle]] is &lt;math&gt; x^2 +y^2-1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

An '''implicit function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is defined implicitly by an implicit equation, by associating one of the variables (the [[value (mathematics)|value]]) with the others (the [[argument of a function|argument]]s).&lt;ref name=Chiang&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiang |first=Alpha C. |authorlink=Alpha Chiang |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Third |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gcoAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|204–206}} Thus, an implicit function for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the context of the [[unit circle]] is defined implicitly by &lt;math&gt; x^2 +f(x)^2-1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This implicit equation defines &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;-1 \leq x \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and one considers only non-negative (or non-positive) values for the values of the function.

The [[implicit function theorem]] provides conditions under which some kinds of relations define an implicit function, namely relations defined as the [[indicator function]] of the [[zero set]] of some [[continuously differentiable]] [[Multivariable calculus|multivariate]] function.

==Examples==

===Inverse functions===
A common type of implicit function is an [[inverse function]]. If  ''g'' is a function of ''x'', then the inverse function of ''g'', called ''g'' &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, is the function giving a solution of the equation

:&lt;math&gt; y=g(x) &lt;/math&gt;

for ''x'' in terms of ''y''. This solution is

:&lt;math&gt; x = g^{-1}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an implicit function, and more specifically an inverse function. While for some functions ''g'', &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; could be written out explicitly — for instance, if &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 2x, &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}(y)=\tfrac{1}{2}y&lt;/math&gt; — this is often not the case (as in the product log example below).

Intuitively, an inverse function is obtained from ''g'' by interchanging the roles of the dependent and independent variables. Stated another way, the inverse function gives the implicit solution for  ''x'' of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;R(x,y) = y-g(x) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example'''

The [[product log]] is an implicit function giving the solution for ''x'' of the equation ''y'' − ''xe''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===Algebraic functions===
{{main|Algebraic function}}
An '''algebraic function''' is a function that satisfies a polynomial equation whose coefficients are themselves polynomials. For example, an algebraic function in one variable ''x'' gives a solution for ''y'' of an equation

:&lt;math&gt;a_n(x)y^n+a_{n-1}(x)y^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') are polynomial functions of ''x''. This algebraic function can be written as the right side of the solution equation ''y'' = ''f'' (''x''). Written like this, ''f'' is a [[multi-valued function|multi-valued]] implicit function.

Algebraic functions play an important role in [[mathematical analysis]] and [[algebraic geometry]].  A simple example of an algebraic function is given by the left side of the unit circle equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2-1=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''y'' gives an explicit solution:

:&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

But even without specifying this explicit solution, it is possible to refer to the implicit solution of the unit circle equation as  &lt;math&gt;y= f (x),&lt;/math&gt; where ''f'' is the multi-valued implicit function.

While explicit solutions can be found for equations that are [[quadratic equations|quadratic]], [[cubic equation|cubic]], and [[quartic equation|quartic]] in ''y'', the same is not in general true for [[quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations, such as

:&lt;math&gt; y^5 + 2y^4 -7y^3 + 3y^2 -6y - x = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Nevertheless, one can still refer to the implicit solution ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') involving the multi-valued implicit function ''f''.

==Caveats==
Not every equation ''R''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 implies a graph of a single-valued function, the circle equation being one prominent example. Another example is an implicit function given by  ''x'' − ''C''(''y'') = 0 where ''C'' is a [[cubic polynomial]] having a "hump" in its graph. Thus, for an implicit function to be a  ''true'' (single-valued) function it might be necessary to use just part of the graph. An implicit function can sometimes be successfully defined as a true function only after "zooming in" on some part of the  ''x''-axis and "cutting away" some unwanted function branches. Then an equation expressing  ''y'' as an implicit function of the other variable(s) can be written.

The defining equation ''R''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 can also have other pathologies. For example, the equation  ''x'' = 0 does not imply a function ''f''(''x'') giving solutions for ''y'' at all; it is a vertical line.  In order to avoid a problem like this, various constraints are frequently imposed on the allowable sorts of equations or on the [[function domain|domain]]. The [[implicit function theorem]] provides a uniform way of handling these sorts of pathologies.

==Implicit differentiation==
In [[calculus]], a method called '''implicit differentiation''' makes use of the [[chain rule]] to differentiate implicitly defined functions.

To differentiate an implicit function ''y''(''x''), defined by an equation  ''R''(''x'', ''y'') = 0, it is not generally possible to solve it explicitly for ''y'' and then differentiate. Instead, one can [[total differentiation|totally differentiate]]  ''R''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' and then solve the resulting linear equation for ''dy'' /''dx'' to explicitly get the derivative in terms of ''x'' and ''y''. Even when it is possible to explicitly solve the original equation, the formula resulting from total differentiation is, in general, much simpler and easier to use.

===Examples===
'''1.'''  Consider for example

:&lt;math&gt;y + x + 5 = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is easy to solve for ''y'', giving

:&lt;math&gt;y = -x - 5 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the right side is the explicit form of the function ''y''(''x''). Differentiation then gives ''dy''/''dx'' = −1. Alternatively, one can totally differentiate the original equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{dx}{dx} + \frac{d}{dx}(5) = 0;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''dy''/''dx'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = -1,&lt;/math&gt;

the same answer as obtained previously.

'''2.'''  An example of an implicit function for which implicit differentiation is easier than using explicit differentiation is the function  ''y''(''x'') defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt; x^4 + 2y^2 = 8 .&lt;/math&gt;

To differentiate this explicitly with respect to ''x'', one has first to get

:&lt;math&gt;y(x) =  \pm\sqrt{\frac{8 - x^4}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

and then differentiate this function. This creates two derivatives: one for ''y'' ≥ 0 and another for ''y'' &lt; 0.

It is substantially easier to implicitly differentiate the original equation:

:&lt;math&gt;4x^3 + 4y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-4x^3}{4y} = \frac{-x^3}{y}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''3.'''  Often, it is difficult or impossible to solve explicitly for ''y'', and implicit differentiation is the only feasible method of differentiation. An example is the equation

:&lt;math&gt;y^5-y=x.&lt;/math&gt;

It is impossible to [[algebraic expression|algebraically express]] ''y'' explicitly as a function of ''x'', and  therefore one cannot find ''dy'' /''dx'' by explicit differentiation. Using the implicit method, ''dy'' /''dx'' can be obtained by differentiating the equation to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;5y^4\frac{dy}{dx} - \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dx}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''dx'' /''dx'' = 1. Factoring out ''dy'' /''dx'' shows that

:&lt;math&gt;(5y^4 - 1)\frac{dy}{dx} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

which yields the result

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{5y^{4}-1},&lt;/math&gt;

which is defined for &lt;math&gt;y \ne \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{5}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \ne \pm i\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{5}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===General formula for derivative of implicit function===
If &lt;math&gt;R(x,y)=0,&lt;/math&gt; the derivative of the implicit function ''y''(''x'') is given by&lt;ref name="Stewart1998"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Stewart
  | first = James
  | title = Calculus Concepts And Contexts

  | isbn = 0-534-34330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§ 11.5}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial R/ \partial x}{\partial R / \partial y} = -\frac {R_x}{R_y},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' indicate the [[partial derivative]]s of ''R'' with respect to ''x'' and ''y''.

The above formula comes from using the [[Chain rule#Chain rule for several variables|generalized chain rule]] to obtain the [[total derivative]]—with respect to ''x''—of both sides of ''R''(''x'', ''y'') = 0:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dx} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial R}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} =0,&lt;/math&gt;

which, when solved for ''dy''/''dx'', gives the expression above.

==Implicit function theorem==
{{main|Implicit function theorem}}
[[Image:Implicit circle.svg|thumb|right|200px|The unit circle can be defined implicitly as the set of points {{math|(''x,y'')}} satisfying &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2=1&lt;/math&gt;. Around point {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|y}} can be expressed as an implicit function {{math|''y''(''x'')}}. (Unlike in many cases, here this function can be made explicit as &lt;math&gt;g_1(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.) No such function exists around point {{mvar|B}}, where the [[tangent space]] is vertical.]]

It can be shown that if {{math|''R''(''x'', ''y'')}} is given by a [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[submanifold]] {{mvar|M}} in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is a point of this submanifold such that the [[tangent space]] there is not vertical  (that is, {{math| ∂''R''/∂''y'' ≠ 0}}), then {{mvar|M}} in some small enough [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is given by a [[parametrization]] {{math|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}} where {{math|''f''}} is a [[smooth function]].

In less technical language, implicit functions exist and can be differentiated, unless the tangent to the supposed graph would be vertical. In the standard case where we are given an equation
:&lt;math&gt;R(x,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
the condition on {{math|''R''}} can be checked by means of [[partial derivative]]s.&lt;ref name="Stewart1998"/&gt;{{rp|§ 11.5}}

==In algebraic geometry==
Consider a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] of the form ''R''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, where ''R'' is a multivariable polynomial. The set of the values of the variables that satisfy this relation is called an [[implicit curve]] if ''n'' = 2 and an '''implicit surface''' if ''n''=3. The implicit equations are the basis of [[algebraic geometry]], whose basic subjects of study are the simultaneous solutions of several implicit equations whose left-hand sides are polynomials. These sets of simultaneous solutions are called [[affine algebraic set]]s.

==In differential equations==
The solutions of differential equations generally appear expressed by an implicit function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Wilfred |title=Advanced Calculus |location=Boston |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2003 |isbn=0-201-79937-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in economics==

===Marginal rate of substitution===

In [[economics]], when the level set ''R''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 is an [[indifference curve]] for the quantities ''x'' and ''y'' consumed of two goods, the absolute value of the implicit derivative d''y''/d''x'' is interpreted as the [[marginal rate of substitution]] of the two goods: how much more of ''y'' one must receive in order to be indifferent to a loss of one unit of&amp;nbsp;''x''.

===Marginal rate of technical substitution===

Similarly, sometimes the level set ''R''(''L'', ''K'') is an [[isoquant]] showing various combinations of utilized quantities ''L'' of labor and ''K'' of [[physical capital]] each of which would result in the production of the same given quantity of output of some good. In this case the absolute value of the implicit derivative d''K''/d''L'' is interpreted as the [[marginal rate of technical substitution]] between the two factors of production: how much more capital the firm must use to produce the same amount of output with one less unit of labor.

===Optimization===
{{Main|Mathematical economics#Mathematical optimization}}

Often in [[economic theory]], some function such as a [[utility function]] or a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] function is to be maximized with respect to a choice vector ''x'' even though the objective function has not been restricted to any specific functional form. The [[implicit function theorem]] guarantees that the [[first-order condition]]s of the optimization define an implicit function for each element of the optimal vector ''x*'' of the choice vector ''x''. When profit is being maximized, typically the resulting implicit functions are the [[labor demand]] function and the [[supply function]]s of various goods. When utility is being maximized, typically the resulting implicit functions are the [[labor supply]] function and the [[demand function]]s for various goods.

Moreover, the influence of the problem's [[Parameter#Mathematical functions|parameters]] on ''x*''—the partial derivatives of the implicit function—can be expressed as [[total derivative]]s of the system of first-order conditions found using [[Differential of a function#Differentials in several variables|total differentiation]].

After serving as an instructor and post doctoral fellow at [[Yale University|Yale]] and also holding a membership at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey]], Sgro returned to school to study neurology, and received his M.D. in 1980 from the Ph.D to M.D. Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d296da |title=Perspective: PhD Scientists Completing Medical School in Two Years: Looking at the Miami PhD-to-MD Program Alumni Twenty Years Later |year=2010 |last1=Koniaris |first1=Leonidas G. |last2=Cheung |first2=Michael C. |last3=Garrison |first3=Gwen |last4=Awad Jr |first4=William M. |last5=Zimmers |first5=Teresa A. |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=687–91 |pmid=20354390}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine]] at the [[University of Miami]], followed by an internal medicine internship at [[UNC Health Care|UNC Memorial Hospital]], residency in [[neurology]], a fellowship, and faculty position in [[clinical neurophysiology]] at the [[Neurological Institute of New York]].

As an outgrowth of his work in neurophysiology, while still working as a post-doctoral fellow and an assistant professor of neurology, Sgro founded [http://www.alacron.com Alacron, Inc.]    (formerly Corteks, Inc.until 1990) in 1985 to manufacture technologies relevant to his neurological research.  In 1989 he commercialized this technology and began developing [[array processor]]s, frame grabbers, vision processors, and most recently supported advances in [[Backside illumination|BSI]] sensor technology.  Extending his work in machine vision technology, in 2002, Sgro founded [http://www.fast-vision.com FastVision, LLC], a maker of [[smart camera]]s, as a subsidiary of Alacron, Inc .

==Mathematical research==

During his first year as a PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin, Sgro proved that a [[topological]] extension of [[first-order logic]] using the [[open set]] logic [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] has [[completeness (logic)|logical completeness]], which had previously been widely believed but had not been proven. Sgro’s proof drew attention throughout mathematical world, and, in 1974, a year before finishing his PhD, he was awarded an appointment as a Josiah Willard Gibbs Instructor in Mathematics at Yale University, received an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] research grant to continue his work in topological model theory.&lt;ref&gt;"Topological Model Theory," [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=7704131 National Science Foundation, Division of Mathematical Sciences, award number 77-04131], 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  Yale allowed him to accept this honor while remotely completing his thesis and dissertation at Wisconsin, which he did in 1975.  His conclusions regarding the topological model theory formed the basis of his PhD thesis and dissertation. During the 1976-1977 academic year Sgro received a Centennial Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;Centennial Fellowship [http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/committees/centfellow-charge.pdf Overview and Roster]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]].  His work also resulted in an invitation to speak at the Logica Colloquim ’77 European Meeting of the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]].  This event was held in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]], which was then still part of the [[Eastern Bloc]], making Sgro among the first mathematicians from the West to speak at an event “behind the Iron Curtain.”&lt;ref&gt;Logic Colloquium ’77, Wroclaw, Poland.

Published in 1977, Sgro’s thesis “Completeness Theorems for Topological Models”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000348437790016X | doi=10.1016/0003-4843(77)90016-X | volume=11 | title=Completeness theorems for topological models | journal=Annals of Mathematical Logic | pages=173–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extensions of this research including the [[axiomatization]] and completeness of [[continuous function]]s on [[product topology]] open set quantifiers was published in 1976 in the [[Israel Journal of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02757004|title=Completeness theorems for continuous functions and product topologies|first=Joseph|last=Sgro|date=1 September 1976|publisher=|journal=Israel Journal of Mathematics|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=249–272|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF02757004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these results, Sgro published a proof that an extension of the open set quantifier logic using [[interior operator]] quantifier logic has completeness and satisfies [[Craig interpolation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1980-258-01/S0002-9947-1980-0554321-4/S0002-9947-1980-0554321-4.pdf|title=The interior operator logic and product topologies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He further showed that the Souslin-Kleene closure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003484374900163|title=Axioms for abstract model theory|first=K.|last=Jon Barwise|date=1 December 1974|publisher=|journal=Annals of Mathematical Logic|volume=7|issue=2|pages=221–265|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/0003-4843(74)90016-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the open set quantifier logic fails Craig Interpolation which implies that it is strictly weaker than the interior operator logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1980-078-04/S0002-9939-1980-0556634-4/S0002-9939-1980-0556634-4.pdf|title=Interpolation fails for the Souslin-Kleene closure of the open-set quantifier logic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later research concentrated on proving the existence of maximal extensions of first order logic which satisfy [[Łoś's theorem]] on [[ultraproduct]]s and have the Souslin-Kleene property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1977-063-02/S0002-9939-1977-0491143-2/S0002-9939-1977-0491143-2.pdf|title=Maximal Logics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also this was extended to ultraproduct extensions of first order logic which satisfied both the Łoś's theorem and an extended form of the [[compactness theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1980-079-04/S0002-9939-1980-0572318-0/S0002-9939-1980-0572318-0.pdf|title=Ultraproduct invariant logic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological research==

While researching mathematical logic, Sgro became interested in investigating the logic systems that the brain uses to process motor and sensory information, and returned to school, intending to study clinical neurophysiology, the branch of [[neurology]] and [[physiology]] that examines the functioning of the peripheral and central [[nervous system]]. Neurophysiological research typically uses imaging tools for visualizing chemical and electrical activity in nerve pathways, and today includes [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[evoked potentials]] (EPs), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] and other technologies to visualize and evaluate brain activity.

After Sgro completed his [[internship]] in [[internal medicine]] at the [[University of North Carolina]] in 1981 and his [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in neurology at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]] in 1984. Sgro served as a [[post-doctoral fellow]] in clinical neurophysiology (1983–1985), as an Associate in Neurology (1985–1986) and then as an [[Assistant Professor]] of Neurology (1986–1987) at The [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]].  Sgro relocated to [[Richmond, Virginia]] where he was an [[Associate Professor]] of Neurology and the Head of Neurophysiology (1987–1991) and finally, as Chief of the Division of Clinical Neurophysiology (1991–1994) at the [[VCU Medical Center|Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center]].  He was also appointed as an adjunct associate professor of Neurology at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]] in 1994.

During his post-doctoral fellowship at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]], Sgro achieved recognition in the medical community for his research and findings on the theory of [[evoked potentials]], with a particular focus on [[Somatosensory Evoked Potential]]s (SSEPs).  A summary of Sgro's efforts to improve evoked potential recording recording technology is found in Keith Chiappa's book.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sgro, J. A., R. G. Emerson, and P. C. Stanton. "Advanced techniques of evoked potential acquisition and processing."''Evoked Potentials in Clinical Medicine. 3rd ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott-Raven'' (1997): 579-600. {{ISBN|978-0397516599}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article covers many [[one dimensional|one]] and [[two dimensional]], [[linear]] and [[non-linear]]  [[digital filter]]s.  Two approaches to improve recording fidelity is by increasing the [[signal to noise ratio]]  (SNR) by the reduction of coherent [[electrical]] [[noise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013469485910211 | doi=10.1016/0013-4694(85)91021-1 | volume=60 | title=Phase synchronized triggering: A method for coherent noise elimination in evoked potential recording | journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | pages=464–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and second the development of a two dimensional [[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] digital filtering of evoked potentials which trades off the SNR improvement of the [[moving average]] technique with the detection of changes in the averaged [[waveform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168559785900462 | doi=10.1016/0168-5597(85)90046-2 | volume=62 | title=Real-time reconstruction of evoked potentials using a new two-dimensional filter method | journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Evoked Potentials Section | pages=372–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this technology, Sgro proved that SSEPs were “state dependent,” varying depending on whether the patient was [[awake]] or [[asleep]] ([[anesthetized]]).&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092012119390095O | doi=10.1016/0920-1211(93)90095-O | volume=15 | title=Conventional and rapid stimulation evoked potential changes in patients with status epilepticus | journal=Epilepsy Research | pages=149–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following these findings with funding from the [[Whitaker Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Development of Methods for the Analysis of Non-Time-Stable Brain Responses.'' Whitaker Foundation grant, 1985-1989&lt;/ref&gt; Sgro developed technology and techniques to analyze evoked potentials based on stimulation run by an ultra fast (i.e. hundreds of [[hertz]]) [[pseudorandom m-sequence]]s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jens Hee |url=http://jenshee.dk/signalprocessing/mls.pdf |title=Impulse response measurements using MLS |website=jenshee.dk |date=August 2003 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marmarmelis, P. and Marmarmelis, V.Z., Analysis of PhysiologicalSystem, Plenum Press, New York, NY, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work was demonstrated to be a more effective method of identification and predictor of sub-clinical diseases or damage such as [[Death|mortality]] from [[status epilepticus]]&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=3901794&amp;icde=10452325&amp;ddparam=&amp;ddvalue=&amp;ddsub= "Assessment of Afferent and Efferent Neuropathways in Severe Head Injury," NIH Program Project Grant #2P01NS012587, 1989-1992.].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=3902216&amp;icde=10452325&amp;ddparam=&amp;ddvalue=&amp;ddsub=|title=Project Information - NIH RePORTER - NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results|first=metatags|last=generator|website=projectreporter.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (diseases that otherwise went undetected until they become severe enough to qualify as clinically apparent when compared to conventional evoked potentials).

While conducting research into the (afferent) [[sensory nervous system]] with evoked potentials, Sgro also began to investigate devices and techniques to determine the state of the (efferent) [[motor system|motor nervous system]] using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation|TMS]] with the goal of more effective detection of sub-clinical diseases and increased sensitivity of the motor system during intra-operative patient monitoring.

These studies resulted in the construction of a rapid high magnetic field strength device  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,061,234.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5,061,234&amp;RS=PN/5,061,234|title=United States Patent: 5061234 - Magnetic neural stimulator for neurophysiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was suitable for safety studies.  The safety of  TMS in rats with a maximal field strength of 3.4 [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]] at 8 Herz for 20 minutes or 10uC/cm2/phase was demonstrated in Sgro &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sgro | first1 = J A | last2 = Ghatak | first2 = N R | last3 = Stanton | first3 = P C | last4 = Emerson | first4 = R G | last5 = Blair | first5 = R | year = 1991 | title = Repetitive high magnetic field stimulation: the effect upon rat brain.. | url = | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 180–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a neurology researcher Sgro began work in [[biomedical engineering]] and machine vision, specifically the use of imaging and machine vision technologies, to assess the function and integrity of the [[nervous system]] in various states of [[consciousness]], during [[medical procedures]], and disease.  The research was performed initially using [[computer program]]s written in [[Fortran]] running on a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] [[minicomputer]].  In the mid 1980s the widespread adoption of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers with the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus enabled the development of [[personal computer|PC]] based [[expansion cards]] to increase the functionality of the PC. To facilitate lower cost advanced hardware development, Sgro co-founded Alacron, Inc. to develop advanced [[medical research]] equipment and commercial PC based products.

==Entrepreneurial career==

===Alacron, Inc.===

In 1985, Sgro co-founded [http://www.alacron.com Alacron, Inc.] in [[Nashua, New Hampshire]].  Sgro and the Alacron engineering team focused on the development and production of [[frame grabber]]s and high speed image processing computational subsystems.  The product family currently includes frame grabbers, software, data recording devices and supporting peripherals. Despite initial focus on neurophysiology research and medical imaging, Alacron saw uses for its products expand outside the field of medicine into other applications, such as manufacturing, military, and other industries that use robotics extensively.  Alacron is one of the largest frame grabber manufacturers in the [[Automated Imaging Association]]'s annual market data report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.machinevisiononline.org/market-data.cfm?id=100 Automated Imaging Association annual market data report overview]. Membership in AIA is required to obtain full report.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of broader machine vision uses of frame grabbers originally developed for use in medical imaging include [[American Science and Engineering|AS&amp;E]], which incorporated Alacron technology in [[backscatter X-ray]] equipment used for border security, and as image capture used for [[Voyage Data Recorder]]s, the maritime equivalent of aviation “[[Flight recorder|black box]]es.”

In addition to the commercial product lines offered by Alacron, Sgro continued to perform basic research in integrating frame grabber technology with specialized systems for various disciplines.  The company received [[Small Business Innovation Research|SBIR]] grants where Sgro acted as principal investigators, including:

===FastVision, LLC===

In 2002, Sgro launched [http://www.fast-vision.com FastVision, LLC].  FastVision builds high-speed megapixel-plus digital cameras, based on [[CMOS sensor|CMOS]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] image sensors . The company's goal is to produce [[smart camera]]s, i.e. cameras with high-speed scalable integrated [[image processing]] capabilities built into the same package housing the opto-electronics.  Like most smart camera vendors, FastVision’s suite includes [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] processing and memory subsystems to enable in-camera image processing. When integrated with a high powered frame grabber or vision processor board (or a host subsystem), the resulting system capabilities can be expanded beyond simple image compression.  The smart camera subsystem can be integrated with disk or non-volatile semiconductor storage inside or outside the camera to hold sustained real-time data acquisition, a valuable aid to system effectiveness when network connectivity is overloaded or is unavailable.

Applications for smart cameras range from security and surveillance, to robotics in medicine and manufacturing, to military applications such as bots, drones and intelligent weaponry, to satellites and inner and outer space exploration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4618">In [[computational complexity theory]], '''Karp's 21 NP-complete problems''' are a set of [[computational problem]]s which are [[NP-complete]]. In his 1972 paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", {{sfn |Karp|1972}} [[Richard Karp]] used [[Stephen Cook]]'s 1971 theorem that the [[boolean satisfiability problem]] is NP-complete{{sfn |Cook|1971}} (also called the [[Cook-Levin theorem]]) to show that there is a [[polynomial time]] [[many-one reduction]] from the boolean satisfiability problem to each of 21 [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] computational problems, thereby showing that they are all NP-complete. This was one of the first demonstrations that many natural computational problems occurring throughout [[computer science]] are [[computationally intractable]], and it drove interest in the study of NP-completeness and the [[P versus NP problem]].

== The problems ==
Karp's 21 problems are shown below, many with their original names. The nesting indicates the direction of the reductions used. For example, '''[[Knapsack problem|Knapsack]]''' was shown to be NP-complete by reducing '''[[Exact cover]]''' to '''Knapsack'''.

* '''[[Boolean satisfiability problem|Satisfiability]]''': the boolean satisfiability problem for formulas in [[conjunctive normal form]] (often referred to as SAT)
** '''[[Integer linear programming|0–1 integer programming]]''' (A variation in which only the restrictions must be satisfied, with no optimization)
** '''[[Clique problem|Clique]]''' (see also [[independent set problem]])
*** '''[[Set packing]]'''
*** '''[[Vertex cover problem|Vertex cover]]'''
**** '''[[Set cover problem|Set covering]]'''
**** '''[[Feedback vertex set|Feedback node set]]'''
**** '''[[Feedback arc set]]'''
**** '''[[Hamiltonian path problem|Directed Hamilton circuit]]''' (Karp's name, now usually called '''Directed Hamiltonian cycle''')
***** '''[[Hamiltonian path problem|Undirected Hamilton circuit]]''' (Karp's name, now usually called '''Undirected Hamiltonian cycle''')
** '''[[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|Satisfiability with at most 3 literals per clause]]''' (equivalent to 3-SAT)
*** '''[[Graph coloring|Chromatic number]]''' (also called the [[Graph coloring|Graph Coloring Problem]])
**** '''[[Clique cover]]'''
**** '''[[Exact cover]]'''
***** '''[[Hitting set]]'''
***** '''[[Steiner tree]]'''
***** '''[[3-dimensional matching]]'''
***** '''[[Knapsack problem|Knapsack]]''' (Karp's definition of Knapsack is closer to [[Subset sum]])
****** '''[[Job shop scheduling|Job sequencing]]'''
****** '''[[Partition problem|Partition]]'''
******* '''[[Maximum cut|Max cut]]'''

As time went on it was discovered that many of the problems can be solved efficiently if restricted to special cases, or can be solved within any fixed percentage of the optimal result. However, [[David Zuckerman (mathematician)|David Zuckerman]] showed in 1996 that every one of these 21 problems has a constrained optimization version that is impossible to approximate within any constant factor unless P = NP, by showing that Karp's approach to reduction generalizes to a specific type of approximability reduction.{{sfn |Zuckerman|1996}} Note however that these may be different from the standard optimization versions of the problems, which may have approximation algorithms (as in the case of maximum cut).

In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be '''locally Hausdorff''' if every point has an [[open set|open]] [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] that is a [[Hausdorff space]] under the [[subspace topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* There are locally Hausdorff spaces where a sequence has more than one limit. This can never happen for a Hausdorff space.
* The [[non-Hausdorff manifold|bug-eyed line]] is locally Hausdorff (it is in fact [[locally metrizable]]) but not Hausdorff.
* The [[etale space]] for the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of differentiable functions on a [[differential manifold]] is not Hausdorff, but it is locally Hausdorff.
* A T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space need not be locally Hausdorff; an example of this is an infinite set given the [[cofinite topology]].
* Let ''X'' be a set given the [[particular point topology]]. Then ''X'' is locally Hausdorff at precisely one point. From the last example, it will follow that a set (with more than one point) given the particular point topology is not a [[topological group]]. Note that if ''x'' is the 'particular point' of ''X'', and y is distinct from ''x'', then any set containing ''y'' that doesn't also contain ''x'' inherits the discrete topology and is therefore Hausdorff. However, no neighbourhood of ''y'' is actually Hausdorff so that the space cannot be locally Hausdorff at ''y''.
* If ''G'' is a topological group that is locally Hausdorff at ''x'' for some point ''x'' of ''G'', then ''G'' is Hausdorff. This follows from the fact that if ''y'' is a point of ''G'', there exists a homeomorphism from ''G'' to itself carrying ''x'' to ''y'', so ''G'' is locally Hausdorff at every point, and is therefore T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; topological groups are Hausdorff).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">'''Min-plus matrix multiplication''', also known as the '''distance product''', is an operation on [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

Given two &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices &lt;math&gt;A = (a_{ij})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = (b_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;, their distance product &lt;math&gt;C = (c_{ij}) = A \star B&lt;/math&gt; is defined as an &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix such that &lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = \min_{k=1}^n \{a_{ik} + b_{kj}\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is standard matrix multiplication for the semi-ring of [[Tropical geometry|tropical numbers]] in the min convention.

This operation is closely related to the [[shortest path problem]].  If &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix containing the edge weights of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], then &lt;math&gt;W^k&lt;/math&gt; gives the distances between vertices using paths of length at most &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; edges, and &lt;math&gt;W^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance matrix]] of the graph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9857">In algebra, a '''monomial ideal''' is an [[Ideal_(ring_theory)|ideal]] generated by some [[monomial|monomials]] in a multivariate [[polynomial ring]] over a [[Field_(mathematics)|field]].

A '''toric ideal''' is an ideal generated by differences of monomials (provided the ideal is a [[prime ideal]]). An affine or projective [[algebraic variety]] defined by a toric ideal or a homogeneous toric ideal is an affine or projective [[toric variety]], possibly [[normal scheme|non-normal]].

==Definitions and Properties==

Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{K} &lt;/math&gt; be a field and &lt;math&gt; R = \mathbb{K}[x] &lt;/math&gt; be the [[polynomial ring]] over &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{K} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; variables &lt;math&gt; x = x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n &lt;/math&gt;. 

A '''monomial''' in &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;, is a product &lt;math&gt; x^{\alpha} = x_1^{\alpha_1} x_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots x_n^{\alpha_n} &lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; tuple &lt;math&gt; \alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dotsc, \alpha_n) \in \mathbb{N}^n &lt;/math&gt; of nonnegative integers. An ideal &lt;math&gt; I \subseteq  \mathbb{K}[x] &lt;/math&gt; is called a '''monomial ideal''' if it is generated by [[monomials]]. 

Furthermore, an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] &lt;math&gt; I \in R &lt;/math&gt; is called a  ''monomial ideal'' whenever it satisfies any of the following three properties. 
# &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;  is generated by monomials,
# If &lt;math&gt; f = \Sigma_{\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^n} c_{\alpha} x^{\alpha} \in I &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; x^{\alpha} \in I &lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt; c_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero.
# &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is [[torus action|torus fixed]], i.e, given &lt;math&gt;(c_1, c_2, \dotsc, c_n) \in (\mathbb{K}^*)^{n} &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is fixed under the action &lt;math&gt; f(x_i) = c_ix_i &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; i&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a monomial ideal &lt;math&gt; I = (m_1, m_2, \dotsc, m_k) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; f \in \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] \in I &lt;/math&gt; if and only if every monomial ideal term &lt;math&gt; f_i &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of one the &lt;math&gt; m_j &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name=Dummit&amp;Foote&gt;{{harvnb|Dummit|Foote|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:'''
Suppose  &lt;math&gt; I = (m_1, m_2, \dotsc, m_k) &lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt; f \in \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] \in I &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; f = f_1m_1 + f_2m_2 + \dotsm + f_km_k &lt;/math&gt;, for some  &lt;math&gt; f_i \in \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;. 

For all &lt;math&gt; 1 \leqslant i \leqslant k &lt;/math&gt;, we can express each &lt;math&gt; f_i &lt;/math&gt; as the sum of monomials, so that &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; can be written as a sum of multiples of the &lt;math&gt; m_i &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; will be a sum of multiples of monomial terms for at least one of the &lt;math&gt; m_i &lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, let &lt;math&gt; I = (m_1, m_2, \dotsc, m_k) &lt;/math&gt; and let each monomial term in &lt;math&gt; f \in \mathbb{K} [x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n] &lt;/math&gt; be a multiple of one of the &lt;math&gt; m_i &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;. Then each monomial term in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; can be factored from each monomial in &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt; f = c_1m_1 + c_2m_2 + \dotsm + c_km_k &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; c_i \in \mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;, as a result &lt;math&gt; f \in I &lt;/math&gt;. 

The following illustrates an example of monomial and polynomial ideals.

Let &lt;math&gt; I = (xyz, y^2) &lt;/math&gt; then the polynomial &lt;math&gt; x^2yz + 3xy^2&lt;/math&gt; is in {{mvar|I,}} since each term is a multiple of an element in {{mvar|J,}} i.e., they can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;x^2yz = x(xyz)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3xy^2 = 3x(y^2),&lt;/math&gt; both in {{mvar|I.}} However, if &lt;math&gt; J = (xz^2, y^2) &lt;/math&gt;, then this polynomial &lt;math&gt; x^2yz + 3xy^2&lt;/math&gt; is not in {{mvar|J,}} since its terms are not multiples of elements in {{mvar|J.}}

== Monomial Ideals and Young Diagrams ==

A monomial ideal can be interpreted as a [[Young diagram]]. Suppose &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathbb{R}[x, y] &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted in terms of the minimal monomials generators as &lt;math&gt; I = (x^{a_1}y^{b_1}, x^{a_2}y^{b_2},\dotsc, x^{a_k}y^{b_k}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; a_1 &gt; a_2 &gt; \dotsm &gt; a_k \geqslant 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b_r &gt; \dotsm &gt; b_2 &gt; b_1 \geqslant 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  The minimal monomial generators of &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; can be seen as the inner corners of the Young diagram. The minimal generators would determine where we would draw the staircase diagram.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|Sturmfels|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The monomials not in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; lie inside the staircase, and these monomials form a vector space basis for the [[quotient ring]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}[x, y]/I &lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the following example. 
Let &lt;math&gt; I = (x^3, x^2y, y^3) \subset \mathbb{R}[x, y] &lt;/math&gt; be a monomial ideal. Then the set of grid points &lt;math&gt; S = {\{(0, 3), (2, 1),(0, 3)}\} \in \mathbb{N}^2 &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the minimal monomial &lt;math&gt; x^0y^3, x^2y^1, x^0y^3 &lt;/math&gt; generators in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;. Then as the figure shows, the pink Young diagram consists of the monomials that are not in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;. The points in the inner corners of the Young diagram, make us possible to identify the minimal monomials &lt;math&gt; x^0y^1, x^2y^1, x^3y^0 &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; as seen in the green boxes. Hence, &lt;math&gt; I = (y^3, x^2y, x^3) &lt;/math&gt;.

 [[File:Wikipic.png|thumb|A Young diagram and its connection with its monomial ideal.]]
In general, to any set of grid points, we can associate a Young diagram, so that the monomial ideal is constructed by determining the inner corners that make up the staircase diagram; likewise, given a monomial ideal, we can make up the Young diagram by looking at the &lt;math&gt; (a_i, b_j) &lt;/math&gt; and representing them as the inner corners of the Young diagram. The coordinates of the inner corners would represent the powers of the minimal monomials in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, monomial ideals can be described by Young diagrams of partitions.

Moreover, the [[torus action|&lt;math&gt; (\mathbb{C}^*)^2 &lt;/math&gt;-action]] on the set of  &lt;math&gt; I \subset \mathbb{C}[x, y]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \mathbb{C}[x, y]/I = n &lt;/math&gt; as a [[vector space]] over &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; has fixed points corresponding to monomial ideals only, which correspond to [[Partition (number theory)|partitions]] of size &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;, which are identify by Young diagrams with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; boxes.

==Monomial Ordering and Gröbner Basis==
A '''monomial ordering''' is a well ordering "&lt;math&gt; \geqslant &lt;/math&gt;" on the set of monomials such that if &lt;math&gt; a, m_1, m_2 &lt;/math&gt; are monomials, then &lt;math&gt; am_1 \geqslant am_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[monomial order]], we can state the following definitions for a polynomial in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;. 

''Definition''&lt;ref name=Dummit&amp;Foote /&gt;

# Consider an ideal &lt;math&gt; I \subset \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;, and a fixed monomial ordering. The '''leading term''' of a nonzero polynomial &lt;math&gt; f \in \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt; LT(f) &lt;/math&gt; is the monomial term of maximal order in &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; and the leading term of &lt;math&gt; f = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
# The '''ideal of leading terms''', denoted by &lt;math&gt; LT(I) &lt;/math&gt;, is the ideal generated by the leading terms of every element in the ideal, that is, &lt;math&gt; LT(I) = (LT(f)| f\in I) &lt;/math&gt;.
# A '''Gröbner basis''' for an ideal &lt;math&gt; I \subset \mathbb{K}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of generators &lt;math&gt; {\{g_1, g_2, \dotsc, g_s}\} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; whose leading terms generate the ideal of all the leading terms in &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; I = (g_1, g_2, \dotsc, g_s) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; LT(I) = (LT(g_1), LT(g_2), \dotsc, LT(g_s)) &lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if we choose the [[lexicographical order]] &lt;math&gt; x &gt; y &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}[x, y] &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; LT(2x^3y + 9xy^5 + 19) = 2x^3y &lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt; LT(2x^3y + 9xy^5 + 19) =  9xy^5 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; y &gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt; LT(I) &lt;/math&gt; in general depends of the ordering used.

In addition, monomials are present on [[Gröbner basis]] and to define the division algorithm for polynomials with several variables. 

Notice that for a monomial ideal &lt;math&gt; I = (g_1, g_2, \dotsc, g_s) \in \mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;, the finite set of generators &lt;math&gt; {\{g_1, g_2, \dotsc, g_s}\} &lt;/math&gt; is a Gröbner basis for &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;. To see this, notice that for any polynomial &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; in the ideal, can be expressed as &lt;math&gt; f = a_1g_1 + a_2g_2 + \dotsm + a_sg_s &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; a_i \in \mathbb{F}[x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n] &lt;/math&gt;. Then the leading term of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is a multiple for some &lt;math&gt; g_i &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, &lt;math&gt; LT(I) &lt;/math&gt; is generated by the &lt;math&gt; g_i &lt;/math&gt; likewise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3796">In mathematics the '''Mott polynomials''' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are polynomials introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Nevill Francis Mott|first=N. F. |last=Mott|year=1932|loc=p. 442}} who applied them to a problem in the theory of electrons. 
They are given by the exponential generating function 
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x(\sqrt{1-t^2}-1)/t}=\sum_n s_n(x) t^n/n!.&lt;/math&gt;
Because the factor in the exponential has the power series
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sqrt{1-t^2}-1}{t} = -\sum_{k\ge 0} C_k (\frac{t}{2})^{2k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
in terms of [[Catalan number|Catalan numbers]] &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficient in front of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; of the polynomial can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;[x^k] s_n(x) =(-1)^k\frac{n!}{k!2^n}\sum_{n=l_1+l_2+\cdots l_k}C_{(l_1-1)/2}C_{(l_2-1)/2}\cdots C_{(l_k-1)/2}&lt;/math&gt;,
according to the general formula for [[Generalized Appell polynomials|generalized Appell polynomials]],
where the sum is over all [[Composition (combinatorics)|compositions]] &lt;math&gt;n=l_1+l_2+\cdots l_k&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; positive odd integers. The empty product appearing for &lt;math&gt;k=n=0&lt;/math&gt; equals 1. Special values, where all contributing Catalan numbers equal 1, are
:&lt;math&gt; [x^n]s_n(x) = \frac{(-1)^n}{2^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [x^{n-2}]s_n(x) = \frac{(-1)^n n(n-1)(n-2)}{2^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
For odd &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; [x]s_n(x) = -\frac{n!}{2^n}C_{(n-1)/2}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
By differentiation the recurrence for the first derivative becomes
&lt;!--
:&lt;math&gt; s'(x) =- \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} \frac{n!}{m!2^{n-m}} C_{(n-1-m)/2}s_m(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
where the sum is over the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(n-1-m)/2&lt;/math&gt; is integer.
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; s'(x) =- \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2\rfloor} \frac{n!}{(n-1-2k)!2^{2k+1}} C_k s_{n-1-2k}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The first few of them are  {{OEIS|A137378}}
:&lt;math&gt;s_0(x)=1;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_1(x)=-\frac{1}{2}x;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_2(x)=\frac{1}{4}x^2;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_3(x)=-\frac{3}{4}x-\frac{1}{8}x^3;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_4(x)=\frac{3}{2}x^2+\frac{1}{16}x^4;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_5(x)=-\frac{15}{2}x-\frac{15}{8}x^3-\frac{1}{32}x^5;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_6(x)=\frac{225}{8}x^2+\frac{15}{8}x^4+\frac{1}{64}x^6;&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">[[File:Constructing nerve.png|thumb|Constructing the nerve of an open good cover containing 3 sets in the plane.]]

In [[topology]], the '''nerve of an open covering''' is a construction of an [[abstract simplicial complex]] from an [[Cover (topology)#open cover|open covering]] of a [[topological space]] ''X'' that captures many of the interesting topological properties in an algorithmic or combinatorial way. It was introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aleksandroff|first=P. S.|author-link=Pavel Alexandrov| title=Über den allgemeinen Dimensionsbegriff und seine Beziehungen zur elementaren geometrischen Anschauung |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=98 |year=1928| pages=617–635|doi=   10.1007/BF01451612}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has many variants and generalisations, among them the Čech nerve of a cover, which in turn is generalised by [[hypercovering|hypercoverings]].


==Alexandrov's definition==
Given an [[index set]] ''I'', and [[open set]]s ''U&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt; contained in ''X'', the ''nerve'' ''N'' is the set of finite subsets of ''I'' defined as follows:
* a finite set ''J'' ⊆ ''I'' belongs to ''N'' if and only if the intersection of the ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose subindices are in ''J'' is non-empty,
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{j\in J}U_j \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, if ''J'' belongs to ''N'', then any of its subsets is also in ''N''. Therefore ''N'' is an abstract simplicial complex.

In general, the complex ''N'' need not reflect the topology of ''X'' accurately. For example we can cover any ''n''-sphere with two contractible sets ''U'' and ''V'', in such a way that ''N'' is an [[Abstract simplicial complex|abstract 1-simplex]]. However, if we also insist that the open sets corresponding to every [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] indexed by a set in ''N'' are also [[contractible space|contractible]], the situation changes. In particular, the nerve lemma states that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[good cover]], in that for each &lt;math&gt;\sigma\subset I&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in \sigma} U_i&lt;/math&gt; is contractible if it is nonempty, then the nerve &lt;math&gt;N(\mathcal U)&lt;/math&gt; is homotopy equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899283974|title=Elementary applied topology|last=1969-|first=Ghrist, Robert W.,|isbn=9781502880857|edition=Edition 1.0|location=[United States]|oclc=899283974}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This means for instance that a circle covered by three open arcs, intersecting in pairs in one arc, is modelled by a homeomorphic complex, the [[geometrical realization]] of ''N''.

==The Čech nerve==
Given an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U=\{U_i\}&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, or more generally a cover in a site, we can regard the pairwise [[Pullback_(category_theory)|fibre products]] &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}=U_i\times_XU_j&lt;/math&gt;, which in the case of a topological space is precisely the intersection &lt;math&gt;U_i\cap U_j&lt;/math&gt;. The collection of all such intersections can be referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; and the triple intersections as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;. By considering the natural maps &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}\to U_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_i\to U_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct a simplicial object &lt;math&gt;C(\mathcal U)_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;C(\mathcal U)_n=\mathcal U\times_X\cdots\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;, n-fold fibre product. This is the '''Čech nerve''', and by taking connected components we get a simplicial set, which we can realise topologically: &lt;math&gt;|C(\pi_0(\mathcal U))|&lt;/math&gt;. If the covering and the space are sufficiently nice, for instance if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact and all intersections of sets in the cover are contractible or empty, then this space is weakly equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as ''the nerve theorem''.

'''Ortrud R. Oellermann''' is a South African mathematician specializing in [[graph theory]]. She is a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Winnipeg]].

==Education and career==
Oellermann was born in [[Vryheid]].{{r|vryheid}}
She earned a bachelor's degree, ''cum laude'' honours, and a master's degree at the [[University of Natal]] in 1981, 1982, and 1983 respectively,{{r|esa}}
as a student of [[Henda Swart]].{{r|marching}}
She completed her Ph.D. in 1986 at [[Western Michigan University]].
Her dissertation was ''Generalized Connectivity in Graphs'' and was supervised by [[Gary Chartrand]].{{r|esa|mgp}}

Oellermann taught at the [[University of Durban-Westville]], Western Michigan University, University of Natal, and [[Brandon University]], before moving to Winnipeg in 1996. At Winnipeg, she was co-chair of mathematics and statistics for 2011–2013.{{r|esa}}

==Contributions==
With Gary Chartrand, Oellermann is the author of the book ''Applied and Algorithmic Graph Theory'' (McGraw Hill, 1993).{{ran|AA}}

She is also the author of well-cited research publications on [[Metric dimension (graph theory)|metric dimension of graphs]]{{ran|MD}}, on distance-based notions of [[convex hull]]s in graphs,{{ran|CS}} and on [[highly irregular graph]]s in which every [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] has a [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighborhood]] in which all [[degree (graph theory)|degrees]] are distinct.{{ran|IG}} The phrase "highly irregular" was a catchphrase of her co-author [[Yousef Alavi]]; because of this, [[Ronald Graham]] suggested that there should be a concept of highly irregular graphs, by analogy to the [[regular graph]]s, and Oellermann came up with the definition of these graphs.{{r|hi}}

==Recognition==
In 1991, Oellermann was the winner of the annual Silver British Association Medal of the [[Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science]].{{r|bam}}
She won the Meiring Naude Medal of the [[Royal Society of South Africa]] in 1994.{{r|naude}}
She was also one of three winners of the Hall Medal of the [[Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications]] in 1994, the first year the medal was awarded.{{r|hall}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">'''PCF theory''' is the name of a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory, introduced by Saharon {{harvs|txt|last=Shelah|year=1978}}, that deals with the [[cofinality]] of the [[ultraproduct]]s of [[ordered set]]s. It gives strong upper bounds on the cardinalities of [[power set]]s of [[regular cardinal|singular]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]]s, and has many more applications as well. The abbreviation "PCF" stands for "possible [[cofinality|cofinalities]]".

== Main definitions ==
If ''A'' is an infinite set of [[regular cardinal]]s, ''D'' is an [[ultrafilter]] on ''A'', then 
we let &lt;math&gt;cf(\prod A/D)&lt;/math&gt; denote the cofinality of the ordered set of functions 
&lt;math&gt;\prod A&lt;/math&gt; where the ordering is defined as follows. 
&lt;math&gt;f&lt;g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\{x\in A:f(x)&lt;g(x)\}\in D&lt;/math&gt;. 
pcf(''A'') is the set of cofinalities that occur if we consider all ultrafilters on ''A'', that is, 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\rm pcf}(A)=\{cf(\prod A/D):D\,\,\mbox{is an ultrafilter on}\,\,A\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Main results==
Obviously, pcf(''A'') consists of regular cardinals. Considering ultrafilters concentrated on elements of ''A'', we get that 
&lt;math&gt;A\subseteq {\rm pcf}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Shelah proved, that if &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;\min(A)&lt;/math&gt;, then pcf(''A'') has a largest element, and there are subsets &lt;math&gt;\{B_\theta:\theta\in {\rm pcf}(A)\}&lt;/math&gt; of ''A'' such that for each ultrafilter ''D'' on ''A'', &lt;math&gt;cf(\prod A/D)&lt;/math&gt; is the least element &amp;theta; of pcf(''A'') such that &lt;math&gt;B_\theta\in D&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;|{\rm pcf}(A)|\leq2^{|A|}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Shelah also proved that if ''A'' is an interval of regular cardinals (i.e., ''A'' is the set of all regular cardinals between two cardinals), then pcf(''A'') is also an interval of regular cardinals and |pcf(''A'')|&lt;|''A''|&lt;sup&gt;+4&lt;/sup&gt;. 
This implies the famous inequality 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\omega}&lt;\aleph_{\omega_4}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
assuming that ℵ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is [[limit cardinal|strong limit]].

If λ is an infinite cardinal, then ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; is the following ideal on ''A''. ''B''&amp;isin;''J''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; if &lt;math&gt;cf(\prod A/D)&lt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; holds for every ultrafilter ''D'' with ''B''&amp;isin;''D''. Then ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; is the ideal generated by the sets &lt;math&gt;\{B_\theta:\theta\in {\rm pcf}(A),\theta&lt;\lambda\}&lt;/math&gt;. There exist ''scales'', i.e., for every &amp;lambda;&amp;isin;pcf(''A'') there is a sequence of length &amp;lambda; of elements of &lt;math&gt;\prod B_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is both increasing and cofinal mod ''J''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt;. This implies that the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\prod A&lt;/math&gt; under pointwise dominance is max(pcf(''A'')). 
Another consequence is that if λ is singular and no regular cardinal less than λ is [[Jónsson cardinal|Jónsson]], then also λ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is not Jónsson. In particular, there is a [[Jónsson algebra]] on ℵ&lt;sub&gt;ω+1&lt;/sub&gt;, which settles an old conjecture.

== Unsolved problems ==
The most notorious conjecture in pcf theory states that |pcf(''A'')|=|''A''| holds for every set ''A'' of regular cardinals with |''A''|&lt;min(''A''). This would imply that if ℵ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is strong limit, then the sharp bound 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\omega}&lt;\aleph_{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
holds. The analogous bound 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_{\omega_1}}&lt;\aleph_{\omega_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
follows from [[Chang's conjecture]] ([[Menachem Magidor|Magidor]]) or even from the nonexistence of a [[Kurepa tree]] ([[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]]).

A weaker, still unsolved conjecture states that if |''A''|&lt;min(''A''), then pcf(''A'') has no inaccessible limit point. This is equivalent to the statement that pcf(pcf(''A''))=pcf(''A'').

== Applications ==

The theory has found a great deal of applications, besides cardinal arithmetic.
The original survey by Shelah, ''Cardinal arithmetic for skeptics'', includes the following topics: almost free abelian groups, partition problems, failure of preservation of chain conditions in Boolean algebras under products, existence of Jónsson algebras, existence of entangled linear orders, equivalently narrow Boolean algebras, and the existence of  nonisomorphic models equivalent in certain infinitary logics.

In the meantime, many further applications have been found in Set Theory, Model Theory, Algebra and Topology.

In [[mathematics]], a '''prime geodesic''' on a [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is a '''primitive''' [[closed geodesic]], i.e. a geodesic which is a [[curve|closed curve]] that traces out its image exactly once. Such geodesics are called prime geodesics because, among other things, they obey an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic distribution law]] similar to the [[prime number theorem]].

==Technical background==
We briefly present some facts from [[hyperbolic geometry]] which are helpful in understanding prime geodesics.

===Hyperbolic isometries===
Consider the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] ''H'' of 2-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]]. Given a [[Fuchsian group]], that is, a [[discrete subgroup]] Γ of [[projective linear group|PSL(2, '''R''')]], Γ [[group action|acts]] on ''H'' via [[linear fractional transformation]]. Each element of PSL(2, '''R''') in fact defines an [[isometry]] of ''H'', so Γ is a group of isometries of ''H''.

There are then 3 types of transformation: hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic. (The loxodromic transformations are not present because we are working with [[real number]]s.) Then an element γ of Γ has 2 distinct real fixed points if and only if γ is hyperbolic. See [[Möbius transformation#Classification|Classification of isometries]] and [[Möbius transformation#Fixed points|Fixed points of isometries]] for more details.

===Closed geodesics===
Now consider the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient surface]] ''M''=Γ\''H''.  The following description refers to the upper half-plane [[Models of the hyperbolic plane|model of the hyperbolic plane]].  This is a hyperbolic surface, in fact, a [[Riemann surface]]. Each hyperbolic element ''h'' of Γ determines a [[closed geodesic]] of Γ\''H'': first, by connecting the geodesic semicircle joining the fixed points of ''h'', we get a geodesic on ''H'' called the axis of ''h'', and by projecting this geodesic to ''M'', we get a geodesic on Γ\''H''.

This geodesic is closed because 2 points which are in the same orbit under the action of Γ project to the same point on the quotient, by definition.

It can be shown that this gives a [[bijection|1-1 correspondence]] between closed geodesics on Γ\''H'' and hyperbolic [[conjugacy class]]es in Γ. The prime geodesics are then those geodesics that trace out their image exactly once &amp;mdash; algebraically, they correspond to primitive hyperbolic conjugacy classes, that is, conjugacy classes {γ} such that γ cannot be written as a nontrivial power of another element of Γ.

==Applications of prime geodesics==
The importance of prime geodesics comes from their relationship to other branches of mathematics, especially [[dynamical systems]], [[ergodic theory]], and [[number theory]], as well as [[Riemann surface]]s themselves. These applications often overlap among several different research fields.

===Dynamical systems and ergodic theory===
In dynamical systems, the [[closed geodesic]]s represent the [[Periodic function|periodic]] [[group action|orbits]] of the [[Geodesic#Geodesic flow|geodesic flow]].

===Number theory===
In number theory, various "prime geodesic theorems" have been proved which are very similar in spirit to the [[prime number theorem]]. To be specific, we let π(''x'') denote the number of closed geodesics whose norm (a function related to length) is less than or equal to ''x''; then π(''x'') ∼ ''x''/ln(''x''). This result is usually credited to [[Atle Selberg]]. In his 1970 Ph.D. thesis, [[Grigory Margulis]] proved a similar result for surfaces of variable negative curvature, while in his 1980 Ph.D. thesis, [[Peter Sarnak]] proved an analogue of [[Chebotarev's density theorem]].

There are other similarities to number theory &amp;mdash; error estimates are improved upon, in much the same way that error estimates of the prime number theorem are improved upon. Also, there is a [[Selberg zeta function]] which is formally similar to the usual [[Riemann zeta function]] and shares many of its properties.

Algebraically, prime geodesics can be lifted to higher surfaces in much the same way that [[prime ideal]]s in the [[ring of integers]] of a [[number field]] can be split (factored) in a [[Galois extension]]. See [[Covering map]] and [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions]] for more details.

===Riemann surface theory===
Closed geodesics have been used to study Riemann surfaces; indeed, one of [[Riemann]]'s original definitions of the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of a surface was in terms of simple closed curves. Closed geodesics have been instrumental in studying the [[eigenvalue]]s of [[Laplacian]] [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s, [[arithmetic group|arithmetic Fuchsian group]]s, and [[Teichmüller space]]s.

'''[[Stein's example]]''' is an important result in [[decision theory]] which can be stated as

: ''The ordinary decision rule for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is inadmissible under mean squared error risk in dimension at least 3''.

The following is an outline of its proof. The reader is referred to the [[Stein's example|main article]] for more information.

==Sketched proof==
The [[risk function]] of the decision rule &lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,d) = \mathbb{E}_\theta[ |\mathbf{\theta - X}|^2]&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;=\int (\mathbf{\theta - x})^T(\mathbf{\theta - x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{(-1/2) (\mathbf{\theta - x})^T (\mathbf{\theta - x}) } m(dx)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = n.&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider the decision rule

:&lt;math&gt;d'(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} - \frac{\alpha}{|\mathbf{x}|^2}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = n-2&lt;/math&gt;. We will show that &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; is a better decision rule than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. The risk function is

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,d') = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ \left|\mathbf{\theta - X} + \frac{\alpha}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\mathbf{X}\right|^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ |\mathbf{\theta - X}|^2 + 2(\mathbf{\theta - X})^T\frac{\alpha}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\mathbf{X} + \frac{\alpha^2}{|\mathbf{X}|^4}|\mathbf{X}|^2 \right] &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \mathbb{E}_\theta\left[ |\mathbf{\theta - X}|^2 \right] + 2\alpha\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\mathbf{(\theta-X)^T X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] + \alpha^2\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

&amp;mdash; a quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We may simplify the middle term by considering a general "well-behaved" function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathbf{x} \mapsto h(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; and using [[integration by parts]]. For &lt;math&gt;1\leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, for any continuously differentiable &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; growing sufficiently slowly for large &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_\theta [ (\theta_i - X_i) h(\mathbf{X}) | X_j=x_j (j\neq i) ]= \int (\theta_i - x_i) h(\mathbf{x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{ -(1/2)\mathbf{(x-\theta)}^T \mathbf{(x-\theta)} } m(dx_i)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \left[ h(\mathbf{x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{-(1/2) \mathbf{(x-\theta)}^T \mathbf{(x-\theta)} } \right]^\infty_{x_i=-\infty}  
- \int  \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{x}) \left( \frac{1}{2\pi} \right)^{n/2} e^{-(1/2)\mathbf{(x-\theta)}^T \mathbf{(x-\theta)} } m(dx_i)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = - \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{X})  | X_j=x_j (j\neq i) \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}_\theta [ (\theta_i - X_i) h(\mathbf{X})]=  - \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i}(\mathbf{X}) \right].&lt;/math&gt;

(This result is known as [[Stein's lemma]].)

Now, we choose

:&lt;math&gt;
h(\mathbf{x})  =  \frac{x_i}{|\mathbf{x}|^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; met the "well-behaved" condition (it doesn't, but this can be remedied -- see below), we would have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i} = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|^2} - \frac{2 x_i^2}{|\mathbf{x}|^4} &lt;/math&gt;

and so

::&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\mathbf{(\theta-X)^T X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ (\theta_i - X_i) \frac{X_i}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = - \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ \frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} - \frac{2 X_i^2}{|\mathbf{X}|^4} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = -(n-2)\mathbb{E}_\theta \left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Then returning to the risk function of &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\theta,d') =  n - 2\alpha(n-2)\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] + \alpha^2\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right].
&lt;/math&gt;

This quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is minimized at

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = n-2,&lt;/math&gt;

giving

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,d') = R(\theta,d) - (n-2)^2\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which of course satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt;
R(\theta,d') &lt; R(\theta,d).
&lt;/math&gt;

making &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; an inadmissible decision rule.

It remains to justify the use of
:&lt;math&gt;
h(\mathbf{X})= \frac{\mathbf{X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This function is not continuously differentiable since it is singular at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;. However the function

:&lt;math&gt;
h(\mathbf{X}) = \frac{\mathbf{X}}{\epsilon + |\mathbf{X}|^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

is continuously differentiable, and after following the algebra through and letting &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \to 0&lt;/math&gt; one obtains the same result.

:&lt;math&gt;
|p(x)| \le 1
&lt;/math&gt;

on some set of measure ≥ 2 contained in the closed interval [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1+σ]. Then the '''Remez inequality''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{p \in \pi_n(\sigma)} \|p\|_\infty=\|T_n\|_\infty&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the Chebyshev polynomial of degree ''n'', and the supremum norm is taken over the interval [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;1+σ].

Observe that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is increasing on &lt;math&gt;[1, +\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, hence 
:&lt;math&gt; \|T_n\|_\infty = T_n(1+\sigma). &lt;/math&gt;

The R.i., combined with an estimate on Chebyshev polynomials, implies the following
corollary: If ''J''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is a finite interval, and ''E''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''J'' is an arbitrary measurable set, then
:&lt;math&gt;  \max_{x \in J} |p(x)| \leq \left( \frac{4 \,\, \textrm{mes } J}{\textrm{mes } E} \right)^n \sup_{x \in E} |p(x)| \qquad\qquad(*) &lt;/math&gt;
for any polynomial ''p'' of degree ''n''.

==Extensions: Nazarov–Turán lemma==

Inequalities similar to (&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;) have been proved for different classes of functions, and are known as Remez-type inequalities. One important example is [[Fedor Nazarov|Nazarov]]'s inequality for exponential sums {{harv|Nazarov|1993}}:

:'''Nazarov's Inequality.''' Let
:: &lt;math&gt; p(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^n a_k e^{\lambda_k x} &lt;/math&gt;
:be an [[exponential sum]] (with arbitrary ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈'''C'''), and let ''J''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a finite interval, ''E''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''J''—an arbitrary measurable set. Then
::&lt;math&gt; \max_{x \in J} |p(x)| \leq e^{\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J} \left( \frac{C \,\, \textrm{mes} J}{\textrm{mes} E} \right)^{n-1} \sup_{x \in E} |p(x)|~, &lt;/math&gt;
:where ''C'' &gt; 0 is a numerical constant.

In the special case when ''λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are pure imaginary and integer, and the subset ''E'' is itself an interval, the inequality was proved by [[Pál Turán]] and is known as Turán's lemma.

This inequality also extends to &lt;math&gt;L^p(\mathbb{T}),\ 0\leq p\leq2&lt;/math&gt; in the following way

:&lt;math&gt; \|p\|_{L^p(\mathbb{T})}\leq e^{A(n-1)\textrm{mes }(\mathbb{T}\setminus E)}\|p\|_{L^p(E)} &lt;/math&gt;

for some ''A''&gt;0 independent of ''p'', ''E'', and ''n''. When

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mes} E &lt;1-\frac{\log n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

a similar inequality holds for ''p'' &gt; 2. For ''p''=∞ there is an extension to multidimensional polynomials.

'''Proof:''' Applying Nazarov's lemma to &lt;math&gt;E=E_\lambda=\{x\,:\ |p(x)|\leq\lambda\},\ \lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; leads to

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x \in J} |p(x)| \leq e^{\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J} \left( \frac{C \,\, \textrm{mes} J}{\textrm{mes} E_\lambda} \right)^{n-1} \sup_{x \in E_\lambda} |p(x)| \leq e^{\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J} \left( \frac{C \,\, \textrm{mes} J}{\textrm{mes} E_\lambda} \right)^{n-1} \lambda &lt;/math&gt;

thus

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{mes} E_\lambda\leq C \,\, \textrm{mes} J\left(\frac{\lambda e^{\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J}}{\max_{x \in J} |p(x)|} \right )^{\frac{1}{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now fix a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and choose &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\textrm{mes} E_\lambda\leq\tfrac{1}{2}\textrm{mes} E&lt;/math&gt;, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\left(\frac{\textrm{mes} E}{2C \mathrm{mes} J}\right)^{n-1}e^{-\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J}\max_{x \in J} |p(x)| &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this implies: 

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{mes} E\cap (J\setminus E_\lambda)\geq  \textrm{mes}E-\textrm{mes}E_\lambda \geq \tfrac{1}{2} \textrm{mes} E&lt;/math&gt;

Now

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{x\in E}|p(x)|^p\,\mbox{d}x &amp;\geq \int_{x\in E\cap (J\setminus E_\lambda)}|p(x)|^p\,\mbox{d}x \\[6pt]
&amp;\geq \lambda^p\mathrm{mes} E\cap (J\setminus E_\lambda)\\[6pt]
&amp;\geq \frac{1}{2}\textrm{mes} E \left(\frac{\textrm{mes} E}{2C \mathrm{mes} J}\right)^{p(n-1)}e^{-p\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J}\max_{x \in J} |p(x)|^p \\[6pt]
&amp;\geq \frac{1}{2} \frac{\textrm{mes} E}{\textrm{mes} J}\left(\frac{\textrm{mes} E}{2C \mathrm{mes} J}\right)^{p(n-1)}e^{-p\max_k |\Re \lambda_k| \, \mathrm{mes} J}\int_{x \in J} |p(x)|^p\,\mbox{d}x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which completes the proof.

==Pólya inequality==

One of the corollaries of the R.i. is the '''Pólya inequality''', which was proved by [[George Pólya]]  {{harv|Pólya|1928}}, and states that the Lebesgue measure of a sub-level set of a polynomial ''p'' of degree ''n'' is bounded in terms of the leading coefficient LC(''p'') as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \textrm{mes} \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \, \mid \, |P(x)| \leq a \right\} \leq 4 \left(\frac{a}{2 \mathrm{LC}(p)}\right)^{1/n}~, \quad a &gt; 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28427">In [[theoretical physics]], '''scalar field theory''' can refer to a relativistically invariant [[Classical field theory|classical]] or [[Quantum field theory|quantum theory]] of [[scalar field]]s. A scalar field is invariant under any [[Lorentz transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;i.e., it transforms under the trivial [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Common representations|{{math|(0, 0)}}]]-representation of the Lorentz group, leaving the value of the field at any spacetime point unchanged, in contrast to a [[vector field|vector]] or [[tensor field]], or more generally, spinor-tensors, whose components undergo a mix under Lorentz transformations. Since particle or field spin by definition is determined by the Lorentz representation under which it transforms, all scalar (and pseudoscalar) fields and particles have spin zero, and are as such [[boson]]ic by the [[spin statistics theorem]]. See {{harvnb|Weinberg|1995|loc=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only fundamental scalar quantum field that has been observed in nature is the [[Higgs field]]. However, scalar quantum fields feature in the [[effective field theory]] descriptions of many physical phenomena. An example is the [[pion]], which is actually a [[pseudoscalar]].&lt;ref&gt;This  means it is not invariant under [[parity transformation]]s which invert the spatial directions, distinguishing it from a true scalar, which is parity-invariant.See {{harvnb|Weinberg|1998|loc=Chapter 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since they do not involve [[Photon polarization#Polarization states|polarization]] complications, scalar fields are often the easiest to appreciate [[Canonical quantization#Real scalar field|second quantization]] through. For this reason, scalar field theories are  often used for purposes of introduction of novel concepts and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Linear (free) theory===
The most basic scalar field theory is the [[linear]] theory.  Through the Fourier decomposition of the fields, it represents the [[Normal mode#Coupled oscillators|normal modes]] of an [[Quantum_harmonic_oscillator#Harmonic_oscillators_lattice:_phonons|infinity of coupled oscillators]] where the continuum limit of the oscillator index ''i'' is now denoted by {{mvar|x}}. The [[Action (physics)|action]] for the free [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] scalar field theory is then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathcal{S} &amp;= \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \mathrm{d}t \mathcal{L} \\
              &amp;= \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \mathrm{d}t \left[\frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi - \frac{1}{2} m^2\phi^2\right] \\[6pt]
              &amp;= \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \mathrm{d}t \left[\frac{1}{2}(\partial_t\phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2}\delta^{ij}\partial_i\phi \partial_j\phi -\frac{1}{2} m^2\phi^2\right],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is known as a [[Lagrangian density]]; {{math|''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' ≡ ''dx'' ⋅ ''dy'' ⋅ ''dz'' ≡ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the three spatial coordinates; {{math|''δ&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]] function; and {{math|''∂''&lt;sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''∂''/''∂x''&lt;sup&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}  for the {{mvar|''ρ''}}-th coordinate {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

This is an example of a quadratic action, since each of the terms is quadratic in the field, {{mvar|φ}}. The term proportional to {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is sometimes known as a mass term, due to its subsequent interpretation, in the quantized version of this theory, in terms of particle mass.

The equation of motion for this theory is obtained by [[Euler–Lagrange|extremizing]] the action above. It takes the following form, linear in  {{mvar|φ}},  

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\phi+m^2\phi=\partial^2_t\phi-\nabla^2\phi+m^2\phi=0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Del#Laplacian|Laplace operator]]. This is the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], with the interpretation  as a classical field equation, rather than as a quantum-mechanical wave equation.

===Nonlinear (interacting) theory===

The most common generalization of the linear theory above is to add a [[scalar potential]] {{math|''V''(Φ)}} to the Lagrangian, where typically, in addition to a mass term, ''V'' is a polynomial in {{mvar|Φ}}. Such a theory is sometimes said to be [[interaction|interacting]], because the Euler-Lagrange equation is now nonlinear, implying a [[Self-energy|self-interaction]]. The action for the most general such theory is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathcal{S} &amp;= \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \, \mathrm{d}t \mathcal{L} \\[3pt]
              &amp;= \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \mathrm{d}t \left[\frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi - V(\phi) \right] \\[3pt]
              &amp;= \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \, \mathrm{d}t \left[
                   \frac{1}{2}(\partial_t\phi)^2 - \frac{1}{2}\delta^{ij}\partial_i\phi\partial_j\phi -
                   \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2 - \sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} g_n\phi^n
                 \right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The ''n''! factors in the expansion are introduced because they are useful in the Feynman diagram expansion of the quantum theory, as described below.

The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation of motion is now
:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \partial_\nu\phi + V'(\phi) = \partial^2_t \phi - \nabla^2 \phi + V'(\phi) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Dimensional analysis and scaling===
{{main|Natural units#"Natural units" (particle physics and cosmology)}}
Physical quantities in these scalar field theories may have dimensions of length, time or mass, or some combination of the three.

However, in a relativistic theory, any quantity  {{mvar|t}}, with dimensions of time, can be readily converted into a ''length'', {{math|''l'' {{=}}''ct''}}, by using the [[velocity of light]],  {{mvar|c}}. Similarly, any length  {{mvar|l}} is equivalent to an inverse mass, {{mvar|ħ}}/''mc'', using [[Planck's constant]], {{mvar|ħ}}. In natural units, one thinks of a time as a length, or either time or length as an inverse mass.

In short, one can think of the dimensions of any physical quantity as defined in terms of ''just one'' independent dimension, rather than in terms of all three. This is most often termed the [[Classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] of the quantity. Knowing the dimensions of each quantity, allows one to ''uniquely restore'' conventional dimensions from a natural units expression in terms of this mass dimension, by simply reinserting the requisite powers of  {{mvar|ħ}} and {{mvar|c}} required for dimensional consistency.

One conceivable objection is that this theory is classical, and therefore it is not obvious how Planck's constant should be a part of the theory at all. If desired, one could indeed recast the theory without mass dimensions at all: However, this would be at the expense of slightly obscuring the connection with the quantum scalar field. Given that one has dimensions of mass, Planck's constant is thought of here as an essentially ''arbitrary fixed reference quantity of action'' (not necessarily connected to quantization), hence with dimensions appropriate to convert between mass and [[inverse length]].

====Scaling dimension====
The [[classical scaling dimension]], or mass dimension,  {{mvar|Δ}}, of  {{mvar|φ}} describes the transformation of the field under a rescaling of coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi\rightarrow\lambda^{-\Delta}\phi ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The units of action are the same as the units of {{mvar|ħ}}, and so the action itself has zero mass dimension. This fixes the scaling dimension of the field {{mvar|φ}} to be
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta =\frac{D-2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Scale invariance====
There is a specific sense in which some scalar field theories are [[Scale invariance|scale-invariant]]. While the actions above are all constructed to have zero mass dimension, not all actions are invariant under the scaling transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi\rightarrow\lambda^{-\Delta}\phi ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The reason that not all actions are invariant is that one usually thinks of the parameters ''m'' and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  as fixed quantities, which are not rescaled under the transformation above. The condition for a scalar field theory to be scale invariant is then quite obvious: all of the parameters appearing in the action should be dimensionless quantities. In other words, a scale invariant theory is one without any fixed length scale (or equivalently, mass scale) in the theory.

For a scalar field theory with {{math|''D''}} spacetime dimensions, the only dimensionless parameter  {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfies  {{mvar|n}} =  {{math|{{Fraction|2''D''|(''D'' − 2)}} }}. For example, in {{math|''D''}} = 4, only  {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is classically dimensionless, and so the only classically scale-invariant scalar field theory in {{math|''D''}} = 4 is the massless [[Quartic interaction|{{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory]].

Classical scale invariance, however, normally does not imply quantum scale invariance, because of the [[renormalization group]] involved – see the discussion of the beta function below.

====Conformal invariance====
A transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow \tilde{x}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be [[Conformal symmetry|conformal]] if the transformation satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\tilde{x^\mu}}{\partial x^\rho}\frac{\partial\tilde{x^\nu}}{\partial
 x^\sigma}\eta_{\mu\nu}=\lambda^2(x)\eta_{\rho\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;
for some function {{math|''λ''(''x'')}}.

The conformal group contains as subgroups the [[isometry|isometries]] of the metric &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Poincaré group]]) and also the scaling transformations (or [[Scale invariance|dilatation]]s) considered above. In fact, the scale-invariant theories in the previous section are also conformally-invariant.

==={{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory===
{{See also|Quartic interaction}}
Massive {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory illustrates a number of interesting phenomena in scalar field theory.

The Lagrangian density is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_t\phi)^2 -\frac{1}{2}\delta^{ij}\partial_i\phi\partial_j\phi - \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2-\frac{g}{4!}\phi^4.&lt;/math&gt;

====Spontaneous symmetry breaking====
{{See also|Quartic interaction#Spontaneous symmetry breaking}}
This Lagrangian has a ℤ₂ symmetry under the transformation  {{math|''φ''→ −''φ''}}.
This is an example of an [[internal symmetry]], in contrast to a [[Spacetime symmetries|space-time symmetry]].

If {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is positive, the potential 
:&lt;math&gt;V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2 +\frac{g}{4!}\phi^4&lt;/math&gt; 
has a single minimum, at the origin. The solution ''φ''=0 is clearly invariant under the ℤ₂ symmetry.

Conversely, if {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is negative, then one can readily see that the potential 
:&lt;math&gt;\, V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2+\frac{g}{4!}\phi^4\!&lt;/math&gt; 
has two minima. This is known as a ''double well potential'', and the lowest energy states (known as the vacua, in quantum field theoretical language) in such a theory are {{em|not}} invariant under the ℤ₂ symmetry of the action (in fact it maps each of the two vacua into the other). In this case, the ℤ₂ symmetry is said to be ''[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]]''.

====Kink solutions====
The {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory with a negative {{mvar|m}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; also has a kink solution, which is a canonical example of a [[soliton]]. Such a solution is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\vec{x}, t) = \pm\frac{m}{2\sqrt{\frac{g}{4!}}}\tanh\left[\frac{m(x - x_0)}{\sqrt{2}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{mvar|x}} is one of the spatial variables ({{mvar|φ}} is taken to be independent of  {{mvar|t}}, and the remaining spatial variables). The solution interpolates between the two different vacua of the double well potential. It is not possible to deform the kink into a constant solution without passing through a solution of infinite energy, and for this reason the kink is said to be stable. For ''D''&gt;2 (i.e., theories with more than one spatial dimension), this solution is called a [[domain wall]].

Another well-known example of a scalar field theory with kink solutions is the [[sine-Gordon]] theory.

===Complex scalar field theory===

In a complex scalar field theory, the scalar field takes values in the complex numbers,
rather than the real numbers. The action considered normally takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \, \mathrm{d}t
\mathcal{L} = \int \mathrm{d}^{D-1}x \, \mathrm{d}t \left[\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi^*\partial_\nu\phi
-V(|\phi|^2)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

This has a [[U(1)]], equivalently O(2) symmetry, whose action on the space of fields rotates &lt;math&gt;\phi\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}\phi&lt;/math&gt;, for some real phase angle  {{mvar|α}}.

As for the real scalar field, spontaneous symmetry breaking is found if ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is negative. This gives rise to Goldstone's [[Mexican hat potential]] which is a rotation of the double-well potential of a real scalar
field by 2π radians about the ''V''&lt;math&gt; (\phi) &lt;/math&gt; axis. The symmetry breaking takes place in one higher dimension, i.e.  the choice of vacuum breaks a continuous ''U''(1) symmetry instead of a discrete one.
The two components of the scalar field are reconfigured as a massive mode and a massless [[Goldstone boson]].

===''O''(''N'') theory===

One can express the complex scalar field theory in terms of two real fields, ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = Re ''φ''   and    ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Im ''φ'', which transform in the vector representation of the ''U''(1) = ''O''(2) internal symmetry. Although such fields transform as a vector under the ''internal symmetry'', they are still Lorentz scalars.

This can be generalised to a theory of N scalar fields transforming in the vector representation of the [[Orthogonal group|''O''(''N'')]] symmetry. The Lagrangian for an ''O''(''N'')-invariant scalar field theory is typically of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\cdot\partial_\nu\phi -V(\phi\cdot\phi)&lt;/math&gt;
using an appropriate ''O''(''N'')-invariant [[inner product]].

In [[quantum field theory]], the fields, and all observables constructed from them, are replaced by quantum operators on a [[Hilbert space]]. This Hilbert space is built on a [[vacuum state]], and dynamics are governed by a quantum  [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], a positive-definite operator which annihilates the vacuum.  A construction of a quantum scalar field theory is detailed in the [[canonical quantization]] article, which relies on canonical commutation relations among the fields.  Essentially, the infinity of classical oscillators repackaged in the scalar field as its (decoupled) normal modes, above, are now quantized in the standard manner, so the respective quantum operator field describes an infinity of [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]s acting on a respective [[Fock space]].

In brief, the basic variables are the quantum field {{mvar|φ}} and its canonical momentum {{mvar|π}}. Both these operator-valued fields are [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]]. At spatial points {{vec|''x''}}, {{vec|''y''}} , at equal times, their [[canonical commutation relations]] are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left[\phi\left(\vec{x}\right), \phi\left(\vec{y}\right)\right] =
    \left[\pi\left(\vec{x}\right), \pi\left(\vec{y}\right)\right] &amp;= 0,\\
   \left[\phi\left(\vec{x}\right), \pi\left(\vec{y}\right)\right] &amp;= i \delta\left(\vec{x} - \vec{y}\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

while the free [[Hamiltonian (quantum theory)|Hamiltonian]] is, similarly to above, 
:&lt;math&gt;H = \int d^3x \left[{1 \over 2}\pi^2 + {1 \over 2}(\nabla \phi)^2 + {m^2 \over 2}\phi^2\right].&lt;/math&gt;

A spatial [[Fourier transform]] leads to [[momentum space]] fields
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \widetilde{\phi}(\vec{k}) &amp;= \int d^3x e^{-i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}}\phi(\vec{x}),\\
   \widetilde{\pi}(\vec{k}) &amp;= \int d^3x e^{-i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}}\pi(\vec{x})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which resolve to annihilation and creation operators
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
           a(\vec{k}) &amp;= \left(E\widetilde{\phi}(\vec{k}) + i\widetilde{\pi}(\vec{k})\right),\\
   a^\dagger(\vec{k}) &amp;= \left(E\widetilde{\phi}(\vec{k}) - i\widetilde{\pi}(\vec{k})\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E = \sqrt{k^2 + m^2}&lt;/math&gt; .

These operators satisfy the commutation relations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left[a(\vec{k}_1), a(\vec{k}_2)\right] =
    \left[a^\dagger(\vec{k}_1), a^\dagger(\vec{k}_2)\right] &amp;= 0,\\
            \left[a(\vec{k}_1), a^\dagger(\vec{k}_2)\right] &amp;= (2\pi)^3 2E \delta(\vec{k}_1 - \vec{k}_2).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The state &lt;math&gt;| 0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; annihilated by all of the operators ''a'' is identified as the ''bare vacuum'', and a particle with momentum  {{vec|''k''}}  is created by applying &lt;math&gt;a^\dagger(\vec{k})&lt;/math&gt; to the vacuum.

Applying all possible combinations of creation operators to the vacuum constructs the relevant [[Hilbert space]]: This construction is called [[Fock space]].  The vacuum is annihilated by the Hamiltonian
:&lt;math&gt;H = \int {d^3k\over (2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{2} a^\dagger(\vec{k}) a(\vec{k}) , &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[zero-point energy]] has been removed by [[Wick ordering]]. (See [[canonical quantization]].)

Interactions can be included by adding an interaction Hamiltonian.  For a ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory, this corresponds to adding a Wick ordered term ''g'':''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;:/4! to the Hamiltonian, and integrating over ''x''. Scattering amplitudes may be calculated from this Hamiltonian in the [[interaction picture]].  These are constructed in [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] by means of the [[Dyson series]], which gives the time-ordered products, or ''n''-particle Green's functions &lt;math&gt;\langle 0|\mathcal{T}\{\phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n)\}|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as described in the [[Dyson series]] article. The Green's functions may also be obtained from a generating function that is constructed as a solution to the [[Schwinger–Dyson equation]].

{{see also|Quantum harmonic oscillator#Harmonic oscillators lattice: phonons}}

===Feynman path integral===
The [[Feynman diagram]] expansion may be obtained also from the Feynman [[path integral formulation]].&lt;ref&gt;A general reference for this section is {{cite book|last=Ramond|first=Pierre|title=Field Theory: A Modern Primer (Second Edition)|publisher=Westview Press|location=USA|date=2001-12-21|isbn=0-201-30450-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[time ordered]] [[vacuum expectation value]]s of polynomials in {{mvar|φ}}, known as the ''n''-particle Green's functions, are constructed by integrating over all possible fields, normalized by the [[vacuum expectation value]] with no external fields,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle 0|\mathcal{T}\{\phi(x_1)\cdots \phi(x_n)\}|0\rangle =
  \frac
    {\int \mathcal{D}\phi \phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n) e^{i\int d^4x \left({1 \over 2}\partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - {m^2 \over 2}\phi^2 - {g \over 4!}\phi^4\right)}}
    {\int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{i\int d^4x \left({1 \over 2}\partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - {m^2 \over 2}\phi^2 - {g \over 4!}\phi^4\right)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

All of these Green's functions may be obtained by expanding the exponential in ''J''(''x'')φ(''x'') in the generating function
:&lt;math&gt;
  Z[J] =
    \int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{i\int d^4x \left({1 \over 2}\partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - {m^2 \over 2}\phi^2 - {g \over 4!}\phi^4 + J\phi\right)} =
    Z[0] \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{i^n}{n!} J(x_1) \cdots J(x_n) \langle 0|\mathcal{T}\{\phi(x_1) \cdots \phi(x_n)\}|0\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

A [[Wick rotation]] may be applied to make time imaginary. Changing the signature to (++++) then turns the Feynman integral into a [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|statistical mechanics partition function]] in [[Euclidean space]],
:&lt;math&gt;Z[J] = \int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{-\int d^4x \left[{1 \over 2}(\nabla\phi)^2 + {m^2 \over 2}\phi^2 + {g \over 4!}\phi^4 + J\phi\right]}.&lt;/math&gt;

Normally, this is applied to the scattering of particles with fixed momenta, in which case, a [[Fourier transform]] is useful, giving instead
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{Z}[\widetilde{J}] = \int \mathcal{D}\widetilde\phi e^{-\int d^4p \left[{1 \over 2}\left(p^2 + m^2\right)\widetilde\phi^2 + {\lambda \over 4!}\widetilde\phi^4 - \widetilde{J}\widetilde\phi\right]}.&lt;/math&gt;

The standard trick to evaluate this [[functional integral]] is to write it as a product of exponential factors, schematically,
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{Z}[\widetilde{J}]\sim\int \mathcal{D}\widetilde\phi \prod_p \left[e^{-{1 \over 2}\left(p^2 + m^2\right)\widetilde\phi^2} e^{-{g \over 4!}\widetilde\phi^4} e^{\widetilde{J}\widetilde\phi}\right].&lt;/math&gt;
The second two exponential factors can be expanded as power series, and the combinatorics of this expansion can be represented graphically through [[Feynman diagram]]s.

The integral with {{mvar|λ}} = 0 can be treated as a product of infinitely many elementary Gaussian integrals: the result may be expressed as a sum of [[Feynman diagrams]], calculated using the following Feynman rules:
* Each field  {{overset|~|''φ''}}(''p'') in the ''n''-point Euclidean Green's function is represented by an external line (half-edge) in the graph, and associated with momentum ''p''.
* Each vertex is represented by a factor −''g''.
* At a given order ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, all diagrams with ''n'' external lines and {{mvar|k}} vertices are constructed such that the momenta flowing into each vertex is zero. Each internal line is represented by a propagator 1/(''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where {{mvar|q}} is the momentum flowing through that line.
* Any unconstrained momenta are integrated over all values.
* The result is divided by a symmetry factor, which is the number of ways the lines and vertices of the graph can be rearranged without changing its connectivity.
* Do not include graphs containing "vacuum bubbles", connected subgraphs with no external lines.

The last rule takes into account the effect of dividing by  {{overset|~|''Z''}}[0].  The Minkowski-space Feynman rules are similar, except that each vertex is represented by ''−ig'', while each internal line is represented by a propagator ''i''/(''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;−''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''iε''), where the {{mvar|ε}} term represents the small Wick rotation needed to make the Minkowski-space Gaussian integral converge.

===Renormalization===
{{main|Beta function (physics)|Renormalization group}}
The integrals over unconstrained momenta, called "loop integrals", in the Feynman graphs typically diverge. This is normally handled by [[renormalization]], which is a procedure of adding divergent counter-terms to the Lagrangian in such a way that the diagrams constructed from the original Lagrangian and counter-terms is finite.&lt;ref&gt;See the previous reference, or for more detail, {{cite book|last1=Itzykson|first1=Zuber|last2=Zuber|first2=Jean-Bernard|title=Quantum Field Theory|publisher=Dover|date=2006-02-24|isbn=0-07-032071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A renormalization scale must be introduced in the process, and the coupling constant and mass become dependent upon it.

The dependence of a coupling constant {{mvar|g}} on the scale {{mvar|λ}} is encoded by a [[Beta function (physics)|beta function]], {{math|''β''(''g'')}}, defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(g) = \lambda\,\frac{\partial g}{\partial \lambda} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

This dependence on the energy scale is known as "the running of the coupling parameter", and theory of this systematic scale-dependence in quantum field theory is described by the [[renormalization group]].

Beta-functions are usually computed in an approximation scheme, most commonly [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], where one assumes that the coupling constant is small. One can then make an expansion in powers of the coupling parameters and truncate the higher-order terms (also known as higher [[Feynman graph|loop]] contributions, due to the number of loops in the corresponding [[Feynman graph]]s).

The  {{math|''β''}}-function at one loop (the first perturbative contribution) for the {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory is
:&lt;math&gt;\beta(g) = \frac{3}{16\pi^2}g^2 + O\left(g^3\right) ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the sign in front of the lowest-order term is positive suggests that the coupling constant increases with energy. If this behavior persisted at large couplings, this would indicate the presence of a [[Landau pole]] at finite energy, arising from [[quantum triviality]].  However, the question can only be answered non-perturbatively, since it involves strong coupling.

A quantum field theory is said to be ''trivial'' when the renormalized coupling, computed through its [[Beta function (physics)|beta function]], goes to zero when the ultraviolet cutoff is removed. Consequently, the [[propagator]] becomes that of a free particle and the field is no longer interacting.

For a {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; interaction, [[Michael Aizenman]] proved that the theory is indeed trivial, for space-time dimension {{mvar|D}} ≥ 5.&lt;ref name="Aiz81"&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For {{mvar|D}} = 4, the triviality has yet to be proven rigorously, but [[Quantum triviality|lattice computations]] have provided strong evidence for this.  This fact is important as [[quantum triviality]] can be used to bound or even ''predict'' parameters such as the [[Higgs boson]] mass.  This can also lead to a predictable Higgs mass in [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity#The mass of the Higgs boson|asymptotic safety]] scenarios.&lt;ref name="TrivPurs"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=David J E Callaway | first=D.

{{Lie groups |Classical}}

In mathematics, the '''special unitary group''' of degree {{math|''n''}}, denoted {{math|SU(''n'')}}, is the [[Lie group]] of {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[Unitary matrix|unitary]] [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with [[determinant]] 1.

(More [[Unitary group|general unitary matrices]] may have complex determinants with absolute value 1, rather than real 1 in the special case.)

The group operation is [[matrix multiplication]]. The special unitary group is a [[subgroup]] of the [[unitary group]] {{math|U(''n'')}}, consisting of all {{math|''n''×''n''}} unitary matrices. As a [[classical group|compact classical group]], {{math|U(''n'')}} is the group that preserves the [[inner product space#Examples|standard inner product]] on {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For a characterization of {{math|U(''n'')}} and hence {{math|SU(''n'')}} in terms of preservation of the standard inner product on {{math|ℂ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, see [[Classical group]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is itself a subgroup of the [[general linear group]], {{math|SU(''n'') ⊂ U(''n'') ⊂ GL(''n'', '''C''')}}.

The {{math|SU(''n'')}} groups find wide application in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], especially [[#The_group_SU(2)|{{math|SU(2)}}]] in the [[electroweak interaction]] and [[#The_group_SU(3)|{{math|SU(3)}}]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Halzen, Francis |authorlink1 = Francis Halzen |author2=Martin, Alan | title=Quarks &amp; Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1984 | isbn=0-471-88741-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest case, {{math|SU(1)}}, is the [[trivial group]], having only a single element. The group {{math|SU(2)}} is [[isomorphic]] to the group of [[quaternion]]s of [[Quaternion#Conjugation, the norm, and division|norm]] 1, and is thus [[diffeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]]. Since [[unit quaternion]]s can be used to represent rotations in 3-dimensional space (up to sign), there is a [[surjective]] [[homomorphism]] from {{math|SU(2)}} to the [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation group {{math|SO(3)}}]] whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is {{math|{+''I'', −''I''}}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For an explicit description of the homomorphism {{math|SU(2) → SO(3)}}, see [[rotation group SO(3)#Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)|Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)]].&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|SU(2)}} is also identical to one of the symmetry groups of [[spinor]]s, [[spin group|Spin]](3), that enables a spinor presentation of rotations.

==Properties==
The special unitary group {{math|SU(''n'')}} is a real [[Lie group]] (though not a [[complex Lie group]]). Its dimension as a [[manifold|real manifold]] is {{nowrap|{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}. Topologically, it is [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.11&lt;/ref&gt; Algebraically, it is a [[simple Lie group]] (meaning its [[Lie algebra]] is simple; see below).&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Garner Wybourne|Wybourne, B G]] (1974). ''Classical Groups for Physicists'', Wiley-Interscience. {{isbn|0471965057}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[center of a group|center]] of {{math|SU(''n'')}} is isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] {{math|Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and is composed of the diagonal matrices {{math|''ζ I''}} for {{mvar|ζ}} an {{mvar|n}}&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of unity and {{mvar|I}} the ''n''×''n'' identity matrix.

Its [[outer automorphism group]], for {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}}}, is {{math|Z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, while the outer automorphism group of {{math|SU(2)}} is the [[trivial group]].

A maximal torus, of rank {{math|''n'' − 1}}, is given by the set of diagonal matrices with determinant 1. The [[Weyl group]] is the [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which is represented by [[generalized permutation matrix#Signed permutation group|signed permutation matrices]] (the signs being necessary to ensure the determinant is 1).

The [[Lie algebra]] of {{math|SU(''n'')}}, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{su}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, can be identified with the set of [[traceless]] [[antiHermitian]] {{math|''n''×''n''}} complex matrices, with the regular [[commutator]] as Lie bracket. [[Particle physics|Particle physicists]] often use a different, equivalent representation: the set of traceless [[Hermitian]] {{math|''n''×''n''}} complex matrices with Lie bracket given by {{math|−''i''}} times the commutator.

==Lie algebra==
{{main article|Classical group#U(p, q) and U(n) – the unitary groups}}

The Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{su}(n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[skew Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian]] matrices with trace zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.24&lt;/ref&gt; This (real) Lie algebra has dimension &lt;math&gt;n^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt;. More information about the structure of this Lie algebra can be found below in the section "Lie algebra structure."

===Fundamental representation===
In the physics literature, it is common to identify the Lie algebra with the space of trace-zero ''Hermitian'' (rather than the skew-Hermitian) matrices. That is to say, the physicists' Lie algebra differs by a factor of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from the mathematicians'. With this convention, one can then choose generators {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}} that are [[trace (linear algebra)|traceless]] [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] complex {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrices, where:

:&lt;math&gt;T_a T_b = \frac{1}{2n}\delta_{ab}I_n + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{c=1}^{n^2 -1}\left(if_{abc} + d_{abc}\right) T_c&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''f''}} are the [[structure constants]] and are antisymmetric in all indices, while the {{math|''d''}}-coefficients are symmetric in all indices.

As a consequence, the anticommutator and commutator are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left\{T_a, T_b\right\} &amp;= \frac{1}{n}\delta_{ab} I_n + \sum_{c=1}^{n^2 -1}{d_{abc} T_c} \\
    \left[T_a, T_b\right] &amp;= i \sum_{c=1}^{n^2 -1} f_{abc} T_c\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The factor of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the commutation relations arises from the physics convention and is not present when using the mathematicians' convention.

We may also take

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{c,e=1}^{n^2 - 1} d_{ace}d_{bce} = \frac{n^2 - 4}{n} \delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;

as a normalization convention.

===Adjoint representation===
In the {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} }}-dimensional [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]], the generators are represented by {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} }}× {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} }} matrices, whose elements are defined by the structure constants themselves:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(T_a\right)_{jk} = -if_{ajk}.&lt;/math&gt;

==The group SU(2)==
{{see also|Versor|Pauli matrices|Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra|Representation theory of SU(2)}}
{{math|SU(2)}} is the following group,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Exercise 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SU}(2) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; -\overline{\beta} \\ \beta &amp; \overline{\alpha} \end{pmatrix}: \ \ \alpha,\beta \in \mathbf{C}, |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 \right\}~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the overline denotes [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]].

There is a 2:1 homomorphism from [[Rotation_group_SO(3)#Using_quaternions_of_unit_norm|SU(2) to SO(3)]].

===[[Diffeomorphism]] with [[3-sphere|S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]===
If we consider &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\beta&lt;/math&gt; as a pair in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=a+bi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=c+di&lt;/math&gt;, then the equation &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; becomes
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation of the [[3-sphere|3-sphere S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]. This can also be seen using an embedding: the map
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \varphi \colon \mathbf{C}^2 &amp;\to \operatorname{M}(2, \mathbf{C}) \\
       \varphi(\alpha, \beta) &amp;= \begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; -\overline{\beta}\\ \beta &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|M(2, '''C''')}} denotes the set of 2 by 2 complex matrices, is an injective real linear map (by considering {{math|'''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|M(2, '''C''')}} diffeomorphic to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}). Hence, the [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of {{math|''φ''}} to the [[3-sphere]] (since modulus is 1), denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is an embedding of the 3-sphere onto a compact submanifold of {{math|M(2, '''C''')}}, namely {{math|1=''φ''(''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = SU(2)}}.

Therefore, as a manifold, {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is diffeomorphic to {{math|SU(2)}}, which shows that {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be endowed with the structure of a compact, connected [[Lie group]].

===[[Isomorphism]] with [[Rotation group SO(3)#Using quaternions of unit norm|unit quaternions]]===
The complex matrix:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 
    a + bi &amp; -c + di \\ 
    c + di &amp;  a - bi
  \end{pmatrix} \quad
  (a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R})
&lt;/math&gt;

can be mapped to the [[quaternion]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a + bi + cj + dk&lt;/math&gt;

This map is in fact an isomorphism. Additionally, the determinant of the matrix is the norm of the corresponding quaternion. Clearly any matrix in {{math|SU(2)}} is of this form and, since it has determinant 1, the corresponding quaternion has norm 1. Thus {{math|SU(2)}} is isomorphic to the [[versor|unit quaternions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://alistairsavage.ca/mat4144/notes/MAT4144-5158-LieGroups.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Lie algebra basis}}Lie algebra===
The [[Lie algebra]] of {{math|SU(2)}} consists of &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; [[skew Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian]] matrices with trace zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.24&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly, this means
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{su}(2) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} i\ a &amp; -\overline{z} \\ z &amp; -i\ a \end{pmatrix}:\ a \in \mathbf{R}, z \in \mathbf{C} \right\}~.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lie algebra is then generated by the following matrices,
:&lt;math&gt;u_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; i \\
    i &amp; 0
  \end{pmatrix}, \quad
  u_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; -1 \\
    1 &amp;  0
  \end{pmatrix}, \quad
  u_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
    i &amp;  0 \\
    0 &amp; -i
  \end{pmatrix}~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which have the form of the general element specified above.

These satisfy the [[quaternion]] relationships  &lt;math&gt;u_2\ u_3 = -u_3\ u_2 = u_1~,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;u_3\ u_1 = -u_1\ u_3 = u_2~,&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;u_1 u_2 = -u_2\ u_1 = u_3~.&lt;/math&gt; The [[commutator bracket]] is therefore specified by
:&lt;math&gt;\left[u_3, u_1\right] = 2\ u_2, \quad \left[u_1, u_2\right] = 2\ u_3, \quad \left[u_2, u_3\right] = 2\ u_1~.&lt;/math&gt;

The above generators are related to the [[Pauli matrices]] by &lt;math&gt;u_1 = i\ \sigma_1~, \, u_2 = -i\ \sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;u_3 = +i\ \sigma_3~.&lt;/math&gt; This representation is routinely used in [[quantum mechanics]] to represent the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of [[fundamental particle]]s such as [[electron]]s. They also serve as [[unit vector]]s for the description of our 3&amp;nbsp;spatial dimensions in [[loop quantum gravity]].

The Lie algebra serves to work out the [[representation theory of SU(2)|representations of {{math|SU(2)}}]].

==The group SU(3)==
{{see also|Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)}}

===Topology===
The group SU(3) is a simply-connected, compact Lie group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.11&lt;/ref&gt; Its topological structure can be understood by noting that SU(3) acts transitively on the unit sphere &lt;math&gt;S^5&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^3 = \mathbb{R}^6&lt;/math&gt;. The stabilizer of an arbitrary point in the sphere is isomorphic to SU(2), which topologically is a 3-sphere. It then follows that SU(3) is a [[fiber bundle]] over the base &lt;math&gt;S^5&lt;/math&gt; with fiber &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;. Since the fibers and the base are simply connected, the simple connectedness of SU(3) then follows by means of a standard topological result (the [[Homotopy group#Long exact sequence of a fibration|long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] for fiber bundles).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representation theory===
The representation theory of SU(3) is well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions of these representations, from the point of view of its complexified Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sl}(3; \mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;, may be found in the articles on [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|Lie algebra representations]] or [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)#Representations of the SU.283.29 group|the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)]].

===Lie algebra===
The generators, {{mvar|T}}, of the Lie algebra su(3) of SU(3) in the defining representation, are:
:&lt;math&gt;T_a = \frac{\lambda_a}{2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|λ}}, the [[Gell-Mann matrices]], are the {{math|SU(3)}} analog of the [[Pauli matrices]] for {{math|SU(2)}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \lambda_1 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 \\ 1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; 
  \lambda_2 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i &amp;  0 \\ i &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; 
  \lambda_3 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, \\
  \lambda_4 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 \\ 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; 
  \lambda_5 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;  0 &amp; -i \\ 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ i &amp; 0 &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, \\
  \lambda_6 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; 
  \lambda_7 ={} &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp;  0 &amp; -i \\ 0 &amp; i &amp;  0 \end{pmatrix}, &amp; 
  \lambda_8 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
                &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} span all [[trace (linear algebra)|traceless]] [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] {{mvar|H}} of the [[Lie algebra]], as required. Note that {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;}} are antisymmetric.

They obey the relations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \left[T_a, T_b\right] &amp;= i \sum_{c=1}^8 f_{abc} T_c, \\
  \left\{T_a, T_b\right\} &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \delta_{ab} I_3 + \sum_{c=1}^8 d_{abc} T_c,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:(or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_a, \lambda_b\} = \frac{4}{3}\delta_{ab} I_3 + 2\sum_{c=1}^8{d_{abc} \lambda_c}&lt;/math&gt;).

The {{mvar|f}} are the [[structure constants]] of the Lie algebra, given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                                      f_{123} &amp;= 1 \\
  f_{147} = -f_{156} = f_{246} = f_{257} = f_{345} = -f_{367} &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \\
                                           f_{458} =  f_{678} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- Make alignment more good --&gt;

while all other {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} not related to these by permutation are zero. In general, they vanish, unless they contain an odd number of indices from the set {2, 5, 7}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;So fewer than 1/6 of all {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;''}}s are non-vanishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetric coefficients {{math|''d''}} take the values:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  d_{118} = d_{228} =  d_{338} = -d_{888} &amp;=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}  \\
  d_{448} = d_{558} =  d_{668} =  d_{778} &amp;= -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}} \\
  d_{146} = d_{157} = -d_{247} =  d_{256} = d_{344} = d_{355} = -d_{366} = -d_{377}
                                          &amp;= \frac{1}{2}~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- Make alignment more good --&gt;

They vanish if the number of indices  from the set {2, 5, 7} is odd.

A generic {{math|SU(3)}} group element generated by a traceless 3×3 Hermitian matrix {{mvar|H}}, normalized as {{math|tr(''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) {{=}} 2}}, can be expressed as a ''second order'' matrix polynomial in {{mvar|H}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosen|first1=S P|title=Finite Transformations in Various Representations of SU(3)|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=12|issue=4|year=1971|pages=673 |doi=10.1063/1.1665634|bibcode=1971JMP....12..673R}};  {{cite journal|doi=     10.1016/S0034-4877(15)30040-9|title= Elementary results for the fundamental representation of SU(3)|author1= Curtright, T L|author2=Zachos, C K|year=2015|journal=Reports On Mathematical Physics|volume=76|pages=401–404|bibcode=2015RpMP...76..401C|arxiv=1508.00868}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \exp(i\theta H) ={}
          &amp;\left[-\frac{1}{3} I\sin\left(\varphi + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \sin\left(\varphi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}~H\sin(\varphi) - \frac{1}{4}~H^2\right]
           \frac{\exp\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}~i\theta\sin(\varphi)\right)}
                {\cos\left(\varphi + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \cos\left(\varphi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\[4pt]
    {}+{} &amp;\left[-\frac{1}{3}~I\sin(\varphi) \sin\left(\varphi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}~H\sin\left(\varphi + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{4}~H^{2}\right]
           \frac{\exp\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}~i\theta \sin\left(\varphi + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\right)}
                {\cos(\varphi) \cos\left(\varphi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)} \\[4pt]
    {}+{} &amp;\left[-\frac{1}{3}~I\sin(\varphi) \sin\left(\varphi + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}~H \sin\left(\varphi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{4}~H^2\right]
           \frac{\exp\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}~i\theta \sin\left(\varphi - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\right)}
                {\cos(\varphi)\cos\left(\varphi + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi \equiv \frac{1}{3}\left[\arccos\left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\det H\right) - \frac{\pi}{2}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

==Lie algebra structure==
As noted above, the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{su}(n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[skew Hermitian matrix|skew-Hermitian]] matrices with trace zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.24&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[complexification]] of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{su}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sl}(n; \mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;, the space of all &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; complex matrices with trace zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 3.6&lt;/ref&gt; A Cartan subalgebra then consists of the diagonal matrices with trace zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.7.1&lt;/ref&gt; which we identify with vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^n&lt;/math&gt; whose entries sum to zero. The [[root system|roots]] then consist of all the {{nowrap|{{math|''n''(''n'' − 1)}}}} permutations of {{math|(1, −1, 0, ..., 0)}}.

A choice of [[simple root (root system)|simple root]]s is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (&amp;1, -1,  0, \dots, 0,  0), \\
  (&amp;0,  1, -1, \dots, 0,  0), \\
   &amp;\vdots                    \\
  (&amp;0,  0,  0, \dots, 1, -1).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So, {{math|SU(''n'')}} is of [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' − 1}}}} and its [[Dynkin diagram]] is given by {{math|A&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, a chain of {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' − 1}} }} nodes: {{Dynkin|node|3|node|3|node|3}}...{{Dynkin|3|node}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 8.10.1&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Cartan matrix]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
     2 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
    -1 &amp;  2 &amp; -1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; -1 &amp;  2 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
     \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 2
  \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Its [[Weyl group]] or [[Coxeter group]] is the [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[symmetry group]] of the {{nowrap|{{math|(''n'' − 1)}}}}-[[simplex]].

==Generalized special unitary group==
For a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''F''}}, the '''generalized special unitary group over ''F''''', {{math|SU(''p'', ''q''; ''F'')}}, is the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[linear transformation]]s of [[determinant]] 1 of a [[vector space]] of rank {{nowrap|{{math|1=''n'' = ''p'' + ''q''}}}} over {{math|''F''}} which leave invariant a [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]], [[Hermitian form]] of [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}. This group is often referred to as the '''special unitary group of signature {{math|''p q''}} over {{math|''F''}}'''. The field {{math|''F''}} can be replaced by a [[commutative ring]], in which case the vector space is replaced by a [[free module]].

Specifically, fix a [[Hermitian matrix]] {{math|''A''}} of signature {{math|''p q''}} in {{math|GL(''n'', '''R''')}}, then all
:&lt;math&gt;M \in \operatorname{SU}(p, q, R)&lt;/math&gt;

satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  M^{*} A M &amp;= A \\
     \det M &amp;= 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Often one will see the notation {{math|SU(''p'', ''q'')}} without reference to a ring or field; in this case, the ring or field being referred to is {{math|'''C'''}} and this gives one of the classical [[Lie groups]]. The standard choice for {{math|''A''}} when {{nowrap|{{math|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}}} is
: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 &amp; 0       &amp; i \\
     0 &amp; I_{n-2} &amp; 0 \\
    -i &amp; 0       &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

However, there may be better choices for {{math|''A''}} for certain dimensions which exhibit more behaviour under restriction to subrings of {{math|'''C'''}}.

===Example===
An important example of this type of group is the [[Picard modular group]] {{math|SU(2, 1; '''Z'''[''i''])}} which acts (projectively) on complex hyperbolic space of degree two, in the same way that {{math|SL(2,9;'''Z''')}} acts (projectively) on real [[hyperbolic space]] of dimension two. In 2005 Gábor Francsics and [[Peter Lax]] computed an explicit fundamental domain for the action of this group on {{math|HC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |arxiv=math/0509708 |date=September 2005 |title=An Explicit Fundamental Domain For The Picard Modular Group In Two Complex Dimensions |last1=Francsics |first1=Gabor |last2=Lax |first2=Peter D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further example is {{math|SU(1, 1; '''C''')}}, which is isomorphic to {{math|SL(2,'''R''')}}.

==Important subgroups==
In physics the special unitary group is used to represent [[bosonic]] symmetries. In theories of [[symmetry breaking]] it is important to be able to find the subgroups of the special unitary group. Subgroups of {{math|SU(''n'')}} that are important in [[Grand unification theory|GUT physics]] are, for {{nowrap|{{math|''p'' &gt; 1, ''n'' − ''p'' &gt; 1}} }},
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SU}(n) \supset \operatorname{SU}(p) \times \operatorname{SU}(n - p) \times \operatorname{U}(1),&lt;/math&gt;

where × denotes the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] and {{math|U(1)}}, known as the [[circle group]], is the multiplicative group of all [[complex number]]s with [[absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]] 1.

For completeness, there are also the [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] and [[compact symplectic group|symplectic]] subgroups,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \operatorname{SU}(n) &amp;\supset \operatorname{SO}(n), \\
  \operatorname{SU}(2n) &amp;\supset \operatorname{Sp}(n).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[rank of a Lie group|rank]] of {{math|SU(n)}} is {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' − 1}} }} and of {{math|U(1)}} is 1, a useful check is that the sum of the ranks of the subgroups is less than or equal to the rank of the original group. {{math|SU(''n'')}} is a subgroup of various other Lie groups,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \operatorname{SO}(2n) &amp;\supset \operatorname{SU}(n) \\
    \operatorname{Sp}(n) &amp;\supset \operatorname{SU}(n) \\
  \operatorname{Spin}(4) &amp;= \operatorname{SU}(2) \times \operatorname{SU}(2) \\
      \operatorname{E}_6 &amp;\supset \operatorname{SU}(6) \\
      \operatorname{E}_7 &amp;\supset \operatorname{SU}(8) \\
      \operatorname{G}_2 &amp;\supset \operatorname{SU}(3)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
See [[spin group]], and [[simple Lie groups]] for E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

There are also the [[Spin group#Accidental isomorphisms|accidental isomorphisms]]:   {{nowrap|{{math|1 = SU(4) = Spin(6)}} }}, {{nowrap|{{math|1 = SU(2) = Spin(3) = Sp(1)}} }},&lt;ref group=nb&gt;{{math|Sp(''n'')}} is the [[compact real form]] of {{math|Sp(2''n'', '''C''')}}. It is sometimes denoted {{math|USp(''2n'')}}. The dimension of the {{math|Sp(''n'')}}-matrices is {{math|2''n'' × 2''n''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nowrap|{{math|1 = U(1) = Spin(2) = SO(2)}} }}.

One may finally mention that {{math|SU(2)}} is the [[double covering group]] of {{math|SO(3)}}, a relation that plays an important role in the theory of rotations of 2-[[spinor]]s in non-relativistic [[quantum mechanics]].

The ''Summa'' is the first printed work on algebra in a [[vernacular]] language, and it contains the first published description of the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Treasures - Pacioli's Summa|last=Swetz|first=Frank J|last2=Katz|first2=Victor J|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|work=Loci|date=January 2011|url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-paciolis-summa|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set a new standard for writing and argumentation about algebra,&lt;ref name="argument"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Heeffer|first=Albrecht|title=From Problem Solving to Argumentation: Pacioli’s Appropriation of Abbacus Algebra|publisher=[[Ghent University]]|url=http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/Argumentation2.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its impact upon the subsequent development and standardization of professional accounting methods was so great that Pacioli is sometimes referred to as the "father of accounting."&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting|last=Smith|first=L Murphy|date=2011|publisher=[[American Accounting Association]]|url=http://aaahq.org/southwest/pacioli.htm|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Summa de arithmetica'' as originally printed consists of ten chapters on a series of mathematical topics, collectively covering essentially all of Renaissance mathematics. The first seven chapters form a summary of arithmetic in 222 pages. The eighth chapter explains contemporary algebra in 78 pages. The ninth chapter discusses various topics relevant to business and trade, including [[barter]], [[bills of exchange]], weights and measures and [[bookkeeping]], in 150 pages. The tenth and final chapter describes practical geometry (including basic [[trigonometry]]) in 151 pages.&lt;ref name="MARKET"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sangster|first=Alan|last2=Stoner|first2=Gregory N|last3=McCarthy|first3=Patricia|title=THE MARKET FOR LUCA PACIOLI’S ''SUMMA ARITHMETICA''|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|volume=35|number=1|date=June 2008|pages=111–134|url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was dedicated to [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], Duke of [[Urbino]], a patron of the arts whom Pacioli had met in Rome some years earlier.

The book's mathematical content draws heavily on the traditions of the [[abacus school]]s of contemporary northern Italy, where the children of merchants and the middle class studied arithmetic on the model established by [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. The emphasis of this tradition was on facility with computation, using the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], developed through exposure to numerous example problems and case studies drawn principally from business and trade. Pacioli's work likewise teaches through examples, but it also develops arguments for the validity of its solutions through reference to general principles, axioms and logical proof. In this way the ''Summa'' begins to reintegrate the logical methods of classical Greek geometry into the medieval discipline of algebra.&lt;ref name="history of thought"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Pacioli, Luca|encyclopedia=Il Contributo italiano alla storia del Pensiero – Scienze|language=Italian|year=2013|last=Napolitani|first=Pier Daniele|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Il-Contributo-italiano-alla-storia-del-Pensiero:-Scienze%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookkeeping and finance===
Within the chapter on business, a section entitled ''Particularis de computis et scripturis'' (''Details of calculation and recording'') describes the accounting methods then in use among northern-Italian merchants, including [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]], [[trial balance]]s, [[balance sheet]]s and various other tools still employed by professional accountants. The business chapter also introduces the [[rule of 72]] for predicting an investment's [[future value]], anticipating the development of the [[logarithm]] by more than century.&lt;ref name="paccioliLog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Pacioli_logarithm.html|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]|website=MacTutor|title=A Napierian logarithm before Napier|last=O'Connor|first=John J|last2=Robertson|first2=Edmund F|date=March 2006|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques did not originate with Pacioli, who merely recorded and explained the established best practices of contemporary businesspeople in his region; still, the ''Summa'''s role in standardizing and disseminating professional bookkeeping methods has earned Pacioli a reputation as the "father of accounting."&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; 

==History and impact==
[[Image:Pacioli summa stamp.jpg|thumb|1994 Italian 750-lira postage stamp commemorating the 500th anniversary of the ''Summa'''s publication]]
''Summa de arithmetica'' was composed over a period of decades through Pacioli's work as a professor of mathematics, and was probably intended as a textbook and reference work for students of mathematics and business, especially among the mercantile middle class of northern Italy.&lt;ref name="MARKET"/&gt; The book was originally published in [[Venice]] in 1494 by [[Paganino Paganini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an identical second edition printed in 1523 in Toscolano.

While the ''Summa'' contained little or no original mathematical work by Pacioli, it was the most comprehensive mathematical text ever published at the time. Its thoroughness and clarity (and the lack of any other similar work available in print) made it a basic point of reference for European mathematicians through the sixteenth century and beyond.&lt;ref name="history of thought"/&gt; The reputation the ''Summa'' earned Pacioli as a mathematician and intellectual inspired [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of [[Milan]], to invite him to serve as a mathematical lecturer in the ducal court, where Pacioli befriended and collaborated with [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

The book also marks the beginning of a movement in sixteenth-century algebra toward the use of logical argumentation and [[theorem]]s in the study of algebra, following the model of classical Greek geometry established by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name="argument"/&gt; It includes the first printed example of a set of [[plus and minus signs]] that were to become standard in Italian Renaissance mathematics: 'p' with a tilde above (p̄) for "plus" and 'm' with a tilde (m̄) for minus.&lt;ref name="MARKET"/&gt; Pacioli's (incorrect) assertion in the ''Summa'' that there was no general solution to [[cubic equation]]s helped to popularize the problem among contemporary mathematicians, contributing to its eventual solution by [[Scipione del Ferro]].

In 1994 Italy issued a 750-[[Italian lira|lira]] [[postage stamp]] honoring the 500th anniversary of the ''Summa'''s publication, depicting Pacioli surrounded by mathematical and geometric implements. The image on the stamp was inspired by the ''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', and contains many of the same elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Sovietesque Disappearance of Pacioli’s Rhombicuboctahedron|author=John F.

The '''Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire''' (Lotharingian Seminar of Combinatorics) is a peer-reviewed academic journal specialising in combinatorial mathematics, named after [[Lotharingia]].

It has existed since 1980 as a regular joint seminar in Combinatorics for the Universities of Bayreuth, Erlangen and Strasbourg. In 1994, it was decided to create a journal under the same name. The regular meetings also continue to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1911">In applied mathematics, '''Tikhonov's theorem on dynamical systems''' is a result on stability of solutions of systems of [[differential equation]]s.  It has applications to [[chemical kinetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Wlodzimierz |last=Klonowski |authorlink=Wlodzimierz Klonowski |title=Simplifying Principles for Chemical and [[Enzyme kinetics|Enzyme Reaction Kinetics]] |journal=Biophysical Chemistry |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1983 |pages=73–87 |doi=10.1016/0301-4622(83)85001-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |first=Marc R. |last=Roussel |title=Singular perturbation theory |date=October 19, 2005 |work=Lecture notes |url=http://people.uleth.ca/~roussel/nld/singpert.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theorem is named after [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov]].

== Statement ==

Consider this system of differential equations:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} &amp; = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t), \\
\mu\frac{d\mathbf{z}}{dt} &amp; = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;\mu\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, this becomes the "degenerate system":

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} &amp; = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t), \\
\mathbf{z} &amp; = \varphi(\mathbf{x},t),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equation is the solution of the algebraic equation

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that there may be more than one such function &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;.

Tikhonov's theorem states that as &lt;math&gt;\mu\to 0,&lt;/math&gt; the solution of the system of two differential equations above approaches the solution of the degenerate system if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \varphi(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is a stable root of the "adjoined system"

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\mathbf{z}}{dt} = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t). &lt;/math&gt;

Victor Schlegel (1843–1905)|title=Bibliotheca mathematica|year=1905|page=421|location=Leipzig|publisher=B. G. Teubner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA421}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]]. He is remembered for promoting the geometric algebra of [[Hermann Grassmann]] and for a method of visualizing [[polytope]]s called [[Schlegel diagram]]s.

In the nineteenth century there were various expansions of the traditional field of [[geometry]] through the innovations of [[hyperbolic geometry]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. Hermann Grassmann was one of the more advanced innovators with his anticipation of [[linear algebra]] and [[multilinear algebra]] that he called "Extension theory" (''Ausdehnungslehre''). As recounted by David E. Rowe in 2010:
:The most important new convert was Victor Schlegel, Grassmann’s colleague at Stettin Gymnasium from 1866 to 1868. Afterward Schlegel accepted a position as Oberlehrer at the Gymnasium in [[Waren (Müritz)|Waren]], a small town in [[Mecklenburg]].
In 1872 Schlegel published the first part of his ''System der Raumlehre'' which used Grassmann’s methods to develop plane geometry. Schlegel used his book to put forth Grassmann’s case, arguing that
"Grassmann’s ideas had been neglected because he had not held a university chair."
Continuing his criticism of academics, Schlegel expressed the reactionary view that
:Rather than developing a sound basis for their analytic methods, contemporary mathematicians tended to invent new symbolisms on an ad hoc basis, creating a Babel-like cacophony of unintelligible languages.
Schlegel’s attitude was that no basis for [[scientific method]] was shown in mathematics, and "neglect of foundations had led to the widely acknowledged lack of interest in mathematics in the schools."

The mathematician [[Felix Klein]] addressed Schlegel’s book in a review&lt;ref&gt;''Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik'' Jahrgang 1872, SS. 231–5&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing him for neglect of [[cross ratio]] and failure to contextualize Grassmann in the flow of mathematical developments. Rowe indicates that Klein was most interested in developing his [[Erlangen program]].
In 1875 Schlegel countered with the second part of his ''System der Raumlehre'', answering Klein in the preface. This part developed [[conic section]]s, [[projective harmonic conjugate|harmonic ranges]],  [[projective geometry]], and [[determinant]]s.

Schlegel published a [[biography]] of Hermann Grassmann in 1878. Both parts of his textbook, and the biography, are now available at the [[Internet Archive]]; see External links section below.

At the Summer meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]] on August 15, 1894, Schlegel presented an essay on the problem of finding the place which is at a minimum total distance from given points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schlegel from Hagen in Westfalen|title=On the problem of the minimum sum of the distances of a point from given points|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1894|volume=1|issue=2|pages=33&amp;ndash;52|mr=1557288|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1894-00242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 Schlegel became German national secretary for the international [[Quaternion Society]] and reported on it in [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]].

'''William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OM|GCVO|PC|FRS|FRSE}} (26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907) was a [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabiner |first=Judy |date=2002 |title=''Creators of Mathematics: The Irish Connection'' (book review) |url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/ims/bull48/BR4801.pdf |journal=Irish Math.

At the [[University of Glasgow]] he did important work in the [[mathematical analysis]] of electricity and formulation of the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]], and did much to unify the emerging discipline of [[physics]] in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor [[Hugh Blackburn]] in his work. He also had a career as an [[electric telegraph]] engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1866 by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the [[mariner's compass]], which previously had limited reliability.

Absolute temperatures are stated in units of [[kelvin]] in his honour. While the existence of a lower limit to temperature ([[absolute zero]]) was known prior to his work, Lord Kelvin is known for determining its correct value as approximately −273.15 degree [[Celsius]] or −459.67 degree [[Fahrenheit]].

He was [[ennobled]] in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/158/1/011001 Kelvin and Ireland] Raymond Flood, Mark McCartney and Andrew Whitaker (2009) ''J.

He was the first British scientist to be elevated to the [[House of Lords]]. The title refers to the [[River Kelvin]], which flows near his laboratory at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His home was the red sandstone mansion Netherhall, in Largs.  Despite offers of elevated posts from several world-renowned universities, Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining professor of [[Physics|Natural Philosophy]] for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement from that post.  The [[Hunterian Museum]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] has a permanent exhibition on the work of Lord Kelvin including many of his original papers, instruments, and other artifacts, such as his smoking pipe.

Active in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by [[George Eastman]] to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman [[Kodak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l6531208p5241376/ Lord Kelvin, Recipient of The John Fritz Medal in 1905] Matthew Trainer, ''Physics in Perspective'', (2008) 10, 212–223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and work==
===Family===
[[File:Thomson family lineage.png|330px|right|thumb|Thomson family tree: [[James Thomson (mathematician)]], [[James Thomson (engineer)]], and William Thomson, were all professors at [[Glasgow University]]; the later two, through their association with [[William Rankine]], another Glasgow professor, worked to form one of the founding schools of [[thermodynamics]].]]
William Thomson's father, [[James Thomson (mathematician)|James Thomson]], was a teacher of mathematics and engineering at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] and the son of a farmer. James Thomson married Margaret Gardner in 1817 and, of their children, four boys and two girls survived infancy. Margaret Thomson died in 1830 when William was six years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Thomson_James.html |title=Biography of William Thomson's father |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William and his elder brother [[James Thomson (engineer)|James]] were tutored at home by their father while the younger boys were tutored by their elder sisters. James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father's encouragement,  affection and financial support and was prepared for a career in engineering.

In 1832, his father was appointed professor of mathematics at Glasgow and the family moved there in October 1833. The Thomson children were introduced to a broader cosmopolitan experience than their father's rural upbringing, spending mid-1839 in London and the boys were tutored in French in Paris. Mid-1840 was spent in [[Germany]] and the Netherlands. Language study was given a high priority.

His sister, Anna Thomson, was the mother of [[James Thomson Bottomley]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (1845-1926).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1783–2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth===
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--first 3 paragraphs are not cited--&gt;
Thomson had heart problems and nearly died when he was 9 years old. He attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]], where his father was a professor in the university department, before beginning study at Glasgow University in 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any precociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age.

In school, Thomson showed a keen interest in the classics along with his natural interest in the sciences. At the age of 12 he won a prize for translating [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''Dialogues of the Gods'' from [[Latin]] to English.

In the academic year 1839/1840, Thomson won the class prize in [[astronomy]] for his ''Essay on the figure of the Earth'' which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity. Throughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategy during times of personal [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. On the title page of this essay Thomson wrote the following lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Essay on Man]]''. These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:

{{quote|
Go, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides; &lt;br /&gt;
Go measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; &lt;br /&gt;
Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, &lt;br /&gt;
Correct old Time, and regulate the sun;  }}

Thomson became intrigued with [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier's]] ''Théorie analytique de la chaleur'' and committed himself to study the "Continental" mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Unsurprisingly, Fourier's work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, [[Philip Kelland]] authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published [[scientific paper]]&lt;ref&gt;P.Q.R (1841) "On Fourier's expansions of functions in trigonometric series" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' '''2''', 258–262&lt;/ref&gt; under the pseudonym ''P.Q.R.'', defending Fourier, and submitted to the ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' by his father. A second P.Q.R. paper followed almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;P.Q.R (1841) "Note on a passage in Fourier's 'Heat'" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' '''3''', 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

While on holiday with his family in [[Lamlash]] in 1841, he wrote a third, more substantial, P.Q.R. paper ''On the uniform motion of heat in homogeneous solid bodies, and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity''.&lt;ref&gt;P.Q.R (1842) "On the uniform motion of heat and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' '''3''', 71–84&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper he made remarkable connections between the mathematical theories of [[heat conduction]] and [[electrostatics]], an [[analogy]] that [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was ultimately to describe as one of the most valuable ''science-forming ideas.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Niven, W.D. (ed.) | title=The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell, 2 vols | location=New York | publisher=Dover | year=1965 | at=Vol. 2, p. 301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambridge===
William's father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]]. In 1845 Thomson graduated as [[Second Wrangler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=THN841W|name=Thomson, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the First [[Smith's Prize]],
which, unlike the [[tripos]], is a test of original research. [[Robert Leslie Ellis]], one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner "You and I are just about fit to mend his pens."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1910) vol. 1, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and [[sculling]], winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbcf.org/history/timeline.php |title=Peterhouse Boat Club Fund – Timeline |publisher=Pbcf.org |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004103813/http://www.pbcf.org/history/timeline.php |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of [[mathematics]], physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination.

[[File:Hubert von Herkomer03.jpg|thumb|upright|Lord Kelvin by [[Hubert von Herkomer]]]]
In 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]]'s idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or "dielectric", and not by some incomprehensible "action at a distance". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the [[Faraday effect]], which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related.

He was elected a fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|St. Peter's]] (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845.&lt;ref name="physicsworld"&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=McCartney|title=William Thomson: king of Victorian physics|work=[[Physics World]]|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/16484|date=1 December 2002|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated [[Henri Victor Regnault]], at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the [[Professor of Natural Philosophy, Glasgow|chair of natural philosophy]] in the [[University of Glasgow]]. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student a few years before.

===Thermodynamics===
By 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] annual meeting in [[Oxford]]. At that meeting, he heard [[James Prescott Joule]] making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the [[caloric theory]] of heat and the theory of the [[heat engine]] built upon it by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Émile Clapeyron]]. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and [[mechanical work]] and for their mechanical equivalence.

Thomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot–Clapeyron school. He predicted that the [[melting point]] of ice must fall with [[pressure]], otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a ''[[perpetual motion|perpetuum mobile]]''. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.

In 1848, he extended the Carnot–Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the [[gas thermometer]] provided only an [[operational definition]] of temperature. He proposed an ''[[absolute temperature]] scale''&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2004), Ch.4&lt;/ref&gt; in which ''a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature ''T''° of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (''T''−1)°, would give out the same mechanical effect ''[work]'', whatever be the number'' T''.'' Such a scale would be ''quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1848) "On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol. 1, ''pp'' 100–106&lt;/ref&gt; By employing such a "waterfall", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of ''[[absolute zero]]'' about which [[Guillaume Amontons]] had speculated in 1702. "Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat", published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used −267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature.  Thomson used data published by Regnault to [[calibration|calibrate]] his scale against established measurements.

In his publication, Thomson wrote:

{{Quotation|... The conversion of heat (or ''caloric'') into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered}}

— But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's ''very remarkable discoveries''. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views.

Thomson returned to critique Carnot's original publication and read his analysis to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in January 1849,&lt;ref&gt;— (1949) "An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat; with Numerical Results deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.1, ''pp'' 113–155&lt;/ref&gt; still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. He was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In Carnot's theory, lost heat was ''absolutely lost'' but Thomson contended that it was "''lost to man'' irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world". Moreover, his [[theology|theological]] beliefs led to speculation about the [[heat death of the universe]].

{{Quotation|I believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on – I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing ''[[vis viva]]'' which is converted into heat; and that although some ''vis viva'' may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be ''precisely'' compensated and I think it probable that it is under-compensated.&lt;ref name="Sharlin 1979"&gt;Sharlin (1979), ''p.''112&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compensation would require ''a creative act or an act possessing similar power''.&lt;ref name="Sharlin 1979"/&gt;

In final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared "the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1851) "On the dynamical theory of heat; with numerical results deduced from Mr. Joule's equivalent of a thermal unit and M. Regnault's observations on steam" [https://www.google.com/books?id=NGGOnRx4aakC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol. 1], ''pp'' 175–183&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson went on to state a form of the second law:

{{Quotation|It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=W.|title=On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=March 1851|volume=XX|issue=part II|pages=261–268; 289–298}} Also published in {{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=W.|title=On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam|journal=Phil. Mag. |date=December 1852 |volume=IV |series=4 |issue=22 |pages=8–21 |url=https://archive.org/details/londonedinburghp04maga |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the paper, Thomson supported the theory that heat was a form of motion but admitted that he had been influenced only by the thought of Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and the experiments of Joule and [[Julius Robert von Mayer]], maintaining that experimental demonstration of the conversion of heat into work was still outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1851) ''p.''183&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the [[Joule–Thomson effect]], sometimes called the Kelvin–Joule effect, and the published results&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1856) "On the thermal effects of fluids in motion" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.1, ''pp'' 333–455&lt;/ref&gt; did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].

Thomson published more than 650 scientific papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314541/William-Thomson-Baron-Kelvin |title=William Thomson, Baron Kelvin (Scottish engineer, mathematician, and physicist) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1907-12-17 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applied for 70 patents (not all were issued).  Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following.

{{Quotation|In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it.  I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of ''science'', whatever the matter may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=W.|title=Popular Lectures and Addresses, Vol. I|year=1891|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|page=80|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JcMKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

==Transatlantic cable==
===Calculations on data rate===
{{hatnote|To understand the technical issues in which Thomson became involved, see [[Submarine communications cable#Bandwidth problems|Submarine communications cable: Bandwidth problems]].}}
Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of [[Walter Crum]];&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=36507|title=Thomson, William|first=Crosbie|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, [[George Gabriel Stokes]] wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of [[Michael Faraday]] on the proposed [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].

Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent – in modern terms, the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1854) "On the theory of the electric telegraph" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''61&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed his results in terms of the [[data signalling rate|data rate]] that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential [[revenue]] of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1855) "On the peristaltic induction of electric currents in submarine telegraph wires" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''87&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its [[profit (accounting)|profit]]ability.

Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by [[Wildman Whitehouse]], the [[electrician]] of the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]]. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be "abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible".

Thomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1855) "Letters on telegraph to America" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''92&lt;/ref&gt; pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger [[conductor (material)|conductor]] with a larger [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of [[Electrical insulation|insulation]]. He thought Whitehouse no fool, and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had attracted the attention of the project's undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.

===Scientist to Engineer===
Thomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir [[Charles Tilston Bright]] as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the [[specification]], supported by Faraday and [[Samuel F. B. Morse]].

Thomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship {{HMS|Agamemnon|1852|6}} in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after {{convert|380|mi|km}} when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the ''Engineer'' the whole theory of the [[stress (physics)|stress]]es involved in the laying of a submarine [[Submarine communications cable|cable]], and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1857) ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''154&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a [[character (computing)|character]] every 3.5&amp;nbsp;seconds. He patented the key elements of his system, the [[mirror galvanometer]] and the [[siphon recorder]], in 1858.

Whitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson's many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Sharlin (1979) ''p.''141&lt;/ref&gt;

The board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the ''Agamemnon'' had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, [[Cyrus West Field]] and [[Curtis M. Lampson]] argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work. A cable was completed on 5 August.

===Disaster and triumph===
Thomson's fears were realized when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigor.&lt;ref&gt;Sharlin (1979) ''p.''144&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint committee of inquiry was established by the [[Board of Trade]] and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse.&lt;ref&gt;"Board of Trade Committee to Inquire into … Submarine Telegraph Cables’, Parl. papers (1860), 52.591, no. 2744&lt;/ref&gt; The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Scientific Committee Appointed to Consider the Best Form of Cable for Submersion Between Europe and America" (1863)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1865, Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the {{SS|Great Eastern}} but the voyage was dogged by technical problems. The cable was lost after {{convert|1200|mi|km}} had been laid and the project was abandoned. A further attempt in 1866 laid a new cable in two weeks , and the recover and complete the 1865 cable. The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was [[knighted]] on 10 November 1866.

To exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson now entered into a partnership with [[C.F. Varley]] and [[Fleeming Jenkin]]. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an [[automatic curb sender]], a kind of [[telegraph key]] for sending messages on a cable.

===Later expeditions===
Thomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic [[submarine communications cable]] of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student [[James Alfred Ewing]]. He was present at the laying of the [[Belém|Pará]] to [[Pernambuco]] section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873.

Thomson's wife died on 17 June 1870, and he resolved to make changes in his life.

His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the board of enquiry into the sinking of {{HMS|Captain|1869|6}}.

In June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the ''Hooper'', bound for [[Lisbon]] with {{convert|2500|mi|km|-1}} of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in [[Madeira]] followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the ''Lalla Rookh''. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence "Will you marry me?" and Fanny signalled back "Yes". Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on 24 June 1874.

===Thomson and Tait: ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy''===
{{Main|Treatise on Natural Philosophy}}
Over the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on a [[text book]] that founded the study of [[mechanics]] first on the mathematics of [[kinematics]], the description of motion without regard to [[force]]. The text developed [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] in various areas but with constant attention to [[energy]] as a unifying principle.

A second edition appeared in 1879, expanded to two separately bound parts. The textbook set a standard for early education in [[mathematical physics]].

===Kelvin's vortex theory of the atom===
&lt;!-- "Vortex theory of the atom" redirects here --&gt;

Between 1870 and 1890 a theory purporting that an [[atom]] was a [[vortex]] in the [[luminiferous aether|aether]] was popular among British physicists and mathematicians. About 60 scientific papers were written by approximately 25 scientists. Following the lead of Thomson and Tait,&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Thomson (1867) [http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_vortex_atoms.html On Vortex Atoms], ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'' 6: 94&amp;ndash;105&lt;/ref&gt; the branch of [[topology]] called [[knot theory]] was developed. Kelvin's initiative in this complex study that continues to inspire new mathematics has led to persistence of the topic in [[history of science]].&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, Robert H. (1963) ''William Thomson: Smoke Rings and Nineteenth-Century Atomism'', [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] 54(4): 461&amp;ndash;474.

===Marine===
[[File:DSCN1739-thomson-tide-machine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Thomson's [[tide-predicting machine]]]]
Thomson was an enthusiastic yachtsman, his interest in all things relating to the sea perhaps arising from, or fostered by, his experiences on the ''Agamemnon'' and the ''[[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]]''.

Thomson introduced a method of deep-sea [[depth sounding]], in which a steel [[piano wire]] replaces the ordinary hand line. The wire glides so easily to the bottom that "flying soundings" can be taken while the ship is at full speed. A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson.

About the same time he revived the [[Sumner method]] of finding a ship's position, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application. In 1876, he constructed a harmonic analyzer, in which an assembly of disks were used to sum trigonometric series and thus to [[Tide-predicting machine|predict tides]]. Kelvin mentioned that a similar device could be built to solve differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1107|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable [[compass]] to correct errors arising from [[magnetic deviation]] owing to the increased use of iron in [[naval architecture]]. Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction. The deviation due to the ship's magnetism was corrected by movable iron masses at the [[binnacle]]. Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles identified by [[George Biddell Airy]] and others, but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by [[The Admiralty]].

{{quotation | Scientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind. Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other hand, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors'.
&lt;br&gt;
The truth, inevitably, seems to lie somewhere between the two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley (2004), ''p.''259&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Charles Babbage]] had been among the first to suggest that a [[lighthouse]] might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light, but Thomson pointed out the merits of the [[Morse code]] for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes.

===Electrical standards===
Thomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of [[William Snow Harris]] were in accordance with the laws of [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]]. In the ''Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences'' for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring [[electrometer]], based on the old electroscope of [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]] and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the [[current balance]], also known as the ''Kelvin balance'' or ''Ampere balance'' (''SiC''), for the [[accuracy and precision|precise]] specification of the [[ampere]], the [[standardisation|standard]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[electric current]]. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer [[Magnus Maclean]] [[FRSE]] in his electrical experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maclean, Magnus, 1857-1937, electrical engineer |url=http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/maclean-magnus-1857-1937-electrical-engineer |website=University of Strathclyde Archives |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the [[Niagara Falls]] [[power station]]. Despite his belief in the superiority of [[direct current]] [[electric power transmission]], he endorsed Westinghouse's [[alternating current]] system which had been demonstrated at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of that year. Even after Niagara Falls Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system.&lt;ref&gt;David Lindley, ''Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy'', page 293&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] elected Thomson as its first President at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26–27 June 1906. "On the proposal of the President [Mr Alexander Siemens, Great Britain], secounded [sic] by Mr Mailloux [US Institute of Electrical Engineers] the Right Honorable Lord Kelvin, [[G.C.V.O.]], [[Order of Merit|O.M.]], was unanimously elected first President of the Commission", minutes of the Preliminary Meeting Report read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/pdf/IEC_Founding_Meeting_Report_1906.pdf | title=1906 Preliminary Meeting Report, pp 46-48 | website=The minutes from our first meeting | author=IEC | accessdate=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of the Earth: geology and theology===
[[File:Lord Kelvin Vanity Fair 1897-04-29.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Lord Kelvin caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1897]]
Thomson remained a devout believer in Christianity throughout his life; attendance at chapel was part of his daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;McCartney &amp; Whitaker (2002), reproduced on [http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/15/12/6 Institute of Physics website]&lt;/ref&gt; He saw his Christian faith as supporting and informing his scientific work, as is evident from his address to the annual meeting of the [[Christian Evidence Society]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, W. (1889) [[s:William Thomson's account of his Christian faith|Address to the Christian Evidence Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; 23 May 1889.&lt;ref&gt;The Finality of this Globe, Hampshire Telegraph, 15 June 1889, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the clearest instances of this interaction is in his estimate of the [[age of the Earth]]. Given his youthful work on the figure of the Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate the Earth's cooling and to make historical inferences of the Earth's age from his calculations. Thomson was a [[creationism|creationist]] in a broad sense, but he was not a '[[flood geology|flood geologist]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sharlin (1979) ''p.''169&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the [[laws of thermodynamics]] operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the [[solar system]] and other structures, followed by a gradual "heat death". He developed the view that the Earth had once been too hot to support life and contrasted this view with that of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past. He contended that "This earth, certainly a moderate number of millions of years ago, was a red-hot globe ... ."&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, Thomson saw evidence of the relatively short habitable age of the Earth as tending to contradict Darwin's gradualist explanation of slow [[natural selection]] bringing about [[biological diversity]]. Thomson's own views favoured a version of [[theistic evolution]] sped up by divine guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowler, Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler |title=The eclipse of Darwinism: anti-Darwinian evolution theories in the decades around 1900 |edition=paperback |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1983 |pages=23–24 |isbn=978-0-8018-4391-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His calculations showed that the Sun could not have possibly existed long enough to allow the slow incremental development by [[evolution]] – unless some energy source beyond what he or any other [[Victorian era]] person knew of was found. He was soon drawn into public disagreement with geologists,&lt;ref name="England et al 2007"&gt;Kelvin did pay off gentleman's bet with Strutt on the importance of radioactivity in the Earth. The Kelvin period does exist in the evolution of stars. They shine from gravitational energy for a while (correctly calculated by Kelvin) before fusion and the main sequence begins.  Fusion was not understood until well after Kelvin's time.

In his response to Huxley's address to the Geological Society of London (1868) he presented his address "Of Geological Dynamics" (1869)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/of_geological_dynamics.html |title="Of Geological Dynamics" excerpts |publisher=Zapatopi.net |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, among his other writings, challenged the geologists' acceptance that the earth must be of indefinite age.&lt;ref name="England et al 2007"/&gt;

Thomson's initial 1864 estimate of the Earth's age was from 20 to 400 million years old. These wide limits were due to his uncertainty about the melting temperature of rock, to which he equated the earth's interior temperature,&lt;ref&gt;Tung, K.K. "Topics in Mathematical Modeling" (Princeton University Press 2007), p.243-251. In Thomson's theory the earth's age is proportional to the ''square'' of the difference between interior temperature and surface temperature, so that the uncertainty in the former leads to an even larger relative uncertainty in the age.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=William|title=On the Secular Cooling of the Earth|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=XXIII|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the uncertainty in thermal conductivities and specific heats of rocks. Over the years he refined his arguments and reduced the upper bound by a factor of ten, and in 1897 Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, ultimately settled on an estimate that the Earth was 20–40&amp;nbsp;million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Burchfield | first=Joe D. | title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth | year=1990 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-08043-7 | page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hamblin | first=W.

His exploration of this estimate can be found in his 1897 address to the [[Victoria Institute]], given at the request of the Institute's president [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSeKh7OWAcgC|page=1095|title=The life of Lord Kelvin|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=45|issue=10|author=Silvanus Phillips Thompson|isbn=978-0-8284-0292-7|date=January 1977|bibcode=1977AmJPh..45.1010T|doi=10.1119/1.10735}}&lt;/ref&gt; as recorded in that Institute's journal ''[[Science and Christian Belief|Transactions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSeKh7OWAcgC|page=998|title=The life of Lord Kelvin|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=45|issue=10|author=Silvanus Phillips Thompson|isbn=978-0-8284-0292-7|date=January 1977|bibcode=1977AmJPh..45.1010T|doi=10.1119/1.10735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his former assistant [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] published a paper in 1895 challenging Kelvin's assumption of low [[thermal conductivity]] inside the Earth, and thus showing a much greater age,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, John (1895) "On the age of the earth," ''Nature'', '''51''' :  [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015038750868;view=1up;seq=266 224-227], 341-342, 582-585.

The discovery in 1903 that [[radioactive decay]] releases heat led to Kelvin's estimate being challenged, and [[Ernest Rutherford]] famously made the argument in a lecture attended by Kelvin that this provided the unknown energy source Kelvin had suggested, but the estimate was not overturned until the development in 1907 of [[radiometric dating]] of rocks.&lt;ref name="England et al 2007"/&gt;

It was widely believed that the discovery of radioactivity had invalidated Thomson's estimate of the age of the Earth. Thomson himself never publicly acknowledged this because he thought he had a much stronger argument restricting the age of the Sun to no more than 20 million years. Without sunlight, there could be no explanation for the sediment record on the Earth's surface. At the time, the only known source for the solar power output was [[gravitational collapse]]. It was only when [[thermonuclear fusion]] was recognised in the 1930s that Thomson's age paradox was truly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Frank D.|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=105|pages=13155–13158|year=2000|issue=B6|doi=10.1029/2000JB900028|title=Kelvin's age of the Earth paradox revisited|bibcode = 2000JGR...10513155S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1860–1861 Kelvin slipped on some ice and fractured his leg, causing him to limp thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Philips|first=Thompson S|title=The Life of William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained something of a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic until his death.

In the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902 (the original day of King [[Edward VII]]´s coronation),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Kelvin was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] and one of the first members of the new [[Order of Merit]] (OM). He received the order from the King on 8 August 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5679|date=2 September 1902|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn a member of the council at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 11 August 1902.&lt;ref name=LG27464&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27464 |date=12 August 1902 |page=5173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1907 he caught a chill and his condition deteriorated until he died at his Scottish residence, Netherhall, in Largs on 17 December.&lt;ref name="Times digital archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Death of Lord Kelvin|website=Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of [[Westminster Abbey]], the undertakers Wylie &amp; Lochhead prepared an oak coffin, lined with lead. In the dark of the winter evening the cortege set off from Netherhall for [[Largs railway station]], a distance of about a mile. Large crowds witnessed the passing of the cortege, and shopkeepers closed their premises and dimmed their lights. The coffin was placed in a special Midland and [[Glasgow and South-Western Railway]] van. The train set off at 8.30 pm for [[Kilmarnock]], where the van was attached to the overnight express to [[St Pancras railway station]] in London.&lt;ref name="The Scotsman, 23 December 1907"&gt;The Scotsman, 23 December 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Kelvin’s coffin was then taken by hearse to Westminster Abbey where it rested overnight in St Faith’s Chapel. The following day the Abbey was crowded for the funeral, including representatives from the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], along with representatives from France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Monaco. Lord Kelvin’s grave is in the nave, near the choir screen, and close to the graves of [[Isaac Newton]], [[John Herschel]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. The pall-bearers included Darwin’s son, Sir [[George Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Herald, 24 December 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Scotland the University of Glasgow held a memorial service for Lord Kelvin in the Bute Hall. Lord Kelvin had been a member of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], attached to St Columba’s Episcopal Church in Largs, and when in Glasgow to St Mary’s Episcopal Church (now, [[St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow]]).&lt;ref name="The Scotsman, 23 December 1907"/&gt; At the same time as the funeral in Westminster Abbey, a service was held in St Columba’s Episcopal Church, Largs, attended by a large congregation including burgh dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Evening Times, 23 December 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

William Thomson is also memorialised on the Thomson family grave in [[Glasgow Necropolis]]. The family grave has a second modern memorial to William alongside, erected by the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow; a society that he was president of in the periods 1856-58 and 1874-77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow | title=No Mean Society: 200 years of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow. 2nd Ed | year=2008 | page=138 | url=http://royalphil.org/Sessions/No%20Mean%20Society.pdf | isbn=978-0-9544965-0-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
===Limits of classical physics===
In 1884, Thomson led a [[master class]] on "Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light" at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kargon and Peter Achinstein (1987) ''Kelvin’s Baltimore Lectures and Modern Theoretical Physics: historical and philosophical perspectives'', [[MIT Press]] {{ISBN|0-262-11117-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelvin referred to the [[acoustic wave equation]] describing sound as waves of pressure in air and attempted to describe also an [[electromagnetic wave equation]], presuming a [[luminiferous aether]] susceptible to vibration. The study group included Michelson and Morley who subsequently performed the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] that undercut the aether theory. Thomson did not provide a text but [[A. S. Hathaway]] took notes and duplicated them with a [[Mimeograph#Papyrograph|Papyrograph]]. As the subject matter was under active development, Thomson amended that text and in 1904 it was typeset and published. Thomson's attempts to provide mechanical models ultimately failed in the electromagnetic regime.

On 27 April 1900 he gave a widely reported lecture titled ''Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light'' to the [[Royal Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Kelvin, Nineteenth Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light", reproduced in ''Notices of the Proceedings at the Meetings of the Members of the Royal Institution of Great Britain with Abstracts of the Discourses'', Volume 16, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvoAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363 p. 363–397]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[w:Philosophical Magazine|The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science]]'', Series 6, volume 2, pages 1–40 (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; The two "dark clouds" he was alluding to were confusion surrounding how matter moves through the aether (including the puzzling results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]) and indications that the [[equipartition theorem|Law of Equipartition]] in statistical mechanics might break down. Two major physical theories were developed during the twentieth century starting from these issues: for the former, the [[theory of relativity]]; for the second, [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Albert Einstein]], in 1905, published the so-called "[[Annus Mirabilis papers]]", one of which explained the [[photoelectric effect]] and was a precursor of quantum mechanics, another of which described [[special relativity]], and the last of which explained [[Brownian motion]] in terms of [[statistical mechanics]], providing a strong argument for the existence of atoms.

===Pronouncements later proven to be false===&lt;!--do not change this to "proved" because that breaks the link in many articles and because it's old-fashioned prescriptivism and an [[MOS:ENGVAR]] issue - see also https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prove--&gt;
Like many scientists, Thomson made some mistakes in predicting the future of technology.

His biographer Silvanus P. Thompson writes that "When [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]]'s discovery of the X-rays was announced at the end of 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax. The papers had been full of the wonders of Röntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until Röntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper &amp; seen the photographs, he wrote Röntgen a letter saying that "I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made"&lt;ref&gt;''The life of William Thomson, baron Kelvin of Largs'', [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwillthom02thomrich/lifeofwillthom02thomrich_djvu.txt vol2], "Views and Opinions"&lt;/ref&gt; He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=6002 The Royal Society, London]&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[N rays]].)

His forecast for practical [[aviation]] (i.e., heavier-than-air [[aircraft]]) was negative. In 1896 he refused an invitation to join the Aeronautical Society, writing that "I have not the smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation other than ballooning or of expectation of good results from any of the trials we hear of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/letters.html#baden-powell Letter from Lord Kelvin to Baden Powell] 8 December 1896&lt;/ref&gt; And in a 1902 newspaper interview he predicted that "No balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/interview_aeronautics_and_wireless.html Interview] in the ''Newark Advocate'' 26 April 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement" has been widely misattributed to Kelvin since the 1980s, either without citation or stating that it was made in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1900).&lt;ref&gt;''Superstring: A theory of everything?'' (1988) by Paul Davies and Julian Brown&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Kelvin said this,&lt;ref&gt;''Einstein'' (2007) by Walter Isaacson, page 575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horgan"&gt;''The End of Science'' (1996), by [[John Horgan (journalist)|John Horgan]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=S1Lmqh79dOoC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt; and the quote is instead a paraphrase of [[Albert A.

In 1898, Kelvin predicted that only 400 years of oxygen supply remained on the planet, due to the rate of burning combustibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP18980730.2.105 |title=Papers Past — Evening Post — 30 July 1898 — A Startling Scientific Prediction |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712214331/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19010716&amp;id=yCYiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AaQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5236,534844]&lt;/ref&gt; In his calculation, Kelvin assumed that [[photosynthesis]] was the only source of free oxygen; he did not know all of the components of the [[oxygen cycle]].{{dubious|reason=But isn't it overwhelmingly photosynthesis? See talk page.|date=March 2015}} He could not even have known all of the sources of photosynthesis: for example the [[cyanobacterium]] ''[[Prochlorococcus]]''—which accounts for more than half of marine photosynthesis—was not discovered until 1986.

'''Women in computing''' have shaped the evolution of [[information technology]]. They were among the first programmers in the early-20th century, and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements.

Since the 18th century, women have developed scientific computations, including [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]]'s prediction of [[Halley's Comet]], and [[Maria Mitchell]]'s computation of the motion of [[Venus]]. The first [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by a computer was designed by [[Ada Lovelace]] who was a pioneer in the field. [[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to design a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]]. Throughout the 19th and early-20th century, and up to [[World War II]], programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the [[Harvard Computers]], codebreaking at [[Bletchley Park]] and engineering at [[NASA]].

After the 1960s, the "soft work" that had been dominated by women evolved into modern [[software]], and the importance of women decreased. The gender disparity and the lack of women in computing from the late 20th century onward has been examined, but no firm explanations have been established. Nevertheless, many women continued to make significant and important contributions to the IT industry, and attempts were made to readdress the gender disparity in the industry. In the 21st century, women held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, such as [[Meg Whitman]], president and chief executive officer of [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], and [[Marissa Mayer]], president and CEO of [[Yahoo!]] and key spokesperson at [[Google]].

One of the first computers for the American ''[[Nautical almanac|Nautical Almanac]]'' was [[Maria Mitchell|Maria Mitchel]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=61}} Her work on the assignment was to compute the motion of the planet [[Venus]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=62}} The ''Almanac'' never became a reality, but Mitchell became the first [[astronomy]] professor at [[Vassar College|Vassar]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=71}}

[[Ada Lovelace]] was the first person to publish an [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by the first modern computer, the [[Analytical Engine]] created by [[Charles Babbage]].

Menabrea, came to the attention of Lovelace, who not only translated it into English, but corrected mistakes made by Menabrea.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=19}} Babbage suggested that she expand the translation of the paper with her own ideas, which, signed only with her initials, AAL, "synthesized the vast scope of Babbage's vision."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=19-20}} Lovelace imagined the kind of impact of the Analytical Engine might have on society.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=20}} She drew up explanations of how the engine could handle inputs, outputs, processing and data storage.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} She also created several [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] to show how the engine would handle calculations of [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli Numbers]] on its own.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} The proofs are considered the first examples of a computer program.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}}&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing" /&gt; Lovelace downplayed her role in her work during her life, for example, in signing her contributions with AAL so as not be "accused of bragging."{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=5}}

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States, more women were hired as human computers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}} Many were war widows looking for ways to support themselves.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}} Others were hired when the government opened positions to women because of a shortage of men to fill the roles.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=81}}

[[File:Annie Jump Cannon sitting at desk.jpg|thumb|[[Annie Jump Cannon]] working at Harvard]]
[[Anna Winlock]] asked to become a computer for the Harvard Observatory in 1875 and was hired to work for 25 cents an hour.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} By 1880, [[Edward Charles Pickering]] had hired several women to work for him at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] because he felt that women could do the job as well as men and he could ask them to volunteer or work for less pay.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=13}}{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} The women, described as "Pickering's harem" and also as the [[Harvard Computers]], performed clerical work that the male employees and scholars considered to be tedious at a fraction of the cost of hiring a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-female-computers-mapped-the-universe-and-brought-america-to-the-moon|title=How Female Computers Mapped the Universe and Brought America to the Moon|date=March 4, 2016|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=September 29, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women working for Pickering cataloged around ten thousand stars, discovered the [[Horsehead Nebula]] and developed the system to describe stars.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} One of the "computers," [[Annie Jump Cannon]], could classify stars at a rate of three stars per minute.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} The work for Pickering became so popular that women volunteered to work for free even when the computers were being paid.{{Sfn|Sobel|2016|p=105}} Even though they performed an important role, the Harvard Computers were paid less than [[factory]] workers.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}}

By the 1890s, women computers were college graduates looking for jobs where they could use their training in a useful way.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=103}} Florence Tebb Weldon, was part of this group and provided computations relating to biology and evidence for [[evolution]], working with her husband, W.F. Raphael Weldon.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=106}} Florence Weldon's calculations demonstrated that statistics could be used to support [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of evolution.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=107}} Another human computer involved in biology was [[Alice Lee (mathematician)|Alice Lee]], who worked with [[Karl Pearson]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=110}} Pearson hired two sisters to work as part-time computers at his Biometrics Lab, [[Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave|Beatrice]] and [[Frances Cave-Browne-Cave|Frances Cave-Brown-Cave]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=112}}

=== 1910s ===
During [[World War I]], Karl Pearson and his Biometrics Lab helped produce [[ballistics]] calculations for the British [[Minister of Munitions|Ministry of Munitions]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}} Beatrice Cave-Brown-Cave helped calculate trajectories for bomb shells.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}} In 1916, Cave-Brown-Cave left Pearson's employ and started working full-time for the Ministry.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=131}} In the United States, women computers were hired to calculate ballistics in 1918, working in a building on the [[Washington Mall]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=138}} One of the women, Elizabeth Webb Wilson, worked as the chief computer.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=139}} After the war, women who worked as ballistics computers for the U.S. government had trouble finding jobs in computing and Wilson eventually taught high school math.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=152}}

In the early 1920s, [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]], professor [[George W. Snedecor|George Snedecor]] worked to improve the school's science and engineering departments, experimenting with new punch-card machines and calculators.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=165-166}} Snedecor also worked with human calculators most of them women, including Mary Clem.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}} Clem coined the term "zero check" to help identify errors in calculations.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}} The computing lab, run by Clem, became one of the most powerful computing facilities of the time.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=167}}{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=169}} 

Women computers also worked at the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph]] company.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} These human computers worked with [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineers]] to help figure out how to boost signals with [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} One of the computers, Clara Froelich, was eventually moved along with the other computers to their own division where they worked with a mathematician, Thornton Fry, to create new computational methods.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170}} Froelich studied IBM [[Tabulating machine|tabulating equipment]] and desk calculating machines to see if she could adapt the machine method to calculations.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=170-171}}

[[File:'bombe'.jpg|alt=Woman working on a Bombe computing device.|thumb|left|Woman working on a [[Bombe]] computing device.]]
"Tedious" computing and calculating was seen as "women's work" through the 1940s{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=21}} resulting in the term "kilogirl", invented by a member of the [[Applied Mathematics Panel]] in the early 1940s.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} A kilogirl of energy was "equivalent to roughly a thousand hours of computing labor."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} While women's contributions to the United States war effort during [[World War II]] was championed in the media, their roles and the work they did was minimized.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} This included minimizing the complexity, skill and knowledge needed to work on computers or work as human computers.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} During WWII, women did most of the ballistics computing, seen by male engineers as being below their level of expertise.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=460}}  [[Black women]] computers worked as hard (or more often, twice as hard) as their white counterparts, but in segregated situations.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=47-48}} By 1943, almost all people employed as computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}}

NACA expanded its a pool of women human computers in the 1940s.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} NACA recognized in 1942 that "the engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they could."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1943 two groups, segregated by race, worked on the east and west side of [[Langley Air Force Base]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} The black women were the [[West Area Computers]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} Unlike their white counterparts, the black women were asked by NACA to re-do college courses they had already passed and many never received promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a24429/hidden-figures-real-story-nasa-women-computers/|title=The True Story of 'Hidden Figures' and the Women Who Crunched the Numbers for NASA|last=Blitz|first=Matt|date=February 3, 2017|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also working on ballistic missile calculations. In 1948, women such as [[Barbara Paulson]] were working on the [[WAC Corporal]], determining trajectories the missiles would take after launch.{{Sfn|Holt|2016|p=58-59}}

[[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to create a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]] and one of the first programmers of the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer, an electro-mechanical computer based on Analytical Engine. Hopper's work with computers started in 1943, when she started working at the [[Bureau of Ordnance]]'s Computation Project at Harvard where she programmed the Harvard Mark I.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Hopper not only programmed the computer, but created a 500 page comprehensive manual for it.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Even though Hopper created the manual which was widely cited and published, she was not specifically credited in the manual.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper is often credited with the coining of the term "bug" and "[[debugging]]" when a moth caused the Mark II to malfunction.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}} While a moth was found and the process of removing it called "debugging," the terms were already part of the language of programmers.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=176}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2515435/app-development/moth-in-the-machine--debugging-the-origins-of--bug-.html|title=Moth in the machine: Debugging the origins of 'bug'|last=|first=|date=September 3, 2011|work=Computerworld|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/12/googles-doodle-honors-grace-hopper-and-entomology/|title=Google Honors Grace Hopper...and a "bug"|last=Pearson|first=Gwen|date=December 9, 2013|work=WIRED|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adele Mildred Koss, who had worked at UNIVAC with Hopper, started work at [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) in 1965.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} There she developed algorithms for graphics, including graphic storage and retrieval.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

[[Mary K. Hawes]] of [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroghs Corporation]] set up a meeting in 1959 to discuss the creation a computer language that would be shared between businesses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Six people, including Hopper, attended to discuss the philosophy of creating a common business language (CBL).{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Hopper became involved in developing [[COBOL]] (Common Business Oriented Language) where she innovated new symbolic ways to write computer code.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper developed programming language that was easier to read and "self-documenting."{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=92}} After COBOL was submitted to the [[CODASYL]] Executive Committee, Betty Holberton did further editing on the language before it was submitted to the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] in 1960.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} IBM were slow to adopt COBOL, which hindered its progress but it was accepted as a standard in 1962, after Hopper had demonstrated the compiler working both on UNIVAC and RCA computers.{{sfn|Marx|2004|p=60}} The development of COBOL led to the generation of compilers and generators, most of which were created or refined by women such as Koss, Nora Moser, Deborah Davidson, Sue Knapp, Gertrude Tierney and [[Jean E.

In 1964, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] announced a "White-Hot" revolution in technology, that would give greater prominence to IT work. As women still held most computing and programming positions at this time, it was hoped that it would give them more positive career prospects.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=14}} In 1965, [[Mary Kenneth Keller|Sister Mary Kenneth Keller]] became the first American woman to earn a doctorate in computer science.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180}} Keller helped develop [[BASIC]] while working as a graduate student at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], where the university "broke the 'men only' rule" so she could use its computer science center.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180-181}}

[[Christine Darden]] began working for NASA's computing pool in 1967 having graduated from the [[Hampton Institute]].{{sfn|Edwards|Harris|2016|p=50}} Women were involved in the development of [[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]], including [[Judy Clapp]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} She created the prototype for an air defense system for Whirlwind which used radar input to track planes in the air and could direct aircraft courses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

In 1969, [[Elizabeth J. Feinler|Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler]], who was working for [[Stanford University|Stanford]], made the first Resource Handbook for [[ARPANET]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=112}} This led to the creation of the ARPANET directory, which was built by Feinler with a staff of mostly women.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=113}} Without the directory, "it was nearly impossible to navigate the ARPANET."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=116}} 

By the end of the decade, the general demographics of programmers had shifted away from being predominantly women, as they had before the 1940s.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=1}} Though women accounted for around 30 to 50 percent of computer programmers during the 1960s, few were promoted to leadership roles and women were paid significantly less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76-77}} ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' ran an article in the April 1967 issue about women in programming called "The Computer Girls."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=75}} Even while magazines such as ''Cosmopolitan'' saw a bright future for women in computers and computer programming in the 1960s, the reality was that women were still being marginalized.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}}

In the early 1970s, Pam Hardt-English led a group to create a computer network they named Resource One and which was part of a group called [[Project One (San Francisco)|Project One]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=100}} Her idea to connect Bay Area bookstores, libraries and Project One was an early prototype of the [[Internet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}} To work on the project, Hardt-English obtained an expensive [[SDS 940|SDS-940]] computer as a donation from TransAmerica Leasing Corporation in April 1972.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=98}} They created an electronic library and housed it in a record store called Leopold's in Berkeley.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=101}} This became the Community Memory database and was maintained by hacker, [[Jude Milhon]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=102}} After 1975, the SDS-940 computer was repurposed by Sherry Reson, Mya Shone, Chris Macie and Mary Janowitz to create a social services database and a Social Services Referral Directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=104-105}} Hard copies of the directory, printed out as a subscription service, were kept at city buildings and libraries.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=106-107}} The database was maintained and in use until 2009.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=107}}

In the early 1970s, Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler, who worked on the Resource Directory for ARPANET, and her team created the first [[WHOIS]] directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} Feinler set up a server at the [[Domain name registry|Network Information Center]] (NIC) at Stanford which would work as a directory that could retrieve relevant information about a person or entity.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} She and her team worked on the creation of [[Domain name|domains]], with Feinler suggesting that domains be divided by categories based on where the computers were kept.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120}} For example, military computers would have the domain of .mil, computers at educational institutions would have .edu.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120-121}} Feinler worked for NIC until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/elizabeth-jake-feinler/|title=Before Google and GoDaddy, There Was Elizabeth Feinler|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=June 18, 2012|work=WIRED|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalltalk was used by Apple to launch [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, the first personal computer with a GUI, and a year later its [[Macintosh]]. Windows 1.0, based on the same principles, was launched a few months later in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/11/engelbart_celebration/|title=The Mother of All Demos — 150 years ahead of its time|work=The Register|date=December 11, 2008|accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/tracing-the-origins-of-the-macintosh/|title=Tracing the Origins of the Macintosh|work=CNet|first=Dan|last=Farber|date=January 21, 2014|accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counteract this, the company launched a series of software titles designed towards women and publicised in ''[[Good Housekeeping]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Computer machismo|magazine=Sinclair User|date=November 1984|p=12|url=http://live.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek/magazines/sinclair-user/32#12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Borg, who had been noticing that women were under-represented in computer science, founded an email support group, [[Systers]], in 1987.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24671349/|title=Anita Borg; Helped Women Break Industry's 'Silicone Ceiling'|last=|first=|date=April 10, 2003|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=October 19, 2018|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, computing was dominated by men. The proportion of female computer science graduates peaked in 1984 around 37 per cent, and then steadily declined.

In the 21st century, several attempts have been made to reduce the gender disparity in IT and get more women involved in computing again. A 2001 survey found that while both sexes use computers and the internet in equal measure, women were still five times less likely to choose it as a career or study the subject beyond standard secondary education.{{sfn|Frieze|Quesenberry|2015|p=15}} Journalist [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] said a key problem has been [[personality test]]s in job interviews and the belief that good programmers are introverts, which tends to self-select the stereotype of an antisocial white male nerd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview|title=Why sexism is rife in Silicon Valley|first=Emily|last=Chang|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 17, 2018|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==

===Euclidean Space===

In [[real analysis]], the following result is called Young's convolution inequality:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last       = Bogachev
 | first      = Vladimir I.
 | title      = Measure Theory
 | volume     = I
 | publisher  = Springer-Verlag
 | location   = Berlin, Heidelberg, New York
 | year       = 2007
 | isbn       = 978-3-540-34513-8
 | mr       = 2267655
 | zbl       = 1120.28001 
}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;3.9.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose ''f'' is in [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)]] and ''g'' is in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{r} +1&lt;/math&gt;

with 1 ≤ ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' ≤ ∞. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\|f*g\| _r\le\|f\|_p\|g\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the star denotes [[convolution]], ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]], and

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_p = \Bigl(\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} |f(x)|^p\,dx \Bigr)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the usual ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm.

Equivalently, if &lt;math&gt;p, q, r \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r} = 2&lt;/math&gt; then 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} f (x) g (x - y) h (y) \,\mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}y
\le \left(\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} \vert f\vert^p \right)^\frac{1}{p}\left(\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} \vert g\vert^q \right)^\frac{1}{q}\left(\int_{\mathbf{R}^d} \vert h\vert^r \right)^\frac{1}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Generalizations===

Young's convolution inequality has a natural generalization in which we replace &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; by a [[unimodular group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If we let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be a bi-invariant [[Haar measure]] on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and we let &lt;math&gt;f,g:G\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; be integrable functions, then we define &lt;math&gt;f*g&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
f*g(x)=\int_G f(y)g(y^{-1}x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(y).
&lt;/math&gt;
Then in this case, Young's inequality states that for &lt;math&gt;f\in L^p(G,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in L^q(G,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p,q,r\in[1,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{r} +1 &lt;/math&gt;
we have a bound 
:&lt;math&gt;
\lVert f*g\rVert_r\le\lVert f\rVert_p\lVert g\rVert_q.
&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, if &lt;math&gt;p, q, r \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r} = 2&lt;/math&gt; then 
:&lt;math&gt; 
\int_G \int_G f (x) g (y^{-1}x) h (y) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)
\le \left(\int_G \vert f\vert^p \right)^\frac{1}{p}\left(\int_G \vert g\vert^q \right)^\frac{1}{q}\left(\int_G \vert h\vert^r \right)^\frac{1}{r}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a locally compact abelian group (and therefore unimodular) with the Lebesgue measure the desired Haar measure, this is in fact a generalization.

==Applications==
An example application is that Young's inequality can be used to show that the [[Weierstrass transform|heat semigroup]] is a contracting semigroup using the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm (i.e. the [[Weierstrass transform]] does not enlarge the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm).

==Proof==

===Proof by Hölder's inequality===

Young's inequality has an elementary proof with the non-optimal constant 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45799429|title=Analysis|last=Lieb|first=Elliott H.|last2=Loss|first2=Michael|last3=|date=2001|publisher=American Mathematical Society|others=|year=|isbn=978-0-8218-2783-3|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Studies in Mathematics|location=Providence, R.I.|pages=100|oclc=45799429|author-link=Elliott H. Lieb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We assume that the functions &lt;math&gt;f,g,h:G\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative and integrable, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a unimodular group endowed with a bi-invariant Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. We use the fact that &lt;math&gt;\mu(S)=\mu(S^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; for any measurable &lt;math&gt;S\subset G&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle p(2 - \frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{r}) = q(2 - \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{r}) = r(2 - \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{r}) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_G \int_G f (x) g (y^{-1}x) h (y) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)
= \int_G \int_G \left(f (x)^{p} g (y^{-1}x)^q \right)^{1 - \frac{1}{r}}
\left(f (x)^p h (y)^r \right)^{1 - \frac{1}{q}} \left(g (y^{-1}x)^{q} h (y)^r \right)^{1 - \frac{1}{p}}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)
&lt;/math&gt;
By the [[Hölder inequality]] for three functions we deduce that 
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_G \int_G f (x) g (y^{-1}x) h (y) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)
\le 
\left(\int_G \int_G f (x)^{p} g (y^{-1}x)^q \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y) \right)^{1 - \frac{1}{r}}
\left(
\int_G \int_G f (x)^p h (y)^r \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y) \right)^{1 - \frac{1}{q}}
\left(\int_G \int_G g (y^{-1}x)^{q} h (y)^r \,\mathrm{d}\mu(x) \,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)\right)^{1 - \frac{1}{p}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The conclusion follows then by left-invariance of the Haar measure, the fact that integrals are preserved by inversion of the domain, and by [[Fubini's theorem]].

==Sharp constant==
In case ''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 Young's inequality can be strengthened to a sharp form, via

: &lt;math&gt;\|f*g\| _r\le c_{p,q} \|f\|_p\|g\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckner|first=William|date=1975|title=Inequalities in Fourier Analysis|jstor=1970980|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=102|issue=1|pages=159–182|doi=10.2307/1970980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brascamp|first=Herm Jan|last2=Lieb|first2=Elliott H|date=1976-05-01|title=Best constants in Young's inequality, its converse, and its generalization to more than three functions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001870876901845|journal=Advances in Mathematics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=151–173|doi=10.1016/0001-8708(76)90184-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; When this optimal constant is achieved, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are [[Gaussian function|multidimensional Gaussian functions]].

The '''zero-crossing rate''' is the rate of sign-changes along a [[signal (information theory)|signal]], i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.&lt;ref&gt;* Chen, C. H., Signal processing handbook, Dekker, New York, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This feature has been used heavily in both [[speech recognition]] and [[music information retrieval]], being a key feature to classify percussive sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Gouyon F., Pachet F., Delerue O. (2000),[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/14f8be2c96ab2f55faec54d3e3876c5b1b69.pdf On the Use of Zero-crossing Rate for an Application of Classification of Percussive Sounds], in ''Proceedings of the COST G-6 Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFX-00 - DAFX-06), Verona, Italy, December 7–9, 2000''. Accessed 26 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZCR is defined formally as

:&lt;math&gt;zcr = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \mathbb{1}_{ \mathbb{R}_{&lt; 0} } (s_t s_{t-1}) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a signal of length &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{1}_{ \mathbb{R}_{&lt; 0} } &lt;/math&gt; is an [[indicator function]].

In some cases only the "positive-going" or "negative-going" crossings are counted, rather than all the crossings - since, logically, between a pair of adjacent positive zero-crossings there must be one and only one negative zero-crossing.

For [[Monaural|monophonic]] tonal signals, the zero-crossing rate can be used as a primitive [[pitch detection algorithm]].

==Applications==
Zero crossing rates are used for [[Voice activity detection]] (VAD), i.e., finding whether human speech is present in an audio segment or not.
