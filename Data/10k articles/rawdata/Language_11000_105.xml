'''Abe de Vries''' (10 January 1965) is a Frisian poet, essayist, literary critic, journalist, editor, translator, photographer, and one of the Frisian public figures leading the cultural and intellectual debate in Friesland.

== Biography ==

De Vries was born in [[Winaam]], a small village in the province of [[Friesland]], in the north of the [[Netherlands]]. He grew up bilingual; West Frisian was the community's everyday language, although it was not the culture language, which was, and still is, Dutch. After completing the secondary school Simon Vestdijk in Harns, he studied political science at the University of Amsterdam. At the time, in 1983, this study in Amsterdam still had a Marxist orientation, which would constitute an important influence in life and works of De Vries. While living in Amsterdam, he developed a major interest in literature, particularly in poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abe de Vries|url=http://www.sirkwy.nl/titel/254#.VmLpdXo3U_s|website=Sirkwy: Fryske Literatuerside|publisher=Tresoar|accessdate=1 December 2015|language=Frisian|date=2009–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his conscription De Vries remained in military service for another six years, now working as a contract-based intelligence-officer. From 1993 until 1996 he studied history in Groningen. His professor Frank Ankersmit, despite being an obvious [[Classical liberalism|liberal]], had a significant influence on De Vries's thinking, through his intellectual, theoretical approach of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abe de Vries|url=http://www.sirkwy.nl/titel/254#.VmLpdXo3U_s|website=Sirkwy: Fryske Literatuerside|publisher=Tresoar|accessdate=1 December 2015|language=Frisian|date=2009–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, De Vries educated the members of the peace keeping force in Bosnia and Croatia about the backgrounds of the conflict in those countries, and he wrote opinion articles on the conflict for every Dutch newspaper. In 1996 he became a journalist for the General Press Bureau Tammeling in Groningen. In 1999, motivated by dissatisfaction with the emotional and biased news coverage, he became a correspondent in Belgrade for the ANP, and the Dutch journals ''Trouw'' and ''Elsevier''. From 2000 until 2006 he was a foreign correspondent for ''Elsevier''. For his assignments he traveled to former Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Russia, and Afghanistan, as well as other destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abe de Vries|url=http://www.epibreren.com/rs/vries.html|website=Epibreren|publisher=De Dichters uit Epibreren|accessdate=1 December 2015|language=Frisian|date=31 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, De Vries was a contributing poet, and also a member of the editorial staff, for the innovative and wayward literary magazine ''Kistwurk''. In February 2003, De Vries started the literary magazine ''Farsk'', of which he was the chief editor until 2006. He also wrote a one-man magazine on the Internet, Oranzjery De Kopspiker, which, in 2010, was succeeded by the weblog Seedyksterfeartfisk. That has been the leading Frisian literary blog for a number of years, with content that informed the artistic-cultural as well as the environmental activist discourse.

In the beginning of 2005 he succeeded Jabik Veenbaas as the prose reviewer for the main Frisian newspaper the ''Leeuwarder Courant''. From 2006 until 2011 he was a publisher at the publishing house Friese Pers Boekerij/Noordhoek. Since 2011 he has been associated with the newspaper ''Friesch Dagblad'', first as a review writer for Frisian poetry and essayistic publications, journalist of common cultural topics and columnist of the weekly column "Skroeier", and since 2014 also as senior editor.

In 2015 De Vries, along with Friduwih Riemersma, started the literary magazine ''Fers2'', a digital platform for critical, independent literature and radical literary research.

== Poetry ==

In his youth De Vries started writing Dutch poems. In 2002 he made his début in Friesland with the collection ''De weromkommer yn it ûnlân'' (The returner in the nonland). Poems from this collection were published earlier in the Frisian literary magazines ''Trotwaer'', ''Hjir'' en ''Kistwurk''.

In his early poetry he sought a balance between the present and his lost youth in Winaam, with its related theme of lost love. Eastern Europe was also often a subject in his poems from that period. Later on, love, the search for the significant other, and the finding and subsequent losing of security, came to be the prominent themes for his poetry. In addition, this poetry expresses consideration for the West Frisian language, which is a dying language, and for the history and violation of the North Frisian coastal region, and the marginal position of the Frisian speaking artist. De Vries's lyrical poetry shows the development from primarily image-focused poems toward a broader, more narrative poetic style, in which the music of language has been given ample scope.

In 2005 De Vries received the Gysbert Japicx Award for his second collection ''In waarm wek altyd'' (A warm ice-hole forever). As a result, he was the fourth Frisian author, after Trinus Riemersma, Jan Wybenga and Willem Abma, who was awarded for a young oeuvre; there had never been such a short time between the start of the profession in the belles-lettres and receiving the Gysbert Japicx Award, as in the case of awarding the prize to De Vries.

In January 2013 the sixth collection was published, ''Ravensulver/Ravenzilver'' (Ravensilver). The seventh collection, ''Brek dyn klank'' (Missing your sound) came two years later, in 2015. ''Brek dyn klank'' further examines post-modern uprooted relationships, but from a more delicate perspective, and more drawn from experience than the earlier works, while at the same time preserving the classical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van der Meulen|first1=Jelle|title=Abe de Vries|url=http://home.planet.nl/~meul2882/fries/Vries,Abede.html|website=Friese-literatuursite|publisher=Jelle van der Meulen|accessdate=1 December 2015|language=Dutch|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Essays ==

De Vries is also one of the main essay writers in Friesland. Several of his essays have found their way as introductions to anthologies or omnibus volumes. The essay collections about the Frisian literature, ''Identiteit &amp; kowesturten'' (Identity &amp; cow tails, 2008), ''Erfskip &amp; krisis'' (Heritage &amp; crisis, 2015), and ''Winternocht &amp; moannereis'' (Winter joy &amp; moon journey, forthcoming), are an idiosyncratic mix of empirical literary history, philosophical cultural criticism, and personal reflection on his own roots. These diverse aspects are connected by a strong engagement. Furthermore, the last collection, ''Winternocht &amp; moannereis'', aims at the decanonization of the nineteenth-century Frisian literature.

== Photography ==

The photo works explore the interface between documentary photography and art photography. The Frisian landscape frequently is the subject and the muse. Some series were shown in gallery exhibitions; other photo series were published in photography books.

'''Articulatory synthesis''' refers to computational techniques for [[speech synthesis|synthesizing speech]] based on models of the human [[vocal tract]] and the articulation processes occurring there. The shape of the vocal tract can be controlled in a number of ways which usually involves modifying the position of the speech articulators, such as the [[tongue]], [[jaw]], and lips. Speech is created by digitally simulating the flow of air through the representation of the vocal tract.

== Mechanical talking heads ==

There is a long history of attempts to build mechanical "talking heads."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskins.yale.edu/featured/heads/heads.html Talking Heads]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speech synthesis#Mechanical devices|Mechanical devices]].[[Pope Silvester II|Gerbert]] (d. 1003), [[Albertus Magnus]] (1198–1280) and [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294) are all said to have built speaking heads ([[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]] 1837). However, historically confirmed speech synthesis begins with [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]] (1734–1804), who published an account of his research in 1791 (see also {{harvnb|Dudley|Tarnoczy|1950}}).

== Electrical vocal tract analogs ==

The first electrical vocal tract analogs were static, like those of Dunn (1950), [[Kenneth N. Stevens|Ken Stevens]] and colleagues (1953), [[Gunnar Fant]] (1960). Rosen (1958) built a dynamic vocal tract (DAVO), which Dennis (1963) later attempted to control by computer. Dennis et al. (1964), Hiki et al. (1968) and Baxter and Strong (1969) have also described hardware vocal-tract analogs. Kelly and Lochbaum (1962) made the first computer simulation; later digital computer simulations have been made, e.g. by Nakata and Mitsuoka (1965), Matsui (1968) and Paul Mermelstein (1971). Honda et al. (1968) have made an [[analog computer]] simulation.

== Haskins and Maeda models ==

The first software articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the mid-1970s by [[Philip Rubin]], Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskins.yale.edu/facilities/asy.html ASY]&lt;/ref&gt; was a computational model of speech production based on vocal tract models developed at [[Bell Laboratories]] in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues. Another popular model that has been frequently used is that of Shinji Maeda, which uses a factor-based approach to control [[tongue]] shape.

== Modern models ==
Recent progress in speech production imaging, articulatory control modeling, and tongue biomechanics modeling has led to changes in the way articulatory synthesis is performed [http://shylock.uab.cat/icphs/plenariesandsymposia.htm]. Examples include the Haskins CASY model (Configurable Articulatory Synthesis),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskins.yale.edu/facilities/casy.html CASY]&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Philip Rubin]], Mark Tiede [http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/tiede.html], and Louis Goldstein [http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1016450], which matches midsagittal vocal tracts to actual [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) data, and uses MRI data to construct a 3D model of the vocal tract. A full 3D articulatory synthesis model has been described by Olov Engwall. A geometrically based 3D articulatory speech synthesizer has been developed by Peter Birkholz (VocalTractLab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vocaltractlab.de VocalTractLab]&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Neurocomputational_speech_processing#DIVA_model|Directions Into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA) model]], a feedforward control approach which takes the neural computations underlying speech production into consideration, was developed by [[Frank H. Guenther]] at [[Boston University]]. The ArtiSynth project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artisynth.org Artisynth]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Sidney Fels [http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~ssfels/] at the [[University of British Columbia]], is a 3D biomechanical modeling toolkit for the human vocal tract and upper airway. Biomechanical modeling of articulators such as the [[tongue]] has been pioneered by a number of scientists, including Reiner Wilhelms-Tricarico [http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/tricarico.html], Yohan Payan [http://www-timc.imag.fr/Yohan.Payan/] and Jean-Michel Gerard [http://www-timc.imag.fr/gmcao/en-fiches-projets/modele-langue.htm], Jianwu Dang and Kiyoshi Honda [http://iipl.jaist.ac.jp/dang-lab/en/].

== Commercial models ==
One of the few commercial articulatory speech synthesis systems is the [[NeXT]]-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the [[University of Calgary]], where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of [[NeXT]] (started by [[Steve Jobs]] in the late 1980s and merged with [[Apple Computer]] in 1997), the Trillium software was published under a [[GNU General Public Licence]], with work continuing as [[gnuspeech]]. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Rene Carré's "distinctive region model".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~hill/papers/avios95/body.htm Real-time articulatory speech-synthesis-by-rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|right|An 18th-century edition of ''[[The Art of War]]'' made with bamboo strips]]

'''Bamboo and wooden slips''' ({{zh|s=简牍|p=jiǎndú}}) were the main media for writing documents in China before the widespread [[history of paper|introduction of paper]] during the first two centuries AD. (Silk was occasionally used, but was prohibitively expensive.)

The earliest surviving examples of wood or bamboo slips date from the 5th century BC during the [[Warring States period]]. However, references in earlier texts surviving on other media make it clear that some precursor of these Warring States period bamboo slips was in use as early as the late [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] period (from about 1250 BC). Bamboo or wooden strips were the standard writing material during the Han dynasty and excavated examples have been found in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loewe|first=Michael|chapter=Wood and bamboo administrative documents of the Han period|editor=Edward L. Shaughnessy| title=New Sources of Early Chinese History|publisher=Society for the Study of Early China|year=1997|pages=161–192|isbn=1-55729-058-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the invention of [[History of paper|paper]] by [[Cai Lun]] during the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|Han dynasty]] began to displace bamboo and wooden strips from mainstream uses, and by the 4th century AD bamboo had been largely abandoned as a medium for writing in China.

The long, narrow strips of wood or bamboo typically carry a single column of brush-written text each, with space for several tens of visually complex ancient Chinese characters. Each strip of wood or bamboo is said to be as long as a chopstick and as wide as two. For longer texts, many slips were sewn together used to make a kind of folding book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of China: History and Culture |last=Perkins |first=Dorothy |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-1579581107 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of interring books made of the durable bamboo strips in royal tombs has preserved many works in their original form through the centuries. An important early find was the [[Jizhong discovery]] in 279 AD of a tomb of a king of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], though the original recovered strips have since disappeared. Several caches of great importance have been found in recent years.

The Shanghai Museum corpus was purchased in Hong Kong the year after the Guodian tomb was excavated, and is believed to have been taken by tomb robbers from a tomb in the same area. The Tsinghua collection was donated by an alumnus who purchased it through auction, with no indication of its origin. The others are archaeologically excavated.

==Accoutrements==
One accoutrement used when writing on bamboo slips was a small knife which would be used to scrape away mistakes and make amendments. Decorated knives became a symbol of office for some officials indicating their power to amend and change records and edicts.

[[Image:KitchenBlocking.JPG|thumb|350px|right|''Blocking'' or ''backing'' intended for cabinets]]
[[File:Kilbarchan Scout Hall, Barn Green, Kilbarchan - geograph.org.uk - 961784.jpg|thumb|The blocking or ''solid bridging'' is not completely installed between these floor joists]]

'''Blocking''' is a general, American English term for the use of short pieces (blocks) of [[dimensional lumber]] in wood [[Framing (construction)|framed]] construction. Uses include filling, spacing, joining, or reinforcing members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blocking|work=dictionary.com|accessdate=10 February 2015|title=Blocking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blocking is typically made from short off-cuts or defective, [[Wood warping|warped]] pieces of lumber. The term ''Blocking'' is also sometimes used by people in construction to refer to discontinuous [[Shim (spacer)|shims]] or spacers. Names for similar materials in other forms of English include [[dwang]], nog, noggin, and nogging.

==Uses==
Some blocking is used structurally like [[cross bracing]] between [[joist]]s in a subfloor to prevent [[buckling]] and stiffen the floor. This use is also called ''block bridging'', ''solid bridging'', and ''solid strutting''.&lt;ref&gt;"Block bridging", ''RSMeans Illustrated Construction Dictionary''. Student ed. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire-blocking is a [[firestop]].&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Francis D. K., and Steven R. Winkel. ''Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2006 International Building Code''. 2nd ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007. 94 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blocks'' are spacers between studs such as where an interior wall attaches an exterior wall and for framing corners such as a "three-stud corner with blocking".&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Rick. ''Basic Framing''. Stirling Publishers: New York. 2008. 68. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocking is used for panel edge supports such as sheets of drywall or plywood&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Harry, and Harold Dana Hauf. ''Simplified Engineering for Architects and Builders''. 5th ed. New York: Wiley, 1975. 231. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; also called ''back blocking''&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, H. Leslie. ''Olin's Construction: Principles, Materials, and Methods''. 9th ed. Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocking, often called ''backing'' or sometimes ''grounds'',&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Craig. ''Trim Carpentry Techniques: Installing Doors, Windows, Base, and Crown''. Newtown, Conn.: Taunton, 1989. 68. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; also refers to pieces of [[wood]] or other material that run between [[wall stud]]s in order to provide support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as [[cabinets]], shelving, [[handrail]]s, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once [[drywall]], or any other material, covers the wall it can be difficult to find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a [[stud finder]], and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5940">'''Monsignor Brendan Devlin MA, DD''' (Irish: ''Breandán Ó Doibhlin'') (born 1931) is a priest of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Derry|Derry Diocese]]. He was born in [[Rouskey]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]. He was educated in [[St Columb's College]], Derry, [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth]], and the [[Pontifical Irish College]] in Rome.

In 1958, he became professor of modern languages at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, a position he held until he retired in 1996. On 2 September 2013 he was the principal celebrant  at the funeral of the poet Seamus Heaney.

==Homily for Seamus Heaney==
'''Homily of Monsignor Brendan Devlin at Funeral Mass''' (02. SEP, 2013)

Just as I hold that it is not for a Christian minister to embark on eulogy or to praise the talents and achievements of those who have  gone from us, neither is it for me to audit the virtues and good works of  Seamus Heaney, (after all, as Wisdom tells us of great men, “ their good works go before them”.) And yet, when we read that series of sharp witted paradoxes that we call the Eight Beatitudes and which are the core of the Sermon on the Mount, what you might call the identikit portrait of the ideal Christian, it cannot but strike us how many of them apply readily to our memories of Seamus Heaney.

“How blest are those of gentle spirit; those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail; those who show mercy to others; those who want to see peace established.”

How much of that is a description of the man we knew, of the brilliant literary critic, of the articulater of the years of pain in the North.

But understand me well, this not my effort to recuperate him, as the French say, to harness him in the ranks of the soldiers of Christ. How unsufferably patronising that would be! I think rather of something more deep-seated than such easy conformism. I remember something he wrote a lifetime ago when he recalled the early stirrings of a poetic imagination as he recited as an altar boy the words of the Litany: “Mystical Rose, Tower of David, Tower of Ivory, House of Gold, Ark of the Covenant, Morning Star.” I too recall such stirrings at devotions in the twilight of a May evening. Like many of our generation we had both inherited, he on the plains of South Derry, I in the hills of Tyrone, the imagination and with it the memory of a community. What was important was not so much the prayers we did or did not say as the prayers that had been said before us for generations, generations whose hard won loyalties were so authentically embodied in the man and so vibrantly expressed in his work.

Therefore as we commend Seamus Heaney to the mercy of the Lord, which is the primary purpose of a Catholic funeral Mass, we do so in the faith and hope of an age-old community, who lived their lives and died their death in the Lord Jesus and who, still living in that same Lord, await us their descendants and heirs in that eternal life which we hold to be sealed in us by our common baptism.

In that sense, all of us have long since been given to God by our forefathers in the Faith and by the hope which nourished them and which they looked to see fulfilled in us. The Gospel of Saint John quotes Jesus as saying: “Everyone the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes to me I will not cast out,” and as repeating: “Father, of those you have given me I have not lost anyone.”

In our natural consternation in the presence of death and the termination of our earthly supports, we can only turn our eyes on life in that spirit of Christian optimism which, it seems to me, breathes in much of the work of Seamus Heaney and which I believe to be his inheritance from our troubled past.

It was in similarly troubling circumstances, as the shadows of evening descended on that Upper Room of the Last Supper that Christ’s disciples heard him speak the words that we have just read in the Gospel. Amid the foreboding of those last days in the life of Jesus with their crowding events, commands and prophecies, they were urged by their Lord to overcome their sorrow through a renewal of their faith and trust in God.

“Let not your hearts be troubled,” He said. “I go to prepare a place for you and if I do so, I will come back to bring you with me, so that where I am, you also may be. And as for the way there, I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. “

As we part from Seamus Heaney for a while and send him from us on that way, what our forefathers called “slí na firinne”, we accompany him in faith and hope and with the viaticum of our prayers.

==Biography==
Devlin is an accomplished polyglot and popular teacher who is particularly known for his work in French and in Irish. For many years, he was rector of the Irish College in Paris and has also published three novels in Irish: ''Néal Maidine agus Tine Oíche'' (1964), ''An Branar gan Cur'' (1979) and ''Sliocht ar Thír na Scáth'' (2018).  He has also published translations from French into Irish by La Fontaine, Pascal and Saint-Euxperry.  He translated several books of the Bible into Irish.

In 2001, Devlin was invested as an Officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]], the highest French award available to a foreign national.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Legion d'Honneur for monsignor |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2001/1119/01111900013.html |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=11 November 2001 |accessdate=4 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caranqui''', or '''Cara''' (Kara), is an extinct, probably [[Barbacoan languages|Barbacoan language]] of [[Ecuador]].

Caranqui was replaced by [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], perhaps surviving as late as the 18th century. It seems in turn to have influenced [[Imbabura Quechua]]. There are similarities between Caranqui and the Barbacoan languages [[Pasto language|Pasto]] and [[Tsafiki language|Tsafiki]], so Caranqui is often classified as Barbacoan, but the evidence is not conclusive due its poor documentation.

      <comment>Text could be misunderstood as PHP and Python being examples of languages that have character data types, but not character literals.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''character literal''' is a type of [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] in [[computer programming|programming]] for the representation of a single [[character (computing)|character]]'s value within the [[source code]] of a [[computer program]].

Languages that have a dedicated character data type generally include character literals; these include [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html|title=Primitive Data Types (The Java™ Tutorials &gt;                     Learning the Java Language &gt; Language Basics)|website=docs.oracle.com|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/47zceaw7.aspx|title=Data Type Summary (Visual Basic)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Languages without character data types (like [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html|title=5. Built-in Types — Python 2.7.12 documentation|website=docs.python.org|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[PHP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.php|title=PHP: Types - Manual|website=php.net|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) will typically use strings of length&amp;nbsp;1 to serve the same purpose a character data type would fulfil. This simplifies the implementation and basic usage of a language but also introduces new scope for programming errors.

A common convention for expressing a character literal is to use a single quote (&lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;) for character literals, as contrasted by the use of a double quote (&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;) for [[string literal]]s. For example, &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; indicates the single character &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;"a"&lt;/code&gt; indicates the string &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; of length&amp;nbsp;1.

The representation of a character within the computer memory, in storage, and in data transmission, is dependent on a particular [[Character encoding|character encoding scheme]]. For example, an [[ASCII]] (or [[extended ASCII]]) scheme will use a single byte of computer memory, while a [[UTF-8]] scheme will use one or more bytes, depending on the particular character being encoded.

Alternative ways to encode character values include specifying an integer value for a code point, such as an ASCII code value or a Unicode code point. This may be done directly via converting an integer literal to a character, or via an [[escape sequence]].

'''Classical Arabic''' is the form of the [[Arabic language]] used in [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] literary texts from the 7th century AD to the 9th century AD.

The orthography of the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] was not developed for the standardized form of Classical Arabic.

[[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA) is its direct descendant used today throughout the [[Arab world]] in writing and in formal speaking, for example, prepared speeches, some radio broadcasts, and non-entertainment content;{{sfn|Bin-Muqbil|2006|p=14}} it is also used in modernized versions of the Quran and revised editions of poetries and novels from [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] times (7th to 9th centuries). While the [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] and [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] of Modern Standard Arabic are different from Classical Arabic, the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]] have remained basically unchanged (though MSA uses a subset of the syntactic structures available in CA).{{sfn|Bin-Muqbil|2006|p=15}} In the Arab world, little distinction is made between CA and MSA, and both are normally called ''al-fuṣḥá'' ({{lang|ar|الفصحى}}&amp;lrm;) in Arabic, meaning 'the most eloquent'.

==History==
In the late 6th century AD, a relatively uniform intertribal ‘poetic [[koiné]]’ distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the [[Bedouin]] dialects of [[Najd]], probably in connection with the [[Lakhmid]] court of [[Al-Hirah|al-Ḥīra]]. During the first Islamic century the majority of Arabic poets and Arabic-writing persons spoke a form of Arabic as their mother tongue. Their texts, although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts, contain traces of non-standardized Classical Arabic elements in morphology and syntax.  The standardization of Classical Arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century. The first comprehensive description of the ''ʿarabiyya'' "Arabic", [[Sibawayh|Sībawayhi's]] ''al''-''Kitāb'', is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts, in addition to the Qurʾān and Bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the ''ʿarabiyya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jallad|first=Ahmad|title=Polygenesis in the Arabic Dialects|journal=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics/polygenesis-in-the-arabic-dialects-EALL_SIM_000030?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics&amp;s.q=neo-arabic|language=en|date=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varieties of Arabic|"Colloquial" Arabic]] refers to the many regional dialects derived from Arabic spoken daily across the region and learned as a [[first language]], and as [[second language]] if people speak other languages native to their particular country. By the 8th century, knowledge of Classical Arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world, as it was the lingua franca across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Horn of Africa]] during those times; the analogy is like most literate Romance speakers were also literate in [[Classical Latin]]. Various Arabic dialects freely [[loanword|borrowed words]] from Classical Arabic, this situation is similar to [[Romance languages]], wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from [[Classical Latin]]. People speak Classical Arabic as a [[second language]] if they speak colloquial Arabic dialects as their first language, but as a [[third language]] if others speak other languages native to a country as their first language and colloquial Arabic dialects as their second language. But Classical Arabic was spoken with different pronunciations influenced by [[varieties of Arabic#Phonetics|informal dialects]]. The differentiation of the pronunciation of informal dialects is the influence from native languages previously spoken and some presently spoken in the regions, such as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in Egypt, [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Punic language|Punic]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in North Africa, [[Himyaritic language|Himyaritic]], [[Modern South Arabian]] and [[Old South Arabian]] in Yemen, and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in the Levant.

Notes:

:{{note|d|1}}[[Sibawayh]] described the consonant {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ط}}}} as voiced ({{IPA|/dˠ/}}), but some modern linguists cast doubt upon this testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics|last1=Danecki|first1=Janusz|date=2008|publisher=Brill|volume=III|page=124|chapter=Majhūra/Mahmūsa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|g|2}}[[Ibn Khaldun]] described the pronunciation of {{angbr|{{lang|ar|ق}}}} as a voiced velar {{IPA|/g/}} and that it might have been the old Arabic pronunciation of the letter, he even describes that [[Muhammad|prophet Muhammad]] may have had the {{IPA|/g/}} pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinrichs|first=Wolfhart|title=Ibn Khaldūn as a Historical Linguist with an Excursus on the Question of Ancient gāf|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8F_PW9P6dqlcWc1OUpBcFpLZTA/view|journal=Harvard University|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|s|3}}Non-emphatic {{IPA|/s/}} may have actually been {{IPA|[ʃ]}},{{sfn|Watson|2002|p=15}} shifting forward in the mouth before or simultaneously with the fronting of the palatals (see below).

:Notes: 
:* [e] might have been an allophone of short {{IPA|/a/}} in certain imalah contexts
:* In pre-Classical Arabic, [eː] arose out of contraction of certain Old Arabic triphthongs. Some Arabs said ''banē'' (&lt; *banaya) for ''banā'' ("he built") and ''zēda'' (&lt; *zayida) for ''zāda'' ("it increased"). This {{IPA|/eː/}} merged with {{IPA|/aː/}} in later Classical Arabic. A completely different phenomenon called [[imāla]] led to the raising of {{IPAslink|a}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} adjacent to a sequence {{IPA|i(ː)C}} or {{IPA|Ci(ː)}}, where C was a non-emphatic, non-uvular consonant, e.g. ''al-kēfirīna'' &lt; ''al-kāfirīna'' ("the disbelievers")
:* [ɑ(ː)] might have been an allophone of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} after uvular and emphatic consonants

==== Case ====
The A1 inscription dated to the 3rd or 4th c. AD in the [[Greek alphabet]] in a dialect showing affinities to that of the Safaitic inscriptions shows that short final high vowels had been lost in at least some dialects of [[Old Arabic]] at that time, obliterating the distinction between nominative and genitive case in the singular, leaving the accusative the only marked case:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12463830|title=Al-Jallad. 2015.

==== State ====
The definite article spread areally among the Central Semitic languages and it would seem that Proto-Arabic lacked any overt marking of definiteness. Besides dialects with no definite article, the Safaitic inscriptions exhibit about four different article forms, ordered by frequency: ''h-'', ''ʾ-'', ''ʾl-'', and ''hn-''. The Old Arabic of the Nabataean inscriptions exhibits almost exclusively the form ''ʾl-''. Unlike the Classical Arabic article, the Old Arabic ''ʾl'' almost never exhibits the assimilation of the coda to the coronals; the same situation is attested in the Graeco-Arabica, but in A1 the coda assimilates to the following ''d'', αδαυρα *''ʾad-dawra'' {{lang|ar|الدورة}} 'the region'.

In Classical Arabic, the definite article takes the form ''ʾal-'', with the coda of the article exhibiting assimilation to the following dental and denti-alveolar consonants. Note the inclusion of palatal {{IPA|/ɕ/}}, which alone among the palatal consonants exhibits assimilation, indicating that assimilation ceased to be productive before that consonant shifted from Old Arabic {{IPA|/ɬ/}}:

=== Verbs ===
{{Main article|Arabic verbs}}

==== Barth-Ginsberg alternation ====
Proto-Central Semitic, Proto-Arabic, various forms of Old Arabic, and some modern Najdi dialects to this day have alternation in the performative vowel of the prefix conjugation, depending on the stem vowel of the verb. Early forms of Classical Arabic allowed this alternation, but later forms of Classical Arabic levelled the /a/ allomorph:

}}Daga (Dimuga, Nawp) is a non-Austronesian language of Papua New Guinea. Daga is spoken by about 9,000 people as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/dgz/|title=Daga|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peoples that speak Daga are located in the [[Rabaraba]] subdistrict of [[Milne Bay Province|Milne Bay district]], and in the [[Abau District|Abau subdistrict]] of the [[Central Province (Papua New Guinea)|Central district]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daga Grammar|last=Murane|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Benjamin F, Ulson|year=1974|isbn=|location=University of Oklahoma|pages=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers ==
The people who speak Daga live in the Rabaraba subdistrict of the Milne Bay Province on Papua New Guinea. This province is about 5,405.4 sq mi (14,000km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with a population of 209,054 people. The
[[File:Papua_new_guinea_provinces_(numbers)_2012.png|thumb|266x266px|The Milne Bay Province is illustrates in section 10.]]
Economy of the province is brought by tourism, palm oil, and gold mining on [[Misima Island]].

During [[World War II]], the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] took place in the province giving it some other significance.

The [[Massim]], the people of Milne Bay, have exchanged culture with nearby islands and gained many rituals from nearby including the [[Kula ring]]. The people of the Massim are characterized by [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcabii.org/resources/provinces/Milne%20Bay%20Province.pdf|title=Milne Bay Province|last=|first=|date=|website=http://pcabii.org/resources/provinces/Milne%20Bay%20Province.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Milne Bay while distinct from, are still in culture sync with Papua New Guinea. The remote, wild, and pristine lands of Papua New guinea holds a lot of diversity. There are over 7000 different cultures in Papua New Guinea although there is only about 7 million people living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zegrahm.com/blog/papua-new-guinea-culture-introduction-ancient-traditions|title=Papua New Guinea Culture: An Introduction to Ancient Traditions|work=Zegrahm Expeditions|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Papua New Guinea have strong ties to music having spontaneous and coordinated acts of musical expression throughout the year.

== Grammar ==

=== Morphemes ===
In Daga, there are some rules for how to make morphemes. some include, the ending of [[Word stem|stems]] other than G, R, S, and W add /a/ if the next suffix is a [[Suffix|consonant-initial suffix]].  If the final consonant of a [[prefix]] is before a consonant-initial stem, the [[manner of articulation]] of the final [[consonant]] of the prefix is changed to match the manner of articulation of the initial consonant of the stem. When the [[morpheme]] has initial [[phoneme]] /w/ is comes before the vowel /o/ or /u/, the /w/ is lost in the final word. When the final phoneme of a preceding morpheme and the initial phoneme of a following morpheme are both [[Vowel|vowels]], the initial-vowel of the following morpheme is lost unless that phoneme is /i/, in which case it is left as is. For all [[Noun|nouns]], the final vowel is -e.

=== Stems ===
In Daga, word [[Word stem|stems]] are the part of the word that gives the word meaning. Compound word stems are often a verb stem followed by a combination of the verb yaw ("see") .

&lt;big&gt;wa ('say') + yaw ('see') = wayaw ('ask')&lt;/big&gt;

This works with all verb stems and completely changes the meaning of the verb stem. [[Verb stem|Prefix-derived verb stems]] are verb stems that follow one of four prefixes, wa-, to-, en-, and a-. These prefixes are used to classify the verb stem to identify a certain thing or group of thing. The prefix wa- on a verb stem makes the verb stem only apply to one subject. The prefix to- means that the verb will be changed to involve hitting a singular subject. The prefix en- means the action depicted by the verb is changed to match an action that involves sticking into an object. The prefix a- also adjusts the verb stem to involve biting. Adjective-derived verb stems are verbs that are created by using an adjective stem and verbalization to create a verb out of an adjective. For example, the word ''tama ('straight')'' followed by the verbalization ''-am'' creates an outcome of the word ''tamanam'' ('correct'). There are also noun-derived verb stems which like adjective-derived verb stems use a verbalization and a noun stem to create a verb from a noun. An example of this is when the word ''ago'' ('servant') with the verbalization ''-at'' becomes ''agat'' ('help'). This concept of deriving words from other stems of other classifications also carries across to nouns and adjectives, where Daga has verb-derived noun stems which is when a verb can be nominalized by the suffix ''-at'' and becomes a noun. Although the stems give meaning to the word, the word isn't complete without a suffix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Words ===
In Daga, like many other languages has many different classifications of words. [[Clitic|Clitics]] in Daga is a classification of word which can then be classified again down into 3 more classes, location clitics which describe are used to illustrate location of a noun, substantive clitics which are the last word in a substantive clause or a [[Nominalize|nominalized]] clause, and included-clause clitics are used to complete clauses using homophuous medical suffixes. Postpositions are a classification of words that are similar in their manner of usage as that of a clitic in which it is used to mark location, accompaniment, comparison, and temporal construction. Positionals can also be used with personal markers to give location or demonstrate accompaniment alongside a person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phrases ===
Long phrases are extremely uncommon in Daga.

In Daga, there are two [[Intensifier|intensifiers]], ''di'' which is used with any phrase to add emphasis, and ''iren'' is used after a noun, adjective, and positional to add specificity. Conjunctions are used to join phrases, clauses, and sentences. The conjunctions that do these things can be considered different classifications.

=== Interrogatives ===

=== Numbers ===
Numeral roots in Daga are created using an odd system. Daga only has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 and use the convention of using body-parts to represent numbers. For example, the word ''nani'' ('hand') means five and the word ''apen'' ('man') means 20 counting all the fingers and toes attached to that entity. These words along with the word ''yamu'' ('other') creates the phrases that illustrate numbers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''decimal separator''' is a symbol used to separate the [[integer]] part from the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part of a [[number]] written in [[decimal]] form.

Different countries officially designate different symbols for the decimal separator. The choice of symbol for the decimal separator also affects the choice of symbol for the [[thousands separator]] used in digit grouping, so the latter is also treated in this article.

Any such symbol can be called a '''decimal mark''', '''decimal marker''' or '''decimal sign'''. But symbol-specific names are also used; '''decimal point''' and '''decimal comma''' refer to an (either [[Baseline dot|baseline]] or [[Middle dot|middle]]) dot and [[comma]] respectively, when it is used as a decimal separator; these are the usual terms used in English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/decimal-point|title=Decimal point definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DecimalPoint.html|title=Decimal Point|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/decimal-point|title=decimal point Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aforementioned generic terms reserved for abstract usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/245510/how-to-change-excels-decimal-separators-from-periods-to-commas/|title=How to Change Excel’s Decimal Separators from Periods to Commas|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smartickmethod.com/blog/math/learning-resources/decimal-separators/|title=Decimal Separators: Points or commas? - Elementary Math|date=2018-01-19|work=Elementary Math|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many contexts, when a number is spoken, the function of the separator is assumed by the spoken name of the symbol:{{efn|Specifically, the symbol that the speaker uses in written numbers}} '''comma''' or '''point''' in most cases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/02/decimal-point.html|title=Mythematics: a decimal point|date=2012-02-17|work=Grammarphobia|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some specialized contexts, the word '''decimal''' is instead used for this purpose (such as in [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]-regulated [[air traffic control]] communications).

In mathematics the decimal separator is a type of [[radix point]], a term that also applies to number systems with bases other than ten.

==History==
{{anchor|Separatrix|Pythagorean arc}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], before printing, a [[overline|bar]] ( ¯ ) over the [[units digit]] was used to separate the integral part of a number from its [[fractional part]], e.g. 9{{overline|9}}95 (meaning, 99.95 in decimal point format). This practice derived from the decimal system used in [[Indian mathematics]]&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, L., and Reimer, W. ''Mathematicians Are People, Too: Stories from the Lives of Great Mathematicians, Vol. 2''. 1995. pp. 22-22. Parsippany, NJ: Pearson ducation, Inc. as Dale Seymor Publications. {{ISBN|0-86651-823-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized by the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Al-Khwarizmi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1305 Khwarizmi, Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Musa al-], Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Latin]] translation of [[#Arithmetic|his work]] on the [[Indian numerals]] introduced the [[decimal]] [[Positional notation|positional number system]] to the Western world. His ''[[Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'' presented the first systematic solution of [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s in Arabic. A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal separator, e.g. 99&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ins&gt;95&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Later, a "separatrix" (a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] (e.g. 99'''ˌ'''95), while an L-shaped or [[vertical bar]] ({{!}}) served as the separatrix in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |contribution=separatrix, ''n.'' |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When this character was [[typeset]], it was convenient to use the existing [[Comma (punctuation)|comma]] (99''','''95) or [[full stop]] (99'''.'''95) instead. 

[[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]] marked triples of columns with an arc (called a "Pythagorean arc") when using his Hindu–Arabic numeral-based abacus in the 10th&amp;nbsp;century. [[Fibonacci]] followed this convention when writing numbers such as in his influential work ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Man of Numbers: Fibonacci's Arithmetic Revolution |last=Devlin |first=Keith |authorlink= |year=2011 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=9780802779083 |page= |pages=44–45 |accessdate= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tables of [[logarithm]]s prepared by [[John Napier]] in 1614 and 1619 used the period (full stop) as the decimal separator, which was then adopted by [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] in his influential 17th&amp;nbsp;century work.

In [[France]], the full stop was already in use in printing to make [[Roman numerals]] more readable, so the comma was chosen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Enciclopedia Universal Santillana, 1996 by SANTILLANA S.A., Barcelona, Spain. {{ISBN|84-294-5129-3}}. Comma, def.2: "coma: MAT. Signo utilizado en los números no enteros para separar la parte entera de la parte decimal o fraccionaria; p.ej., 2,123."&lt;/ref&gt; Many other countries, such as Italy, also chose to use the comma to mark the decimal units position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It has been [[ISO 80000-2|made standard]] by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] for international blueprints.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 80000-2:2009|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31887|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, English-speaking countries took the comma to separate sequences of three digits. In some countries, a raised dot or dash (''{{visible anchor|upper comma}}'') may be used for grouping or decimal separator; this is particularly common in handwriting. 

In the [[United States]], the full stop or period (.) was used as the standard decimal separator.

[[File:Interpunct as decimal point in Henderson 1839.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Decimal separator in a British print from 1839&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas Henderson |title=On the Parallax of α Centauri|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1840MmRAS..11...61H&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf |periodical=Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 11, p. 64 |date=1839-01-03 |access-date=2015-03-26|format=PDF |language=en}} – Scan published by [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the nations of the [[British Empire]], although the full stop could be used in typewritten material and its use was not banned, the [[interpunct]] (also known as the decimal point, point, or mid dot) was preferred for the decimal separator in printing technologies that could accommodate it, e.g. 99·95.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, L., and Reimer, W. ''Mathematicians Are People, Too: Stories from the Lives of Great Mathematicians, Vol. 1''. 1990 p. 41. Parsippany, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc. as Dale Seymor Publications. {{ISBN|0-86651-509-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the mid dot was already in common use in the mathematics world to indicate multiplication, the [[SI]] rejected its use as the decimal separator. During the beginning of British [[metrication]] in the late 1960s and with impending currency [[decimalisation]], there was some debate in the United Kingdom as to whether the decimal comma or decimal point should be preferred: the [[British Standards Institution]] and some sectors of industry advocated the comma and the [[Decimal Currency Board]] advocated for the point. In the event, the point was chosen by the [[Ministry of Technology]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/218111c0| title = Victory on Points| journal = Nature| volume = 218| issue = 5137| pages = 111| year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[South Africa]] [[metrication|adopted the metric system]], it adopted the comma as its decimal separator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://laws.parliament.na/cms_documents/gg-4326-a7726e51e7.pdf |title=Government Notice R. 1144, ''Government Gazette'' 4326 |date=5 July 1974 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a number of house styles, including some English-language newspapers such as ''The Sunday Times'', continue to use the full stop.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The three most spoken [[international auxiliary language]]s, [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Esperanto]], and [[Interlingua]], all use the comma as the decimal separator. Interlingua has used the comma as its decimal separator since the publication of the [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/parts_of_speech/numerals.html Grammar of Interlingua: Parts of Speech – Numerals]&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanto also uses the comma as its official decimal separator, while thousands are separated by [[non-breaking space]]s: {{nowrap|''12 345 678,9''}}. Ido's ''Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido'' (Complete Detailed Grammar of the International Language Ido) officially states that commas are used for the decimal separator while full stops are used to separate thousands, millions, etc. So the number 12,345,678.90123 (in American notation) for instance, would be written ''12.345.678,90123'' in Ido. The 1931 grammar of [[Volapük]] by [[Arie de Jong]] uses the comma as its decimal separator, and (somewhat unusually) uses the middle dot as the thousands separator (12·345·678,90123).&lt;ref&gt;[http://evertype.com/books/dejong-gramat.html Gramat Volapüka. Cathair na Mart: Evertype.] {{ISBN|978-1-904808-94-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, disputes between European and American delegates over the correct representation of the decimal separator nearly stalled the development of the [[ALGOL]] computer programming language.&lt;ref&gt;Perlis, Alan, ''The American Side of the Development of ALGOL'', ACM SIGPLAN Notices, August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; ALGOL ended up allowing different decimal separators, but most computer languages and standard data formats (e.g. [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Fortran]], [[CSS|Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)]]) specify a dot.

==Current standards==
The 22nd [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] declared in 2003 that "the symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line". It further reaffirmed that "numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Resol22CGPM-EN.pdf], Resolution 10.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g.{{nbsp}}{{val|1000000000}}). This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States' [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf#10.5.2 |title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) |page=37 |first=Ambler |last=Thompson |first2=Barry N. |last2=Taylor |date=March 2008 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digit grouping==
For ease of reading, numbers with many digits may be divided into groups using a [[delimiter]],&lt;ref name="AMA10p793"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |page=793}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as comma "," or dot "." or space or underbar "_" (as in maritime "21_450"). In some countries, these "digit group separators" are only employed to the left of the decimal separator; in others, they are also used to separate numbers with a long [[fractional part]]. An important reason for grouping is that it allows rapid judgement of the number of digits, via [[subitizing]] (telling at a glance) rather than counting – contrast {{val|100000000}} with 100000000 for one hundred million.

Since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ViewCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=22&amp;RES=10&lt;/ref&gt; the use of spaces as separators (for example: {{val|20000}} and {{val|1000000}} for "twenty thousand" and "one million") has been officially endorsed by [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|SI/ISO 31-0 standard]],&lt;ref name="nist.gov"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2006_1122.htm#decimal |title=Decimals Score a Point on International Standards |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC),&lt;ref name="BIPM"&gt;[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]. "Rules and style conventions for expressing values of quantities": "[http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-3-4.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="old.iupac.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.iupac.org/reports/provisional/guidelines.html |title=Guidelines for drafting IUPAC technical reports and recommendations |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Medical Association]]'s widely followed ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'', and the [[Metrication Board]], among others.

The groups created by the delimiters tend to follow the use of the local language, which varies. In European languages, large numbers are read in groups of thousands and the delimiter (which occurs every three digits when it is used) may be called a "thousands separator". In [[East Asian culture]]s, particularly [[Chinese numerals|China]], [[Japanese numerals|Japan]], and [[Korean numerals|Korea]], large numbers are read in groups of [[myriad]]s (10,000s) but the delimiter commonly separates every three digits.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;!--see talk page--&gt; The [[Indian numbering system]] is somewhat more complex: it groups the rightmost three digits together (till the hundreds place) and thereafter groups by sets of two digits. One trillion would thus be written as 10,00,00,00,00,000 or 10 [[kharab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Special_Pattern_Characters|title=UNICODE LOCALE DATA MARKUP LANGUAGE (LDML) PART 3: NUMBERS|last=Emmons|first=John|date=2018-03-25|website=Unicode.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725183458/https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Special_Pattern_Characters|archive-date=2018-07-25|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention for digit group separators historically varied among countries, but usually seeking to distinguish the delimiter from the decimal separator. Traditionally, [[English-speaking countries]] employed commas as the delimiter &amp;ndash; 10,000 &amp;ndash; and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or {{val|10000}}. Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|SI/ISO 31-0 standard]],&lt;ref name="nist.gov"/&gt; as well as by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which have also begun advocating the use of a "[[thin space]]" in "groups of three".&lt;ref name="BIPM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old.iupac.org"/&gt; Within the United States, the [[American Medical Association]]'s widely followed ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'' also calls for a thin space.&lt;ref name="AMA10p793"/&gt; In some online [[character encoding|encoding]] environments (for example, [[ASCII]]-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.

===Data versus mask===
Digit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the [[separation of presentation and content]], making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any [[whitespace character]]s into the string of digits in the [[digital content|content]]. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an [[input mask]] or an output mask). Common examples include [[spreadsheet]]s and [[database]]s in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces, and/or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In [[web content]], such digit grouping can be done with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS style]]. It is useful because the number can be [[cut, copy, and paste|copied and pasted]] into [[calculator]]s (including a web browser's [[omnibox]]) and parsed by the computer as-is (without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, [[Wikipedia]] content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples: {{val|149597870700}} metres is 1 [[astronomical unit]]; {{gaps|3.14159|26535|89793|23846}} is [[pi|π]] rounded to 20 decimal places, and {{gaps|2.71828|18284|59045|23536}} is ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' rounded to 20 decimal places.

In some [[programming language]]s, it is possible to group the digits in the program's [[source code]] to make it easier to read; see [[Integer literal#Digit separators|Integer literal: Digit separators]]. [[Ada programming language|Ada]],  [[C_Sharp_(programming_language)|C#]] (from version 7.0), [[D (programming language)|D]],  [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[Python_(programming_language)|Python]] (from version 3.6), [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] use the [[Underscore|underscore (_)]] character for this purpose. All these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form [[Fortran]] ignores [[whitespace character|whitespace]] (in all contexts), so 700&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 is permissible. [[C++14]] allows the use of an [[apostrophe]] for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.

===Exceptions to digit grouping===
The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] states that "when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit".&lt;ref name=BIPM/&gt; Likewise, some [[Style guide|manuals of style]] state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1000 to 9999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, [[APA style]] stipulates a thousands separator for "most figures of 1,000 or more" except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.

There are always "common-sense" country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, [[postal code]]s and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.

===In non-base-10 numbering systems===
In binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a [[nibble]], or equivalently to a [[hexadecimal]] digit. For integer numbers, dots are used as well to separate groups of four bits.&lt;ref name="DR-DEBUG_H"&gt;As an example, the [[DR-DOS]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; command displays the entered number in hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary notation:&lt;pre&gt;-h 1234
1234 #4660 \011064 %0001.0010.0011.0100&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, binary digits may be grouped by threes, corresponding to an [[octal]] digit. Similarly, in hexadecimal (base-16), full spaces are usually used to group digits into twos, making each group correspond to a [[byte]].&lt;ref name="DR-DEBUG_D"/&gt; Additionally, groups of eight bytes are often separated by a hyphen.&lt;ref name="DR-DEBUG_D"&gt;As an example, the [[DR-DOS]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; command dumps the memory byte-wise in hexadecimal notation with bytes separated by spaces and groups of eight bytes separated by hyphens:&lt;source lang="hexdump"&gt;-d 0
1234:0000  57 69 6B 69 70 65 64 69-61 20 68 65 6C 70 73 21   Wikipedia helps!&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of calculators and computers==
In countries with a decimal comma, the decimal point is also common as the "international" notation because of the influence of devices, such as [[electronic calculator]]s, which use the decimal point. Most computer [[operating systems]] allow selection of the decimal separator and programs that have been carefully [[i18n|internationalized]] will follow this, but some programs ignore it and a few may even fail to operate if the setting has been changed.

==Other numeral systems==
Unicode defines a ''decimal separator key symbol'' (⎖ in hex U+2396, decimal 9110) which looks similar to the [[apostrophe]]. This symbol is from [[ISO/IEC 9995]] and is intended for use on a keyboard to indicate a key that performs decimal separation.

In the [[Arab world]], where [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] are used for writing numbers, a different character is used to separate the integer and fractional parts of numbers. It is referred to as an [[Arabic (Unicode block)|Arabic decimal separator]] ({{lang|ar|٫}}) (in hex U+066B) in [[Unicode]]. An Arabic thousands separator ({{lang|ar|٬}}) also exists.

In [[Persian language|Persian]], the decimal separator is called ''momayyez'', which is written like a forward [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}—there is a small difference between the ''upside-down (Persian) comma'' character used in sentences and the ''Latin'' comma ({{lang|fa|٫}}) (in hex U+066B) used to separate sequences of three digits. To separate [[sequence]]s of three digits, a Latin comma or [[space (punctuation)|blank space]] may be used; however this is not a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/Archives-Old/UML024/1289.html |title=Persian decimal separator |last=Pournader |first=Roozbeh |date=2000-10-15 |work=Unicode Mail List Archive |publisher=Unicode Consortium |accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In [[English Braille]], the decimal point, {{bc|46}}, is distinct from both the comma, {{bc|2}}, and the full stop, {{bc|256}}.

*In Albania, Belgium (French), Estonia, Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kielitoimistonohjepankki.fi/ohje/49|title=Luvut ja numerot: numeroiden ryhmittely|website=Kielitoimiston ohjepankki|language=fi-FI|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and much of [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]] as well as French Canada: {{gaps|1|234|567,89}} (In Spain, in handwriting it is also common to use an upper comma: 1.234.567'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''89){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
*In Belgium (Dutch), Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden and much of Europe: {{gaps|1|234|567,89}} or 1.234.567,89. In [[handwriting]], 1'''˙'''234'''˙'''567''','''89 is also seen, but never in Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia or Sweden. In Italy, a straight apostrophe is also used in handwriting: 1'234'567,89. In the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium, the points thousands separator is most commonly used, and is preferred for currency amounts, but the space is recommended by some style guides, mostly in technical writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1/10000000_10_000_000/|title=10.000.000&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000|author=Taalunieversum|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Estonia, currency numbers often use a dot "." as the decimal separator, and a space as a thousands separator. This is most visible on shopping receipts and in documents that also use other numbers with decimals, such as measurements. This practice is used to better distinguish between prices and other values with decimals. An older convention uses dots to separate thousands (with commas for decimals) &amp;mdash; this older practice makes it easier to avoid word breaks with larger numbers.
*Historically, in Germany and Austria, thousands separators were occasionally denoted by alternating uses of comma and point, e.g. 1.234,567.890,12&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Röll |title=Union Pacific-Eisenbahn |work=Enzyklopädie des Eisenbahnwesens |url=http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Union+Pacific-Eisenbahn |accessdate=26 August 2014}}, entry "Union Pacific-Eisenbahn", largest numbers in table&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Röll |title=Bilanz |work=Enzyklopädie des Eisenbahnwesens |url=http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Bilanz |accessdate=26 August 2014}}, entry "Bilanz", sums in last table&lt;/ref&gt; for "eine Milliarde 234 Millionen ...", but this is never seen in modern days and requires explanation to a contemporary German reader.
*Switzerland: There are two cases: An apostrophe as a thousands separator along with a dot "." as the decimal separator are used for currency values (for example: 1'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''234'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''567'''.'''89). For other values, the [[SI]]-style {{gaps|1|234|567,89}} is used with a comma "," as the decimal separator. The apostrophe is also the most common variety for non-currency values: 1'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''234'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''567''','''89 &amp;mdash; though this usage is officially discouraged.
*In Ireland, Israel, Japan, [[Korea]] (both), Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States: 1,234,567'''.'''89 or 1,234,567'''·'''89; the latter is generally found only in older, and especially [[Manuscript|handwritten]] documents. Australia used this style up until the 1970s; now it uses the [[International System of Units|SI]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Steinle |first=Vicki |title=Teaching and Learning about Decimals |url=http://extranet.edfac.unimelb.edu.au/DSME/decimals/SLIMversion/backinfo/overseas.shtml |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*English Canada: There are two cases: The preferred method for currency values is $4,000.00 &amp;mdash;while for numeric values, it is {{gaps|1|234|567.89}}; however, commas are also sometimes used, although no longer taught in school or used in official publications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
*[[International System of Units|SI]] style: {{nowrap|1 234 567.89}} or {{nowrap|1 234 567,89}} (in their own publications, the dot "." is used in the English version, and the comma "," in the French version).
*In China, comma and space are used to mark digit groups, because dot is used as decimal separator. There is no universal convention on digit grouping, so both thousands grouping and no digit grouping can be found. Japan and Taiwan are similar; although when grouping by myriads, [[Japanese numerals|kanji]] or [[Chinese numerals|characters]] are frequently used as separators: 1億2345万6789 / 1億2345萬6789. Commas are used when grouping by thousands.
*In [[India]], due to a numeral system using ''[[lakh]]s'' (''lacs'') (1,23,456 equal to 123&amp;nbsp;456) and ''[[crore]]s'' (1,23,45,678 equal to {{nowrap|12 345 678}}), comma is used at levels of thousand; lakh and crore, for example, 10 million (1 crore) would be written as 1,00,00,000. In [[Pakistan]], there is a greater tendency to use the standard western system, while using the Indian numbering system when conducting business in [[Urdu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5141">'''''Epigraphia Carnatica''''' is a set of books on [[epigraphy]] of the [[Mysore State|Old Mysore]] region of [[India]], compiled by [[Benjamin Lewis Rice]], the Director of the Mysore Archaeological Department.&lt;ref name="fl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Preserving inscriptions digitally |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2223/stories/20051118000607600.htm |work=The Frontline, Volume 22 - Issue 23, Nov. 05 - 18, 2005 |author=Parvathi Menon |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220183957/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2223/stories/20051118000607600.htm |archivedate=2008-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of about ten years between 1894 and 1905, Rice published the books in a set of twelve volumes. The books contain the study of about 9000 inscriptions from [[lithic core|lithic]] surfaces and [[intaglio printing|copper plate]]s, which were found in the region.&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt; Apart from the original inscription, an English translation and a Roman transliteration are also provided.

==History==
Benjamin Lewis Rice was born in [[Bangalore]] in 1837. His father was a Christian [[missionary]] and head of the Bangalore [[parish]].&lt;ref name="jk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=495|work=Kamat.com|title=B.L. Rice - Father of Kannada Epigraphy|accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his education in [[England]], Rice returned to serve as the principal of Central School in Bangalore. He was also appointed as a secretary of the education commission. When he toured the countryside as an education inspector, he came across various inscriptions. He was interested in epigraphy and he took the help of his assistants to edit, translate and transliterate about 9000 inscriptions.&lt;ref name="jk"/&gt; When in 1886, the British made him the head of the Department of Archaeology, he started work towards publishing his epigraphical study and brought out a series of twelve volumes entitled ''Epigraphia Carnatica''.&lt;ref name="jk"/&gt; Rice also wrote a book called ''The History of Mysore and Coorg from Inscriptions'' which is based on ''Epigraphia Carnatica''.

==Compilation==
''Epigraphia Carnatica'' contains a study of inscriptions from 3rd century AD until the 19th century. These inscriptions belonged to different dynasties that ruled this region such as [[Cholas]], [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]]s, [[Western Chalukya]]s, [[Hoysala]]s, [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] kings, [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]] and the Mysore [[Wodeyar]]s.&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt; The inscriptions found were mainly written in [[Kannada language]] but some have been found to be written in languages like [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Urdu]] and even [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt;

==Publishing==
After the set of twelve volumes had been published by Rice, R. Narsimhacharya, who succeeded Rice as the head of the archaeological department, found another 4000 inscriptions. H. M. Krishna, after his excavations at [[Chandravalli]] and [[Brahmagiri archaeological site|Brahmagiri]], discovered 2000 inscriptions and published these discoveries as the volumes 13, 14 and 15 of ''Epigraphia Carnatica''.&lt;ref name="more"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/archaeology/eng/introduction.htm|work=Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Karnataka|title=Introduction|accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1950, the volumes were out of print. In 1972, the Department of Kannada at [[Mysore University]] undertook the task of reprinting the volumes, but could bring out only six volumes. The Southern Regional Centre of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) under the chairmanship of Professor S. Settar wanted to create a digitized version of the volumes. Settar donated his personal copies of ''Epigraphia Carnatica'', which were scanned and released as a CD-ROM in 2005.&lt;ref name="fl"/&gt;

==Volumes==
The twelve original volumes of "Epigraphia Carnatica" were:&lt;ref name="gaz"&gt;B. L. Rice (1897), p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Coorg]] inscriptions
* Inscriptions at [[Sravanabelagola]]
* Inscriptions in the [[Mysore district]], Part I

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9704">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Habitual ''be''}}
'''Habitual ''be''''' is the use of an [[Inflection|uninflected]] ''be'' in [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) and [[Caribbean English]] to mark habitual or extended actions, in place of the Standard English inflected forms of ''be'', such as ''is'' and ''are''. In AAVE, use of ''be'' indicates that a subject repeatedly does an action or embodies a trait. In [[Standard English]], the use of (an inflection of) ''be'' merely conveys that an individual has done an action in a particular tense, such as in the statement "She was singing" (the habitual being "she sings").

It is a common misconception that AAVE speakers simply replace ''is'' with ''be'' across all tenses, with no added meaning. In fact, AAVE speakers use ''be'' to mark a habitual [[grammatical aspect]] not explicitly distinguished in Standard English. For example, to ''be singing'' means ''to sing habitually,'' not ''to presently be singing.'' In one experiment, children were shown drawings of [[Elmo]] eating cookies while [[Cookie Monster]] looked on. Both black and white subjects agreed that Elmo ''is'' eating cookies, but the black children said that Cookie Monster ''be'' eating cookies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/education/curriculum/high/aae/#aaegram |title=Do You Speak American. For Educators. Curriculum. High School. AAE |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/synergy/fall98/ebonics3.html |title=SYNERGY – African-American English |publisher=Umass.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesized sources ==

The source of habitual ''be'' in AAVE is still disputed. Some linguists suggest it came from the finite ''be'' in the 17th to 19th century English of British settlers (perhaps especially those from [[West Country English|South West England]], although the usage may be latterday "[[Mummerset]]" in this context), while other linguists believe that it came from Scots-Irish immigrants whose [[Ulster Scots dialects]] mark habitual verb forms with ''be'' and ''do be''.

One hypothesis is that habitual ''be'' simply diffused into New World Black English from [[Hibernian English]] (HE) through contact in the Caribbean. Some evidence is that the two dialects structure sentences with the habitual ''be'' almost identically:

(1)	''Even when I do be round there with friends, I do be scared.'' (HE)

(2)	''Christmas Day, well, everybody be so choked up over gifts and everything, they don't be too hungry.'' (AAVE)&lt;ref name="Rickford1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickford|first=John|title=Social Contact and Linguistic Diffusion: Hiberno-English and New World Black English|journal=Language|year=1986|volume=62|issue=2|page=261–265|doi=10.2307/414674|jstor=414674}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of the hypothesis stems from the fact that there is no evidence that ''be'' was used as a habitual marker in the past or is used today in Caribbean creoles of English.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; Instead, Caribbean English speakers use the preverbal ''does'' to mark habitualness. They use ''be'' only as filler between ''does'' and the sentence's predicate.

The hypothesis states that the geographical differences in use of ''be'' and ''do (be)'', by Northern and Southern HE speakers respectively, accounts for the difference in use of be and does (be) in AAE and Caribbean English respectively.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; During the 17th and 18th centuries, Northern HE speakers immigrated more to North America, and Southern HE speakers immigrated to the Caribbean Islands, both working alongside blacks. Although the expansion to include the differences in the dialects of HE accounts for the absence of habitual be in Caribbean English creoles, the hypothesis has its disadvantages as well. The first problem is the distribution of ''do'' and ''be'' again. In Southern HE, ''do'' is more common with ''be'' than other verbs, but in Caribbean English, ''does'' is less common with ''be'' than other verbs.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; Hibernian English marks habitualness on be, and Caribbean English rarely marks it, if at all. A second problem is that there is not sufficient evidence to show that Southern HE speakers did not introduce ''do (be)'' to the American colonies since there were Southern HE speakers in the colonies that worked closely with blacks.

A further expansion and modification of the diffusion hypotheses account for the periphrastic do found in Caribbean English creoles. The ''do'' feature was common in British English and persisted in the nonstandard Southern and Southwestern English dialects that were used by the white colonials in the Caribbean colonies.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; The Irish and the blacks were both learning English at the same time, and both groups learned a new language while retaining the conventions of their native languages. In America, the Irish feature habitual be may have diffused into AAE and the two assemblages of people were in close contact and communicating with a new tongue. It is possible that British dialects could have had features that served as models for habitual ''do (be)'' in the Caribbean creoles, which, in turn, expanded to AAE in the Americas. It is also worth noting that Southern and Southwestern British immigrants traveled to the American colonies as well and their dialects would have been used as a model to blacks, leading to a drawback, the introduction, and subsequent loss of habitual ''do (be)'' in America, which was also the problem with the first expansion of the diffusion hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; Another hypothesis for the origins of habitual ''be'' in NWBE and afterwards into AAE is the most logical and the strongest of the lot.

The decreolization theory for the emergence of habitual ''be'' in AAE is the most likely and most supported of the theories of its origin. It involves the decreolization process of Caribbean English creole, with the loss of ''does (be)'', which itself is a decreolization of a previous creole habitual marker and its co-occurrence with ''be''.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; The process is seen as one code-shifting in the series of English learned by blacks in the New World. The existence of a category of habituals in the native Caribbean languages at the basilectal level shows that over time, blacks learned English but kept the conventions of their native languages until code-shifting replaced these old conventions with new ones. The evidence that Rickford gives is as following:

(18) Habitual aspect with a prepositional phrase or locative:

Stage 1: He (d)a de [dc] in the bed. (basilect)

Stage 2: He does de in the bed. (hab. (d)a -&gt; does)

Stage 3: He does be in the bed. (loc. cop. de -&gt; be)

Stage 4: He 0 be in the bed. (does -&gt; 0; be 'habitual')

This data is just one set of three, with this one preceding a predicate containing a prepositional phrase, and shows the shifting from the basilectal, native language convention, level to the English habitual be level in stage 4, with the coexistence of two or more stages at once.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; It is hypothesized that the first three stages were present in the speech of plantation slaves, and the hypothesis appears to be supported by the presence of these stages today on the Sea Islands of the United States, with only stage four surviving anywhere else in America.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; The advantages of this hypothesis are that there is no assumption that blacks had no native language influence and that the conventions of English were perfectly copied to the emerging English grammars of blacks and the fact that the decreolizing of habitual be also follows the pattern of decreolization in general linguistics and the pattern in cultural anthropology, with formal approximations of English over time and cultural assimilation of language respectively.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; Another merit is that this same pattern of decreolizing of be is found in other creoles that are relatively close to AAE and affirm the plausibility of this origin for habitual be. Yet another merit for this hypothesis is that it can incorporate the strong points of the revised diffusion hypotheses and surmount the weaknesses associated with them. For instance, creoles and dialects have lexicons that derive from the languages that feed them, and AAE and Caribbean English are no different; they followed the models of language dialects that came in contact with them and used their native language conventions as well as the newly learned conventions to mutate into varieties of the model language. A possible disadvantage of the hypothesis is that it does not work for area in which creoles did not develop, such as areas of America with very few blacks in the population.&lt;ref name="Rickford1986" /&gt; Another possible disadvantage is that the sources of slaves for the differing regions of America and the Caribbean could have led to different creole starting points, leading to the different habitual markers in AAE and Caribbean English creoles. The two minor problems are far outweighed by the advantages that the hypothesis has and further affirm that it is the best possible origin of habitual ''be''.

{{English grammar}}
An '''idiom''' ({{lang-la|idiom}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;from {{lang-grc|ἰδίωμα|translite=idomm}}, "special feature, special phrasing, a peculiarity", f. {{lang-grc|ἴδιος|translit=ídios}}, "one's own") is a [[phrase]] or an expression that has a [[figurative language|figurative]], or sometimes literal, [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]]. Categorized as [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]], an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the [[Literal and figurative language|literal]] meaning.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford companion to the English language (1992:495f.)&lt;/ref&gt; There are thousands of idioms, occurring frequently in all languages. It is estimated that there are at least twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions in the [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivations==
Many idiomatic expressions, in their original use, were not figurative but had literal meaning. Also, sometimes the attribution of a literal meaning can change as the phrase becomes disconnected from its original roots, leading to a [[folk etymology]]. For instance, ''spill the beans'' (meaning to reveal a secret) has been said to originate from an ancient method of democratic voting, wherein a voter would put a bean into one of several cups to indicate which candidate he wanted to cast his vote for. If the jars were spilled before the counting of votes was complete, anyone would be able to see which jar had more beans, and therefore which candidate was the winner. Over time, the practice was discontinued and the idiom became figurative.

However, this etymology for ''spill the beans'' has been questioned by [[linguists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/spill-the-beans.html|title='Spill the beans' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|first=Gary|last=Martin|website=Phrasefinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known written accounts come from the USA and involve horse racing around 1902–1903, and the one who "spilled the beans" was an unlikely horse who won a race, thus causing the favorites to lose. By 1907 the term was being used in baseball, but the subject who "spilled the beans" shifted to players who made mistakes, allowing the other team to win. By 1908 the term was starting to be applied to politics, in the sense that crossing the floor in a vote was "spilling the beans". However, in all these early usages the term "spill" was used in the sense of "upset" rather than "divulge". A Stack Exchange discussion provided a large number of links to historic newspapers covering the usage of the term from 1902 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28093/origin-of-spill-the-beans |title=etymology - Origin of "spill the beans" - English Language &amp; Usage Stack Exchange |publisher=English.stackexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other idioms are deliberately figurative. ''[[Break a leg]]'', used as an ironic way of wishing good luck in a performance or presentation, may have arisen from the belief that one ought not to utter the words "good luck" to an actor. By wishing someone bad luck, it is supposed that the opposite will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/break-a-leg.html |title=Break a leg |author=Gary Martin |publisher=The Phrase Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compositionality==
[[File:Donato Barcaglia, Liebe macht blind, Ausschnitt.jpg|thumb|''Love is blind'']]

In [[linguistics]], idioms are usually presumed to be [[figures of speech]] contradicting the [[principle of compositionality]]. That compositionality is the key notion for the analysis of idioms is emphasized in most accounts of idioms.&lt;ref&gt;Radford (2004:187f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Portner (2005:33f).&lt;/ref&gt; This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should be in a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole. The following example is widely employed to illustrate the point:

{{quote|Fred '''kicked the bucket'''.}}

Understood compositionally, Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The much more likely idiomatic reading, however, is non-compositional: Fred is understood to have died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single [[lexical item]] that is now largely independent of the literal reading.

In [[phraseology]], idioms are defined as a sub-type of [[Phraseme#Non-compositional phrasemes: Idioms|phraseme]], the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts.&lt;ref&gt;Mel’čuk (1995:167–232).&lt;/ref&gt; John Saeed defines an idiom as [[collocation|collocated]] words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilised term]].&lt;ref&gt;For Saeed's definition, see Saeed (2003:60).&lt;/ref&gt; This collocation of words redefines each component word in the [[word-group]] and becomes an ''idiomatic expression''. Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for-word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless.

When two or three words are often used together in a particular sequence, the words are said to be irreversible binomials, or [[Siamese twins (linguistics)|Siamese twins]]. Usage will prevent the words from being displaced or rearranged. For example, a person may be left "high and dry" but never "dry and high". This idiom in turn means that the person is left in their former condition rather than being assisted so that their condition improves. Not all Siamese twins are idioms, however. "Chips and dip" is an irreversible binomial, but it refers to literal food items, not idiomatic ones.

== Mobility ==
Idioms possess varying degrees of mobility. While some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and [[clefting]], demonstrating separable constituencies within the idiom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=George|year=2003|title=Idioms, Metaphors, and Syntactic Mobility|url=|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=39|pages=245–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mobile idioms'', allowing such movement, maintain their idiomatic meaning where ''fixed idioms'' do not:
;Mobile: ''I spilled the beans on our project.'' → ''The beans were spilled on our project.''
;Fixed: ''The old man kicked the bucket.'' → ''The bucket was kicked'' (by the old man).
Many fixed idioms lack ''semantic composition'', meaning that the idiom contains the semantic role of a verb, but not of any object. This is true of ''kick the bucket'', which means ''die''. By contrast, the semantically composite idiom ''spill the beans'', meaning ''reveal a secret'', contains both a semantic verb and object, ''reveal'' and ''secret''. Semantically composite idioms have a syntactic similarity between their surface and semantic forms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The types of movement allowed for certain idiom also relate to the degree to which the literal reading of the idiom has a connection to its idiomatic meaning. This is referred to as ''motivation'' or ''transparency''. While most idioms that do not display semantic composition generally do not allow non-adjectival modification, those that are also motivated allow lexical substitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keizer|first=Evelien|year=2016|title=Idiomatic expressions in Functional Discourse Grammar|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=54|pages=981–1016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''oil the wheels'' and ''grease the wheels'' allow variation for nouns that elicit a similar literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mostafa|first=Massrura|year=2010|title=Variation in V+the+N idioms|url=|journal=English Today|volume=26|pages=37–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of changes can occur only when speakers can easily recognize a connection between what the idiom is meant to express and its literal meaning, thus an idiom like ''kick the bucket'' cannot occur as ''kick the pot''.

From the perspective of [[dependency grammar]], idioms are represented as a [[catena (linguistics)|catena]] which cannot be interrupted by non-idiomatic content. Although syntactic modifications introduce disruptions to the idiomatic structure, this continuity is only required for idioms as lexical entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Grady|first=William|year=1998|title=The Syntax of Idioms|url=|journal=Natural Language and Linguistic Theory|volume=16|pages=279–312|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain idioms, allowing unrestricted syntactic modification, can be said to be metaphors. Expressions such as ''jump on the bandwagon'', ''pull strings'', and ''draw the line'' all represent their meaning independently in their verbs and objects, making them compositional. In the idiom ''jump on the bandwagon'', ''jump on'' involves joining something and a 'bandwagon' can refer to a collective cause, regardless of context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Translating idioms==
A [[literal translation|literal word-by-word translation]] of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom ''kick the bucket'' has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as ''kopnąć w kalendarz'' ("kick the calendar") in Polish, ''casser sa pipe'' ("to break his pipe") in French&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-fr?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in French |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tirare le cuoia'' ("pulling the leathers") in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idiommaster.com/search/en-it?search-term=kick+the+bucket |title=Translation of the idiom kick the bucket in Italian |publisher=www.idiommaster.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some idioms are transparent.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, R. W. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of their meaning does get through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, ''lay one's cards on the table'' meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions, or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; ''spill the beans'' (to let secret information become known) and ''leave no stone unturned'' (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) [[English language]] in [[polysemes]], the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a [[verb]].

Idioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many [[natural language]] words have ''idiomatic origins'', but are assimilated, so losing their figurative senses, for example, in Portuguese, the expression ''saber de coração'' 'to know by heart', with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to 'saber de cor', and, later, to the verb ''decorar'', meaning ''memorize''.

In 2015, [[TED (conference)|TED]] collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying "to slide in on a shrimp sandwich", which refers to somebody who didn't have to work to get where they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/40-idioms-that-cant-be-translated-literally/|title=40 brilliant idioms that simply can’t be translated literally|website=TED Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with non-compositionality==
The non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] in any sense. For example:

{{quote|How do we '''get to the bottom of''' this situation?}}

The fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory's analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here ''this situation'') is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, ''How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /'' etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the [[Construction Grammar]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;Culicver and Jackendoff (2005:32ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]]-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne and Groß (2012:173ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The [[dependency grammar]] trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:

::[[File:Idiom trees 1'.png|Idiom trees 1']]

The fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:

::[[File:Idiom trees 2.png|Idiom trees 2]]

The fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective ''nitty-gritty'' and the adverb ''always'' are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.

The catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality. The [[Principle of Compositionality]] can in fact be maintained. Units of meaning are being assigned to catenae, whereby many of these catenae are not constituents.

==Multiword Expression==
A multiword expression is "lexical units larger than a word that can bear both idiomatic and compositional meanings. (...) the term multi-word expression is used as a pre-theoretical label to include the range of phenomena that goes from collocations to fixed expressions." It is a problem in [[natural language processing]] when trying to translate lexical units such as idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Peter |last2=Ohneiser |first2=Ingeborg |last3=Olsen |first3=Susan |last4=Rainer |first4=Franz |title=Word Formation, An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe (HSK Series) |date=Oct 2011 |publisher=Berlin: De Gruyter |page=Chapter 25: Multword Expressions |url=http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/static/mh/Huening_Schluecker_2015_ms.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-45715-1_1 |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1810 |accessdate=8 August 2018|chapter=Multiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for NLP |title=Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing |volume=2276 |pages=1–15 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2002 |last1=Sag |first1=Ivan A |last2=Baldwin |first2=Timothy |last3=Bond |first3=Francis |last4=Copestake |first4=Ann |last5=Flickinger |first5=Dan |isbn=978-3-540-43219-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sailermarkantonatou"&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2592">The '''interface hypothesis''' in adult [[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition]] is an attempt to explain non-target-like linguistic behavior that persists even among highly advanced speakers. The hypothesis was first put forward by [[Antonella Sorace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Second Language Acquisition|last = Doughty|first = Catherine|publisher = Blackwell|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 130–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis posits that for adult second language learners, acquiring grammatical properties within a given linguistic area, such as [[phonology]], [[syntax]], or [[semantics]], should not be problematic. Interfacing between those modules, such as communicating between the syntax and semantic systems, should likewise be feasible. However, grammatical operations where the speaker is required to interface between an internal component of the grammar, and an external component, such as [[pragmatics]] or [[Discourse analysis|discourse information]], will prove to be very difficult, and will not be acquired completely by the second language learner, even at very advanced levels.

Examples of phenomena argued to be influenced by the interface hypothesis include use of overt vs. [[Null-subject language|null subjects]], as well as use of subject placement before or after the verb to mark [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] vs. using [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], in languages like [[Italian language|Italian]] by native [[English language|English]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Theoretical and developmental issues in the syntax of subjects: Evidence from near-native Italian|last = Belletti, Bennati and Sorace|first = |date = 2007|journal = Natural Language and Linguistic Theory|volume = 25|issue = 4|pages = 657|doi = 10.1007/s11049-007-9026-9|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khorasani Turkic''' (Khorasani Turkic: ''خراسان تركچىسى'', Pronunciation: {{IPA|[xorɑsɑn tyrktʃesi]}}; {{lang-fa|Zebān-e Torkī-ye Xorāsānī زبان ترکی خراسانی}}) is an [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in northern [[North Khorasan Province]] and [[Razavi Khorasan Province]] in [[Iran]]. Nearly all Khorasani Turkic speakers are also [[bilingual]] in [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=kmz Ethnologue report for Khorasani Turkic]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:North khorasanTurkic.jpg|thumb|300px|Turkic people in North khorasan region (North Khorasan and Razavi Khorasan provinces); without Turic people that live in west and south counties of khorasan region (Nishapur County, Sabzevar County etc.)]]
Khorasani Turkic is spoken in the Iranian provinces of [[North Khorasan]], near [[Bojnord]], and [[Razavi Khorasan]], near [[Sabzevar]], [[Quchan]]. The [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] dialect spoken in western [[Uzbekistan]] is sometimes considered a dialect of Khorasani Turkic. 

==Dialects==
Khorasani Turkic is split into North, South and West dialects.  The northern dialect is spoken in North Khorasan near Quchan; the southern in Soltanabad near Sabzevar; the western around Bojnord. 

==Classification and related languages==
Khorasani Turkic belongs to the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] group of [[Turkic languages]], which also includes [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish language|Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], and [[Salar language|Salar]], as well as the Oghuz dialect spoken in Uzbekistan. Khorasani Turkic is most closely related to Oghuz Uzbek and Turkmen and is close to the Azerbaijani dialects spoken in Iran.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}

Khorasani Turkic was first classified as a separate dialect by Javad Heyat in the book ''Tarikh-e zabān o lahcayā-ye Türki'' (History of the Turkic dialects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkiyatjournal.com/Makaleler/2055235739_5.pdf] Horasan Türkçesi ne İlgili Folklor Çalışmaları&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some linguists, it's been considered linguistically between [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], but it's not considered as a dialect of either.&lt;ref name="refSultantulu"&gt;[http://e-dergi.atauni.edu.tr/index.php/taed/article/viewFile/2091/2090 Sultan Tulu, “Horasan Türkçesi ile İlgili Folklor Çalışmaları”, Atatürk Üniversitesi Türkiyat Araştırmaları Enstitüsü Dergisi, Sayı 1, 1994, s. 48-51.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===

====Pluralization====
Pluralization is marked on nouns with the suffix {{IPA|/-lAr/}}, which has the two forms {{IPA|/-lar/}} and {{IPA|/-lær/}}, depending on [[vowel harmony]]. Plular {{IPA|/ɑ/}} never rounding even follow {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} for.

====Case====
Nouns in Khorasani Turkic take a number of [[declension|case]] endings that change based on vowel harmony and whether they follow a [[vowel]] or a [[consonant]]:

The '''Language Council of Norway''' ({{lang-no|Språkrådet}}) is the consultative body of the Norwegian state on language issues. It was established in 2005 and replaced the '''Norwegian Language Council''' ({{lang-no|Norsk språkråd}}) which existed from 1974 to 2005. It is a subsidiary agency of the [[Ministry of Culture (Norway)|Ministry of Culture]] and has thirty-five employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sprakradet.no/Toppmeny/Om-oss/English-and-other-languages/English/ The Language Council of Norway] The Language Council of Norway. Retrieved 16 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two organisations involved in language standardization in Norway, alongside the [[Norwegian Academy]].

== History ==

===Norwegian Language Council===
The Norwegian Language Council (1974&amp;ndash;2005) had 38 members, which represented different stakeholders, such as other language organisations including the [[Norwegian Academy]], [[Riksmålsforbundet]] and [[Noregs Mållag]], but also the educational sector and the media. The council created lists of acceptable word forms. Some words previously had two forms, the official form which were to be used in government documents and textbooks, and optional forms, which could be used by students in state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Janus|first=Louis|title=Norwegian Verbs And Essentials of Grammar|publisher=Passport Books|date=1999|location=Chicago|pages=4|isbn=0-8442-8596-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 2005 this difference no longer exists in the lists published by the Language Council of Norway.

'''Manonmaniyam P. Sundaram Pillai''' (4 April 1855 – 26 April 1897) was an Indian scholar, noted for the famous [[Tamil drama]] ''[[Manonmaniyam]]''.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite news|title=Manonmani 1942|author=Randor Guy|authorlink=Randor Guy|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/article961803.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
He was born in the area of [[Alleppey]] in [[Travancore]], to Perumal Pillai and Madathi Ammal (Māṭatti'am'māḷ மாடத்தி அம்மாள்). Pillai studied religious literature such as [[Tevaram]], [[Thiruvasagam]] during his childhood. [[Nagapattinam]] Narayana Samy Pillai was his [[Tamil language]] teacher. He completed his [[B.A.]] in 1876 and in the following year, he married Sivagami Ammal (Civakāmi am'māḷ சிவகாமி அம்மாள்).

==Career==
His career as an [[educator]] began in 1877. He became the Principal at a bilingual English-Tamil school in [[Tirunelveli]], playing a key role in the school's development. Pillai later taught [[philosophy]] at [[H. H. The Maharaja's College]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and he completed his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1880. During that period he became acquainted with Robert Harvey.

Sundaram showed his respect for Harvey, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Professor of Philosophy and English at The ''Maharaja's College'', by dedicating his drama ''Manonmaniyam'' to him, and naming his farmhouse after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.internationalstory.gla.ac.uk/person/?id=WH11787 |title=University of Glasgow :: International Story :: Robert Harvey |publisher=Internationalstory.gla.ac.uk |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they wrote the book, ''Some Early Sovereigns of Travancore''.

The MDT Hindu College, Tirunelveli, of which he was the first Principal, describes his works as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdthinducollegetirunelveli.org/princi.htm |title=Madurai Diraviyam Thayumanavar Hindu College, Tirunelveli |publisher=Mdthinducollegetirunelveli.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, he published ''Chathira Saugiragam'', commonly known as ''Nootrogai Villakkam''. He wrote and published his masterpiece ''Manonmaniam'' in 1891.  In the same year, he became a member Fellow of [[Madras University]] (FMU). In 1897, ''Some Early Sovereigns of Travancore'' was published and he became a Member of [[Royal Asiatic Society]] (MRAS).

'''Margaret McMurray''' (died 1760) appears to have been one of the last [[native speakers]] of a [[Scottish lowlands|Lowland]] [[dialect]] of [[Scottish Gaelic]] in the [[Galwegian Gaelic|Galloway variety]].

In ''[[The Scotsman]]'' of 18 November 1951 appeared the following letter, which had originally been printed in the ''Daily Review'' in 1876:

{{quote|Sir-I send this in corroboration of the fact that Gaelic was to some extent spoken in [[Ayrshire]] in the early part of last century. My grand-aunt, Jean McMurray, who died in 1836 at the age of 87, informed me that Margaret McMurray, the representative of the elder branch of the McMurrays of Cultezron, near [[Maybole]], and who died at a very advanced age about the year 1760, was long talked about as having been the last Gaelic-speaking native of [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]. 

Cultezron is situated about 30 miles north of Glenapp, and seven or eight miles south of [[Ayr]]. Cultezron was possessed by several generations of McMurrays, and its name is purely [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''Cul Tigh Eobhain'', (sic) signifying the 'back of Ewan's house'''.

-I am etc. D. Murray-Lyon Ayr, October 31, 1876}}

Cultezron (not to be confused with nearby [[Culzean]]) is a small farm on the outskirts of the town of [[Maybole]] in [[South Ayrshire]]. It appears that Margaret's family had been in possession of it for at least 150 years prior to this, as one 'John McMurray' is in legal records at that time. It is also notable that McMurray's descendants, dropped the 'Mc' from the name, suggesting [[anglicisation]]. Despite their similar appearance, the names 'McMurray' and 'Murray' come from separate origins, the former being related to the [[Murphy]]s and Morrows in [[Ireland]] and the Murchisons in the [[Scottish Highlands]], and the latter's origin being ''de Moray'' (of [[Moray]]).

The farm is now titled Cultezeon Farm, just west of Maybole.

The scholar [[William Laughton Lorimer]] discussed McMurray briefly in ''Scottish Gaelic studies''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">In [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[pragmatics]], the term '''metalocutionary act''' is sometimes used for a [[speech act]] that refers to the forms and functions of the discourse itself rather than continuing the substantive development of the discourse.

The term ''metalocutionary act'' originated as ''metalocution'' (Gibbon 1976, 1983) in functional descriptions of [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] in English and German, by analogy with ''locution'' ([[locutionary act]]), ''illocution'' ([[illocutionary act]]) and ''perlocution'' ([[perlocutionary act]]) in [[Speech act|speech act theory]]. The term metalocutionary act has developed a more general meaning and may include, for example, quotation acts and comments on preceding speech acts.

==Definition== 
Metalocutionary [[deixis]] is the [[denotation]] (in the strict semantic sense) of utterance constituents at points and over intervals in the temporal structure of utterances by means of prosodic deictic indices such as pitch accents, intonation contours and boundary tones.

In the prosodic literature, "mark" is often used informally instead of the strict "denote". The metalocutionary functions are structural rather than attitudinal or emotional functions of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. A precursor of the concept of metalocutionary function is found in the configurational function of intonation proposed by the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague School]] of [[linguistics]] (e.g. Trubetzkoy 1939), with the more specific culmination function and delimitation function, as in accentuation on the one hand and domain or boundary marking on the other.

==Examples==
Example 1: In orthography, e.g. ''Are Henry and Catherine REALly going?'', capitalisation (or other highlighting) of the syllable ''real'' and punctuation (including the initial capital ''a'' and the interrogation point) are orthographic metalocutions: capitalisation  denotes the syllable ''real'' and the word ''really'', of which the syllable is a constituent, while the punctuation denotes the domain of the question function.

Example 2: In the pronunciation of ''Are Henry and Catherine REALly going?'' (where the syllable ''real'' may receive a pitch accent, and the interrogation point may be rendered with a rising final tone and a globally rising pitch contour), the pitch accent is a prosodic metalocution which denotes the syllable ''real'' and the word ''really'', and the final rising pitch is a prosodic metalocution which denotes the end portion of the utterance (as well as a non-final or question speech act); the global rising pitch is a prosodic metalocution which denotes an intonation domain.

[[File:Stanislav Grof by Anton Nossik crop.JPG|thumb|225px|[[Stanislav Grof]] has written on the near-birth experience.]]

A '''near-birth experience''' refers to a recollection of an event which occurred before or during one's own [[birth]], or during the [[pregnancy]]. Under this usage, the term "near-birth experience" is analogous to the term "[[near-death experience]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Blackmore|Blackmore, Susan]]. (2002). ''Out-of-Body Experience''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 164-170. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Psychiatrist]] [[Stanislav Grof]], in 1954 researched [[LSD]] in [[Prague]], and after 1967 he explored [[ketamine]], and other methods for exhibiting non-ordinary states of [[consciousness]] like [[holotropic]] breathing. Grof concluded that some [[near-death experience]]s are virtual recollection of birth memories, actual re-experiencing of parts of the process in symbolic form, and "movement towards the light tunnel being a memory or symbolic re-experience of being born: a memory of the 'near-birth experience'."  According to Grof the NDE reflects memories of the birth process with the tunnel representing the [[birth canal]].&lt;ref name="French 2005"&gt;[[Chris French|French, Chris]]. (2005). ''Near-Death Experiences in Cardiac Arrest Survivors''. Progress in Brain Research 150: 351-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, science writer [[Carl Sagan]] also supported the hypothesis that near-death experiences are memories of birth. The parapsychologist Barbara Honegger (1983) wrote that the [[out-of-body experience]] may be based on a rebirth fantasy or reliving of the birth process based on reports of tunnel-like passageways and a cord-like connection by some OBErs which she compared to an [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref&gt;Honegger, Barbara. (1983). ''The OBE as a Near-Birth Experience''. In Roll, W. G., Beloff, J., and White, R. A. (Eds.). ''Research in Parapsychology''. Scarecrow Press. pp. 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was refuted in a statistical study by [[Susan Blackmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Keay. (2000). ''Carl Sagan: A Life''. Wiley. p. 416. {{ISBN|978-1620455913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Psychologist [[Chris French]] has written "the experience of being born is only very superficially similar to the NDE" and the hypothesis has been refuted as it is common for those born by [[caesarean section]] to experience a tunnel during the NDE.&lt;ref name="French 2005"/&gt;

Psychologist and skeptic [[Susan Blackmore]] has claimed that the near-birth experience hypothesis is "pitifully inadequate to explain the NDE. For a start the newborn infant would not see anything like a tunnel as it was being born."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Blackmore|Blackmore, Susan]]. (1991). ''Near-Death Experiences: In or out of the body?''. Skeptical Inquirer 16: 34-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] has also criticized the hypothesis concluding "there is no evidence for infantile memories of any kind. Furthermore, the birth canal does not look like a tunnel and besides the infant's head is normally down and its eyes are closed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]]. (1997).

'''Oil well control''' is the management of the dangerous effects caused by the unexpected release of [[formation fluid]], such as [[natural gas]] and/or [[crude oil]], upon surface equipment of oil or gas [[drilling rig]]s and escaping into the atmosphere. Technically, oil well control involves preventing the formation fluid, usually referred to as [[#Kicks|kick]], from entering into the [[wellbore]] during drilling.

Formation fluid can enter the wellbore if the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] being drilled.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, William C.; Plisga, Gary J. (2005). ''Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering'' (2nd edition). Elsevier.

Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Oil well control also includes monitoring a well for signs of impending influx of formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling and procedures, to stop the well from flowing when it happens by taking proper remedial actions.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=well%20control "Well control"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to manage and control these pressure effects can cause serious equipment damage and injury, or loss of life.  Improperly managed well control situations can cause [[blowout (well drilling)|blowouts]], which are uncontrolled and explosive expulsions of formation fluid from the well, potentially resulting in a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/primary-well-control.html "Primary Well control"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''.

==Importance of oil well control==
[[Image:H104.jpg|thumb|Modern driller Argentina.]]
Oil well control is one of the most important aspects of drilling operations. Improper handling of [[#Kicks|kicks]] in oil well control can result in blowouts with very grave consequences, including the loss of valuable resources. Even though the cost of a blowout (as a result of improper/no oil well control) can easily reach several millions of US dollars, the monetary loss is not as serious as the other damages that can occur: irreparable damage to the environment, waste of valuable resources, ruined equipment, and most importantly, the safety and lives of personnel on the drilling rig.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Schubert, [http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf "Managed-Pressure Drilling: Kick Detection and Well Control" Section: "Kick Detection While Drilling"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2010/01/15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schub"&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, [http://www.pe.tamu.edu/schubert/public_html/PETE%20625/MEng%20Report.pdf "Well control"], ''Texas A&amp;M University MEng Report for well control'' (December 1995). Retrieved 2011-01-04, p.'''I'''-1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avert the consequences of blowout, the utmost attention must be given to oil well control. That is why oil well control procedures should be in place prior to the start of an abnormal situation noticed within the wellbore, and ideally when a new rig position is sited.  In other words, this includes the time the new location is picked, all drilling, [[Completion (oil well)|completion]], [[workover]], [[snubbing]] and any other drilling-related operations that should be executed with proper oil well control in mind.&lt;ref name=Schub/&gt; This type of preparation involves widespread training of personnel, the development of strict operational guidelines and the design of drilling programs — maximizing the probability of successfully regaining hydrostatic control of a well after a significant influx of formation fluid has taken place.&lt;ref name=Schub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Bybee, [http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2010/01/15WCFocus.pdf "A Well-Specific Approach to the Quantification of Well Control"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2010/01/15, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental concepts and terminology==
[[Pressure]] is a very important concept in the oil and gas industry. Pressure can be defined as: the force exerted per unit area. Its [[International System of Units|SI]] unit is [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per square metre or [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]. Another unit, [[Bar (unit)|bar]], is also widely used as a measure of pressure, with 1&amp;nbsp;bar equal to 100&amp;nbsp;kilopascals. Normally pressure is measured in the U.S. petroleum industry in units of [[Pounds per square inch|pounds force per square inch]] of area, or psi. 1000 &amp;nbsp;psi equals 6894.76&amp;nbsp;kilo-pascals.

===Hydrostatic pressure===
[[Fluid statics#Hydrostatic pressure|Hydrostatic pressure]] (HSP), as stated, is defined as pressure due to a column of fluid that is not moving. That is, a column of fluid that is static, or at rest, exerts pressure due to local force of gravity on the column of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/hydrostatic-pressure.html "Hydrostatic Pressure"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''. Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for calculating hydrostatic pressure in SI units ([[newtons|N]]/[[square meter|m²]]) is:

: Hydrostatic pressure = Height (m) × Density (kg/m³) × Gravity (m/s²).&lt;ref&gt;Micheal Nelkon &amp; Philip Parker, ''Advanced Level Physics'', 7th Edition, New Delhi, India, CBS Publishers, 1995, pp. 103–105, {{ISBN|81-239-0400-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All fluids in a [[wellbore]] exert hydrostatic pressure, which is a function of [[density]] and vertical height of the fluid column. In US oil field units, hydrostatic pressure can be expressed as:

: ''HSP'' = 0.052 × ''MW'' × ''TVD''', where '''MW''' ([[Mud weight|'''M'''ud '''W'''eight or density]]) is the drilling-fluid density in pounds per gallon (ppg), '''TVD''' is the [[true vertical depth]] in feet and '''HSP''' is the hydrostatic pressure in psi.
The 0.052 is needed as the conversion factor to psi unit of HSP.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=hydrostatic%20pressure "Hydrostatic pressure"], "Schlumberger OilField Glossary". Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

To convert these units to SI units, one can use:

*1 ppg = ≈ {{val|119.8264273|u=kg/m³}}
*1&amp;nbsp;ft = 0.3048 metres
*1 psi = 0.0689475729 bar
*1 bar = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascals
*1bar= 15 psi

===Pressure gradient===
The [[pressure gradient]] is described as the pressure per unit length. Often in oil well control, pressure exerted by fluid is expressed in terms of its pressure gradient. The SI unit is pascals/metre. The hydrostatic pressure gradient can be written as:

: Pressure gradient (psi/ft) = HSP/TVD = 0.052 × MW (ppg).&lt;ref name="Jerome Jacob Schubert 1995"&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p. '''1'''-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation pressure===
Formation pressure is the pressure exerted by the [[formation fluid]]s, which are the liquids and gases contained in the geologic formations encountered while drilling for oil or gas. It can also be said to be the pressure contained within the pores of the formation or reservoir being drilled. Formation pressure is a result of the hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluids, above the depth of interest, together with pressure trapped in the formation. Under formation pressure, there are 3 levels:
normally pressured formation,
abnormal formation pressure, or
subnormal formation pressure.

;Normally pressured formation
Normally pressured formation has a formation pressure that is the same with the hydrostatic pressure of the fluids above it. As the fluids above the formation are usually some form of water, this pressure can be defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level.

The normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433&amp;nbsp;pounds per square inch per foot (psi/ft), or 9.792 kilopascals per meter (kPa/m), and 0.465&amp;nbsp;psi/ft for water with dissolved solids like in Gulf Coast waters, or 10.516&amp;nbsp;kPa/m. The density of formation water in saline or marine environments, such as along the Gulf Coast, is about 9.0&amp;nbsp;[[Pressure#pounds per gallon|ppg]] or 1078.43&amp;nbsp;kg/m³. Since this is the highest for both Gulf Coast water and fresh water, a normally pressured formation can be controlled with a 9.0&amp;nbsp;ppg mud.

Sometimes the weight of the overburden, which refers to the rocks and fluids above the formation, will tend to compact the formation, resulting in pressure built-up within the formation if the fluids are trapped in place. The formation in this case will retain its normal pressure only if there is a communication with the surface. Otherwise, an ''abnormal formation pressure'' will result.

;Abnormal formation pressure
As discussed above, once the fluids are trapped within the formation and not allow to escape there is a pressure build-up leading to abnormally high formation pressures. This will generally require a mud weight of greater than 9.0&amp;nbsp;ppg to control. Excess pressure, called "overpressure" or "geopressure", can cause a well to blow out or become uncontrollable during drilling.

;Subnormal formation pressure
Subnormal formation pressure is a formation pressure that is less than the normal pressure for the given depth. It is common in formations that had undergone production of original hydrocarbon or formation fluid in them.&lt;ref name="Jerome Jacob Schubert 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=abnormal%20pressure "Abnormal Pressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=underpressure "UnderPressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=normal%20pressure "Normal Pressure"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overburden pressure===
''Overburden pressure'' is the pressure exerted by the weight of the rocks and contained fluids above the zone of interest. Overburden pressure varies in different regions and formations. It is the force that tends to compact a formation vertically. The density of these usual ranges of rocks is about 18 to 22&amp;nbsp;ppg (2,157 to 2,636&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). This range of densities will generate an overburden pressure gradient of about 1&amp;nbsp;psi/ft (22.7&amp;nbsp;kPa/m). Usually, the 1&amp;nbsp;psi/ft is not applicable for shallow marine sediments or massive salt. In offshore however, there is a lighter column of sea water, and the column of underwater rock does not go all the way to the surface. Therefore, a lower overburden pressure is usually generated at an offshore depth, than would be found at the same depth on land.

Mathematically, overburden pressure can be derived as:

: &lt;big&gt;S = ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;× D&lt;/big&gt;×g

where
:g = acceleration due to gravity

: &lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt; = overburden pressure

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = average formation bulk density

: &lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt; = vertical thickness of the overlying sediments

The bulk density of the sediment is a function of rock matrix density, porosity within the confines of the pore spaces, and porefluid density. This can be expressed as

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = φρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; + (1 – φ)ρ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where

: &lt;big&gt;φ&lt;/big&gt; = rock porosity

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = formation fluid density

: &lt;big&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; = rock matrix density&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp. '''1'''-3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; Schubert, Jerome; Haghshenas, Arash; Paknejad, Amir Saman; Hughes, Jim (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling''. Gulf Publishing Company.

===Fracture pressure===
''Fracture pressure'' can be defined as pressure required to cause a formation to fail or split. As the name implies, it is the pressure that causes the formation to fracture and the circulating fluid to be lost. Fracture pressure is usually expressed as a gradient, with the common units being psi/ft (kPa/m) or ppg (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

To fracture a formation, three things are generally needed, which are:

# Pump into the formation. This will require a pressure in the wellbore greater than formation pressure.
# The pressure in the wellbore must also exceed the rock matrix strength.
# And finally the wellbore pressure must be greater than one of the three principal stresses in the formation.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p. '''1'''-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; ''et al''. (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling'', p.23, section 1.8.1 (online version).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pump pressure (system pressure losses)===
''Pump pressure'', which is also referred to as ''system pressure loss'', is the sum total of all the pressure losses from the oil well surface equipment, the [[drill pipe]], the [[drill collar]], the [[drill bit]], and [[Annulus (oil well)|annular]] friction losses around the drill collar and drill pipe. It measures the system pressure loss at the start of the circulating system and measures the total friction pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-4, 5, 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow pump pressure (SPP)===
''Slow pump pressure'' is the circulating pressure (pressure used to pump fluid through the whole active fluid system, including the borehole and all the surface tanks that constitute the primary system during drilling) at a reduced rate. SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the suction pit, down the drill pipe and drill collars, out the bit, up the annulus, and back to the pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values. The slow pump pressure can also be referred to as "kill rate pressure" or "slow circulating pressure" or "kill speed pressure" and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Oil and Gas glossary, [http://oilgasglossary.com/circulate.html "Circulate"], ''"Oil and Gas Field Technical Terms Glossary"''. Retrieved 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=circulate "Circulate"], ''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shut-in drill pipe pressure===
''Shut-in drill pipe pressure'' (SIDPP), which is recorded when a well is shut in on a kick, is a measure of the difference between the pressure at the bottom of the hole and the hydrostatic pressure (HSP) in the drillpipe. During a well shut-in, the pressure of the wellbore stabilizes, and the formation pressure equals the pressure at the bottom of the hole. The drillpipe at this time should be full of known-density fluid. Therefore, the formation pressure can be easily calculated using the SIDPP. This means that the SIDPP gives a direct of formation pressure during a kick.

===Shut-in casing pressure (SICP)===
The ''shut-in casing pressure'' (SICP) is a measure of the difference between the formation pressure and the HSP in the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] when a kick occurs.

The pressures encountered in the annulus can be estimated using the following mathematical equation:

: FP = HSP&lt;sub&gt;mud&lt;/sub&gt; + HSP&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; + SICP

where

: FP = formation pressure (psi)

: HSP&lt;sub&gt;mud&lt;/sub&gt; = Hydrostatic pressure of the mud in the annulus (psi)

: HSP&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; = Hydrostatic pressure of the influx (psi)

: SICP = shut-in casing pressure (psi)

===Bottom-hole pressure (BHP)===
''Bottom-hole pressure'' (BHP) is the pressure at the bottom of a well. The pressure is usually measured at the bottom of the hole. This pressure may be calculated in a static, fluid-filled wellbore with the equation:

: BHP = D × ρ × C,

where

: BHP = bottom-hole pressure
: D =  the vertical depth of the well
: ρ = density
: C = units conversion factor
: (or, in the English system, BHP = D × MWD × 0.052).
In Canada the formula is depth in meters x density in kgs x the constant gravity factor (0.00981), which will give the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the well bore or (hp) hp=bhp with pumps off.
The bottom-hole pressure is dependent on the following:
*Hydrostatic pressure (HSP)
*Shut-in surface pressure (SIP)
*Friction pressure
*Surge pressure (occurs when transient pressure increases the bottom-hole pressure)
*Swab pressure (occurs when transient pressure reduces the bottom-hole pressure)
Therefore, BHP can be said to be the sum of all pressures at the bottom of the wellhole, which equals:

: BHP = HSP + SIP + friction + Surge - swab&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''1'''-8, 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, Bill; ''et al.'' (2008). ''Managed Pressure Drilling'', p.11, section 1.4.1 (online version).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic calculations in oil well control==
There are some basic calculations that need to be carried during oil well control. A few of these essential calculations will be discussed below. Most of the units here are in US oil field units, but these units can be converted to their SI units equivalent by using this [[Conversion of units]] link.

===Capacity===
The capacity of [[drill string]] is an essential issue in oil well control. The capacity of drillpipe, drill collars or hole is the volume of fluid that can be contained within them.

The capacity formula is as shown below:

: ''Capacity'' = ID&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1029.4

where

: Capacity =  Volume in barrels per foot(bbl/ft)
: ID = Inside diameter in inches
: 1029.4  = Units conversion factor

Also the total pipe or hole volume is given by :

: ''Volume in barrels'' (bbls) = ''Capacity'' (bbl/ft) × length (ft)

Feet of pipe occupied by a given volume is given by:

: ''Feet of pipe'' (ft) = ''Volume of mud'' (bbls) / ''Capacity'' (bbls/ft)

Capacity calculation is important in oil well control due to the following:
*Volume of the drillpipe and the drill collars must be pumped to get kill weight mud to the bit during kill operation.
*It is used to spot pills and plugs at various depths in the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p.2-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annular capacity===
This is the volume contained between the inside diameter of the hole and the outside diameter of the pipe.
Annular capacity is given by :

: ''Annular capacity'' (bbl/ft) = (ID&lt;sub&gt;hole&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - OD&lt;sub&gt;pipe&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / 1029.4

where

: ID&lt;sub&gt;hole&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Inside diameter of the casing or open hole in inches

: OD&lt;sub&gt;pipe&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Outside diameter of the pipe in inches

Similarly

: ''Annular volume'' (bbls) = ''Annular capacity'' (bbl/ft) × length (ft)

and
    
: ''Feet occupied by volume of mud in annulus''  = ''Volume of mud'' (bbls) / ''Annular Capacity'' (bbls/ft).&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''2'''-1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluid level drop===
''Fluid level drop'' is the distance the mud level will drop when a dry string(a bit that is not plugged) is being pulled from the wellbore and it is given by:

: ''Fluid level drop'' = Bbl disp / (CSG cap + Pipe disp)

or

: ''Fluid level drop'' = Bbl disp / (Ann cap + Pipe cap)

and the resulting loss of HSP is given by:

: ''Lost HSP'' = 0.052 × MW × ''Fluid drop''

where

: ''Fluid drop'' = distance the fluid falls (ft)

: ''Bbl disp'' = displacement of the pulled pipe (bbl)

: ''CSG cap''  = casing capacity (bbl/ft)

: ''Pipe disp'' = pipe displacement (bbl/ft)

: ''Ann cap'' = Annular capacity between casing and pipe (bbl/ft)

: ''Pipe cap'' = pipe capacity

: ''Lost HSP'' = Lost hydrostatic pressure (psi)

: ''MW'' =  mud weight (ppg)

When pulling a wet string (the bit is plugged) and the fluid from the drillpipe is not returned to the hole. The fluid drop is then changed to the following:

: ''Fluid level drop'' = ''Bbl disp'' / ''Ann cap''

===Kill Mud weight (KMW)===
''Kill Mud weight''  is the density of the mud required to balance formation pressure during kill operation. The Kill Weight Mud can be calculated by:

: ''KWM =  SIDPP/(0.052 × TVD) + OWM''

where

: ''KWM'' = kill weight mud (ppg)

: ''SIDPP'' = shut-in drillpipe pressure (psi)

: ''TVD'' &amp;nbsp; = true vertical depth (ft)

: ''OWM'' &amp;nbsp; = original weight mud (ppg)

But when the formation pressure can be determined from data sources such as bottom hole pressure, then ''KWM'' can be calculated as follows:

: ''KWM'' = ''FP'' / 0.052 × ''TVD''

where ''FP'' = Formation pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''2'''-4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kicks==
[[File:IXTOC I oil well blowout.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|[[Ixtoc I]] oil well blowout]]
'''Kick''' is the entry of [[formation fluid]] into the wellbore during drilling operations. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of [[drilling fluid]] is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. The whole essence of oil well control is to prevent kick from occurring and if it happens to prevent it from developing into [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]. An uncontrolled kick usually results from not deploying the proper equipment, using poor practices, or a lack of training of the rig crews. Loss of oil well control may lead into blowout, which represents one of the most severe threats associated with the exploration of petroleum resources involving the risk of lives and environmental and economic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Limited article,[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=kick "Kick"],''"Schlumberger OilField Glossary"''. Retrieved 9 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50495081/Basic-Well-Control "Basic Well Control"], Scribd site. Accessed 10/04/2011, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of kicks===
{{main|Causes of kicks}}
A kick will occur when the bottom hole pressure(BHP) of a well falls below the formation pressure and the formation fluid flows into the wellbore.There are usually causes for kicks some of which are:
*[[#Failure to keep the hole full during a trip|Failure to keep the hole full during a trip]]
*[[#Swabbing while tripping|Swabbing while tripping]]
*[[#Lost circulation|Lost circulation]]
*[[#Insufficient density of fluid|Insufficient density of fluid]]
*[[#Abnormal pressure|Abnormal pressure]]
*[[#Drilling into an adjacent well|Drilling into an adjacent well]]
*[[#Lost control during drill stem test|Lost control during drill stem test]]
*[[#Improper fill on trips|Improper fill on trips]]

====Failure to keep the hole full during a trip====
''Tripping'' is the complete operation of removing the [[Drill string|drillstring]] from the wellbore and running it back in the hole. This operation is typically undertaken when the bit (which is the tool used to crush or cut rock during drilling) becomes dull or broken, and no longer drills the rock efficiently. A typical drilling operation of deep oil or gas wells may require up to 8 or more trips of the drill string to replace a dull rotary bit for one well.

Tripping out of the hole means that the entire volume of steel (of drillstring) is being removed, or has been removed, from the well. This displacement of the drill string (the steel) will leave out a volume of space that must be replaced with an equal volume of [[Drilling mud|mud]]. If the replacement is not done, the fluid level in the wellbore will drop, resulting in a loss of hydrostatic pressure (HSP) and bottom hole pressure (BHP). If this bottom hole pressure reduction goes below the [[#Formation pressure|formation pressure]], a [[#Kicks|kick]] will definitely occur.

====Swabbing while tripping====
''Swabbing'' occurs when bottom hole pressure is reduced due to the effects of pulling the [[drill string]] upward in the bored hole. During the tripping out of the hole, the space formed by the [[Drill pipe|drillpipe]], [[drill collar]], or tubing (which are being removed) must be replaced by something, usually [[Drilling mud|mud]]. If the rate of tripping out is greater than the rate the mud is being pumped into the void space (created by the removal of the drill string), then swab will occur. If the reduction in bottom hole pressure caused by swabbing is below [[#Formation pressure|formation pressure]], then a [[#Kicks|kick]] will occur.

====Lost circulation====
''Lost circulation'' usually occurs when the hydrostatic pressure fractures an open formation. When this occurs, there is loss in circulation, and the height of the fluid column decreases, leading to lower [[#Hydrostatic pressure|HSP]] in the [[Well bore|wellbore]]. A kick can occur if steps are not taken to keep the hole full. Lost circulation can be caused by:
*excessive mud weights
*excessive annular friction loss
*excessive surge pressure during trips, or "spudding" the bit
*excessive shut-in pressures.

====Insufficient density of fluid====
If the density of the drilling fluid or [[Drilling mud|mud]]  in the well bore is not sufficient to keep the formation pressure in check, then a kick can occur. Insufficient density of the drilling fluid can be as a result of the following :
* attempting to drill by using an underbalanced weight solution
*excessive dilution of the mud
*heavy rains in the pits
*barite settling in the pits
*spotting low density pills in the well.

====Abnormal pressure====
Another cause of kicks is drilling accidentally into [[#Abnormal Formation pressure|abnormally-pressured]] permeable zones. The increased formation pressure may be greater than the bottom hole pressure, resulting in a kick.

====Drilling into an adjacent well====
Drilling into an adjacent well is a potential problem, particularly in [[offshore drilling]] where a
large number of directional wells are drilled from the same [[Oil platform|platform]]. If the drilling well penetrates the [[production string]] of a previously completed well, the formation fluid from the completed well will enter the wellbore of the drilling well, causing a kick. If this occurs at a shallow depth, it is an extremely dangerous situation and could easily result in an uncontrolled blowout with little to no warning of the event.

====Lost control during drill stem test====
A drill-stem test is performed by setting a packer above the formation to be tested, and allowing the formation to flow. During the course of the test, the bore hole or casing below the packer, and at least a portion of the drill pipe or tubing, is filled with formation fluid. At the conclusion of the test, this fluid must be removed by proper well control techniques to return the well to a safe condition. Failure to follow the correct procedures to kill the well could lead to a blowout.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''3'''-1, 2, 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control", pp.19/20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, William C.; Plisga, Gary J. (2005). ''Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering'', pp.39-41, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improper fill on trips====
Improper fill on trip occurs when the volume of drilling fluid to keep the hole full on a Trip (complete operation of removing the [[Drill string|drillstring]] from the wellbore and running it back in the hole) is less than that calculated or less than Trip Book Record. This condition is usually caused by formation fluid entering the wellbore due to the swabbing action of the drill string, and, if action is not taken soon, the well will enter a kick state.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''4'''-1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace, Robert D.

===Kick warning signs===
[[Image:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout]], 21 April 2010]]
In oil well control, a kick should be able to be detected promptly, and if a kick is detected, proper kick prevention operations must be taken immediately to avoid a blowout. There are various tell-tale signs that signal an alert crew that a kick is about to start. Knowing these signs will keep a kicking oil well under control, and avoid a blowout:

====Sudden increase in drilling rate====
A sudden increase in penetration rate (drilling break) is usually caused by a change in the type of formation being drilled. However, it may also signal an increase in formation pore pressure, which may indicate a possible kick.

====Increase in annulus flow rate====
If the rate at which the pumps are running is held constant, then the flow from the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] should be constant. If the annulus flow increases without a corresponding change in pumping rate, the additional flow is caused by formation fluid(s) feeding into the [[well bore]] or gas expansion. This will indicate an impending kick.

====Gain in pit volume====
If there is an unexplained increase in the volume of surface mud in the pit (a large tank that holds drilling fluid on the rig), it could signify an impending kick. This is because as the formation fluid feeds into the wellbore, it causes more [[drilling fluid]] to flow from the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] than is pumped down the [[drill string]], thus the volume of fluid in the pit(s) increases.

====Change in pump speed/pressure====
A decrease in pump pressure or increase in pump speed can happen as a result of a decrease in [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the annulus as the formation fluids enters the wellbore. As the lighter formation fluid flows into the wellbore, the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the annular column of fluid decreases, and the drilling fluid in the drill pipe tends to U-tube into the annulus. When this occurs, the pump pressure will drop, and the pump speed will increase. The lower pump pressure and increase in pump speed symptoms can also be indicative of a hole in the drill string, commonly referred to as a washout. Until a confirmation can be made whether a washout or a well kick has occurred, a kick should be assumed.

==Categories of oil well control==
There are basically three types of oil well control which are:
primary oil well control,
secondary oil well control, and 
tertiary oil well control. Those types are explained below.

===Primary Oil Well Control===
Primary oil well control is the process which maintains a hydrostatic pressure in the
wellbore greater than the pressure of the fluids in the formation being drilled, but less than formation fracture pressure. It uses the [[Drilling mud|mud]] weight to provide sufficient pressure to prevent an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore. If hydrostatic pressure is less than formation pressure, then formation fluids will enter the wellbore. If the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the wellbore exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, then the fluid in the well could be lost. In an extreme case of lost circulation, the formation pressure may exceed hydrostatic pressure, allowing formation fluids to enter into the well.

===Secondary Oil Well Control===
Secondary oil well control is done after the Primary oil well control has failed to prevent formation fluids from entering the wellbore. This process uses [[Blowout Preventer|“blow out preventer”]], a BOP, to prevent the escape of wellbore fluids from the well. As the rams and choke of the BOP remain closed, a pressure built up test is carried out and a kill mud weight calculated and pumped inside the well to kill the kick and circulate it out.

===Tertiary (or shearing) Oil Well Control===
Tertiary oil well control describes the third line of defense, where the formation cannot be controlled by primary or secondary well control (hydrostatic and equipment). This happens in underground blowout situations. The following are examples of tertiary well control:

*Drill a [[relief well]] to hit an adjacent well that is flowing and kill the well with heavy mud
*Rapid pumping of heavy mud to control the well with equivalent circulating density
*Pump barite or heavy weighting agents to plug the wellbore in order to stop flowing
*Pump cement to plug the wellbore&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control", p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jetj"&gt;Rachain Jetjongjit, [http://www.drillingformulas.com/what-is-tertiary-well-control/ "What is Tertiary well control"], DrillingFormulas.com, Drilling Formulas and Drilling Calculations.

Accessed 2011-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shut-in procedures==
Using shut-in procedures is one of the oil-well-control measures to curtail kicks and prevent a [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] from occurring. Shut-in procedures are specific procedures for closing a well in case of a kick. When any positive indication of a kick is observed, such as a sudden increase in flow, or an increase in pit level, then the well should be shut-in immediately. If a well shut-in is not done promptly, a blowout is likely to happen.

Shut-in procedures are usually developed and practiced for every rig activity, such as drilling, tripping, logging, running tubular, performing a drill stem test, and so on. The primary purpose of a specific shut-in procedure is to minimize kick volume entering into a wellbore when a kick occurs, regardless of what phase of rig activity is occurring. However, a shut-in procedure is a company-specific procedure, and the policy of a company will dictate how a well should be shut-in.

They are generally two type of Shut-in procedures which are soft shut-in or hard shut-in. Of these two methods, the hard shut-in is the fastest method to shut in the well; therefore, it will minimize the volume of kick allowed into the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, p.'''5'''-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well kill procedures==
Source: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil well drilling engineering|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|publisher=Springer|year=1986|isbn=0860106616|location=|pages=302–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A well kill procedure is an oil well control method. Once the well has been [[#Shut-in procedures|shut-in]] on a [[#Kicks|kick]], proper kill procedures must be done immediately. The general idea in well kill procedure is to circulate out any formation fluid already in the [[wellbore]] during kick, and then circulate a satisfactory weight of kill mud called Kill Weight Mud (KWM) into the well without allowing further fluid into the hole. If this can be done, then once the kill mud has been fully circulated around the well, it is possible to open up the well and restart normal operations. Generally, a kill weight mud (KWM) mix, which provides just hydrostatic balance for formation pressure, is circulated. This allows approximately constant bottom hole pressure, which is slightly greater than formation pressure to be maintained, as the kill circulation proceeds because of the additional small circulating friction pressure loss. After circulation, the well is opened up again.

The major well kill procedures used in oil well control are listed below:
*Wait and Weight
*Driller method
*Circulate and Weight
*Concurrent Method
*Reverse Circulation
*Dynamic Kill procedure
*Bullheading
*Volumetric Method
*Lubricate and Bleed&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Jacob Schubert, 1995, pp.'''6'''-1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM article, "Basic Well Control". pp.37/38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil well control incidents - root causes==
[[Image:Oil well burning in Bibi Eibat.JPG|thumb|1904 [[oil well fire]] at [[Bibiheybət|Bibi-Eibat]] (near [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]).]]
There will always be potential oil well control problems, as long as there are drilling operations anywhere in the world. Most of these well control problems are as a result of some errors and can be eliminated, even though some are actually unavoidable. Since we know the consequences of failed well control are severe, efforts should be made to prevent some human errors which are the root causes of these incidents. These causes include:

*Lack of knowledge and skills of [[Drilling rig|rig]] personnel
*Improper work practices
*Lack of understanding of oil well control training
*Lack of application of policies, procedures, and standards
*Inadequate risk management&lt;ref&gt;IDPT/IPM training material, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/50495081/Basic-Well-Control "Basic Well Control"], Scribd site. Accessed 10/04/2011, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations for building well-control culture==
An effective oil-well-control culture can be established within a company by requiring well control training of all rig workers, by assessing well control competence at the rigsite, and by supporting qualified personnel in carrying out safe well control practices during the drilling process. Such a culture also requires personnel involved in oil well control to commit to following the right procedures at the right time. Clearly communicated policies and procedures, credible training, competence assurance, and management support can minimize and mitigate well control incidents. An effective well control culture is built upon technically competent personnel who are also trained and skilled in crew resource management (a discipline within human factors), which comprises situation awareness, decision-making (problem-solving), communication, teamwork, and leadership. Training programs are developed and accredited by organizations such as the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) and International Well Control Forum (IWCF).

[http://www.iadc.org IADC], headquartered in Houston, TX, is a nonprofit industry association that accredits well control training through a program called WellSharp, which is aimed at providing the necessary knowledge and practical skills critical to successful well control. This training comprises drilling and well servicing activities, as well as course levels applicable to everyone involved in supporting or conducting drilling operations--from the office support staff to the floorhands and drillers and up to the most-experienced supervisory personnel. Training such as those included in the WellSharp program and the courses offered by IWCF contribute to the competence of personnel, but true competence can be assessed only at the jobsite during operations. Therefore, IADC also accredits industry competence assurance programs to help ensure quality and consistency of the competence assurance process for drilling operations. IADC has regional offices all over the world and accredits companies worldwide. [http://www.iwcf.org/ IWCF] is an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]], headquartered in Europe, whose main aim is to develop and administer well-control certification programs for personnel employed in oil-well drilling and for workover and well-intervention operations.&lt;ref&gt;Kareen Bybee, [http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/jpt/2009/01/16WCFocus.pdf "Building a Well-Control Culture"], Society of Petroleum Engineers, ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' (JPT), archived 2009/01/16, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IADC, [http://www.iadc.org/wellsharp/ "WellSharp"], IADC.org, International Association of Drilling Contractors Well-Control Accreditation Program.

[[Image:Open matte film illustration.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|A frame from a [[35mm film]] print. Here, the picture is framed for the intended theatrical [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (inside the yellow box). Picture outside the yellow box is matted out when the film is shown in widescreen. For [[4:3]] television versions, a large portion of the picture can be used (inside the red box) with an open matte.]]
'''Open matte''' is a filming technique that involves [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] out the top and bottom of the film frame in the [[movie projector]] (known as a ''soft matte'') for the [[widescreen]] theatrical release and then scanning the film without a matte (at [[Academy ratio]]) for a [[Full screen (cinema)|full screen]] [[home video]] release.

Usually, non-[[anamorphic]] [[negative pulldown|4-perf]] films are filmed directly on the entire [[full frame]] silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a [[married print]] is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the [[frame line]] and optical soundtrack down to [[Academy ratio]] (1.37:1). The [[movie projector]] then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 full-screen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame ("open matte") instead of creating a [[pan and scan]] version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, the decision to use it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the [[camera operator]] can frame for 1.85:1 and "protect" for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as boom [[microphone]]s, cables, and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of [[pan and scan]] in some or all scenes. Additionally, the un-matted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).

Open-matte doesn't happen as often with films presented in 2.20:1 or 2.39:1. Instead those employ [[pan and scan]]. Many films over the years have used this technique, the most prominent of which include ''[[Schindler's List]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', and ''[[Top Gun]]''. [[Stanley Kubrick]] also used this technique for his last five films (''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971), ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987) and ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' (1999).) James Cameron's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) is also an example of open-matte.

He is often described as "Nigerian foremost travel writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mywekutastes.com/pelu-awofeso-nigerias-foremost-travel-writer/|title=Pelu Awofeso: Nigeria’s foremost travel writer {{!}} MyWeku Tastes|date=10 April 2016|work=MyWeku Tastes|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a published author.

== Travel and travel writing ==
Awofeso claims to have become interested in travelling after a first encounter with the city of [[Jos]] in [[Plateau State]] of Nigeria in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://africainwords.com/2013/07/15/qa-travel-writer-journalist-and-publisher-pelu-awofeso/|title=Q&amp;A: Travel writer, journalist and publisher Pelu Awofeso|date=15 July 2013|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encounter, which involved being awed by the beauty of the city as well as coming across "writing from the past by the British" who documented their travels during the times they lived in Nigeria as colonalists, inspired him to take up travel as a hobby.  &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw images from 1930s, 1940s, 1950s; they were so strong I felt like I was seeing that time. After they left I don't think many people were doing that any more. Those encounters seeded me to want to follow in their footsteps, to travel extensively in Nigeria and document what I’ve seen. It made me develop more interest in Jos and also in travelling, to also write about this beautiful place people have written about 50 years ago. I wanted to write something that could actually benefit society. And I had to think about writing about Nigeria in such a way that people appreciate the country. Not just the foreign audience, but also Nigerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://africainwords.com/2013/07/15/qa-travel-writer-journalist-and-publisher-pelu-awofeso/|title=Q&amp;A: Travel writer, journalist and publisher Pelu Awofeso|date=2013-07-15|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Till date, he has visited over 32 states out of Nigeria's 36&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.concisenews.global/news/northern-nigeria-is-vastly-beautiful-pelu-awofeso/|title=Northern Nigeria Is Vastly Beautiful – Pelu Awofeso|date=27 January 2017|work=Concise News|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written about a number of them.

== CNN/Multichoice African Journalists Award ==
In 2010, while he worked for [[Next (Nigeria)|234Next]], Awofeso won the CNN/Multichoice African Journalist of the Year Award in the Tourism Category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cp-africa.com/2010/05/30/cnnmultichoice-africa-journalist-award-winners-pelu-awofeso-234next-emmanuel-maya-sun-newspapers/|title=BREAKING: CNN/Multichoice Africa Journalist Award Winners: Pelu Awofeso, 234Next, Emmanuel Maya, The Sun Newspapers, others|date=30 May 2010|work=CPAfrica|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/africanawards/finalists_2010.html|title=CNN.com – CNN African Journalist of the Year Competition|publisher=CNN|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books and publishing ==
Awofeso is the publisher of an online travel magazine called ''Waka About''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/145638-world-tourism-day-travel-writer-picks-jos-nigerias-hottest-tourist-destination-despite-violence-omena-abenabe.html|title=WORLD TOURISM DAY: Travel writer picks Jos as Nigeria’s hottest tourist destination despite violence, By Omena Abenabe – Premium Times Nigeria|date=29 September 2013|work=Premium Times Nigeria|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the editor of ''Route 234'', a book of travel stories described as "a collection of stories from Nigerian journalists detailing personal experiences while on journeys outside Nigeria"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/640752|title=Route 234, an Ebook by Pelu Awofeso|last=Awofeso|first=Pelu|date=2 June 2016|website=Smashwords|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; What it represents, "overall, is an intervention in a space where much more effort of this nature is needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ktravula.com/2016/09/travel-as-life-a-review-of-route-234/|title=Travel as Life: A Review of Route 234|date=16 September 2016|work=ktravula – a travelogue!|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he published ''Tour of Duty,'' a book "which documents ten months travelling the width and breadth of Nigeria, and tells the stories of people and places he encounters on the way, from the sand sellers of Yenagoa to hunters in Osogbo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://africainwords.com/2013/07/15/qa-travel-writer-journalist-and-publisher-pelu-awofeso/|title=Q&amp;A: Travel writer, journalist and publisher Pelu Awofeso|date=15 July 2013|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His third book ''White Lagos'' was published in 2017, and it focuses on the [[Eyo festival]] which takes place in Lagos in form of a carnival.

== Other activities ==
Awofeso, in 2014, also founded a group called "Beach Samaritans" who walk around beaches in Lagos for the purpose of cleaning them of debris and unwanted trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cp-africa.com/2015/05/13/meet-pelu-awofeso-and-his-beach-samaritans/|title=Meet Pelu Awofeso and His Beach Samaritans|date=13 May 2015|work=CPAfrica|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11037">The '''Phraselator''' is a weatherproof handheld language [[machine translation|translation]] device developed by Applied Data Systems and VoxTec, a former division of the military contractor Marine Acoustics, located in [[Annapolis, MD]]. It was designed to serve as a handheld computer device that translates English into one of 40 different languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-11-22/business/0211220309_1_applied-data-systems-phrase-40-languages|title=Translating machine has a way with words|last=Hirsh|first=Stacey|date=November 22, 2002|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The device==
The '''Phraselator''' is a small [[speech translation]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-sized device designed to aid in [[interpreting|interpretation]]. The device does not produce [[voice synthesizer|synthesized speech]] like that utilized by [[Stephen Hawking]]; instead, it plays pre-recorded foreign language [[MP3]] files. Users can select the phrase they wish to convey from an English list on the screen or speak into the device. It then uses [[speech recognition]] technology called DynaSpeak, developed by [[SRI International]], to play the proper sound file.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2003/04/07/phraselator/index_np.html?pn=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709092837/http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2003/04/07/phraselator/index_np.html?pn=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |title=How do you say "regime change" in Arabic? |accessdate=2006-08-24 |last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |date=2003-04-07 |publisher=Salon |pages=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accuracy of the speech recognition software is over 70 percent according to software developer Jack Buchanan.  The device can also record replies for translation later.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,66816-0.html |title=Machines Not Lost in Translation |accessdate=2006-08-24 |last=Harrison |first=Ann |date=2005-03-09 |publisher=Wired |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-recorded phrases are stored on [[Secure Digital]] [[flash memory]] cards.  A 128 MB card can hold up to 12,000 phrases in 4 or 5 languages.  Users can download phrase modules from the official website, which contained over 300,000 phrases as of March 2005.  Users can also construct their own custom phrase modules.

Earlier devices were known to have run on an SA-1110 Strong Arm 206&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU with 32MB SDRAM and 32MB onboard Flash RAM.&lt;ref name=i4u&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i4u.com/article314.html |title=The Amazing Phraselator |accessdate=2006-08-24 |publisher=I4U News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer model, the P2, was released in 2004 and developed according to feedback from U.S. soldiers.  It translates one way from English to approximately 60 other languages.  It has a directional microphone, a larger library of phrases and a longer battery life. The 2004 release was created by and utilizes a computer board manufactured by InHand Electronics, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inhand.com/news-and-events/press-releases-archive/47-press-releases-archive/140-inhand-technology-supports-voxtecs-new-phraselator&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, the device will be able to display pictures so users can ask questions such as "Have you seen this person?"

Developer Ace Sarich notes that the device is inferior to human [[interpreter]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;
Conclusions derived from a Nepal field test conducted by U.S. and Nepal based NGO Himalayan Aid in 2004 seemed to confirm Sarich's comparisons:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The very concept of using a machine as a communication point between individuals seemed to actually encourage a more limited form of interaction between tester and respondent.  Usually, when limited language skills are present between parties, the genuine struggle and desire to communicate acts as a display of good will – we openly display our weakness in this regard – and the result is a more relaxed and human encounter.  This was not necessarily present with the Phraselator as all parties abandoned learning about each other and instead focused on learning how to work with the device.  As a tool for bridging any cultural differences or communicating effectively at any length, the Phraselator would not be recommended.  This device, at least in the form tested, would best be used in large-scale operations where there is no time for language training and there is a need to communicate fixed ideas, quickly, over the greatest distance by employing large amounts of unskilled users.  Large humanitarian or natural disasters in remote areas of third-world countries might be an effective example.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==
The original idea for the device came from Lee Morin, a [[Navy]] doctor in [[Operation Desert Storm]]. To communicate with patients, he played [[Arabic]] audio files from his laptop.  He informed Ace Sarich, the vice president of VoxTec, about the idea.  VoxTec won a [[DARPA]] Small Business Innovation Research grant in early 2001 to develop a military-grade handheld phrase translator. 

During its development, the Phraselator was tested and evaluated by scientists from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/32679/translation_device_eases_communication_problems|title=Translation device eases communication problems|last=Hickman|first=Matthew|date=January 8, 2010|work=U.S. Army|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was first field tested in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; By 2002, about 500 Phraselators were built for soldiers around the world with another 250 ordered by the U.S. Special Forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The device cost $2000 to develop and could convert spoken English into one of 200,000 recorded commands and questions in 30 languages. However, the device could only translate one-way. At the time, the only existing two-way voice translator that could convert speech back and forth between languages was the Audio Voice Translation Guide System, or TONGUES, which was developed by Carnegie Mellon University for Lockheed Martin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/computer-translators-join-the-ranks/|title=Computer Translators Join The Ranks|last=Bernbaum|first=Brian|date=October 5, 2002|work=CBS News|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a DARPA program known as the Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use, [[SRI International]] has further developed two-way translation software for use in Iraq called [[IraqComm]] in 2006 which contains a vocabulary of 40,000 English words and 50,000 words in [[Iraqi Arabic]].&lt;ref name=mit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17350&amp;ch=infotech |title=How to Talk Like an Iraqi |accessdate=2006-08-24 |last=Greene |first=Kate |date=2006-08-23 |publisher=MIT Technology Review |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable users==
The handheld translator was recently used by U.S. troops while providing relief to [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]] victims in early 2005.  About 500 prototypes of the device were provided to U.S. military forces in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].  Units loaded with Haitian dialects have been provided to U.S. troops in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2096973/ |title=Tomorrow's Soldier Today |accessdate=2006-08-24 |last=Carter |first=Phillip |date=2004-03-11 |publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Army military police have used it in [[Kandahar]] to communicate with [[prisoners of war|POWs]].  In late 2004, the U.S. Navy began to augment some ships with a version of the device attached to large speakers in order to broadcast clear voice instructions up to {{convert|400|yd}} away.  Corrections officers and law enforcement in [[Oneida County, New York]] have tested the device.  Hospital emergency rooms and health departments have also evaluated it.  Several Native American tribes such as the [[Choctaw|Choctaw Nation]], the [[Ponca]], and the [[Comanche|Comanche Nation]] have also used the device to preserve their [[endangered language|dying languages]].&lt;ref name=kten&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=5319101 |title=Technology helps to preserve Indian languages |accessdate=2006-08-24 |author=Associated Press |publisher=KTEN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215214/http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=5319101 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various law enforcement agencies, such as the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], also use the phraselator in their patrol cars.

==Awards==
In March 2004, DARPA director Dr. Tony Tether presented the Small Business Innovative Research Award to the VoxTec division of Marine Acoustics at DARPATech 2004 in [[Anaheim, CA]].&lt;ref name=contractor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marineacoustics.com/PDFs/dt04_awards_final.pdf |title=Darpa recognizes outstanding performance by agents and contractors |accessdate=2006-08-24 |date=2004-03-11 |format=PDF |pages=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101195339/http://www.marineacoustics.com/PDFs/dt04_awards_final.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was recently listed as one of "''Ten Emerging Technologies That Will Change Your World''" in [http://www.technologyreview.com/ MIT's Technology Review].

==Pop culture==
Software developer Jack Buchanan believes that building a device similar to the fictional [[universal translator#Star Trek|universal translator]] seen in [[Star Trek]] would be harder than building the [[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

The device was mentioned in a list of "Top 10 Star Trek Tech" on [[Space.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/technology/top10-star-trek-tech-8.html |title= Top 10 Star Trek Tech #8 - Translators |accessdate= 2008-03-03 |author= Bill Christensen |publisher= Space.com |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080706075457/http://www.space.com/technology/top10-star-trek-tech-8.html |archivedate= 2008-07-06 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A piece of '''postal stationery''' is a stationery item, such as a [[stamped envelope]], [[letter sheet]], [[postal card]], [[lettercard]], [[aerogram]] or [[Newspaper wrapper|wrapper]], with an [[imprinted stamp]] or inscription indicating that a specific rate of postage or related service has been prepaid.&lt;ref name=postalstationery&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/reference/stationery/basic_stationery.aspx|title=''Postal Stationery'' in Linns.com Reference section }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upss.org/code/ps101.php|title=United Postal Stationery Society's ''Postal Stationery 101: What Is Postal Stationery?''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does ''not'', however, include any [[postcard]] without a pre-printed stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postalstationery_19991206/refreshercourse.aspx|title=Baadke, Michael; ''Postal cards are another stamped collectible'' in Linns.com Refresher Course section }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format and origin ==
In general, postal stationery is handled similarly to postage stamps; sold from post offices either at the face value of the printed postage or, more likely, with a surcharge to cover the additional cost of the stationery.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postalstationery_20020114/refreshercourse.aspx|title=Miller, Rick; ''Postal stationery offers collecting variety'' in Linns.com Refresher Course section }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take the form of an [[official mail]] issue produced only for the use of government departments.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horning, Otto; ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Stamp Collecting'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be an issue of a military force where an army, perhaps in a distant war, issues letter sheets for the use of its troops to write home. Postal stationery can be [[overprint]]ed by the government or, occasionally, by a [[private overprint]].  In emergency situations, postal stationery has been produced by handstamping envelopes with modified [[Cancellation (mail)|canceling]] devices; many of the rare Confederate postmasters' provisionals are of this form.  Finally, some postal stationery can be printed to private order.  In this last case, stamped stationery bearing indicia is applied with postal administration approval and with specified regulations, to paper or cards provided by private persons or organizations.  Private impressions result in a wider range of denominations and designs compared with governmental issues.

==Types==
===Aerograms===

{{Main|Aerogram}}
The postal services of some countries also offer a form of letter sheet called an aerogram consisting of a blank sheet of paper with folding instructions and adhesive flaps that becomes its own envelope, and carries prepaid postage at either the international airmail letter rate or at a special lower aerogram rate.  Letter sheets lend themselves to airmail usage because they are lightweight.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Enclosures are not permitted in aerograms. Sales of aerograms in the United States ended in 2006 due to poor sales.

===Letter cards===

{{Main|Letter card}}
A letter card almost has the advantages of a postal card as far as weight and size, but also the advantage of privacy of contents is concerned.&lt;ref name=VanGelder&gt;Van Gelder, Peter J.; ''The Collectors' Guide to Postal Stationery'', A Squirel Publication (1997) {{ISBN|0-947604-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a double card, folded over, with gum or adhesive applied to the three open edges.  It is then opened by the recipient by tearing perforations on the three sides that are on the message side of the gum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postalstationery_20020211/refreshercourse.aspx|title=Miller, Rick; ''Postal stationery: letter, parcel, pneumatic cards'' in Linns.com Refresher Course section }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gummed strip around the card is then discarded, giving rise to the problems collectors have in finding intact used cards. The US has never issued any letter cards.&lt;ref name=postalstationery /&gt;

===Letter sheets===

{{Main|Letter sheet}}
Before 1845 correspondence was not enclosed in an envelope. Letters were folded, sealed, addressed and postmarked on the outside. This continued even after adhesive postage stamps were introduced.  The popularity of folded letters led postal authorities to introduce stamped letter sheets.&lt;ref name=Thorp&gt;''Thorp-Bartels Catalogue of United States Stamped Envelopes'', Century Edition, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;  These became available in the U.S. in 1861, but the first official postal stationery were the 1838 embossed letter sheets of New South Wales. These were followed by the [[Mulready stationery]] that was issued by Great Britain at the same time as the [[Penny Black]] in 1840.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; Since then, most postal services have issued a steady stream of stationery alongside stamps. Often the design of the stationery mimics the contemporaneous stamps, though with less variety and lower printing quality, due to the limitations of printing directly onto the envelope.  Much later, 1947 in the U.S., letter sheets morphed into lithographed '''air letter sheets''' or '''aerograms'''.

===Postal cards===

{{Main|Postal card}}
Postal cards are postal stationery and have a printed or embossed [[indicium]] and are sold by governmental [[postal authorities]].  In the United States, they were first produced in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, Lewis E., Ed.; ''United States Postal Card Catalog'', United Postal Stationery Society, 2010, 248 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the forms taken by postal cards include the regular single card, the attached message-reply cards, airmail postal cards, and official postal cards used for official government business with a "penalty for private use".  

'''[[Postcard]]s''', on the other hand, are cards prepared by private companies that do not have prepaid franking and readily available at commercial outlets.  They are frequently illustrated with pictures or printed advertisements.  They are generally ''not'' considered postal stationery.

===Registered envelopes===

{{Main|Registered envelope}}
A strong envelope with an imprinted stamp sold only for use with the registered mail service. Confusingly, these are usually marked ''Registered Letter'' but that term strictly only relates to a normal letter or packet that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.

===Stamped envelopes===

{{Main|Stamped envelope}}
The envelope form may be called a '''stamped envelope''' or, alternatively, a '''postal stationery envelope''' ('''PSE''' for short).  In August 1852 an act of the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the [[Postmaster General of the United States|Postmaster General]] to provide "suitable letter envelopes with such [[watermark]]s or other guards against [[Counterfeit stamps|counterfeits]]... with the addition of the value or denomination of the postage stamps so printed or impressed thereon...".  The first result was the 1853 Nesbitt issues of stamped envelopes, named after the contractor who produced them for the government.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Allen, Ed.; ''Catalog of the 19th Century Stamped Envelopes, Wrappers, Cut Squares and Full Corners of the United States''; UPSS, 2001. {{oclc|50290906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the different envelope sizes, [[Knife (envelope)|knives]], colors, [[Paper embossing|dies]] to print the [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]], and denominations there are literally thousands of different stamped envelopes produced for the US&lt;ref name=Undersander&gt;Undersander, Dan, Ed.; ''Catalog of the 20th and 21st Century Stamped Envelopes and Wrappers of the United States'', Third Edition, UPSS, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-9800112-8-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrappers===

{{Main|Wrapper (philately)}}
The manufacture of wrappers for the sending of newspapers or periodicals began in the U.S. in 1861.  The first wrappers were rectangular pieces of paper with gum to seal it on one end and an embossed envelope stamp or indicium on it.&lt;ref name=Thorp /&gt;  By 1870, the form was that of a rectangle with the narrow side rounded and gummed at the top. They were manufactured from piles of 300 - 500 sheets of paper which were then cut to shape by a [[Knife (envelope)|knife]]. After around 1900, they were cut individually from long ribbons of paper which had been printed with an embossed envelope die.&lt;ref name=Undersander /&gt;

In the US, they were removed from the items for sale in 1934, though remainders were sold for several years after that.&lt;ref name=Klug&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/postal_20050221/refreshercourse.aspx|title=Klug, Janet; ''Postal stationery wrappers offer challenge'' in Linns.com Refresher Course section }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1940 most countries had discontinued their production due to declining demand. Because the recipient of a wrapped newspaper often tore it open and threw it away, untorn used wrappers, preferred by collectors, are scarce.&lt;ref name=Klug /&gt;  Scarcer yet are wrappers with the original newspaper contents.  Because of their larger size, even mint copies are often sold folded or creased which is also less desirable to collectors.

== Collecting ==
Most postal stationery pieces are collected as entires, that is, the whole card, sheet or envelope. In the 19th century the practice was to collect "[[cut square]]s" (or ''cut-outs'' in the UK)&lt;ref name=VanGelder /&gt; which involved clipping the embossed indicia from a postal envelope.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; This destroyed the envelope. As a result, one cannot tell from a cut square what specific envelope it came from and, many times, the cancellation information. The manner in which the stamped envelope is cut out (defined by the term "[[Knife (envelope)|knife]]") vanishes on a cut square. Thus most collectors prefer entires to cut squares.

Many country-specific [[stamp catalog]]s list postal stationery and there are books devoted to the postal stationery of individual countries.  The current, but now dated, principal encyclopedic work is the nineteen volume [[Higgins &amp; Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog]].

'''Premankur Atorthy''' (1 January 1890 – 13 October 1964) was a novelist, journalist, and film director, born in [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]].  He was involved in [[Hindi cinema|Hindi]] and [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cinemaofindia.org/wiki/Premankur%20Atorthy ''Encyclopedia of Indian film'' article on Atorthy] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414142446/https://cinemaofindia.org/wiki/Premankur%20Atorthy |date=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[[WP:USERG]]?--&gt;

==Early life==
Atorthy's initial schooling started at Brahmo School, [[Kolkata]]. He then studied variously at Duff School, Keshab Academy, City School and Brahma Boys Boarding and Day School, which were then under the [[University of Calcutta]]. His father, Mahesh Chandra Atorthy, was a propagator and writer of the [[Brahma Samaj]].

Atorthy was imaginative and fond of adventure from boyhood. Failing to do well in his studies, he ran away to [[Bombay]]. At Bombay he learnt to play the [[sitar]] under Ustad Karamatullah. Returning to Kolkata, he started working at a sports goods shop in Chowringee. Subsequently, he worked for the Baikali, Yadughar, Hindustan, bharatvarsha, Sangkalpa, Nachghar and bharati.

==Works==
He was a noted novelist and playwrighter, author of many books including compilations of short stories, essays (e.g. on silent film, cf. Atorthy, 1990) and plays. Best- known literary work: ''Mahasthavir Jatak'' (1944), a fictional autobiography in four volumes noted for its irreverent portrayal of Calcutta’s early 20th-century élites. Among his other novels are ''Anarkali'' (1925), ''Bajikar'' (1922), ''Achalpather Jatri'' (1923), ''Chasir Meye'' (1924), ''Dui Ratri'' (1927) and ''Takht Taus''. Associated with literary journal Bharati; edited Nachghar, one of the first performing arts journals to take film seriously, with [[Hemendra Kumar Roy]] and film- maker Pashupati Chatterjee.

Founded Betar Jagat, the journal of the AIR, Calcutta (1929). Started as scenarist and actor, using the pseudonym Krishna Haldar, at Indian Kinema Arts (Punarjanma, 1927; Chasher Meye, 1931). Remade Punarjanma in 1932. Joined B.N. Sircar's International Filmcraft as writer and assistant to Prafulla Roy (Chasher Meye is based on Atorthy's novel and script). Also scripted Nitin Bose's Buker Bojha (1930).

Premankur entered the cinema world with a role in the Bangla film Punarjanma. First directed film, Dena Paona, was New Theatres' first talkie, made in direct competition with Madan Theatres' Jamai Sasthi (1931). Made several Urdu films as part of New Theatres' effort to enter the North Indian market, including the classic film of [[Agha Hashar Kashmiri]]'s play ''Misar Kumari'' to ''[[Yahudi Ki Ladki (1933 film)|Yahudi Ki Ladki]]'' (1933). His film versions of literary classics, e.g. from Saratchandra Chattopadhyay (Dena Paona), Rabindranath Tagore (Chirakumar Sabha) and Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay (Kapal Kundala), established the élite literary film genre intended to distinguish New Theatres' films from routine stage adaptations and remained important signifiers of high art in Bengali cinema. First Bengali film-maker to work in Western India, e.g. for Kolhapur Cinetone (1935) and for Imperial (1936). Credited with the supervision of H.K. Shivdasani's Yasmin (1935), made by the Krishna Studio.

He was the first [[professor]] of Geography at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]]. Apart from being considered the person who first introduced modern Geography in Galicia, he also was an accomplished writer as he demonstrates in his numerous essays, novels, plays and poems. He was also renowned as a great [[orator]] with a charismatic voice [http://www.culturagalega.org/mp3/especiais/discurso_pedrayo.mp3]. In 1933, he addressed a speech at a rally during the [[Aberri Eguna|Basque Fatherland Day]] organized by the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] at [[San Sebastián]], [[Gipuzkoa]] (picture above).

Some of his famous novels are ''Os camiños da vida'' and ''O mesón dos Ermos'', where he provides a meticulous description of Galician rural life. In fact, his non-scientific works are often taken as historical sources, since they are quite accurate and rigorous in terms of localization, description and context. It must also be mentioned ''Arredor de si'', a novel often considered to be a veiled [[autobiography]].

Among his vast scientific production the [[encyclopaedia]] ''Historia de Galiza'' (first published in 1962) stands out as a colossal project. Yet, in his many works he depicts with precision the history, geography, folklore and anthropology of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. He is the first geographer to define Galicia as an [[Atlantic Europe|''Atlantic country'']], that is, of Atlantic and not Mediterranean culture. And together with archaeologist [[Florentino López Cuevillas]] he is one of the first researchers embarking in a systematic scientific study of Galicia's [[Celts|Celtic]] past.

There is a [[foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] named after him, which preserves and promotes his works [http://www.arrakis.es/~trasalba/default.htm].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7766">[[File:KochFlake.svg|thumb|right|Four stages in the construction of a [[Koch snowflake]]. As with many other [[fractal]]s, the stages are obtained via a recursive definition.]]

A '''recursive definition''' (or '''inductive definition''') in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] is used to define the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set  (Aczel 1978:740ff).

A [[recursive]] [[definition]] of a function defines values of the functions for some inputs in terms of the values of the same function for other inputs. For example, the [[factorial]] function ''n''! is defined by the rules
:0! = 1. 	
:(''n''+1)! = (''n''+1)&amp;middot;''n''!.
This definition is valid for all ''n'', because the recursion eventually reaches the '''base case''' of 0. The definition may also be thought of as giving a procedure describing how to construct the function ''n''!, starting from n = 0 and proceeding onwards with n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 etc..

[[recursion#The recursion theorem|The recursion theorem]] states that such a definition indeed defines a function. The proof uses [[mathematical induction]].

An inductive definition of a set describes the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set. For example, one definition of the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s is:
#1 is in '''N'''.
#If an element ''n'' is in '''N''' then ''n''+1 is in '''N'''.
#'''N''' is the intersection of all sets satisfying (1) and (2).
There are many sets that satisfy (1) and (2) - for example, the set {1, 1.649, 2, 2.649, 3, 3.649, ...} satisfies the definition. However, condition (3) specifies the set of natural numbers by removing the sets with extraneous members.

Properties of recursively defined functions and sets can often be proved by an [[mathematical induction|induction]] principle that follows the recursive definition. For example, the definition of the natural numbers presented here directly implies the '''principle of mathematical induction''' for natural numbers: if a property holds of the natural number 0, and the property holds of ''n''+1 whenever it holds of ''n'', then the property holds of all natural numbers (Aczel 1978:742).

==Form of recursive definitions==
Most recursive definitions have two foundations: a base case (basis) and an inductive clause.

The difference between a [[circular definition]] and a recursive definition is that a recursive definition must always have ''base cases'', cases that satisfy the definition ''without'' being defined in terms of the definition itself, and all other cases comprising the definition must be "smaller" (''closer'' to those base cases that terminate the recursion) in some sense. In contrast, a circular definition may have no base case, and define the value of a function in terms of that value itself, rather than on other values of the function. Such a situation would lead to an [[infinite regress]].

That recursive definitions are valid - meaning that a recursive definition identifies a unique function - is a theorem of set theory, the proof of which is non-trivial. Where the domain of the function is the natural numbers, sufficient conditions for the definition to be valid are that the value of &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt; is given (base case) and that, for n&gt;0, an algorithm is given for determining &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;n, f(0), f(1), ...,f(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; (inductive clause).

More generally, recursive definitions of functions can be made whenever the domain is a [[Well-order|well-ordered set]], using the principle of [[transfinite recursion]]. The formal criteria for what constitutes a valid recursive definition are more complex for the general case. An outline of the general proof and the criteria can be found in Munkres' 'Topology'.However,a specific case(domain is restricted to the positive integers instead of any well-ordered set) of the general recursive definition will be given below.&lt;ref name=Munkres&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munkres|first1=James|title=Topology, a first course|date=1975|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-925495-1|page=68, exercises 10 and 12|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principle of Recursive Definition ===
Let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be a set and let &lt;math&gt;a_{0}&lt;/math&gt; be an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a function which assigns to each function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; mapping a nonempty section of the positive integers into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,then there exists a unique function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathbb{Z}_{+}\to A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h(1)=a_{0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h(i)=\rho(h|{{1,2,...,i-1}})&lt;/math&gt;  for  &lt;math&gt;i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of recursive definitions==

===Elementary functions===
Addition is defined recursively based on counting
:&lt;math&gt;0+a=a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1+n)+a=1+(n+a)&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplication is defined recursively 
:&lt;math&gt;0 a=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1+n)a=a+na&lt;/math&gt;
Exponentiation is defined recursively 
:&lt;math&gt;a^0=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a^{1+n}=a a^n&lt;/math&gt;
Binomial coefficients are defined recursively
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{a}{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{1+a}{1+n}=\frac{(1+a)\binom{a}{n}}{1+n}&lt;/math&gt;

===Prime numbers===
The set of [[prime number]]s can be defined as the unique set of positive integers satisfying
* [[1 (number)|1]] is not a prime number
* any other positive integer is a prime number if and only if it is not divisible by any prime number smaller than itself
The primality of the integer 1 is the base case; checking the primality of any larger integer ''X'' by this definition requires knowing the primality of every integer between 1 and ''X'', which is well defined by this definition. That last point can be proved by induction on ''X'', for which it is essential that the second clause says "if and only if"; if it had said just "if" the primality of for instance 4 would not be clear, and the further application of the second clause would be impossible.

===Non-negative even numbers===
The [[even number]]s can be defined as consisting of
* 0 is in the set E of non-negative evens (basis clause)
* For any element x in the set E, x+2 is in E (inductive clause)
* Nothing is in E unless it is obtained from the basis and inductive clauses (extremal clause).

===Well formed formulas===
It is chiefly in logic or computer programming that recursive definitions are found. For example, a [[well formed formula]] (wff) can be defined as:
#a symbol which stands for a [[proposition]] - like '''p''' means "Connor is a lawyer."
#The negation symbol, followed by a wff - like '''Np''' means "It is not true that Connor is a lawyer."
#Any of the four binary [[Logical connective|connective]]s (C, A, K, or E) followed by two wffs. The symbol '''K''' means "both are true", so '''Kpq''' may mean "Connor is a lawyer, and Mary likes music."

The value of such a recursive definition is that it can be used to determine whether any particular string of symbols is "well formed".

* '''Kpq''' is well formed, because it's '''K''' followed by the atomic wffs '''p''' and '''q'''.
* '''NKpq''' is well formed, because it's '''N''' followed by '''Kpq''', which is in turn a wff.
* '''KNpNq''' is '''K''' followed by '''Np''' and '''Nq'''; and '''Np''' is a wff, etc.

[[File:Robert Forby.jpg|thumb|175px|Portrait of Forby in the Norwich Castle Museum (c.1802), artist uncertain.]]
'''Robert Forby''' (1759&amp;ndash;1825), was an English [[Philology|philologist]].

==Career==
Forby, born in 1759 of poor parents at [[Stoke Ferry, Norfolk]], was educated at the free school of [[Lynn Regis]], and at [[Caius College]], [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], where he obtained a fellowship (B.A. 1781, M.A. 1784). [[Berney baronets|Sir John Berney]], bart., induced him to leave the university, and to become tutor of his sons, presenting him in 1787 to the small living of [[Horningtoft]], Norfolk. Afterwards he fixed his residence at [[Barton Bendish]], where he took pupils; and on their number increasing, he removed to [[Wereham]]. Two years subsequently, in 1789, by the death of his uncle, the Rev. Joseph Forby, he came into possession of the valuable rectory of [[Fincham]], Norfolk. He removed thither in 1801, and continued to reside in his parish till his death, which occurred suddenly while he was taking a warm bath, on 20 Sept. 1825, aged 66. He was elected a fellow of the [[Linnean Society]] in 1798, and was a distinguished scholar. At one time, though at what period is uncertain, he was resident at [[Aspall, Suffolk]], as tutor to the children of [[Chevalliers of Aspall Hall|Mr. Chevallier]].

==Works==
He published some small pieces of ephemeral interest, and an important philological work entitled ''The Vocabulary of East Anglia ; an attempt to record the Vulgar Tongue of the twin sister counties, Norfolk and Suffolk, as it existed in the last twenty years of the Eighteenth Century, and still exists: with Proof of its Antiquity from Etymology and Authority'', 2 vols. London, 1830, 8vo. This was edited by the Rev. George Turner of [[Kettleburgh]]. Prefixed to vol. i. is the author's portrait, engraved from a painting by [[Michael William Sharp|M. Sharp]]. Vol. iii., being a supplementary volume by the Rev. William Tylney Spurdens, was published at London in 1858. Later, Spurdens would claim that he supplied most of the information used by Forby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.spurdens/1.2.3.5.6.7.22.27.29/mb.ashx Ancestry.com: the early Spurdens family]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forby also assisted Mr. Mannings in his "Pursuits of Agriculture", and in 1824 wrote the prospectus of a continuation of, as supplement to, the new edition of [[Francis Blomefield|Blomefield]]'s ''Norfolk''.

'''Rosario Ustáriz Borra''' ([[Valle de Hecho|Hecho]], 1927 – [[Jaca]], August 28, 2009) was an [[aragonese language]] writer and poet, born in the pyrenean village of Hecho (currently, part of the municipality known as '[[Valle de Hecho]]), in the [[Province of Huesca]] (northern [[Spain]]), and a native speaker to the aragonese [[Cheso aragonese|Cheso dialect]] (local to the referred valley, and one of the few extant varieties of western aragonese), in which she developed the whole of her work. As one of the few native speakers of modern aragonese that have taken some part in its divulgation and conservation, Ustáriz is well appreciated among the community of scholars and supportants of this pyrenean vernacular, having some of her works been published.

Her first poetic work was the poem ''Remerando a Pedro que se'n fue chugando'' («Remembering Pedro, whom passed while playing») written in 1982, that won the ''Onso d'Oro'' (Golden Bear) prize of the literary competition convened by the Valle de Hecho Council,&lt;ref name="GEA"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=12590 Rosario Ustáriz Borra, from ''Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa'']&lt;/ref&gt; later winning two other ''Onsos d'Oro'', in 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref name="GEA"/&gt; In her works she used to describe her own experiences and used to deal on [[Valle de Hecho]]'s landscapes, people and traditions. In 2006, a compilation of her poems was published, titled ''Miquetas de l'alma'' (literally «Small Pieces from the Soul»). She was an honour member of [[Academia de l'Aragonés]] since November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academiadelaragones.org/miembros.htm List of members of ''l'Academia de l'Aragonés'']&lt;/ref&gt; She died on August 28, 2009 in [[Jaca]] ([[Huesca]]), aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiohuesca.com/Noticia.aspx?codigo=397537 About her death in ''RadioHuesca.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Russian language]] in [[Israel]]''' is spoken natively by a large proportion of the population, reaching about 20 percent of the total population by 1989,{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=95}} mostly by immigrants who came from the [[former Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and later years.{{sfn|Shohamy|2006|p=70}}{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=116}}{{sfn|Grabe|2010|p=155}}{{sfn|Kohn|2007|p=416}}  It is a major foreign language in the country and is used in many aspects of life.

== History ==
{{main | 1970s Soviet Union aliyah| 1990s Post-Soviet aliyah}}
The first large scale immigration of Russian-speaking Soviet Jews to post-1948 Israel occurred during the 1970s, but the "great migration" did not start until the late 1980s, during the last years of the Soviet Union.

About 100,000 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel from 1971 to 1974. Most of them were from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]; the Baltic states of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]; and areas annexed by the [[Red Army]] in 1939–1940, mostly [[Poland]]. Soviet authorities allowed this emigration by calling it "family reunification," to avoid the appearance that anyone was unhappy living in the Soviet state.{{sfn|Eisen|2004|p=584}} These emigrants held strongly [[Zionist]] views and took the opportunity to settle in their historic homeland.{{sfn|Allan Jones|1996|p=27}} Less than half of those who emigrated in the 1970s wave came from [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries, i.e., [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], even though about 80% of Soviet Jews lived there at the time.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=97}}

The Soviet Union was generally anti-Semitic{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}; Zionist activities inside its borders were considered [[treason]] that could lead to execution, and, after 1967, Israel was considered an enemy state.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=63}} It was not until ''[[Perestroika]]'' that Jewish activists were given freedom to operate. The emigration that took place from 1989 to 1993 is described as a "panic migration", due to the socio-economic crisis in the Soviet states, rather than a migration of "born-again" Jews.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=96}} Many of them did not have any relation to [[Judaism]] or [[Zionism]] in their former place of residence.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} Most immigrants of this period came from Russia and Ukraine, and to a lesser extent from Belarus and Central Asia.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=98}}

The "old immigrants" of the 1970s, who mainly came to Israel for Zionist feelings, viewed people who came during the wave of the 1980s and 1990s as people escaping a harsh economic situation who did not have much appreciation for their new homeland.{{sfn|Isurin|2011|p=14}} The last Soviet census of 1989 indicated 1,449,000 Jews living in the country, of which about 877,000 had moved to Israel by October 2000. The wave of immigration in this short period of time was the greatest influx of people to Israel since the date of its creation.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=95}} Immigrants from the former Soviet Union composed 50%–70% of the newcomers.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} The number of people who came to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s outnumbered the number of people who came during the 1970s by four times, which made it harder for them to be integrated into the mainstream society of such a small country.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=98}}
[[File:Russian_language_status_and_proficiency_in_the_World.svg|thumb|States in which Russian is an official, semi-official, and working language.]]
An estimated 250,000 of immigrants are not [[halacha|halachic]]ally Jewish (which only recognises maternal descent), but rather considered Jewish under the [[law of return]] due to having at least one Jewish grandparent, or being the spouse of Jewish immigrants who received Israeli citizenship according to the [[Law of Return]].{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=97}}

=== Integration into Israeli society ===

Although free Hebrew courses are offered to every immigrant, some immigrants did not take them{{cn|date=March 2017}}. In 2013, about 26 percent of Russian immigrants did not speak fluent Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Druckman|first=Yaron|title=CBS: 27% of Israelis struggle with Hebrew|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4335235,00.html|accessdate=1 June 2013|newspaper=[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russians often settle close to each other, forming Russian-speaking neighborhoods with store window advertisements in Russian and banks with at least a few Russian-speaking workers.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} [[Ashdod]], the fifth largest city in Israel, absorbed a particularly large number of immigrants, accepting over 100,000 Soviet Jews from 1990 to 2001.&lt;ref name="Landver Data"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Center for Research and Information, [[Knesset]]|title=Data of population in the city of Ashdod|date=April 17, 2001|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/docs/m00121.rtf|format=Word|accessdate=September 21, 2007|language=Hebrew|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215208/https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/docs/m00121.rtf|archivedate=27 September 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yud-Yud Gimmel neighborhoods in southern Ashdod, where immigrants account for 75 percent of the population of 26,000, were dubbed "Israel's Russian ghetto".&lt;ref name="Rotem"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rotem|first=Tamar|title=An angel in the 'Russian ghetto'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/an-angel-in-the-russian-ghetto-1.64185|newspaper=[[Ha'aretz]]|date=July 17, 2001|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of integration into mainstream Israeli society is slow, because many Russian-speaking adults prefer to not learn Hebrew and are reluctant to give up their Russian cultural background. Language professors Elana Shohamy and Bernard Spolsky attributed this to a "strong loyalty to their ethnic language".{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=241}}

Hayim Gordon describes the situation in his 2007 book ''Israel today'': 
{{cquote|They speak only Russian to their children. They read one of the seven Russian-language newspapers that Russian-speakers have established, and they watch the private Russian TV station that has been set up in Israel and Russian stations abroad. Even after living years in Israel, hundreds of thousands of these Russian-speakers cannot carry on telephone conversation in Hebrew; many thousands of them cannot ask for directions in Hebrew. Despite these inconvenience, many Russian-speaker continue to reject the Hebrew language wherever and whenever they can.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=79}} }}

Today, Russian is in a much better position than Arabic, which has a special official status in the country.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=119}} The Russian-speaking adult population, which is less competitive in Hebrew than the youth, mostly tries to preserve the common Russian cultural background, teaching it to their children born in Israel.{{sfn|Rebhun|Waxman|2004|p=106}} However, according to Shohamy and Spolsky, second generation Israelis of Russian origin "do not receive a formal education in Russian" and, as a result, "language attrition is rapid".{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=236}} Political scientist Ze'ev Khanin opined, "The Russian-speaking community is identifiable, but it is part of the Israeli collective. The second generation is much more influenced by its Israeli experience than its Soviet past."&lt;ref name="Sherwood"/&gt; In 2001, camp counselors in Ashdod volunteered to help youths accommodate to Israeli lifestyle, and those that participated in the program said that "they feel Israeli in every respect".&lt;ref name="Rotem"/&gt;

=== Politics ===
Roughly 20 percent of Israel's population was born in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nahshon|first=Gad|title=The "Russian Power" in Israel|url=http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/the-russian-power-in-israel.html|newspaper=The Jewish Post|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanevsky"/&gt; and, as of 2013, the Russian-speaking community accounts for 15 percent of Israel's eligible voters.&lt;ref name="Sherwood"/&gt; Ze'ev Khanin surmised that [[Russian Jews in Israel]] tend to be politically conservative, estimating that 50 to 60 percent support the [[Likud Beiteinu]] party.&lt;ref name="Sherwood"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title='Russian vote' in Israel integrates into political mainstream|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/18/russian-vote-israel|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli journalist Lily Galili attributed this to being in part due to an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. She explained, "They come from this huge empire to this tiny Israel and they say: 'Is that all, is that the country? And what, you want to give back the territories? Who gives up territory in the first place! And in this small country. You must be kidding!'"&lt;ref name="Kanevsky"/&gt; Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, "Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time. And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue, they just want to solve the problems swiftly."&lt;ref name="Kanevsky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanevsky|first=Yevgeny|title=Why Russian Israelis vote right|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21073444|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is the only official language of the State of Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-passes-controversial-nation-state-bill-1.6291048|title=Israel Passes Controversial Jewish Nation-state Bill After Stormy Debate|last=Lis|first=Jonathan|date=2018-07-19|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-07-26|last2=Landau|first2=Noa|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] has special status.

Russian and a number of other immigrant languages are widely used in Israel, because ethnic Jews from dozens of countries from all around the world have settled in the area. Russian is the major immigrant language of Jews living in Israel. Since 1967, millions of [[Russian Jews]] have settled in the country, and a great influx of Jews from the post-Soviet states took place in the 1990s. Today, Russian is used in cultural events, the educational system and other public domains.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=116}}

By 1999, about 5 to 10 percent of all jobs in Israel were held by Russian speakers. The Ministry of Transport published booklets and manuals in Russian. It is very likely to find Russian-speaking doctors at hospitals.{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=237}}

== Education ==
Most Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union were highly educated{{sfn|Baker|Jones|1998|p=202}} with almost 45 percent of them having some kind of higher education.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=96}}

Despite the fact that the native language of a significant part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. [[Hebrew University]] started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called ''Na'leh 16'' included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=238}}

== Media ==
Traditionally, Russian speakers read newspapers and listen to radio more often than Hebrew speakers.{{sfn|Rebhun|Waxman|2004|p=106}}

''Nasha strana'' was the major Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with ''Tribuna'' for the immigrant reader.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=99}} In 1989, there was only one daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996.{{sfn|Spolsky|Shohamy|1999|p=237}} Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media.{{sfn|LeVineShafir|2012|p=317}} Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=117}} In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as [[Israel Plus]].{{sfn|LeVineShafir|2012|p=317}} In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=117}} Today, there are four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=99}} Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.{{sfn|Baker|Jones|1998|p=202}}

A '''sexual slur''' is a [[term of disparagement]] used to refer to members of a given [[gender]], [[sex]], or [[sexual orientation]] in a [[derogatory]] or pejorative manner. The motivation for using a sexual slur is often [[sexism]] and/or bias against a [[sexual orientation]] or practice.

Many sexual slurs are used in a wide range of contexts outside of their primary meaning; for example, [[gay]] may be used as a [[term of disparagement]] to refer to any person or thing the speaker thinks is worthy of contempt (e.g. "Those sneakers are gay"). Used in this way, the slur conveys contempt by associating its target with an (implicitly despised) sexual minority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3966">In [[software development]], '''small matter of programming''' ('''SMOP''') or '''simple matter of programming''' is a phrase used to ironically indicate that a suggested feature or design change would in fact require a great deal of effort; it often implies that the person proposing the feature underestimates its cost. Such underestimated costs are common during [[Cost estimation in software engineering|cost estimation]], particularly near the beginning of a project. The [[Jargon File]] describes an SMOP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SMOP.html Simple Matter of Programming] ([[Jargon File]], version 4.4.7)&lt;/ref&gt; as:

:#A piece of code, not yet written, whose anticipated length is significantly greater than its complexity. Used to refer to a program that could obviously be written, but is not worth the trouble. Also used ironically to imply that a difficult problem can be easily solved because a program can be written to do it; the irony is that it is very clear that writing such a program will be a great deal of work. "It's easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to compile COBOL as well; it's just a SMOP." 
:#Often used ironically by the intended victim when a suggestion for a program is made which seems easy to the suggester, but is obviously (to the victim) a lot of work. Compare ''[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/minor-detail.html minor detail]''.

The IBM Jargon Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;[https://comlay.net/ibmjarg.pdf SMOP] IBM Jargon Dictionary, Tenth Edition 1990&lt;/ref&gt; defines it as:

:'''SMOP''' ''(smop) n.'' Something quite possible, but requiring unavailable resources to achieve. "Why isn't that function available in the program?" − "It's just a Simple Matter Of Programming". (The implication being that, given a few person-centuries, all things are possible.) Also '''SMOUP''' ''(smoop)'', a Simple Matter Of Micro-Programming (if handwritten, using a Greek mu). See also ''how hard would it be.''

SMOP was among the "games" described in an article  as paralleling the ''[[Games People Play (book)|Games People Play]]'' identified by Dr. [[Eric Berne]] in the field of self-help psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shedley | first = Ethan I. | title = [[Big System Games]] | magazine = [[Datamation]] | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 22–25 | publisher = Technical Publishing Company, 1301 South Grove Ave., Barrington, Illinois 60010 | date = April 1, 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game essentially consists of proposing seemingly simple adjustments to a design, leading to unexpected consequences and delays.

'''Simple matter of software''' or '''small matter of software''' is occasionally used in the same manner. However, it is also used without irony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= ONDI – The ON-line Device Interface |journal= Circuit Cellar INK The computer Applications Journal |author= John Dybowski |issue= 18 |date= January 1991 |page= 16 |url= http://www.pestingers.net/pdfs/other-computers/circuit-cellar/1990/circuit-cellar-018.pdf  |quote= This turns out to be an almost trivial exercise, mainly because the computer is used to compute and the controller to control. Just a simple matter of software. }}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate that straightforward [[Software engineering|software development]] is all that is required to resolve some issue.  This usage is often invoked when the speaker wants to contrast the implied ease of software changes with the suggested greater difficulty of making a hardware change or a change to an [[Standardization|industry standard]].  This non-ironic usage is more often invoked by [[senior management]] and [[Hardware architect|hardware engineers]], than it is by software engineers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The '''Tundra Yukaghir''' language (also known as '''Northern Yukaghir'''; self-designation: '''wadul''') is one of only two extant [[Yukaghir languages]].
Last spoken in the [[tundra]] belt extending between the lower [[Indigirka]] to the lower [[Kolyma River|Kolyma]] basin ({{coord|69|N|154|E|}}), Tundra Yukaghir was formerly spoken in a much wider area extending west to the [[Lena River|Lena]] basin.

==Classification and grammatical features==
The relationship of the Yukaghir languages with other language families is uncertain, though it has been suggested that they are distantly related to the [[Uralic languages]], thus forming the putative [[Uralic–Yukaghir languages|Uralic–Yukaghir]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;Collinder, Björn (1940) Jukagirisch und Uralisch. Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tundra and Kolyma Yukaghir are the only two remnants of what used to be one of the dominant languages/language families of northeastern Siberia, spreading from the [[Anadyr River|River Anadyr]] in the east to the [[Lena River|River Lena]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Dolgikh, Boris O. (1960) Rodovoj i plemennoj sostav narodov Sibiri v XVII v. Moskva: Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the evidence of early sources, it can be assumed that there existed a Yukaghir dialect continuum, with what is today Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir at the extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoleava, Irina (2008) Chuvan and Omok languages? In: A. Lubotsky et al. (Eds.) Evidence and Counter-Evidence. Festschrift Frederik Kortland. Amsterdam: Rodopi, pp. 313-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir are not mutually intelligible. Tundra Yukaghir has residual [[vowel harmony]] and a complex phonotactics of consonants, rich [[agglutinative]] morphology and is strictly [[Head directionality parameter|head-final]]. It has practically no finite subordination and very few coordinate structures. Tundra Yukaghir has a [[Active–stative language|split intransitive]] alignment system based on discourse-pragmatic features. In absence of [[Focus (linguistics)|narrow focus]], the system is organised on a [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] basis; when focused, direct objects and subjects of intransitive verbs are co-aligned (special focus case, special focus agreement).

===Phonotactics===
Syllable structure is CVC, i.e. up to one consonant can occur at the beginning or end of a word and up to two in the middle.

==Grammar==
Tundra Yukaghir is largely head-final and dependent-marking: the default position for the verb is at the end of the clause, nouns are marked for case, adjectives precede nouns and relative clauses precede main clauses.

[[Grammatical case|Case]] assignment for core participants behaves in a broadly [[Active–stative language|split-intransitive]] manner, though actual assignment is very complex, involving semantic role, focus, relative animacy of the participants (first or second [[Grammatical person|person]] versus third), and nature of the noun itself. The assigned cases are primary (used for focused or high animacy [[Nominative case|nominative]] arguments), neutral (for low animacy nominative arguments and high animacy [[Accusative case|accusative]] ones), and focus case (most focused accusative arguments). [[Agreement (linguistics)|Indexation]] of arguments on the verb is similarly conditioned by focus and animacy as well as mood.

Oblique cases include [[Dative case|dative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Comitative case|comitative]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Prolative case|prolative]], and transformative, the latter indicating the intended use or function of an argument.

There is limited [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], used in [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] constructions.

Tundra Yukaghir verbs are marked for [[switch reference]]. Besides indicating whether the verb of a following clause shares the same subject, the switch-reference markers also describe the temporal relationship between clauses, the connection between the actions involved, and in the case of different subjects, the person (first or second versus third) and number of the subject.

'''Urbicide''' is a term which literally translates (Latin: ''urbs'': city + Latin: ''caedere'' to cut, kill) as "violence against the city". The term was first coined by the author [[Michael Moorcock]] in 1963 and later used by critics of 1960s urban restructuring in the United States. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] in 1972 and [[Marshall Berman]] in 1996 have written about urban restructuring (and destruction) in areas like [[the Bronx]], and highlight the impacts of aggressive redevelopment on the urban social experience. The term has come into being in an age of rapid [[globalization]] and [[urbanization]]. This rapid globalization trend has led to the focus of violence and destruction in the context of the [[city]] rather than its surroundings. Especially after the events at [[Sarajevo]], recognition has begun to be given to the cases of violence specifically directed to the destruction of an urban area. The exact constraints and definition of this term continue to be debated because the limits of this emerging concept make it extremely difficult to categorize events under the heading of urbicide. The question of intent also arises when discussing the limits of urbicide. The ability of term to cross a variety of fields such as international [[politics]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]] makes it particularly difficult to set a finite definition of urbicide which satisfies all these fields.

== Terminology ==

The term "urbicide" has its roots in the Latin word ''urbs'', meaning "city", and ''occido'', meaning "to massacre". In 1944, [[Raphael Lemkin]] defined [[genocide]] as "a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves". This term, however, failed to address violence not aimed at human bodies. The first recorded use of the term "urbicide" was by [[Michael Moorcock]] in the [[Elric]] novella "Dead God's Homecoming" (''Science Fantasy'' #59, Nova Publishing, June 1963). In the wake of the destruction of Sarajevo, the term gained more common usage, examples being found in the works of Marshall Berman (1987) and [[Bogdan Bogdanović (architect)|Bogdan Bogdanović]]. In their 1992 publication "Mostar '92", a group of Bosnian architects from [[Mostar]] used the term urbicide to define the violence against the city fabric, such as the destruction of the Mostar bridge, a usage consistent with [[Marshall Berman]]'s prior use of the term to describe similar acts of violence in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. Urbicide is increasingly being used by architects, urban planners, scholars and historians to help describe and understand the contemporary and historic wars where cities can no longer be considered safe havens from war, but rather are part of the battlefield. 

Some people argue that urbicide should be understood as a part of [[genocide]], as to destroy people's homes is to destroy them. In his book ''Urbicide'', Martin Coward argues along a similar line. Rather than use urbicide for all violence against the city, Coward uses the term to denote violence which seeks to annihilate difference through the destruction of the material foundation of that difference. The urban is meant to imply the material foundation of heterogeneity (being with others as being with otherness), and he interprets some instances of destruction of the city as an attempt to destroy the material foundations of that heterogeneity. Urbicide would then share the annihilatory character of genocide, but not necessarily its focus on human beings as the object of destruction.

The definition of urbicide is interdependent on the definitions of [[city]] and [[violence]]. In many urbicidal incidents, one or both of these definitions has been removed from the situation's context by the perpetrator. Either the "city" receiving the violence has been demoted from its status as "city", or the violent act is not considered violent. The meaning of the words city and violence therefore become highly important when classifying an act as urbicidal.

A [[city]] is an area consisting of numerous institutions, residents, industries, and businesses supported by large [[infrastructure]] and a dense and diverse population. A city can be framed in numerous ways. For example, it can be thought of as an economic system, in which all social relations stem from a market economy, and the city is produced and shaped by the market. A city can also be thought of as a state of mind, in which all people who live in the city share the same consciousness. Similarly, it can be seen as an aggregation of different social/cultural forms, making cities a center for heterogeneity.  Finally, a city can be seen from an architectural perspective, as a conglomeration of masses and spaces. As [[Henri Lefebvre]] states, "a city is, therefore, whatever is experienced, known, represented, constructed, or destroyed as a city."
[[Violence]] is typically defined as, "a behaviour involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill" (Compact Oxford Dictionary). However, when defining violence sociologists, historians, philosophers and other scholars have identified other less direct forms of violence that should also be considered. [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]] and [[Philippe Bourgois]] write in their book ''Violence in War and Peace'' that "Violence can never be understood solely in terms of its physicality – force, assault, or the infliction of pain – alone. Violence also includes assaults on the person hood, dignity, sense of worth or value of the victim.  The social and cultural dimensions of the violence are what gives violence its power and meaning."

Some of the other categories are [[structural violence]], [[symbolic violence]], and violence enacted by the government through laws or actions. [[Structural violence]] occurs when the structure of a [[society]] causes the violence. Examples of this include laws that create unequal access to public amenities or affect different citizens based on their status in society. [[Symbolic violence]] concerns socially accepted norms that are ingrained over time such as the roles of different classes, genders and ethnic groups. Finally political violence addresses the harm the government can inflict by their actions either through neglect or action.  All of these forms of violence can also be characterized in urbicide. 

While physical destruction of a city's buildings is the most obvious form of urbicide, it can also occur in less noticeable ways.  Governments redefining areas of the city as [[slums]] or "illegitimate" can lead to an unequal treatment of [[citizens]]. For people living in these areas they have been denied their [[citizenship]]. How a government [[Zoning|zones]] a city can also generate violence. While not directly causing harm, certain [[zoning]] combinations could increase violence, decrease the value of properties, and force poorer people into an undesirable neighborhood.

== Cases ==

The hybrid nature of the term urbicide suggests that it is either a radical framework through which to view the historical destruction of cities, or something appropriate only to the "now" and has mandatory qualities in the present. Whereas in its first modern manifestations the targeting and destruction of cities was seen as something new, outside the traditional rules of European warfare, [[Marshall Berman]], an American [[Marxist]] writer and political theorist, proposes that urbicide is the oldest story in the world. In his view, the [[Old Testament]] books of Jeremiah and Lamentations appropriately cover urbicide, or mark its beginnings. In later times the Roman Empire imposed the complete [[destruction of Jerusalem]] and a similarly devastating [[Carthaginian peace]], though these proved less than permanent. Nonetheless, Berman's view of potential "urbicidal" events is very much within the [[Marxist]] historical ''telos'', which suppresses the contingency of urbicide in history, or rather, its own ''telos''. 

Many cities are in some sense [[imperial cities]], having created an [[empire]] ([[Babylon]], [[Rome]]), or been created by one ([[Persepolis]], [[Cairo]], [[Philadelphia]]) or greatly expanded ([[Byzantium]], [[Delhi]]) or have become the capital of one ([[Peking]], [[London]]) or received special privileges from an empire, for example as [[Free Imperial Cities]].  Thus there are perspectives that see urbicide as part of broader [[imperialist]] goals, for example in the elimination of cities by [[Democratic Kampuchea|Communist Cambodia]]. Writers and  geographers such as [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]], [[Nurhan Abujidi]] and [[Stephen Graham (urbanist)|Stephen Graham]] represent some of these currents. The [[Siege of Sarajevo]], which led to the "coining" of urbicide, stands as the most symbolic historical event representative of urbicide. Recent events in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], [[Zimbabwe]], post-Katrina [[New Orleans]], and [[Iraq]] also stand as significant urbicidal examples, and can be taken as a broad spectrum of "violence against the city," indicating the fluidity or multi-faceted discourse of urbicide.

===Vukovar===
[[File:Castle Eltz Vukovar4.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The fall of Vukovar has been accompanied by destruction of the area. [[Eltz Manor|Castle Eltz]] was in ruins]]
{{main|Battle of Vukovar}}
The siege of Vukovar was an 87-day military campaign aimed against the eastern [[Croatia]]n city of [[Vukovar]] led by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], supported by various [[Serb]]ian [[paramilitary]] forces between August and November 1991 during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Indiscriminate bombardment of Vukovar, in which up to a million shells were fired on the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Anthony Lewis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/04/opinion/abroad-at-home-a-lesson-too-late.html|title=Abroad at Home – A Lesson Too Late|date=March 4, 1994|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to destruction of three quarters of all neighborhoods. 
Among them were [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[church (building)|church]]es, public institutions’ facilities, factories, medieval Eltz Castle and house of the Nobel-winning author [[Lavoslav Ružička]]. Several sources, like the Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia, described the systematic destruction of the city as urbicide.&lt;ref name="Vukovar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.yihr.org/uploads/file/YIHR%20-%20Special%20edition%20-%20Vukovar%20-%2018%20years%20after.pdf|title=Vukovar - 18 Years After|author=Dragan Popovic, Mario Mažić|year=2009|publisher=Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global-discourse.com/contents/urbicide-by-martin-coward/|title=Urbicide by Martin Coward|last=Coward|first=Martin|year=2010|publisher=Global Discourse|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeneucrnom.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=667&amp;lang=en|title=Those Responsible for Crimes in Vukovar Should be Prosecuted - reconciliation must be accompanied by responsibility|date=November 18, 2010|publisher=Women in Black|accessdate=28 July 2011|location=Belgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia also criticized the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] for not reaching a verdict for the destruction of Vukovar.&lt;ref name="Vukovar"/&gt; [[Slobodan Milošević]] was indicted for, inter alia, "wanton destruction" of the city,&lt;ref name="milosevic icty"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/icty/miloseviccroatiaindtmt100801.pdf  |title=Milošević Indictment (IT-02-54) - paragraph 36k, 106 &amp; 107 |date=2002-10-22 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but died before a verdict was reached. [[Goran Hadžić]] was also indicted in the same category and is on trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14223213|title=Goran Hadzic: The last fugitive|date=20 July 2011|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarajevo===
[[Image:Sarajevo Grbavica.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Heavily destroyed apartment buildings in [[Sarajevo]]]]
{{main|Siege of Sarajevo}}
Violence in [[Sarajevo]] was a product of the [[Bosnian War]], which lasted from 1992–1995  in which Serb forces of the [[Republika Srpska]] and the Yugoslav People's Army besieged Sarajevo. This region was very ethnically diverse, providing homes for both [[Serbs]] and [[Muslim Slavs]]. The violence is sometimes referred to as [[ethnic cleansing]] which ended in some of the worst violence this region has ever seen. Ultimately, urbicide resulted in the complete annihilation of Sarajevo's [[built environment]]. This broke down the city's [[infrastructure]] and denied thousands of civilians food, water, medicine, etc. In the wake of this violence, Sarajevo's Civilians also became victims of [[human rights]] offenses including rape, execution, and starvation. The [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] government declared the Siege over in 1996.

===Zimbabwe===

While the term "urbicide" finds its genesis in the urban destruction and targeting associated with the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] Wars of the early 1990s, its meaning(s) develops historically and in the present. Recent events in [[Zimbabwe]], while falling under the definition of urbicide as selective violence and destruction against cities, also positions urbicide outside the dynamics of genocidal warfare. [[Operation Murambatsvina]] or "Operation Restore Order" was a countrywide program of targeted violence against cities, towns, peripheral urban areas, and resettled farms, resulting in the destruction of housing, trading markets, and other "collective" structures. It was a large-scale operation, strategically resulting in the displacement of over 700,000 refugees, and "knowingly" manufacturing a massive humanitarian crisis. Beyond the obvious violations of human rights, Operation Murambatsvina is striking in its abilities to literally unhinge the urban and rural poor from the collective structures integral to everyday, grounded existence in favor of dispersal, but without active state measures to reinstitute these people within governable spaces. Clearly, Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina is urbicidal, yet a more important question is whether an urbicidal framework seeks a different subtext?

===New Orleans===

The destruction caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005 has been interpreted as the culmination of political and policy-driven urbicide that has been played out over many decades of corrupt politics, exemplified by leaders such as [[William J. Jefferson]] which led to waste and outright theft of civic funds by elected officials from all socioeconomic backgrounds. While [[natural disasters]] such as Katrina cannot be considered urbicidal in and of themselves, such disasters can, due to flawed governmental legislation, affect socioeconomic groups disproportionately. In the case of [[New Orleans]], the areas of the city that were hit hardest included neighborhoods from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Areas housing members of the lowest socioeconomic classes lacked the resources to rebuild and re-establish their communities. Higher income neighborhoods were able to raise funds for additional security and civic improvements through tax levees and private fund raising efforts. Impoverished neighborhoods dependent upon city's resources were unable to successfully re-establish themselves without federal [[Hurricane Katrina disaster relief]]. According to urbicide scholar [[Andrew Herscher]], "Katrina's effects…were but the last and most visible traces of a chronic disaster, an urbicide fabricated not by military action but by policy and ideology."

===Aleppo===

AlHakam Shaar and Robert Templer proposed that the deliberate destruction of Aleppo during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)|Battle of Aleppo]] was a form of "urbicide".&lt;ref name="Aleppo Elegy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Urbicide or an Elegy for Aleppo| url=https://www.academia.edu/29782378/Urbicide_OR_AN_ELEGY_FOR_ALEPPO |author=Al-Hakam Shaar, Robert Templer |publisher=academia.edu |page=109 |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human rights ==
[[Human rights]] discourse provides another lens in which we can view urbicide, especially through the use of The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the term urbicide, usually refers to violence and destruction of buildings and architecture, but when also using the UN's Declaration along with urbicide, the focus is instead on people. Looking at violent acts and observing how they affect people, their culture and their safety inevitably centers on human rights and may often carry more validity for these urbicidal acts to also be cases of human rights violations.

The following cases are viewed here with a greater focus on the human rights aspect of them. The term urbicide can still apply, but human rights language may allow for a more familiar approach to these cases as many people are already aware of the general rights that people hold. These rights are explicitly stated here to fully demonstrate how fundamental rights are being violated as part of urbicide:

===Sarajevo===
Article 3 of the [[UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and Article 5 states that no one shall be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However, 20,000 [[Muslim]] women and girls were raped by [[Serbs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/bosnia/context/0628warcrimes-tribunal.html | work=The New York Times | title=For First Time, Court Defines Rape as War Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; thousands were missing and/or executed. When using the term urbicide, human rights should be included because atrocities like this also affect the culture and feeling of the city. They must be taken into account when the urbicidal affects of bombings and military actions in the region are being examined because they show that [[History of Modern Sarajevo|the conflict]] was more than simply destroying the physical city buildings; there was destruction of people, their safety and of their communities.

===Zimbabwe===
The rights of 700,000 [[Zimbabweans]] were violated as they were forced from their urban homes and were left to create new lives for themselves during [[Operation Murambatsvina]] in May 2005 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5032156.stm]. Clearly this breaks the UN's Article 25 which says: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. The government forcibly removed these citizens from where they were living knowingly displaced them, leaving them without resources and access to food, shelter and health care.

== International law ==

As of now there is no explicit language mentioning urbicide in international and humanitarian law. As the term has been coined and interpreted only recently, during the [[Yugoslav war]] in the 1990s, it has not reached public consciousness and public discourse to such extent as to be an instantiated into international law. If [[genocide]] and urbicide, however, are synonymous terms, as some theorists propose, it could be argued that urbicide is already prohibited by [[international law]]. It can also be argued that urbicide, as destruction of urban spaces and human habitations, is made illegal under international law and humanitarian law through the effects of other laws dealing with destruction of human-made environment and people's dependency upon it. Such laws are the rights to adequate housing, the right to life and privacy, to mental integrity, and to the freedom of movement. The most salient example of [[Sarajevo]], where the term urbicide partly originated, clearly demonstrates the violation of these basic [[human rights]] on the civilian population of the city. Testimonies of the urbicide in Sarajevo, in the cultural production of confessional literature during the siege, clearly show the dramatic plunge in the standard of living, the overtaking and militarization of the public space, and the daily struggle of the citizens to get basic supplies such as food and water. In other cases, such as the Porta Farm evacuation and demolition of settlements by the Harare local government, there is evidence of violation of these basic human rights as specified by the International Law and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr46/004/2006/en/]. Despite the specified violations, however, it might be useful to apply, as with [[genocide]], the umbrella term urbicide for these and other cases of urban destruction.

The prospects for a codified prohibition of urbicide might benefit from differentiating the term's legal articulation from [[human rights]] law, just as urbicide conceptually separates itself from [[human rights]]. With the city as the site of urbicide, the traditional nation-state parties to international legislation might not suffice alone as stake-holders in any legal process, customary or otherwise. However, too much localizing of the criminalization of urbicide risks exonerating by inaction the governments often implicated as aggressors against the city and its citizens. It is often against their power interest to prosecute urbicide or to establish any form of judicial framework that deals explicitly with violations of such nature.

The inclusion of governments into the process is desirable, but their willingness to submit to another kind of scrutiny: particularly under the broad definitions of structural violence that often enter discourses on urbicide. They could presumably make their way into the legal discourses, as well.

The lack of explicit terminology that would address the destruction of cities in legal terms on the international level makes it unlikely that the international courts will take the issue more seriously. The problem is also with the enforcement of these laws on the international level, which have previously unenforced, even the human rights laws already in place.

Decisions of the [[International court]], such as the case of reparations to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] by the [[Serbia]]n government for [[crimes against humanity]], in which the court, in February 2007, acquitted [[Serbia]] of the duty to give reparations, perhaps demonstrate the further need to distinguish between urbicide and [[genocide]]. In the case of [[Sarajevo]], where the case of genocide, as legally understood, could not be unequivocally applied to cases such as the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], the concept of urbicide might provide a better interpretive framework for the violence inflicted upon the Sarajevo populace and their urban environment, such as the shared public space and the architecture of the city. The goal of such violence may have not been to destroy a minority population and their cultural and symbolic space, as in cases of [[genocide]] but to fragment the heterogeneous population of the city into homogeneous enclaves based on the [[ethnicity]] of the population. Thus, the violence is not directed towards an ethnicity per se, but towards the city as a heterogeneous space where different cultural identities can live and interact without antagonism.

==Career==
In 1956, Sukhodrev began his career in the translation bureau of the [[Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (MFA). Sukhodrev translated Nikita Khrushchev's famous quote "[[We will bury you]]",&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; among others. In the 1980s Sukhodrev was the deputy head of the Department for the United States and Canada at the Soviet MFA.&lt;ref name="kp"/&gt; In 1999 he penned the [[memoir]] book ''Yazyk moy – drug moy'' (''My Tongue is My Friend'').

During a career of nearly thirty years, Sukhodrev was present at numerous high-profile [[Summit (meeting)|summits]] and deal-makings. [[Richard Nixon]] called Sukhodrev "a superb linguist who spoke English as well as he did Russian",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nixon | first =Richard| title =RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon| publisher =Simon and Schuster| year =2013 | page =&lt;!-- pages are not numbered --&gt; | isbn =1476731837}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Henry Kissinger]] called him "unflappable" and a "splendid interpreter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kissinger | first =Henry | title =Years of Upheaval: The Second Volume of His Classic Memoirs| publisher =Simon and Schuster | year =2001 | page = &lt;!-- pages are not numbered --&gt; | isbn =0857207180}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', "Sukhodrev was present but not present, emptying himself of ego, slipping into the skin of the man who was speaking, feeling his feelings, saying his words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Torikai | first =Kumiko | title =Voices of the Invisible Presence: Diplomatic Interpreters in Post-World War II Japan| publisher =John Benjamins Publishing | year =2009 | page =1 | isbn =9027224277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet and U.S. officials alike considered him to be the best interpreter in the world between Russian and English and he would sometimes be the only interpreter at bilateral meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He had a very good understanding of idiomatic expressions in English with a firm grasp of the varied nuances of meaning in different parts of the English-speaking world.

'''Ștefan Aurel Baciu''' ({{lang-pt|Estêvão Baciu}}, {{lang-es|Esteban Baciu}}; October 29, 1918 – January 6, 1993) was a Romanian and Brazilian poet, novelist, publicist and academic who lived his later life in [[Hawaii]]. A precocious, award-winning, young author in interwar Romania, he was involved in editing several literary magazines. Attracted into left-wing democratic politics and the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR), he camouflaged his views while working for the [[Fascism|fascist]] press under dictatorial regimes, but returned in 1944 to manage the PSDR's ''Libertatea'' newspaper. Witnessing first-hand the gradual [[Communist Romania|communist takeover]], Baciu managed to have himself assigned to a diplomatic posting in [[Switzerland]], and ultimately defected in 1948. A resident and then citizen of Brazil, and a traveler throughout [[Latin America]], he wrote works in Portuguese, Spanish, English and German, as well as in his native Romanian.

Involved with the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] and a friend of independent socialists such as [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], Baciu spoke out against South American communism and criticized [[Fidel Castro]]. He eventually moved to the United States, as a professor at the [[University of Washington]], and, from 1964, the [[University of Hawaii]]. He put out the international magazine ''Mele'', which, although rudimentarily printed and little circulated, remains a noted source of information about avant-garde writers of the [[Romanian diaspora]], from [[Andrei Codrescu]] to [[Dolfi Trost]] and [[Sesto Pals]]. Baciu was also a preeminent historian and anthologist of South and Central American [[surrealism]], as well as a translator of [[Latin American literature]] into Romanian and German.

Baciu's sister, Ioana Veronica, had a successful career in the theater.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt; Through the Sagers, Ștefan and Ioana were of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish descent]].&lt;ref name="iddosarele"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Diaconescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/tefan_baciu_n_dosarele_securitii "Scriitori în arhiva CNSAS: Ștefan Baciu în dosarele Securității"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 21/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 161, 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Raised [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]], and still a practicing believer in the 1960s,&lt;ref name="scdinexil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Cioculescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/scrisori_din_exil "Scrisori din exil"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 12/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu considered himself a "cosmopolitan" one.&lt;ref&gt;Bodiu, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerian]]'s ''[[Viața Literară]]'', which had appointed Baciu its official correspondent and publicity agent for the whole of Transylvania.&lt;ref name="nsviața"/&gt; Struggling with financial difficulties,&lt;ref name="nsviața"/&gt; ''Start'' did not survive beyond its second issue.&lt;ref name="to122"/&gt; Baciu moved on to publish other magazines, alongside [[Vintilă Horia]], [[Mihai Beniuc]], and Ovid Caledoniu: ''Stilet'' ("Stiletto"), then ''Meșterul Manole'' (named after the [[Meșterul Manole|folk legend hero]]).&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt; Additionally, he was a contributor to literary magazines and newspapers across Romania, including ''[[Gând Românesc]]'', ''[[Glasul Bucovinei]]'', ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'', and [[George Ivașcu]]'s ''Manifest''.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt;

At age seventeen, Baciu had his ''Poemele poetului tânăr'' ("Poems of the Young Poet") picked up in a "young poets' anthology", and put out by the official publishing company, [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented with the company's own Young Writers Award and received the [[Romanian Writers' Society]] Poetry Prize.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt; He followed up in 1936 with ''Poeme de dragoste'' ("Love Poems"), published by ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'' of [[Oradea]], and in 1937 with ''Micul dor'' ("A Tiny Longing").&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idstreinu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iordan Datcu, [http://www.romlit.ro/vladimir_streinu_cenzurat "Vladimir Streinu cenzurat"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he was included in the anthology ''13 poeți'', with Horia, Caledoniu, [[Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu]], [[Simion Stolnicu]], [[Dumitru Gherghinescu-Vania]] and various others.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt;

===Under fascism===
Young Baciu was soon received into the cultural elite of [[Bucharest]], befriending the likes of [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]] and [[Ion Minulescu]].&lt;ref name="celumea1"/&gt; Alongside Caledoniu, [[George Petcu]], [[Maria Banuș]], [[Laurențiu Fulga]] and some others, Baciu was also drawn into the "White Nights Manifesto" circle, which sought to promote young literature. Also faced with financial troubles, and unsuccessful in its bid to receive state funding, the circle closed shop in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} M. Cosmescu Delasabar, [http://www.romlit.ro/george_petcu_si_manifestul_noptii_albe "George Petcu și ''Manifestul Nopții Albe''"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Baciu had since enlisted at the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Law, whence he graduated in 1941.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt; His college years overlapped with the demise of Romanian democracy and several authoritarian experiments, the first of which was a [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship. By late 1938,&lt;ref name="mngiur"&gt;{{ro icon}} Miron Neagu, [http://www.romlit.ro/din_arhiva_emil_giurgiuca "Din arhiva Emil Giurgiuca"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 51-52/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu had begun collaborating in the semi-official newspaper, ''[[Sfarmă-Piatră]]'', published by the fascist sympathizer [[Nichifor Crainic]]. He had a literary history column, ''Cronici germane'' ("German Chronicles"), with which he aimed to popularize "that superb [[German Romanticism]]".&lt;ref name="sbinceput2"&gt;Ștefan Baciu, "Cronici germane. Cuvânt de început", in ''[[Universul|Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 43/1939, p. 2 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; He was in correspondence with a more senior poet, [[Emil Giurgiuca]], offering to popularize Giurgiuca's work "in ''Sfarmă-Piatră'' or wherever".&lt;ref name="mngiur"/&gt; Also in 1938, Baciu collected his translations from [[Georg Trakl]], which came out at Editura Frize in [[Iași]].&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t171"&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Having openly supported the [[Iron Guard]] as a radical fascist alternative to the establishment, ''Sfarmă-Piatră'' was also falling into disfavor with the National Renaissance Front regime. Early in 1939, following bloody clashes between the Front and the Guardists, ''Sfarmă-Piatră'' was outlawed. Baciu moved to the more mainstream ''[[Universul]]'', becoming its editor&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt; and resuming ''Cronici germane'' in its literary supplement.&lt;ref name="sbinceput2"/&gt; He also held the literary criticism column, taking over from [[Ștefan Augustin Doinaș]].&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Popa, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=2119 "Alte inedite Ștefan Augustin Doinaș"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 7/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early stages of World War II, Crainic gave Baciu the office of editorial secretary at ''[[Gândirea]]'' magazine, but sacked him upon finding out about his Social Democratic loyalties.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t163"&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; According to communist sources, Baciu was himself an affiliate or sympathizer of the Iron Guard—a claim that has since been disputed; Baciu's PSDR membership and his mother's Jewishness disqualified him for such an enterprise.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; By his own account, Baciu was a ''malagambist'', meaning that he followed the [[Zoot suit|zoot-clad]] jazzman [[Sergiu Malagamba]] and had cosmopolitan, Americophile tastes.&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[George Ciorănescu]], Crisula Ștefănescu, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2010/10/stefan-baciu-un-poet-roman-din-america-latina/ "Ștefan Baciu, un poet român din America Latină"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 297, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He did however befried the Guard's poet laureate, [[Radu Gyr]], helping him publish in ''Gândirea'' even after the Guard's [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|violent fall from grace in early 1941]].&lt;ref name="gyr100"&gt;"Centenar Radu Gyr", in ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 3/2005, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his graduation, Baciu became translator for the Institute of Statistics (under [[Sabin Manuilă]]),&lt;ref name="scdinexil"/&gt; cultural adviser for the [[General Council of Bucharest|General Council]] of [[Bucharest]], and publisher for the companies Gorjanul and Publicom.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt; His poetic work was collected in the volumes ''Drumeț în anotimpuri'' ("A Traveler through Seasons", 1939), ''Căutătorul de comori'' ("The Treasure Hunter", 1939), ''Cetatea lui Bucur'' ("[[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|Bucur]]'s Citadel", 1940), and ''Muzica sferelor'' ("[[Musica universalis|Music of the Spheres]]", 1943).&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt; Attracted by the prospects of a good pay in the only thriving literary industry of the war years, he began contributing to the humorous press. He debuted in Virgil Slăvescu's ''Păcală'', as "Grigore Cumpănașu", and later held columns in ''Veselia'' and [[Ion Anestin]]'s ''Gluma''.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

While at university, Baciu had met and fallen in love with Mira Simian (born 1920). The daughter of Dinu Simian, a [[National Peasants' Party]] politician from [[Vâlcea County]], heir to a tanning and footwear-making empire,&lt;ref name="cmoahu"&gt;Constantin Mateescu, "Oahu", in ''Acolada'', Nr. 1/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Poles in Romania|Polish]] wife, Mira attended the Bucharest Faculty of Letters, then worked as a pharmacist in [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]]. She married Baciu upon the war's end.&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt;

===PSDR journalist, diplomat, defector===
The [[King Michael's Coup|August 23, 1944 Coup]] unsealed Romania's alliance with [[Nazi Germany]], and brought back democracy, but also signified the onset of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]]. Shortly after the legalization of political parties, Baciu became editor of the Social Democratic press organ ''Libertatea'' ("Liberty").&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 253; Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1944 to December 1945,&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt; he edited his own illustrated satirical review, ''Humorul'' ("Humor"). Meanwhile, he also put out new selections from his poetry: ''Cântecul mulțimii'' ("Song of the Crowd"), with a preface by [[Ion Pas]], came out at the PSDR party press in 1944; ''Caiet de vacanță'' ("Notebook for the Holidays") at Unirea of Râmnicu Vâlcea in 1945.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt; His circle of acquaintances grew to include some members of the Bucharest surrealist circle, in particular [[Sesto Pals]] (who was Baciu's lifelong friend)&lt;ref name="mfciudat"&gt;{{ro icon}} Michaël Finkenthal, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Sesto-Pals-sau-poezia-omului-ciudat*articleID_8235-articles_details.html "Sesto Pals sau poezia omului ciudat"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 169, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dolfi Trost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cornel Ungureanu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/michael_finkenthal_de_la_fundoianu_i_estov_la_trost_i_sesto_pals "Michael Finkenthal, de la Fundoianu și Șestov la Trost și Sesto Pals"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 19/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

With his party falling under the influence of [[Romanian Communist Party|Romanian Communists]], Baciu remained close to the independent pro-Western wing, under [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]].&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 275, 279–280; Lazăr, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; As he would note in 1992, Baciu had always been "an adept of [[democratic socialism]]".&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to Petrescu as "the tocsin-sounder of the great perils that were knocking on our door, perils not just for the existence of social democracy, but also of Romania's very existence as a free democratic state".&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Baciu described with alarm the rapid communization of his writer friends, recording Beniuc's enthusiasm at seeing liberal demonstrators being repressed with machine guns.&lt;ref name="lb265"&gt;Boia, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He also witnessed the desperation of his friend Gyr, who attempted suicide in Râmnicu Vâlcea.&lt;ref name="gyr100"/&gt; However, according to literary historian Mircea Popa, Baciu's ''Libertatea'' editorials were of that kind "that would later shame him": young Baciu ridiculed the prewar regime as an era of conformity and "nothingness", and even praised [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="popa92-93"&gt;Popa, p. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Communist Party politicians tempted him with offers to become [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] or theater manager.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu was present at the PSDR Congress of March 10, 1946, which resulted in the party's electoral alliance with the Communists. His testimony describes Petrescu's anti-fusion speech as the point of view of a "good and courageous Romanian". Baciu further recalls: "I walked [Petrescu] back to his home alongside some hundreds of partisans".&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 279–280&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1946, owing to his Social Democratic credentials,&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t162"/&gt; Baciu was appointed press officer of the Romanian Embassy in [[Bern]]. The ambassador was [[Șerban Voinea]], a PSDR theoretician. Baciu conceived of this assignment as a safe haven from communism, but was still troubled about leaving Romania and his relatives. He brought up the issue in conversations with Petrescu, who advised him: "Forget [Mira's] pharmacy, choose freedom."&lt;ref name="celumea1"/&gt; His appointment became the object of disputes between Communist-controlled agencies and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs]], which was still controlled by an ally, [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]]. As Baciu recalls, Tătărescu gave him and his wife tacit backing, without signing any papers, and discreetly handed them their diplomatic passports.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;

On November 5, the Bacius crossed into [[Hungarian Republic (1946–49)|Hungary]] semi-clandestinely, knowing that they risked being returned at the border.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; The [[Petru Groza]] government was only informed later of their arrival in Bern. Like Voinea, Baciu had open disagreements with his Bucharest superiors, complaining that his efforts to publicize [[Romanian literature]] in the Swiss "workers' press" were not being supported by the Romanian state.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t163"/&gt; He wrote for the editorial section of ''[[Tribune de Genève]]'', to dissuade Swiss fears about the stabilization of the [[Romanian leu]]. The communist authorities later accused him of purposefully withholding information, "thus giving reactionaries reason to minimize this important reform".&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt; In late 1947, just before the proclamation of a [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist republic]], Voinea resigned his posting. Baciu, who was recalled and assigned to a new post in [[Sofia]], opted to discontinue his work in diplomacy and demand [[political asylum]] in Switzerland. He was advised to do so by a friend, Victor Popescu (son of ''Universul'' editor [[Stelian Popescu]]).&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t163"/&gt;

===Brazilian exile===
The Bacius registered their case with the [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO), who processed them to determine if they were or had been undercover agents of a secret service.&lt;ref name="ișl294"&gt;Lazăr, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; During the interval, Baciu was publishing essays and in ''Literarische Tat'',&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt; and Mira was working for the [[Zytglogge]] pharmacy.&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt; The Bacius simultaneously applied for asylum in Brazil, [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]] (meanwhile, Mira's uncles had managed to escape to [[Argentina]]).&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t163"/&gt;

Cleared by the IRO in early 1949, the Bacius were given asylum rights in Brazil, and arrived at [[Rio de Janeiro]] in March.&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt; They had a rough start in the new country, and struggled to make ends meet.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt; Ștefan Baciu resumed his work in poetry, translating Latin American novellas into German and Raúl Otero Reiche's ''América'' into Romanian, and publishing his own surrealist works, including ''Analiza cuvântului dor'' ([[Valle Hermoso, Córdoba|Valle Hermoso]], 1951).&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 164, 170, 171&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1952, alongside [[Faust Brădescu]], he was editing ''Înșir-te Mărgărite'', a magazine for the Romanian Brazilian community, which also reached Romanian communities from Argentina to [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; Its stated purpose was the preservation and publicizing of Romanian poetry and prose.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"/&gt; Romania's [[Securitate]] secret police, which was following his movements, noted Brădescu's Iron Guard affiliation as a sign of Baciu's own fascism.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t164"&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1953, Baciu was made editor of the foreign politics page at [[Carlos Lacerda]]'s ''Tribuna da Imprensa''.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 79–80; Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Securitate, this was a "newspaper of the fascist kind".&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt; He published occasional contributions to ''Revista da Semana'', ''Diário Carioca'', and ''Maquis'', and, in 1957, two volumes of his [[Brazilian Portuguese|Portuguese-language]] poetry: ''Aula de solidão'' ("Lesson in Solitude"), ''Dois Guatemaltecos'' ("Two Guatemalans").&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 164, 170&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Mira Baciu worked as a translator for the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Deputies' Chamber]].&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt;

With ''Tribuna da Imprensa'' credentials, Baciu traveled across Latin America. In Mexico, he interviewed [[Natalia Sedova]], widow of [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; In 1956, he was at [[Lima]], where he met the Romanian writer-violinist [[Grigore Cugler]]. The two began a correspondence, with Baciu persuading Cugler to republish his 1930s avant-garde stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristian Livescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/LIVESCUmai11.htm "Avangarda solitară: poezia lui Grigore Cugler, 'simbolul însuși al exilului deplin'"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He prepared for publishing Cugler's ''Afară de unul singur'', but the manuscript was lost in the process (although an earlier print was eventually recovered in 1998).&lt;ref name="isurmuz"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/al_doilea_urmuz "Al doilea Urmuz"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu also embarked on a mission to popularize Romanian avant-garde writers, publishing Spanish and Portuguese essays about [[Urmuz]] and [[Constant Tonegaru]].&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"/&gt;

By then, Baciu was also involved with the anti-authoritarian left-wing movement on the South American continent. As he saw it, the ''[[caudillo]]'' regimes of [[Alfredo Stroessner]], [[Juan Perón]] or [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]] were generally equivalent to Eastern European [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1967), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[El Salvador|Salvadorean]] diplomat Rafael Barraza Monterrosa, the Bacius managed a [[Panhispanism|Panhispanist]] association, called [[Ruy Barbosa]] Circle, building personal contacts with [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], the exiled [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] socialist,&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1967), p. 93; Lazăr, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carlos Mérida]], the [[Guatemala]]n painter.&lt;ref name="ștb(83)11"&gt;Baciu (1983), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he had an encounter with Cuban revolutionary [[Fidel Castro]], and became a sympathizer of his [[26th of July Movement]].&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;

===CCF and Cuban Revolution===
The Bacius were eventually granted [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazilian citizenship]],&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt; and became fully integrated in Brazil's cultural life. The couple counted among their writer friends [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], [[Manuel Bandeira]] and [[Cecília Meireles]].&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt; In April 1958, Baciu, Meireles and Bandeira were among the 42 intellectuals who set up a Brazilian chapter of the anticommunist [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] (CCF), which, from 1959, put out the Portuguese-language review ''Cadernos Brasileiros''.&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 72–73, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was in part funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], through its Paris agent, John Hunt (with whom Baciu corresponded), and answered directly to the Spaniard [[Julián Gorkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu joined the staff of ''Cadernos'' as editor in chief (with [[Afrânio Coutinho]] as editorial manager) and was General Secretary of the CCF until August 1962;&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 79–80, 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; Mira was the Executive Secretary.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt;

Baciu was with Bosch in Venezuela, celebrating [[Rómulo Betancourt]]'s victory in the [[Venezuelan general election, 1958|election of December 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1967), pp. 11, 29, 44–46, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Bosch, he organized a negative campaign against the [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|Republic of Cuba]], but Bosch refused any explicit endorsement of Castro's guerrilla.&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1967), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1959, following the success of the [[Cuban Revolution]], Baciu was invited by the new government in [[Havana]], to report on the work of the revolutionary tribunals.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t164"/&gt; He declined the invitation but, later that year, he made his way there to interview Castro. He recorded in particular Castro's disdain for the [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|Cuban Communists]].&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t164"/&gt; In March, he happened to meet Castro's communist inspiration, [[Che Guevara]], but they only discussed literature.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;

Also in 1959, Baciu published in Rio the essay ''Um continente em busca de uma doutrina'' ("A Continent Searching for a Doctrine").&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elc79"&gt;Cancelli, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Rio.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt; He was working on the book of memoirs in Portuguese, ''Bucareste-Estação Norte'' ("Bucharest-[[Gara de Nord|Northern Station]]"), which came out at Edições o Cruzeiro in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 163, 171&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Baciu's Romanian relatives were suffering under communist persecution. Dinu Simian was mistreated and tortured in [[Sighet prison]], where he eventually died; Dinu's wife, Constanța, was also detained, and, upon her 1962 release, had to struggle to make ends meet.&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt; In 1962, through the intercession of [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], Mira Baciu persuaded the Romanian authorities to grant her mother safe passage to Brazil.&lt;ref name="ișl294"/&gt;

With his 1961 reportage ''Cortina de hierro sobre Cuba'' ("The [[Iron Curtain]] over Cuba"), prefaced by [[Salvador de Madariaga]],&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; Baciu made public his criticism of [[Castroism|Castroist]] communism, and condemned its spread to other Latin American nations.&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 164–165, 171&lt;/ref&gt; He rendered it even more explicit in the poem ''Eu nu îl cînt pe Che'' ("I Do Not Sing for Che"), known in Spanish as ''Yo no canto al Ché''.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Elena Cruz Varela, [http://www.hispanocubana.org/archivos_pdfs/20140227_185452_noticias_id381_revista_hc16.pdf "La Sangrieta saga del Coma-andante Castro"], in ''Revista Hispano-cubana'', Nr. 16, May–September 2003, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; This change of attitudes was radical, as Baciu moved to confront the communists directly, and, in his letters to Gorkin, stated his desire to purge the CCF itself of "camouflaged" [[Brazilian Communist Party|Brazilian Communists]].&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 81, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas alarmed the CIA, since they risked alienating the anticommunist left. John Hunt and [[Keith Botsford]] repeatedly asked Baciu to focus on anti-Casto, rather than "right-wing", propaganda (Hunt referred to Baciu as "a right-wing democratic socialist", a Betancourt associate, and a "maniac").&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the Brazilian CCF was vulnerable, its CIA connections brought up for public debate by communist intellectuals like [[Jorge Amado]] and [[Egídio Squeff]].&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not formally adhere to any Romanian anticommunist organization,&lt;ref name="celumea1"/&gt; Baciu was in correspondence with [[Constantin Vișoianu]] and the [[Romanian National Committee]], publishing anticommunist essays in the latter's ''România'' gazette.&lt;ref name="scdinexil"/&gt;

Allegedly, Baciu found himself threatened by the [[Dirección General de Inteligencia|Cuban Intelligence Directorate]].&lt;ref name="ișl295"&gt;Lazăr, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was Baciu's extreme anticommunism that prompted Hunt to demand his resignation and appoint [[Vicente de Paulo Barretto]] as the new CCF General Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, pp. 82–83, 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu later commented that the CCF had committed "suicide" by moderating its tone, noting that its "constructive dialogue with proven communists" was a moral victory for "[[Eurocommunism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cancelli, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Seattle and Honolulu===
Baciu's Rio colleagues backed him in his bid for the [[Brazilian literature]] chair at the [[University of Washington]]. He obtained it, and moved to [[Seattle]], where Mira began her own career as a Spanish-language teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mira detested the [[Oceanic climate]], and the couple was often taking trips back to Latin America.&lt;ref name="ișl295"/&gt; In 1963, Baciu and his wife were in [[Santo Domingo]], celebrating Bosch's victory in the [[Dominican Republic general election, 1962|Dominican presidential suffrage]].&lt;ref name="scdinexil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1967), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, they also visited neighboring [[Haiti]],&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt; where Baciu was trying to recover for publishing the obscure surrealist works of [[Clément Magloire-Saint-Aude]].&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1983), pp. 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Baciu published in [[Mexico City]] his poetic cycle ''Poemele poetului pribeag'' ("Poems of the Outcast Poet").&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt;

In 1964, Baciu obtained a professorship in [[Latin American literature]] at the newly founded [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="ișl295"/&gt; He enjoyed his work there, but felt bad about the smaller attendance his classes inevitably received.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"/&gt; In 1965, the Bacius set up their own magazine, ''International Poetry Letter – Mele'' (from the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] for "song"),&lt;ref name="ișl295"/&gt; which sought to establish connections between Latino, [[French literature|French]], [[American literature|American]] and Romanian literature. Although noted for the quality of its illustrations,&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt; ''Mele'' had a very minor circulation, with at most 300 copies per issue,&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"/&gt; all of them [[Xerography|xerographed]] by Baciu's students.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;

''Mele'' sought to popularize Romanian authors, and, doubling as a publishing house, put out periodic selections from Baciu's own poems in Romanian and Spanish.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt; Baciu helped discover and popularize [[Andrei Codrescu]], the neo-avant-garde Romanian exile writer.&lt;ref name="ccnemaip"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cosmin Ciotloș]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_poet_nemaipomenit "Un poet nemaipomenit"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 19/2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florina Pîrjol, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Tripla-lansare-Andrei-Codrescu*articleID_13013-articles_details.html "Tripla lansare Andrei Codrescu"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 265, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the Bacius' home in [[Honolulu]] hosted [[Bartolomeu Anania|Valeriu Anania]], the writer and abbot of the [[Romanian Orthodox Archdiocese of America and Canada|Romanian Orthodox Church in America]]. A former Iron Guard man and prisoner of the communists, released with the spell of liberalization in 1964, Anania was treating his depression in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="ștcdestinul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ștefan Cazimir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ce_straniu_poate_fi_destinul_unui_om "'Ce straniu poate fi destinul unui om!'"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcanania"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Cartea-vietii-lui-Valeriu-Anania*articleID_21383-articles_details.html "Cartea vieții lui Valeriu Anania"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 465, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was putting to paper a novel and poetry that he had "written inside his brain" while in jail, and doing research into [[Folklore in Hawaii|Hawaiian folklore]].&lt;ref name="ștcdestinul"/&gt; Anania later recalled that Mira Baciu had fallen in love with him, and that he had to fend off her advances while remaining friends with her and her husband.&lt;ref name="pcanania"/&gt;

Baciu returned to Romanian-language publishing with the 1967 ''Ukulele'', put out by George Uscătescu's Editura Destin in Spain.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; He also made a comeback to Portuguese letters with the 1966 essay ''Manuel Bandeira de corpo inteiro'' ("The Complete Manuel Bandeira").&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elc79"/&gt; He followed up with a 1967 essay on the politics of Juan Bosch and Spanish-language poetry volumes, ''Semblanza y explicación de Latinoamérica'' ("A Profile and Explanation of Latin America") of 1968 and the 1973 ''Nasserismo'' ("[[Nasserism]]").&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t170"/&gt; In 1972, he published in Madrid's ''Colecția Start'' a complete collection of his Romanian poems. They featured a preface by [[Lucian Boz]] and a portrait by [[Marcel Janco]].&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt; Baciu also translated Romanian poetry into Spanish, and published several anthologies, beginning with the 1969 ''Poetas rumanos''.&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 165, 171&lt;/ref&gt; He was under contract with publishing houses in [[West Germany]], such as Peter Hammer and Neues Leben, translating for them five volumes of poetry by [[Ernesto Cardenal]].&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t171"/&gt;

===Anthologist===
Inspired by an encounter with French surrealist [[Benjamin Péret]],&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1983), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu had begun a vast work of research into the history of Latin American avant-garde literature, and spent some time in Peru and [[Bolivia]]. By his own account, he interviewed "my great friend" [[Tristán Marof]], [[Luis Alberto Sánchez]], [[Javier Sologuren]] and [[Emilio Adolfo von Westphalen]], and helped rediscover the anticommunist surrealist [[Rafael Méndez Dorich]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Baciu, "«Rafo» Méndez, soldat inconnu du surréalisme péruvien", in ''Mélusine. Cahiers du Centre de recherche sur le surréalisme'', Nr. 1/1979, pp. 221–226&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Sologuren, Baciu's studies also helped revive interest in the poetry of [[César Moro]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Javier Sologuren]], ''Obras completas de Javier Sologuren, VII'', [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]], Lima, 2005, pp. 349, 370.  {{ISBN|9972-42-681-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, Baciu befriended [[Aldo Pellegrini]], who let him discover early avant-garde texts by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and "the extraordinary" [[Antonio Porchia]].&lt;ref&gt;Baciu (1983), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Pellegrini also introduced him to [[Enrique Gómez Correa]] and the Chilean surrealist scene. Introduced to [[Jean Charlot]] by Mérida, Baciu researched the history of [[Mexican muralism]], and discovered the proto-surrealism of [[José Guadalupe Posada]].&lt;ref name="ștb(83)11"/&gt;

He was still following with interest the work of writers in Romania, and published his translations of neomodernist Romanian literature in a special issue of Peru's ''Haraui'' review.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt; Baciu also followed the work of Romanians who translated Latino literature into Romanian. He found these attempts inauthentic and superficial, and criticized them in the 1970 essay ''Brazilia masacrata''. To the irritation of [[Editura Dacia]] publishers, he mailed them copies of this critique.&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu later exposed [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], noting for instance the cuts that had been made into the published diaries of Șuluțiu, and the exclusion of [[concrete poetry]] from the Brazilian anthologies of [[Darie Novăceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it, "I believe it a duty of the exile writer to defend the Romanian language from the '[[Partiinost'|party-minded]]' invasion of the mediocrities, the boot-lickers, the savvy ones and the profiteers, be they talented or talentless."&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt;

Baciu's inclusion in a poetry anthology, put out in Bucharest by [[Nicolae Manolescu]], scandalized the communist apparatus; the work was soon withdrawn from bookstores by the censors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monica Lovinescu]], ''Unde scurte'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1990, pp. 340–344.  {{ISBN|973-28-0172-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the new communist regime of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] made some efforts to appease Baciu and enlist him to write "propaganda for Romanian art and culture during the years of socialist consolidation",&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt; and even allowed Romanian journalists to contact him on the phone. Baciu claimed to have cut short such attempts, identifying them as a Securitate diversion.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; His rejection did not prevent Iron Guard loyalists such as [[Horia Stamatu]] from labeling Baciu a spy and avoiding all contact with him.&lt;ref&gt;"I. P. Culianu – M. L. Ricketts Correspondence" (letter of January 19, 1988), in Mihaela Gligor (ed.), ''Mircea Eliade between the History of Religions and the Fall into History'', Presa Universitară Clujeană, Cluj-Napoca, 2014, p. 147.  {{ISBN|978-973-595-676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Baciu ultimately put out at [[SUNY Press]] an overall anthology of Latin American poetry (''Antología de la poesía latinoamericana''), and at Editorial Joaquín Mortiz, in Mexico City, a critical anthology of Latin American surrealism, ''Antología de la poesía surrealista latinoamericana''.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t166"&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The latter book was enthusiastically reviewed in ''Plural'' magazine by the writer [[Octavio Paz]], who noted that it was "indispensable" to the study of local surrealism and that it marked the "end of gossip" about the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Octavio Paz]], [http://www.mandragora.uchile.cl/critica/estudios/grupal/paz.htm "Sobre el surrealismo hispanoamericano: El fin de las habladurías"], in ''Plural'', Nr. 35/1974 (republished by the [[University of Chile]], [[La Mandrágora]] project)&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen by literary historians as "orthodox" in comparison with Pellegrini's earlier chrestomathy.&lt;ref&gt;Editor notes to [[Leslie Bethell]] (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Latin America, 10'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge etc., 1995, pp. 266, 588.  {{ISBN|0-521-49594-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he edited in Madrid posthumous reissue of Cugler's ''Vi-l prezint pe Țeavă''.&lt;ref name="isurmuz"/&gt; The following year, at [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Baciu put out a volume of his own essays on [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Mira Baciu, who discovered her artistic talents and became ''Mele'' illustrator, had completed her specialization at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under [[Jacques Borel]], she lectured in Spanish language, then became a professor of French.&lt;ref name="ișl295"/&gt; She befriended artist [[Jacques Hérold]], who illustrated her poetry volume of 1973, ''Houla, Macumba, Hora''.&lt;ref name="ișl295"/&gt; She died of cancer, on July 2, 1978, bequeathing her estate to fund a Romanian literature scholarship at the University of Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Mira's death left Baciu in near-complete isolation from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: "I literally have no one to whom I would read the things I write. There are at most ten Romanian speakers living in Honolulu and none of them, absolutely none, has ever been to a bookstore or a library to peek into, or to ask for, or to purchase a single book of poetry."&lt;ref name="celumea1"/&gt; He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled ''Mira''.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as ''Praful de pe tobă'' ("The Dust on the Drum").&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 566, 567; Spiridon &amp; Toader, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; It was taped by [[Virgil Ierunca]] and serialized by [[Radio Free Europe]] (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;

In 1979, ''Antología de la poesía surrealista latinoamericana'' was reissued by the [[University of Valparaíso]]. Baciu also issued a new chrestomathy of Romanian-to-Spanish translations: ''11+11 poetas rumanos contemporáneos'', published by the [[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]] (UNAN).&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 165, 169&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to putting out ''Mele'' and his own works therein, Baciu published the Spanish-language collection of his poetry, ''El que pierde gana'' ("He Who Loses Wins", UNAN, 1978) and ''Pasaporte y pãnuelo'' ("Passport and Handkerchief", Revista Conservadora del Pensamiento Centroamericano, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Portuguese-language writing in 1982, with ''Carioca honorário'' ("An Honorary [[Carioca]]"), which came out in 1982 at [[Pernambuco]]'s Edições Pirata, and ''Lavradio 98'', a memoir of his work under Lacerda, at Editora Nova Fronteira of Rio.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t171"/&gt; These were followed in 1984 by ''Un rumano en el Istmo'' ("A Romanian in the Isthmus"), at [[Universidad Veracruzana]]; and in 1985 by translations from [[Lucian Blaga]] (co-written with [[Eugenio Montejo]]),&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt; at Fundarte of [[Caracas]],&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 171, 173&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[National University of Costa Rica|Heredia University]] biography of [[Francisco Amighetti]].&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; Among Baciu's later contributions include several essays such as ''Centroamericanos '' (San José, 1986) and a biography of [[Tristán Marof]] ([[La Paz]], 1987).&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;

===Final years===
Throughout the late 1970s and early '80s, despite Baciu's isolation, ''Mele'' managed to obtain collaborations from many other Romanian writers, acquiring a relevant role in Romanian literary history. It hosted selections from the poetry of [[George Ciorănescu]], who was at the time a chronicler for RFE. Ciorănescu returned the favor by popularizing Baciu's work in one of his broadcasts.&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt; ''Mele'' was especially noted for its reissue of works by the 1940s Romanian avant-garde. Baciu repeatedly tried to persuade Sesto Pals, who had returned to his regular job as an engineer, to publish a selection of his lifetime works.&lt;ref name="mfciudat"/&gt; The May 1985 issue of ''Mele'' was entirely dedicated to Pals' poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 172, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu also tracked down and interviewed poet-draftsman [[Paul Păun]], who, like Pals, moved from Romania to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 158, 169, 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Baciu maintained a close relationship with dissidents and avant-garde writers in his native Romania—over 100 people, according to concerned Securitate operatives.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; Such figures include [[Nicolae Carandino]], [[Alexandru Paleologu]], [[Radu Tudoran]], [[Corneliu Coposu]], [[Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu]], [[Constantin Noica]], [[Dan Culcer]] and [[Daniela Crăsnaru]].&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t166"/&gt; He also corresponded with Constantin Mateescu, who provided him with references for the history of Mira's native city, Râmnicu Vâlcea. As Mateescu recalls, Vâlcea was still Baciu's "charming land".&lt;ref name="cmoahu"/&gt; Baciu wrote a complete list of his own works, addressing it to literary critic [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]; like his other letters home, it was intercepted by the Securitate.&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon &amp; Toader, pp. 162, 165–166, 168–173&lt;/ref&gt;

As remarked by Mateescu, in 1984 the correspondence was abruptly interrupted, "even though [Baciu], well informed about our country's realities, was prudent and restrained in his statements".&lt;ref name="cmoahu"/&gt; Baciu's file shows that the Securitate also made note of this prudence, and was undecided about how to interpret it:&lt;blockquote&gt;Albeit he misses his country, [Baciu] does not wish to return for a visit, his refusal backed up by confused explanations, by 'poetic' statements according to which 'he carries his country inside him'. Although [Baciu] is adamant about his refusal of our country's current socio-political system, one may conclude that his literary activity, his propagation of Romanian literature, art and traditions, is positive in nature.&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The secret police repeatedly tried but failed to recruit Baciu's Romanian relatives as informants, and resorted to harassing them at their workplaces.&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;

With some of his late works of [[autofiction]], Baciu saluted the [[Brașov Rebellion|anticommunist revolt in his native Brașov]].&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt; He was enthusiastic about the success of Romania's [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]]. According to his diaspora friend Constantin Eretescu, he hoped to see a rapid transition to a Western-style democracy, but was soon disappointed by the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] regime.&lt;ref name="celumea1"/&gt; Interviewed by [[Marta Petreu]] for ''[[Apostrof]]'', he noted that "one has a hard time adjusting after forty-six years in exile".&lt;ref name="sp&amp;t165"/&gt; His contribution was honored abroad: retired from Hawaii University as a ''professor emeritus'', he was also Bolivia's honorary consul in Honolulu.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt; In 1991, he became Commander of the Bolivian Order of Merit.&lt;ref name="gazetaceleb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iddosarele"/&gt;

Baciu died in Honolulu on January 6, 1993, allegedly while talking to his sister Ioana over the phone.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt; His corpus of works, beginning with ''Poemele poetului tânăr'', was being republished in Romania, following efforts by his sister and his brother-in-law, Ovidiu Mărgineanu.&lt;ref name="gșsteag"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Steag-in-berna-la-Casa-memoriala-Stefan-Baciu*articleID_16780-articles_details.html "Steag în bernă la Casa memorială Ștefan Baciu"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 354, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A new edition of ''Praful de pe tobă'' saw print at [[Editura Eminescu]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="lb265"/&gt; ''Mira'' was also republished, by [[Editura Albatros]], in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, when his ''Cetatea lui Bucur'' was reissued to critical acclaim,&lt;ref name="ccnemaip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dc-evisuri"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]], [http://revistacultura.ro/cultura.php?articol=1506 "Versuri metropolitane"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 79, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the "Yellow House" in Brașov was opened for the public as a Ștefan Baciu Memorial House, presently maintained by Brașov City Hall.&lt;ref name="gșsteag"/&gt;

==Poetry==
Critic [[Vladimir Streinu]] saw Ștefan Baciu's early poetry as "boastful", but lacking "a timber of its own", and ultimately "neutral".&lt;ref name="idstreinu"/&gt; His first surrealist episode was with ''Start'',&lt;ref&gt;Opriș, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; ridiculed at the time by the mainstream review ''[[Viața Românească]]'' for its "jolly good" metaphors: "It tells us that hounds feed on warm meat and that legs will sing when they walk."&lt;ref&gt;"Revista revistelor române. ''Start''", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 11/1933, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Poeme de dragoste'', Streinu suggests, "the tone is youthful", but the subject matter is excessively [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] and self-absorbed.&lt;ref name="idstreinu"/&gt;

The poet soon moved into a more traditionalist format, with echoes from [[Ion Pillat]] and [[Parnassianism]].&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt; The result is visualized by critic [[Daniel Cristea-Enache]] as a "lace of [[Impressionist literature|impressionism]]" with a "thin but strong" [[Expressionism|expressionistic]] thread.&lt;ref name="dc-evisuri"/&gt; According to ''[[România Literară]]'' reviewer [[Cosmin Ciotloș]], this is an "exact and painstaking", but also "stunning", species of poetry.&lt;ref name="ccnemaip"/&gt; In ''Cetatea lui Bucur'', Baciu outlined his vision of a decadent-but-fascinating [[Bucharest]], with its many paradoxes: "How much I hate thee, my beloved city"; "Your bitter joy has done me in".&lt;ref name="dc-evisuri"/&gt; As noted by Ciotloș, in Baciu's Bucharest "everything is alive, everything is artificial".&lt;ref name="ccnemaip"/&gt; The poetic cycle shows Baciu as a social critic, repulsed by the luxurious churches surrounded by slums, but also fascinated with the morbid aspects of Bucharest society, from the "grave-blackened women" of [[Bellu cemetery]] to the pleasure-seekers on [[Calea Victoriei]]—as noted by Cristea-Enache, the latter is merely an anti-capitalist "cliché of that era".&lt;ref name="dc-evisuri"/&gt;

Political inspiration also fueled some of Baciu's other juvenile works, including poems attacking the Nazis and honoring the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]]—written with a Social Democratic bias but owing ultimate inspiration to [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], the Soviet poet laureate.&lt;ref name="popa92-93"/&gt; His more conventional humorous poetry, which came out around 1945, owed inspiration to the jocular verse of [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]] and [[George Topîrceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Popa, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the avant-garde with ''Muzica sferelor'', with its homages to unconventional heroes such as [[Urmuz]] and [[George Ciprian]],&lt;ref name="empoemele"/&gt; Baciu crafted his own poetic style. In large part, such lyrical work is explicitly self-referential, and inevitably linked to his diaspora experience. His nostalgia for Râmnicu Vâlcea and Brașov slowly replaced his memory of Bucharest. As noted by philologist Andrei Bodiu, he was not Brașov's first poetic chronicler, but the only such poet to be "urban and cosmopolitan" rather than elegiac and traditionalist.&lt;ref&gt;Bodiu, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Baciu wrote poems dedicated in part to each Latin American country he visited, and made unexpected connections between them and his native country.&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt; One such piece, honoring the [[Cuban dissident movement]], reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Scriu Cuba și gândesc la tine, Românie: 
cizme și tunuri și tancuri și-avioane
venind fără încetare din Răsărit
pun țării întregi un deget pe buze.
E ora acum când poporul tăcut se ridică
Noaptea în somn, rasuflă închisorile
și peste valurile mării care vin și se duc
se-aude un zgomot surd de lanțuri.
Ca păsări mari pe cerul antilian
Alunecă umbre nevazute de rachete.
Se-agită mâini ce scriu mesagii secrete.
Scriu Cuba și gândesc la tine, Românie.}}&lt;ref name="gccșunpoet"/&gt;
|
I write Cuba, but think of thee, Romania:
of the boots and cannons and tanks and planes
as they pour in, seemingly unending, from the East,
sealing with a finger the lips of a country.
Now is that hour when the silent folk arises
At sleep-time, at night, the prisons exhale
and over the waves of the sea, coming and going,
we catch a faint noise, that of rattling chains.
Like the great birds of the Antillean sky
The unseen shadows of missiles glide by.
Hands shuffle about to write secret postings.
I write Cuba, but think of thee, Romania.}}

Baciu's other poems include a set of [[pastiche]]s and [[parody]] pieces, from [[Emil Botta]], [[Lucian Blaga]], [[Ion Barbu]] and [[Ion Vinea]].&lt;ref name="fmînexil"/&gt; They stand alongside satirical pieces targeting poets who had made compromises with the political system. In one such work, Baciu scolds [[Tudor Arghezi]]: 
{{Verse translation|
