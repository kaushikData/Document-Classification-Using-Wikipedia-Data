'''Abacus Consulting Technology (Private) Limited''', (also known as '''Abacus''' or Abacus Consulting), is a global professional services company providing management [[Management consulting|consulting]], [[Information technology consulting|technology]] and [[outsourcing]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abacus Introduction |url=http://www.amos-global.com/who-we-are/abacus-history.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829164128/http://www.amos-global.com/who-we-are/abacus-history.asp |archivedate=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based out of [[Pakistan]], Abacus is the largest firm of its kind in the country, both in terms of revenue and staff numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts|url=http://www.abacus-global.com/people/whoweare}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest in South Asia.

Having an overall employee strength of over 2500, Abacus has 12 offices in the [http://nie.wikispaces.com/Middle+East,+North+Africa,+South+Asia+(MENASA) MENASA] region through which it serves clients in three continents and 22 countries.  Within Pakistan, Abacus serves 23 out of 35 [[Fortune 100]] companies operating in the country, with 150 to 300 clients entertained each year.  Abacus has over 400 specialist consultants, and 1200 completed projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experience|url=http://www.abacus-global.com/faqs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and name changes ==
Abacus was established in 1987&lt;ref name="Abacus Silver Jubilee"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abacus Silver Jubilee|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/02/27/epaper/profit-epaper/27th-february-2013/|accessdate=21 June 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the current President, Mr. Asad Ali Khan, primarily as a management consulting firm that offered mainly finance related services such as financial analysis, business advisory and economic feasibility studies for new and existing business set-ups and projects.
 
In 1991 Abacus was admitted as an associate member of Coopers &amp; Lybrand International network, changing name to Abacus Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and then Coopers &amp; Lybrand Consulting. in 1997, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse announced plans to merge, creating [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (PwC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C&amp;L and PW merge|url=http://money.cnn.com/1997/09/18/deals/waterhouse/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, the merger formalities were also initiated and completed by June 2000. Consequently, Abacus became the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and became known as PwC Consulting.

In October 2003, Abacus dissociated itself with PwC after some of history's biggest [[Enron scandal|accounting scandals]] that [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|redefined the global regulatory environment]] for consulting and audit firms, restoring its name to Abacus Consulting.

[[File:The Philadelphia City Hall.JPG|thumb|The Philadelphia City Hall in Center City]]

Center City is home to most of Philadelphia's tallest buildings, including [[Philadelphia City Hall|Philadelphia's City Hall]], the second tallest [[masonry]] building in the world and until 1987 the tallest in Philadelphia, as well as the tallest building in the world for seven years. In March 1987, [[One Liberty Place]] broke the [[gentlemen's agreement]] not to exceed the height of the statue of [[William Penn]] atop City Hall. Since the completion of One Liberty Place, no Philadelphia major-league sports team had won a world championship for the next two decades, a phenomenon known as the "[[Curse of Billy Penn]]."  In an effort to reverse the curse, a 3-foot statue of Penn was affixed to the top of the [[Comcast Center (Philadelphia)|Comcast Center]] upon its completion as the city's new tallest building in 2007. On October 29, 2008, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] won the [[2008 World Series]], effectively ending the "curse"

[[File:Philadelphia_Night_Skyline.jpg|thumb|Center City at night]]

Seven other skyscrapers now exceed the height of Penn's statue, including One Liberty Place's little sister, [[Two Liberty Place]]. The Comcast Center, which was completed in 2007, is now the [[List of tallest buildings in Pennsylvania|tallest building in Pennsylvania]], 30 feet taller than One Liberty Place. Two buildings now under construction —  1441 Chestnut and the [[Comcast Technology Center]] — are also slated to be taller than City Hall. The latter would be the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|eighth-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere]], and the tallest outside Manhattan and Chicago. The first publicly accessible vantage point higher than City Hall opened at [[One Liberty Observation Deck]] on the 57th floor of One Liberty Place in 2015.

Other Center City skyscrapers include the [[BNY Mellon Center (Philadelphia)|BNY Mellon Center]] and the [[Three Logan Square]], which houses a traffic camera used by the Philadelphia branch of the [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] MetroNetworks traffic service.

Across the street from City Hall is the [[Masonic Temple (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Masonic Temple]], the headquarters of the [[Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania]], a legacy of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] and signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], many of whom were [[freemasonry|Freemasons]]; such luminaries include [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

While Philadelphia's population declined, Center City's rose 10% between 1990 and 2000.

In 2007, the city designated the area bound by 11th Street, Broad Street, Chestnut Street and Pine Street as the [[Washington Square West, Philadelphia#The Gayborhood|Gayborhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430074123/http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20070419_New_signs_make_it_official__We_have_a_gayborhood.html|title=New signs make it official: We have a 'gayborhood' - Daily News - 04/19/2007|date=30 April 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarence Cary''' (March 18, 1845 – August 27, 1911)&lt;ref name="CCObit1911"/&gt; was an American lawyer and sportsman who was prominent in New York society during the [[Gilded Age]].

==Early life==
Clarence Cary was born in Fairfax County, Virginia on March 18, 1845,&lt;ref name="southland"&gt;"Mrs. Constance Cary Harrison," in {{cite book |last= Raymond |first= Ida |author2=Mary Tardy | title = Southland Writers: Biographical and Critical Sketches of the Living Female Writers of the South.

His parents were Archibald Cary and Monimia ([[née]] Fairfax) Cary.  His sister, the author [[Constance Cary Harrison|Constance Cary]], was married to [[Burton Harrison]], the former private secretary for Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]].  Through his sister, he was the uncle of [[Fairfax Harrison]], who was a President of the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway Company]], and [[Francis Burton Harrison]], who served as a [[Governor-General of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="southland"/&gt;  The family lived at [[Cumberland, Maryland]], where his father was editor of its leading newspaper, [[Media in Cumberland, Maryland|''The Cumberland Civilian'']]. 

His paternal grandparents were Wilson Jefferson Cary and [[Virginia Randolph Cary|Virginia (née Randolph) Cary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pecquet du Bellet  | first = Louise |author2=Edward Jaquelin |author3=Martha Cary Jaquelin  | title = Some Prominent Virginia Families, Vol. 2  | publisher = Bell | year = 1907 | page = 81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tyQSAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His maternal grandparents were [[Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (who never assumed the English title) and Margaret (née Herbert) Fairfax, herself the granddaughter of John Carlyle and Sarah Fairfax.  Cary was also the great-grandnephew of [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="Patterson2000"/&gt;  Among his large and prominent family members was uncle [[Gouverneur Morris]] of ''[[Morrisania]]'',&lt;ref name="famous"&gt;{{cite web| last =  | first =  | title = Miss Burton Harrison | work = Famous Women Authors  | publisher =  | year = 1901 | url = http://www.oldandsold.com/articles27n/women-authors-4.shtml  | doi = | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; who married Anne Cary Randolph.&lt;ref name="ProminentVirginia"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tyQSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA176 Louise Pecquet du Bellet, ''Some Prominent Virginia Families'', p. 81,2]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Archibald died in 1854, his mother moved the family to his grandmother's plantation, known as [[Vaucluse (plantation)|Vaucluse]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]].   Following the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pecquet du Bellet | first = Louise  | authorlink =  |author2=Edward Jaquelin |author3=Martha Cary Jaquelin   | title = Some Prominent Virginia Families, Vol. 2  | publisher = Bell | year = 1907 | location =  | page = 180  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tyQSAAAAYAAJ | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaucluse was seized and torn down to construct [[Fort Worth, Virginia|Fort Worth]] as a part of the [[Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War#Defending the capital|defenses]] of [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Career==
[[File:CSSPalmettoState.jpg|thumb|right|The {{Ship|CSS|Palmetto State||6}}, of which Cary served on during the U.S. Civil War.]]
During the War, Cary served as a midshipman in the [[Confederate States Navy]] and reportedly, "did some very clever acting during the war on the amateur stage and on the naval war boards. In his sailor role he served on the blockade runner, ''[[CSS Nashville (1864)|Nashville]]'', on the ''[[CSS Palmetto State|Palmetto State]]'' [[ironclad]], off the Carolina coast and on the [[James River Squadron|James River fleet]], proving himself a good officer."&lt;ref name="DeLeon1909"/&gt;

After the war, he studied law and practiced in New York, founding the successful firm of Cary &amp; Whitridge, where he was a trusted advisor to [[Varina Davis]], the widow of Jefferson Davis.&lt;ref name="CV1911"&gt;{{cite book |title=Confederate Veteran: Published Monthly in the Interest of Confederate Veterans and Kindred Topics |date=1911 |publisher=S.A.

Cary was a fan of Oriental culture and art, traveling for extended periods to the [[Far East]], setting up a committee with other businessmen known as the "Committee on American Interests in China." He was known for ridiculing [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Sherman]] by calling Sherman's reluctance to Chinese trade as "quaint and dangerous".&lt;ref name="Hamilton2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Richard F. |title=America's New Empire: The 1890s and Beyond |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781351532181 |page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ly0rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as the legal counsel for the [[American China Development Company]], and helped found the [[Asia (magazine)|American Asiatic Association]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="Jacobson2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jacobson |first1=Matthew Frye |title=Barbarian Virtues: The United States Encounters Foreign Peoples at Home and Abroad, 1876-1917 |date=2001 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780809016280 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUKuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8100">'''Customer delight''' is surprising a [[customer]] by exceeding his or her expectations and thus creating a positive emotional reaction. This emotional reaction leads to [[word of mouth]]. Customer delight directly affects [[sales]] and [[profitability]] of a company as it helps to distinguish the company and its products and services from the [[competition (economics)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Scott|title=Positively Outrageous Service. How to delight and astound your customers and win them for life|year=2004|publisher=Dear Born Trade Publishing|location=USA|isbn=978-0-7931-8823-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Rakesh Seth, Kirti|title=Creating customer delight : the how and why of CRM|year=2005|publisher=Response Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=9780761932963|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the past [[customer satisfaction]] has been seen as a [[key performance indicator]]. Customer satisfaction measures the extent to which the expectations of a customer are met (compared to expectations being exceeded). However, it has been discovered that mere customer satisfaction does not create [[brand loyalty]] nor does it encourage positive word of mouth.

Customer delight can be created by the product itself, by accompanied standard services and by interaction with people at the front line. The interaction is the greatest source of opportunities to create delight as it can be personalized and tailored to the specific needs and wishes of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlzon|first=Jan; [foreword by Tom Peters]|title=Moments of truth|year=1989|publisher=Perennial Library|location=New York|isbn=0060915803|page=2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During contacts with [[touch point]]s in the company, more than just [[customer service]] can be delivered. The person at the front line can surprise by showing a sincere personal interest in the customer, offer small attentions that might please or find a solution specific to particular needs. Those front-line employees are able to develop a relationship between the customer and the brand. Elements in creating [[work motivation|motivated]] staff are: recruiting the right people, motivating them continuously and leading them in a clear way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsieh|first=Tony|title=Delivering happiness : a path to profits, passion, and purpose|year=2010|publisher=Business Plus|location=New York|isbn=9780446563048|pages=144, 145|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelli|first=Joseph|title=The Zappos experience : 5 principles to inspire, engage, and wow|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071749589|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of customer delight==
There are three objectives when implementing Customer Delight:
# make [[customer loyalty|customers loyal]].

# have customers that are more profitable. Average delighted customers spend more with less hassle.

Customer Delight is the only kind of growth that can be sustained over the long term according to Reichheld and Markey. The authors mention that their company [[Bain &amp; Company]] have researched and concluded that a 5% increase in [[customer retention]] could yield anywhere between 25% to 100% increase in profits. The book explains the [[net promoter score|Net Promoter Score]]; a system which measures what customers are feeling and thus creating accountability for the customer experience.

In order to consistently deliver Customer Delight at all customer touch points throughout the company, a [[customer-centric]] [[corporate culture]] is key. With this corporate culture all processes, systems, people and leadership are aligned: everyone in the organization shares the same set of values, attitudes and practices. Developing the culture is a continuous exercise of innovation and improvement, involving every employee of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|title=The Apple experience : the secrets of delivering insanely great customer service|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071793209|page=25|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Kaufman {{cite book |title=Uplifting service : the proven path to delighting your customers, colleagues, and everyone else you meet|year=2012|publisher=Evolve Publishing|location=[New York, NY]|isbn=978-0984762507|pages=22, 23, 24, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; An absolutely necessary step is linking Customer Delight behaviour to the core values of the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelli|first=Joseph|title=The Zappos experience : 5 principles to inspire, engage, and wow|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071749589|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core values are operating principles that guide an organization’s internal conduct as well as its relationship with customers, partners and shareholders. Once core values are clearly outlined it is critical to incorporate them into every process, from [[Recruitment|hiring]], to [[employee appraisal]]s and [[decision making]].

He had worked as one-time company director of operations and as an accountant for Madoff since the 1960s. He was arrested on February 25, 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/02/daniel_bonventre_former_bernar.html Daniel Bonventre, former Bernard Madoff executive, is arrested | syracuse.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and charged with allegedly having created false and [[fraud]]ulent books and records, conspiracy, [[securities fraud]], and tax-related charges. He is also being sued by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] for falsifying records.

Prosecutors claim that Bonventre used $154 million of clients' funds to help obtain a $145 million loan. He has also been charged with concealing over $270,000 in income tax between 2003 and 2007.

Another criminal complaint alleges that he helped to arrange millions in illegal payments and loans to Madoff family members and unidentified employees, some of which were used to purchase luxury homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/25/daniel-bonventre-arrested_n_476322.html Daniel Bonventre ARRESTED: Former Madoff Operations Executive To Face Criminal Charges&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, almost three years before other investors lost their life savings, Bonventre emptied his personal accounts at the firm.

On March 24, 2014, he was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/jury-finds-madoff-guilty-counts-article-1.1732198&lt;/ref&gt; He may be sentenced to a maximum of 77 years in prison if convicted.

On December 21, 2010, prosecutors sent a letter to Bonventre's defense lawyer, Andrew J. Frisch, demanding that none of the $820,000 given to him to defend the case be used. The reason for this is because the funds would be subject to forfeiture if Bonventre is convicted of criminal charges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In January 2011, Bonventre filed a suit demanding that the indictment against him be dismissed because the prosecutor had made efforts to seize his defense funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-04/news/27086264_1_bernie-madoff-assets-ponzi Madoff aides Annette Bongiorno and Daniel Bonventre sue government for seizing assets - New York Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/04/bernard-madoff-aides-bonventre-bongiorno Bernard Madoff aides demand to be released from jail | Business | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-03/ex-madoff-aide-bonventre-seeks-dismissal-of-charges-cites-asset-seizure.html Ex-Madoff Aide Bonventre Seeks Dismissal of Charges, Cites Asset Seizure - Bloomberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Cameron MBE''' BSc MA MIEE D.Eng  [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society|FRSGS]] (born 1939) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[hot air balloon|balloonist]], and later founder of [[Cameron Balloons]], the world's largest hot air balloon manufacturer.

==Early life and career==

Born in [[Glasgow]] in 1939, Cameron went to [[Allan Glen's School]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cameronballoons.co.uk/faq/historyofcameronballoons&lt;/ref&gt; and then went on to study [[aeronautical engineering]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], graduating in 1961. In 1963 he obtained a master's degree at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[United States]]. He then joined the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. Cameron developed Britain's first modern [[hot air balloon]] entitled ''[[Bristol Belle]]'' which flew for the first time at [[Weston on the Green]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]] on 9 July 1967. In 1968 Cameron and Leslie Goldsmith founded Omega Balloons which constructed ten balloons, before the company split into [[Cameron Balloons]] and Western Balloons in 1970.

[[Cameron Balloons]] of [[Bristol]], England, was formed by Cameron in 1971 - five years after he constructed his first balloon. The new company was based in [[Cotham, Bristol]] where a total of twenty nine balloons were made in the basement of the property. 1971 also saw Cameron build ''Golden Eagle'', a balloon designed specifically to fly across the [[Sahara]] to shoot a film for [[Jack Le Vien]].

In 1978 his attempt to make the premier [[Atlantic]] crossing by balloon ended when bad weather forced his heated [[helium]] balloon ''Zanussi'' down after a 2,000 mile flight from Canada. It was piloted by Cameron and Christopher Davey. They left [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] on 26 July 1978, covered 1,780 miles, and ditched on 30 July 1978 in the [[Bay of Biscay]] only 110 miles from [[France]] after a tear developed in the balloon. The two planned a second attempt, but discarded their plans when the ''[[Double Eagle II]]'' successfully made a [[transatlantic flight]] three weeks later. Cameron and Davey were awarded the Gold Medal of the [http://royalaeroclub.co.uk/medals-and-awards.php?title=&amp;id=54 Royal Aero Club] in the same year.
 
Never averse to technical challenges, Cameron went on to write computer programmes to design specially shaped balloons.

Cameron has received the gold, silver and bronze medals of the British [[Royal Aero Club]] for his ballooning achievements which include being the first man to cross the [[Sahara]] and the [[Alps]] by hot-air balloon, and making the first flight between the UK and the former USSR in 1990.

His dream came true in 1992 when he flew a balloon of his own design from [[Bangor, Maine]], [[United States|U.S.]] to [[Portugal]] and took second place in the first ever [[transatlantic balloon race]].

In 1999, [[Breitling Orbiter]] 3, built by [[Cameron Balloons]], made the first non-stop flight round the world.

Don Cameron is one of the few [[aeronauts]] to be awarded the [[Harmon Trophy]], as the 'World's Outstanding Aviator' in 1999

'''Doron Richard Jensen''' (born September 1, 1958) is an American restaurateur and principle founder of [[Timber Lodge Steakhouse]], Homestyle Buffet, and [[Old Country Buffet]].

==Early life==
Doron Richard Jensen was born in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], to pastors [[Richard A. Jensen|Richard]] and [[Bonnie L. Jensen|Bonnie Jensen]]. Jensen spent much of his formative youth in [[Addis Abba, Ethiopia]] before returning to the United States in 1965. He dropped out of a secondary school at the age of 16. Influenced by his grandfather's cafe, Jensen's Cafe, Jensen entered the restaurant business as a busboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Alan |title=Access to Democracy featuring Doron Jensen of Jensen's restaurants |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubB1sq8m-Aw |website=accesstodemocracy.com/ |publisher=Access to Democracy |accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen's parents were supportive of his endeavors from an early age. Jensen started his buffet career working as a manager at [[Sirloin Stockade]] and [[Ponderosa Steakhouse|Ponderosa and Bonaza Steakhouse]] in Iowa in the 1970s. After the death of his grandfather, 20-year-old Doron felt ready to take over his grandfather's cafe in [[Fremont, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Alan|title=Access to Democracy: Doron Jensen &amp; Paul Richards|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJpEGQQ620A|website=youtube.com|publisher=Access to Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents helped arrange the takeover of the restaurant, but was blocked by other relatives that thought he was too young for the responsibility.  Jensen briefly attended the [[University of Minnesota]].

}}
Jensen was brought into [[Old Country Buffet]] by Roe Hatlen and C. Dennis Scott in 1983. Jensen opened the first restaurant in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] in 1983. In 1984, Jensen starting opening more locations in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area, eventually expanding its reach outside of Minnesota. Jensen began opening its restaurants along the eastern seaboard, but disagreements began among company leadership whether to expand into the American South. Disagreements within the company continued regarding southern United States expansion, and eventually led to Jensen and major investor and construction magnate Dermot Rowland to leave the company to start their own buffet chain, Homestyle Buffet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Patrick |title=Builder Dermot Rowland had appetite for restaurants business |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/167262415.html |website=startribune.com |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Jensen's departure, ''[[Forbes]]'' recognized Old Country Buffett as one of the ''200 best small companies in the United States'' before becoming the largest buffet chain in the world posting revenues of $808.5 million and $868.9 million by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meeks|first1=Fleming|title=If at First You Don’t Succeed|journal=Forbes|date=November 9, 1992|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen cited his "youth and entrepreneurial spirit" as reasons why he left the company so early in its development.

==Homestyle Buffet (1986-1990)==
Jensen left Old Country Buffett to lead what would become Homestyle Buffet. At just the age of 28, Jensen opened Homestyle Buffets Inc. and incorporated them in [[Clearwater, Florida]] in 1986. He took the company public on December 1, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamm |first1=Dave |title=Florida firms hold their own |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19910727&amp;id=xgJFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6572,5456544 |website=ocala.com |publisher=Ocala Star Banner |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen expanded the reach of the company outside of Florida and across the eastern seaboard and eventually into New England. However, Jensen left the company after just 40 restaurants to return to the Midwest to pursue other ventures.

==Timberlodge Steakhouse (1991-1995)==
While in Florida, Jensen was influenced by the developing steakhouse concept that would eventually become [[Outback Steakhouse]]. Jensen decided to return to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], where he founded the company Q-Steaks Inc as the umbrella company for [[Timber Lodge Steakhouse|Minnesota Steakhouse]] in January 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n19_v29/ai_16910313/&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Jensen took his company public. Timber Lodge Steakhouse went public on January 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/timber-lodge-steakhouse-inc&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen changed the name to [[Timber Lodge Steakhouse]] in 1994 when the company's reach expanded outside of Minnesota, with the exception of Paul Bunyan's in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Phelps |first1=David |title=Timber Lodge Steakhouse finally doing better with name change |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62638657.html |website=www.startribune.com |publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he resigned as President of the company, again leaving a company that he had founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Q-Steaks announces management changes, as founder leaves company |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Q-STEAKS,+INC.+ANNOUNCES+MANAGEMENT+CHANGES-a016954378 |website=prnewsonline.com/ |publisher=PR News Online |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Jensen along with Outback Steakhouse founder, [[Chris T. Sullivan]], would be attributed with rebooting the [[steakhouse|American steakhouse]] concept.

==Later career==
[[File:Jensen_circa_1996.jpg|thumb|right|Jensen circa 1996 in [[Eagan, Minnesota]]. In the late 1990s, Jensen's career shifted towards a more signature style of restaurants.]]
Since Timber Lodge Steakhouse, Jensen has primarily focused on signature restaurants over large-scale restaurant chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gessner|first1=John|title=Jensen's to open Cafe Bar|url=http://sunthisweek.com/2017/08/03/jensens-to-open-cafe-bar-in-heart-of-the-city/|website=sunthisweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jensen developed the signature restaurant Q-Cumbers in [[Edina, Minnesota]] and later developed his own personal brand of self-titled restaurants Jensen's Cafe, Jensen's Supper Club, and Jensen's food &amp; cocktails. Jensen's Cafe is named in honor of his grandfather's original Jensen's Cafe in Fremont, Nebraska.

Jensen's concepts and designs have been cited as influence for other restaurant brands such as Minervas food &amp; cocktails and Hazelwood food &amp; drinks.

Jensen was elected as the President of the [[interest group]] the [[National Restaurant Association|Minnesota Restaurant Association]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitymn.org/displaycommon.cfm?an%3D1%26subarticlenbr%3D6 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726154636/http://www.hospitalitymn.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=6 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jensen's career has also included lobbyist efforts representing the [[National Restaurant Association]] in [[Washington, DC]]. He has also served on various commerce boards in Minnesota.

==Personal life==

The '''European Practice Assessment''' is a pan-European development for [[quality management]] in primary health care. The scaffolding is a set of indicators, that EPA instrument enables
[[General practice|general practitioners]] to compare and to improve the organisation and management of their practices. It is based on an extended review of the international
literature on assessment models for [[primary care]], with special attention
to the Dutch model of practice visits.

== Aims ==
EPA's key aspects of activity are the development and validation of a set of indicators and tools describing the organisational aspects of  primary care practices. It was initiated in [http://www.equip.ch/ EQuiP], and the first set of indicators was developed through an international study by the EQuiP countries (2001–2004). Since 2005 it will be evaluated every three years.
The intention of the EPA instrument as a [[Quality Management System|quality management system]] is to allow management and organization of medical practices to be measured and evaluated at regional, national and nternational levels with an educational approach.

== History ==
Based on the TOPAS research project, the continuous development of EPA instruments started 2001. In autumn 2003 EPA as an instrument came into operation in nine countries.

Within a framework of an [http://fampra.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/137.abstract|international project] the idea of an indicator-based instrument proved to give internationally valid, reliable and feasible
results for quality improvement in [[primary health care]].  
The following nine countries took part in the study and the further development:  Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Slovenia, Austria and Israel.

== Practice ==
encouraged several organisations to establish the European Practice Assessment model as an offer for high quality practice management on a national base. From six European countries leading institutes with experience in research in quality of primary health care and practice visits  collaborate in the European Practice Assessment project:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16494">'''Evidence-based management''' (EBMgt) is an emerging movement to explicitly use the current, best evidence in [[management]] and [[decision-making]]. Its roots are in [[empiricism]] as seen in [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based-practice]], aiming to apply ''[[scientific method]]'' to evaluating practice.

== Overview ==
Evidence-based management entails managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the ''best available'' evidence.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer_2006" /&gt; As with other evidence-based practice, this is based on the three principles of: 1) published peer-reviewed (often in management or social science journals) research evidence that bears on whether and why a particular management practice works; 2) judgement and experience from contextual management practice, to understand the organization and interpersonal dynamics in a situation and determine the risks and benefits of available actions; and 3) the preferences and values of those affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spring B | title = Evidence-based practice in clinical psychology: what it is, why it matters; what you need to know | language = en | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 7 | pages = 611–31 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17551934 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lilienfeld SO, Ritschel LA, Lynn SJ, Cautin RL, Latzman RD | title = Why many clinical psychologists are resistant to evidence-based practice: root causes and constructive remedies | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 883–900 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23647856 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2012.09.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While, like its counterparts in medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evidence-Based-Medicine-Practice-Teach-CD-ROM/dp/0443062404 | title = Evidence-Based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM | vauthors = Sackett DL, Straus SE, Richardson WS, Rosenberg W, Haynes RB | date = 2000-01-18 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | isbn = 978-0-443-06240-7 | edition = second | location = Edinburgh }}&lt;/ref&gt; and education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.amazon.co.uk/Evidence-based-Practice-Education-Conducting-Educational/dp/0335213340 | title = Evidence-based Practice in Education | vauthors = Thomas G, Pring B | date=2004-07-04|publisher=Open University Press | isbn = 978-0-335-21334-4 | location = Maidenhead }}&lt;/ref&gt; EBMgt considers the circumstances and ethical concerns managerial decisions involve, it tends not to make extensive use of behavioral science relevant to effective management practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walshe K, Rundall TG | title = Evidence-based management: from theory to practice in health care | journal = The Milbank Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 429–57, IV-V | date = 2001 | pmid = 11565163 | pmc = 2751196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rousseau_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidence-Based Management in Health Care | vauthors= Rousseau DM | author-link = Denise Rousseau | work = Change and Quality in Human Service Work | publisher = Hampp | year = 2005 | veditors = Korunka C, Hoffmann P | location = Munich | pages = 33-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rousseau_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rousseau DM | author-link = Denise Rousseau |date=2006|title=Keeping an open mind about evidence-based management | journal=Academy of Management Review | volume=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://hbr.org/2006/01/evidence-based-management | title = Evidence-Based Management | date = January 2006 | work = Harvard Business Review | access-date = 2018-01-05 | vauthors = Pfeffer J, Sutton RI | author-link1 = Jeffrey Pfeffer | author-link2 = Robert I. Sutton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
An important part of EBMgt is educating current and future managers in evidence-based practices. The EBMgt website maintained at Stanford University provides a repository of syllabi, cases, and tools that can inform the teaching of evidence-based management.

Efforts to promote EBMgt face greater challenges than have other evidence-based initiatives.  In medicine there is more consensus as to what constitutes best evidence than in the social sciences more generally, and management in particular. Unlike medicine, nursing, education, and law enforcement, "Management" is not a [[profession]]. There are no established legal or cultural requirements regarding education or knowledge for an individual to become a manager. Managers have diverse disciplinary backgrounds.  A college degree may be required for an MBA – but not to be a manager. No formal body of shared knowledge characterizes managers, making it unlikely that peer pressure will be exerted to promote use of evidence by any manager who refuses to do so. Little shared language or terminology exists, making it difficult for managers to hold discussions of evidence or evidence-based practices.&lt;ref name="Rousseau_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rousseau_2006" /&gt; For this reason, the adoption of evidence-based practices is likely to be organization-specific, where leaders take the initiative to build an evidence-based culture.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer_2006"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.amazon.com/Facts-Dangerous-Half-Truths-Total-Nonsense/dp/1591398622 | title = Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths And Total Nonsense: Profiting From Evidence-Based Management | vauthors = Pfeffer J, Sutton RI | date = March 2006 | publisher = Harvard Business Review Press | isbn = 978-1-59139-862-2 | edition = first | location = Boston, Mass | author-link1 = Jeffrey Pfeffer | author-link2 = Robert I. Sutton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices an evidence-based organizational culture employs include systematic accumulation and analysis of data gathered on the organization and its functioning, problem-based reading and discussion of research summaries by managers and staff, and the making of organizational decisions informed by both best available research and organizational information. Organizations successfully pursuing evidence-based management typically go through cycles of experimentation and redesign of their practices to create an evidence-based culture consistent with their values and mission.

Although some advocates of EBMgt argue that it is more likely to be adopted in knowledge-intensive organizations, recent research at the [[University of Oxford]] into six leading organizations in the healthcare industry found that managers and clinical leaders used a variety of forms of knowledge, drawing on academic research, experiential knowledge and respected colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dopson S, Fitzgerald L, Ferlie E, Fischer M, Ledger J, McCulloch J, McGivern G | date = May 2013 | title = Health care managers access  and use of management research|url=https://www.academia.edu/3591512/Health_care_managers_access_and_use_of_management_research|journal=National Institute for Health Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that skilful 'knowledge leadership' is crucial in translating EBMgt and other academic research into practice in ways that are relevant and can be mobilized in specific organizational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 =  Michael D.| last1 = Fischer | last2 = Sue | first2 = Dopson | last3 = Louise | first3 = Fitzgerald | last4 = Chris | first4 =Bennett | last5 = Ewan | first5 = Ferlie | last6 = Jean | first6 =Ledger | last7 = Gerry | first7 = McGivern | name-list-format = vanc | title = Knowledge Leadership: Mobilising Management Research by Becoming the Knowledge Object | url = https://www.academia.edu/17556851/Knowledge_leadership_Mobilising_management_research_by_becoming_the_knowledge_object.html | journal = SSRN Electronic Journal | issn = 1556-5068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations adopting [[Agile software development|agile approaches]] in their [[New product development|product development]], often find they need to make changes in other areas to reap the full benefits of the changes (the growing field of [[business agility]] and [[Business transformation|agile transformation]]). Evidence-based management provides a more structured approach to working through such change in short-cycles; to focus investments in areas that will bring the greatest value soonest; and to provide a framework for evaluating their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=d7HLDgAAQBAJ | title = Coordination in Large-Scale Agile Software Development: Integrating Conditions and Configurations in Multiteam Systems | last = Scheerer | first = Alexander | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Springer | year = 2017 | isbn = 978-3-319-55327-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[evidence-based policy]] and practice within [[international development]] is similarly being emphasized regarding the management of development projects and activities. For instance, in a literature review focused on development, an integrated, participatory, structured and empowering approach to using evidence and data in decision-making to inform development decisions was tied to improved results. &lt;ref&gt;[https://usaidlearninglab.org//lab-notes/cracking-evidence-conundrum-four-ideas-get-people-use-evidence "Cracking the Evidence Conundrum: Four Ideas to Get People to Use Evidence"] (18 December 2017). USAID Learning Lab. Retrieved 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Alternatives and objections  ==
The weak form alternatives to evidence-based anything include [[hearsay]], [[opinion]], [[rhetoric]], [[discourse]], [[advice (opinion)]], [[self deception]], [[bias]], [[belief]], [[fallacy]], or [[advocacy]]. The stronger forms include concerns about what counts as [[evidence]], types of evidence, what evidence is available, sought or possible, who decides and pays for what evidence to be collected, and that evidence needs to be interpreted. Also there are the limitations to [[empiricism]] as well argued in the historical debate between empiricism and [[rationalism]] which is usually assumed to be resolved by [[Immanuel Kant]] by saying the two are inextricably interwoven. We reason what evidence is fair and what the evidence means ([[Critique of Practical Reason]]).[[Critical theorists]] have raised objections to the claims made by those promoting evidence-based management.&lt;ref name = "Learmonth_ Harding_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Learmonth | first1 = Mark | last2 = Harding | first2 = Nancy | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evidence-based management: the very idea | journal = Public Administration | date = June 2006 | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–266 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00001.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Learmonth_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Learmonth | first1 = Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title = Speaking Out: Evidence-Based Management: A Backlash Against Pluralism in Organizational Studies? | journal = Organization | date = March 2008 | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 283–291 | doi = 10.1177/1350508407087763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Morrell_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrell | first1 = Kevin | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Narrative of ‘Evidence Based’ Management: A Polemic|journal=Journal of Management Studies | date = May 2008 | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 613–635 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2007.00755.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Morrell_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morrell | first1 = Kevin | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evidence-based dialectics | journal = Organization | date = 7 July 2011 | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–479 |doi = 10.1177/1350508411414229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, EBMgt has been criticised for treating "evidence" and "scientific method" as if they were neutral, value-free descriptions.&lt;ref name = "Morrell_2008" /&gt;  From this perspective, what counts as "evidence" is considered as intrinsically problematic and contested because there are different ways of looking at social problems.&lt;ref name = "Learmonth_2008" /&gt; Furthermore, in line with perspectives from [[critical management studies]],  "management" is not necessarily an automatic good thing—it often involves the exercise of power and the exploitation of others.  Efforts have been made, however, to include a balanced treatment of such issues in reviewing and interpreting the research literature for practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Rousseau DM, Manning J, Denyer D | author-link1 = Denise Rousseau | title = Evidence in Management and Organizational Science: Assembling the field’s full weight of scientific knowledge through reflective reviews | url = https://tepper.cmu.edu/-/media/ea2a2987566d4b50af40a6910be6a235.ashx }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticisms persist, and critical theorists say fundamental problems with evidence-based management have been ignored.&lt;ref name = "Morrell_2011" /&gt;

One potential alternative to the evidence-based approach is use of [[dialectic]], [[argument]], or public debate (argument is not to be confused with advocacy or quarreling). [[Aristotle]] in works like Rhetoric, reasons that the way to test knowledge claims was to set up an inquiry method where a sceptical audience was encouraged to question evidence and its assumptions.  To win an argument, convincing evidence is required. Calls for argumentative inquiry, or the argumentative turn may be fairer, safer and more creative than calls for evidence-based approaches.&lt;ref name = "Bailin_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailin | first1 = Sharon | name-list-format = vanc | title = Is Argument for Conservatives? or Where Do Sparkling New Ideas Come From? | journal = Informal Logic | date = 1 January 2004 | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.22329/il.v23i1.2151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fischer_Forester_1993"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Frank | last2 = Forester | first2 = John | author-link2 = John F.

'''Fixed position assembly''' refers to an assembly system or situation in which the product does not move while being assembled, this configuration is usually contrasted in [[operations management]] and [[industrial engineering]] with [[assembly lines]]. Dimensioning this system is very simple: considering CP as [[productive capacity]] and T as average assembly time, then N, number of working stations, is given by N=CP*T.

[[Image:Assembly of Ottoman airplane.jpg|thumb|right|Ottoman [[airplane]] being assembled during WWI. Even thought airplane assembly is often cited as an example of fixed position system, today many airplanes go through assembly lines.]]

==Advantages==

*high system flexibility: both in introducing new products and attaining product customization
*high variability in operations naturally lends itself to introducing [[job enlargement]] (to the benefit of the worker)
*low investment: only "capital" needed are generic worker tools.

==Disadvantages==

*High work in progress
*Significant space occupancy
*Higher labor costs: workers need to know how to perform all operations of the technological cycle and therefore skilled labor needs to be employed (this is in sharp contrast to the [[assembly line]] in which a worker needs almost no training thanks to [[division of labour]] being carried to its extreme.

A mold is a hollow shape which exactly encloses the shape of a desired object. The object is usually created by pouring a liquid into the mold and allowing it to solidify: typical liquids include molten metal or plastic, [[plaster of Paris]], epoxy resin.

Molds generally divide into two classes: solid or flexible.

There are five different types of flexible mold compounds in significant use today.

==Hot-Melt==
[[polyvinyl chloride]]

* inexpensive, worn molds can be melted and recast.
* hazardous to handle due to high temperatures required for melting.
* use limited to model and pattern materials that are heat resistant.

==Latex==
* produces a very elastic, thin-walled, strong mold
* shrinkage is high
* molds must be supported to prevent distortion.
* 10 to 20 brush coats must be applied for adequate thickness, with time allowed to "dry" in between each coat, making the mold is slow and time consuming.

==Silicone rubbers==
* excellent molds for casting resins and foams
* material cost is extremely high.

==Polysulfide rubbers==
* versatile and are especially useful for casting plaster, Hydrocal, and other water mixed cements.
* can be used for casting wax candles and some limited use for [[resin casting]].
* easy to handle, non-adhesive and can be poured over clay or practically any type of model or pattern, using very simple release agents such as soap or [[Vaseline]].
* can be used to take impressions directly from a waterclay or plastelene model, so that permanent master models can then be cast in plaster or Hydrocal.

==Polyurethane flexible mold compounds==
* limited shelf stability
* "moisture conscious"
* easy to handle with simple mixing ratios and good fluidity.
* can be used for pouring practically any type of cementitious material, casting resin or foam formulation.
* Cost of material is far below that of the silicones and appreciably lower than polysulfides.

From the standpoint of general utility and economy, the polyurethanes surpass all other types{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.

==Equipment and accessories==
Mixing containers and stirring paddles should be of metal or plastic and always spotlessly clean, warm and dry. Use 1-inch fiber brushes cut down to 1-inch length for application of wax release agent. A regular short fiber scrubbing brush should be used for buffing wax from deep grain or fine design of model or pattern.

Sulphur Free Plastalina Clay (The Compleat Sculptor, New York City) is excellent for modeling, laying up and sealing models and dams. 1/4"-3/8" plywood should be used for mounting models. Scrap pieces can be sawed to rectangular shapes and used for straight side retaining dams.

Lightweight sheet metal, linoleum and heavy cardboard can be used for circular or irregular shaped retaining walls. Sash cord and masking tape are used to bind the walls to the model baseboard. 1/2" X 2" furring and "2 x 4's" cut to short lengths make good wedges. For plaster casting, use regular Molding or Casting Plaster

'''George Benson Hall Jr.''' (1810 &amp;ndash; September 4, 1876) was a businessman involved in the [[Quebec]] lumber business. On his death, the Quebec ''Morning Chronicle'' described him as "one of Quebec’s most prominent and enterprising citizens".

He was born in [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]], [[Upper Canada]], the son of [[George Benson Hall]] and Angelica Fortier. In 1843, he married Mary Jane Patterson, the daughter of [[Peter Patterson (businessman)|Peter Patterson]]. On the death of his father-in-law, he became [[seigneurial system of New France|seigneur]] for Beauport, the last person to hold that title.&lt;ref name="toponym"&gt;[http://www4.ville.quebec.qc.ca/toponymie_repertoire/rues/benson_hall.shtml Répertoire des toponymes, Ville de Québec] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; Hall established a milling complex at the [[Montmorency Falls]] in 1851, which eventually grew to employ members of 800 families at [[Beauport, Quebec|Beauport]]. He served as an alderman for [[Quebec City]] from 1853 to 1862. Hall died at Montmorency, at the time one of the richest lumber operators in Canada. He was also known for his generosity to the under-privileged of his community.&lt;ref name="toponym"/&gt;

In ''The storied province of Quebec'', the Hall [[sawmill]]s at Montmorency are described as "the greatest in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Hildreth Cemetery''' is a small cemetery located on Hildreth Street at Sutherland and By Streets in the Centralville neighborhood of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. The cemetery's history dates back to the mid-18th century, when it was designated as a burial ground by Major Ephraim Hildreth before his death in 1740. Though located within the Lowell city limits, it is actually administered by the nearby town of [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]] because the cemetery was built when Centralville was still a part of Dracut.

In 1913, the City of Lowell attempted to sell the cemetery after the Town of Dracut neglected to pay a tax on a new sidewalk on Hildreth Street; this would have resulted in the forced relocation of many of the remains at the cemetery.   After an injunction in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]] court to prevent the sale, the town continues to maintain the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primaryresearch.org/dracut/hildreth.php Hildreth Cemetery Controversy of 1913]&lt;/ref&gt;  The nearby private cemetery containing the graves of General [[Benjamin Butler]] and his wife, [[Sarah Hildreth Butler|Sarah Hildreth]], was not affected.

==Vandalism, October 2009==
[[Image:Vandalism at Hildreth Cemetery Oct 4 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Vandalism|Vandalized]] [[headstone]]s at Hildreth Cemetery, October 2009]]

On October 3, 2009, a teenager from Centralville became angry over a "personal matter" and damaged over 150 headstones in Hildreth Cemetery, many of them around two centuries old. 90 of them were damaged beyond repair due to age or the materials they were made from (some older ones carved in slate, others in marble). The cost of the damage was estimated to be around $10,000. The Hildreth Family Cemetery, gated and locked all year, was untouched. The perpetrator turned himself in two weeks later upon seeing pictures of the destroyed headstones in the ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|Lowell Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/10/vandals_desecra.html Vandals desecrate historic Lowell cemetery - Local News Updates - The Boston Globe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowellsun.com/ci_13584236 Lowell teen ID'd in cemetery vandalism - Lowell Sun Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the town of Dracut authorized the allocation of $30,000 towards the repair of Hildreth Cemetery, so that the work would begin before the winter. In October, work began on the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dracutforum.net/2010/06/11/money-to-repair-to-hildreth-cemetery-authorized/ Money to Repair to Hildreth Cemetery authorized | Dracut Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; Several stones were repaired on site, as they were merely knocked over or were easily repaired, but those damaged beyond repair were flagged for replacement by Hudson Monuments in [[Hudson, New Hampshire]]. Much of the work was completed by March 2011.

==Hildreth Family Cemetery==
The Hildreth family's private cemetery is set behind the public cemetery and entered via two locked gates accessible only from Hildreth Street. The cemetery is closed all year, with the exception of the annual commemoration of General Butler's birthday and the replacement of the flag, held the first Sunday in November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1234912 Lowell, MA event Nov 1st - Find A Grave Forums]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several generations of the Hildreth family are buried in the cemetery. The more well-known members include:
* [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]] (1818–1893): A controversial Union general during the [[American Civil War]] and later a Congressman and [[Governor of Massachusetts]]. He married [[Sarah Hildreth Butler|Sarah Hildreth]] (1816–1876) in 1844.
* [[Adelbert Ames]] (1835–1933): A highly decorated Union general during the Civil War, who served as a U.S. Senator and [[Governor of Mississippi]] during Reconstruction. He married Butler's daughter [[Blanche Butler Ames|Blanche]] (1847–1939) in 1870, while serving in the Senate. (Ames' date of birth is erroneously listed on the monument as October 30 while all known records, as well as the Medal of Honor plaque at the base of the monument, list his birthday as October 31.)
* Charlotte Ellison Butler (1782–1870): Benjamin Butler's mother.
* Andrew Jackson Butler (1815–1864): Benjamin Butler's elder brother, a colonel in the United States Army who accompanied him to New Orleans and died of fever in February 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403E3DB1739E43BBC4953DFB066838F679FDE LAW REPORTS.; The Will of Col. A. J. Butler. Surrogate's Court--May 31... - Article Preview - New York Times] (dated June 1, 1864)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. Israel Hildreth (1791–1859): Noted physician of the [[Greater Lowell]] area, and father of Sarah Hildreth Butler.
* Benjamin and Sarah Hildreth Butler's other three children, all sons:
** The first Paul Butler (1845–1850)
** The second Paul Butler (1852–1918): Inventor and businessman.
** Ben-Israel Butler (1855–1881): West Point graduate (1877) and lawyer who died before he was able to practice.
* Five of Adelbert and Blanche Butler Ames' children:
** [[Butler Ames]] (1871–1954): West Point graduate (1894) and Colonel in the U.S. Army during the [[Spanish–American War]] and Congressman from Massachusetts. His wife Fifille Willis Ames (1886–1940) is buried alongside him.
** Edith Ames Stevens (1873–1958) and her husband C. Brooks Stevens (1864–1949)
** Sarah Ames (1874–1931)
** [[Blanche Ames Ames]] (1878–1969): Artist and suffragist, who wrote the first full-length biography on her father in response to the biased interpretation of his administration of Mississippi in [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ''[[Profiles in Courage]]''.
** Jessie Ames Marshall (1882–1967)

Ames' youngest son, [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.]], has his name inscribed on the monument; however, he is actually buried at the cemetery on the grounds of [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6724367 Adelbert Ames Jr. (1880 - 1955) - Find A Grave Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hospital Corporation of America''' (HCA) is an American for-profit operator of [[health care]] facilities that was founded in 1968. It is based in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] and manages 178 hospitals and approximately 1,800 sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics in the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="hcahealthcare1"&gt;[http://hcahealthcare.com/util/documents/HCA-presskit-fact-sheet.pdf HCA Fact Sheet 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905113901/http://www.hcahealthcare.com/util/documents/HCA-presskit-fact-sheet.pdf |date=September 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HCA went public on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) in 1969 followed by a substantial growth period for the next two decades. The company was ranked No. 63 in the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, lawsuits were filed against HCA by former employees who drew attention to the company's questionable billing practices to Medicare for hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=Appleby/&gt; Some of the allegations included charging the government costs for running its hospitals, paying kickbacks to physicians for referrals, and unlawfully charging for costs involving wound care facilities. A federal probe ensued, spanning nearly a decade, and culminated in 2003 with "the government receiving a total of over $2 billion in criminal fines and civil penalties for systematically defrauding federal health care programs."&lt;ref name=DOJ/&gt; The federal probe has been referred to as the longest and costliest investigation for health-care fraud in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The first hospital that HCA owned was Park View Hospital, near downtown Nashville.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/08/business/dr-thomas-frist-sr-hca-founder-dies-at-87.html Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., HCA Founder, Dies at 87], ''New York Times'', January 8, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The small group of founders worked out of a small house not far from Park View for the first few years of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=323313151061279&amp;set=s.392040160808021&amp;type=1&amp;theater|title=HCA Healthcare|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, HCA conducted its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt; As HCA grew, the small house that served as office space was no longer large enough, and in 1972, they built new offices behind Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=323315557727705&amp;set=s.269083759840622&amp;type=1&amp;theater|title=HCA Healthcare|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and merger===
During the 1970s and 1980s the corporation went through a tremendous growth period acquiring hundreds of hospitals across the US, 255 owned by HCA, and another 208 managed by HCA.

In 1988, the hospital operator was acquired for $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion in a [[management buyout]] led by chairman [[Thomas F. Frist, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Freudenheim, Milt. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D81039F931A15752C1A96E948260 Buyout Set For Chain Of Hospitals].  ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 22, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and completed a successful [[initial public offering]] in 1992. In 1993 HCA merged with [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]-based Columbia Hospital Corporation to form '''Columbia/HCA'''. In April 1998, [[Birmingham, Alabama]]-based [[HealthSouth Corporation]] announced it was acquiring the majority of HCA's surgical division.

===Recent history===
In 2006, [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] and [[Bain Capital]], together with [[Merrill Lynch]] and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $33.6&amp;nbsp;billion acquisition, making the company privately held again, 17 years after it had first been taken private in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout was the first of several to set new records for the largest, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of [[RJR Nabisco]]. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of [[Equity Office Properties]] and [[Energy Future Holdings|TXU]].&lt;ref&gt;SORKIN, ANDREW ROSS. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/25/business/25buyout.html HCA Buyout Highlights Era of Going Private]." ''[[New York Times]]'', July 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, HCA announced that the corporation would once again go public with an expected $4.6-billion IPO. In March 2011, HCA sold 126.2 million shares for $30 each, raising about $3.79 billion, at that time, the largest private-equity backed IPO in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. Milton Johnson|Milton Johnson]] is the current [[CEO]] of HCA.

==Facilities==
{{As of|2018}}, HCA operated 178 hospitals and approximately 1,800 sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics located in 20 U.S. states and in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="hcahealthcare1"/&gt; In July 2007, HCA sold its hospitals in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2007/07/16/daily39.html HCA sells Switzerland hospitals] ''Nashville Business Journal'', June 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The main hospital sites within the United Kingdom include:

* 52 Alderley Road, Manchester
* The Harley Street Clinic
* HCA at The Shard
* The [[Lister Hospital (Chelsea)|Lister Hospital]]
* [[London Bridge Hospital]]
* The [[Portland Hospital for Women and Children]]
* [[The Princess Grace Hospital]]
* [[Wellington Hospital, United Kingdom|The Wellington Hospital]]
It opened urgent care walk-in centres at London Bridge Hospital and the Portland Hospital in March 2018. They claim that patients, on average, wait just  seven minutes to see a nurse and 17 minutes to see a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HCA expands network of urgent care centres|url=https://www.laingbuissonnews.com/healthcare-markets-content/hca-expands-network-urgent-care-centres/|accessdate=11 May 2018|publisher=LaingBuisson|date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Princess Grace Hospital]] specializes in breast cancer and surgery, aided by Professor [[Kefah Mokbel]] and Dr. Nick Perry who, in 2005, founded The London Breast Institute.

==Fraud investigations==
In 1993, lawsuits were filed by former employees regarding alleged improprieties in HCA's billing of Medicare which amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. With federal investigations still underway, HCA was acquired by Columbia Healthcare; their growth and expansion continued under the company's founder [[Rick Scott]]. In 1997, amid growing evidence that HCA "had kept two sets of books, one to show the government and one with actual expenses listed" &lt;ref name=Appleby/&gt; Scott resigned, and became a venture capitalist. Thomas Frist, a co-founder of HCA and brother of US Senator [[Bill Frist]], took Scott's place.&lt;ref name=Appleby/&gt;

In March 1997, investigators from the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services served search warrants at Columbia/HCA facilities in El Paso and on dozens of doctors with suspected ties to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/financial/032197columbia-hca-investigate.html | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Expands Search of Columbia/HCA in Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the raids, the Columbia/HCA board of directors forced [[Rick Scott]] to resign as chairman and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/business/2-leaders-are-out-at-health-giant-as-inquiry-goes-on.html 2 Leaders Are Out at Health Giant as Inquiry Goes on.] ''New York Times'', July 1997&lt;/ref&gt; He was paid a settlement of $9.88 million and left with 10 million shares of stock worth over $350 million, mostly from his initial investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korten |first=Tristram |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/30/rick_scott_one |title=Rick Scott profits off the uninsured |publisher=Salon.com |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOSPITAL+FIRM+OUSTS+ITS+FOUNDER%3B+COLUMBIA%2FHCA+TRIES+TO+STOP...-a083874577 |title=Hospital Firm Ousts Its Founder; Columbia/Hca Tries To Stop Slide. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1997-07-26 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Columbia/HCA changed its name back to HCA, Inc. HCA also admitted fraudulently billing Medicare and other health programs by inflating the seriousness of diagnoses and to giving doctors partnerships in company hospitals as a [[kickback (bribery)|kickback]] for the doctors referring patients to HCA. They filed false cost reports, fraudulently billing Medicare for home health care workers, and paid kickbacks in the sale of home health agencies and to doctors to refer patients. In addition, they gave doctors "loans" that were never intended to be repaid as well as free rent, free office furniture, and free drugs from hospital pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/12/15/1215disaster.html | website=Forbes.com | title=Disaster Of The Day: HCA | date=December 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101020/OPINION/10201022?p=2&amp;tc=pg |title=The risk of choosing Scott |publisher=HeraldTribune.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Scott stepped down, Frist Jr. returned as chairman and CEO. He called on longtime friend and colleague [[Jack O. Bovender, Jr.]], to help him turn the company around. Frist and Bovender, who became CEO in 2001, pulled off what ''Fortune'' magazine called a remarkable corporate rescue.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/02/09/360103/index.htm | work=Fortune Magazine | title=Bringing HCA Back to Life After years of scandal, the hospital chain is healthy again--and might just be a buy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In settlements reached in 2000 and 2002, Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies and admitted systematically overcharging the government by claiming marketing costs as reimbursable, striking illegal deals with home care agencies, and filing false data about use of hospital space.

[[File:Corporate Office 1972.jpg|thumb|Corporate office in 1972]]
In late 2002, HCA agreed to pay the U.S. government $631 million, plus interest, and pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid agencies, in addition to $250 million paid up to that point to resolve outstanding Medicare expense claims.&lt;ref name=Appleby&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2002-12-18-hca-settlement-_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Julie | last1=Appleby | title=HCA to settle more allegations for $631M | date=December 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, civil lawsuits cost HCA more than $2 billion to settle.&lt;ref name=DOJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/doj-accomplishments.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Accomplishments of the U.S. Department of Justice : 2001-2009|website=Justice.gov|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name subsequently reverted to "Hospital Corporation of America." HCA abandoned the use of its name in its home market and instead promotes its Nashville hospitals under the TriStar brand. The federal investigations, which spanned nearly a decade, drew to a close in 2003 with "the government receiving a total of over $2 billion in criminal fines and civil penalties for systematically defrauding federal health care programs."&lt;ref name=DOJ/&gt; The case has been referred to as the longest and costliest investigation for health-care fraud in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

In July 2005, U.S. Senator [[Bill Frist]] sold all of his HCA shares two weeks before disappointing earnings sent the stock on a 9-point plunge. Frist claimed that he sold his shares to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest if he ran for president. Other executives sold their stock at the same time. Shareholders sued HCA and alleged that the company made false claims about its profits to drive up the price, which then fell when the company reported disappointing financial results. Eleven of HCA's senior officers were sued for accounting fraud and [[insider trading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blbglaw.com/cases/00029 |title= In re HCA Inc., Securities Litigation  |accessdate=Jul 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCA settled the lawsuit in August 2007, agreeing to pay $20&amp;nbsp;million to the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/13/ap4015202.html] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nashville furniture controversy==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
The [[Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County]] gave $1 million to HCA for "moving expenses" into their new building in North Gulch in 2014.&lt;ref name="channel5metrobuys1million"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Ben|title=Metro Buys HCA $1 Million In Office Furniture|url=https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/metro-buys-hca-1-million-in-office-furniture|accessdate=May 23, 2018|work=WTVF|date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, HCA had spent the amount on office furniture, leading to concerns on the part of council member Erica Gilmore, who blamed it on Nashville's Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, and the [[Beacon Center of Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="channel5metrobuys1million"/&gt;

The '''invisible balance''' or '''balance of trade on services''' is that part of the [[balance of trade]] that refers to services and other products that do not result in the transfer of physical objects. Examples include consulting services, shipping services, tourism, and patent license revenues. This figure is usually generated by [[tertiary industry]]. The term 'invisible balance' is especially common in the United Kingdom.

For countries that rely on service exports or on tourism, the invisible balance is particularly important. For instance the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia receive significant international income from financial services, while Japan and Germany rely more on exports of manufactured goods.

==Types of invisibles==

Invisibles are both international payments for services (as opposed to goods), as well as movements of money without exchange for goods or services. These invisibles are called 'transfer payments' or 'remittances' and may include money sent from one country to another by an individual, business, government or non-governmental organisations ([[NGO]]) &amp;ndash; often charities.

An individual remittance may include money sent to a relative overseas. Business transfers may include profits sent by a foreign subsidiary to a parent company or money invested by a business in a foreign country. Bank loans to foreign countries are also included in this category, as are license fees paid for the use of patents and trademarks. Government transfers may involve loans made or official aid given to foreign countries, while transfers made by NGO's include money designated for charitable work within foreign countries, respectively.

==Balance of payments and invisibles==
In many countries a useful distinction is drawn between the [[balance of trade]] and the [[balance of payments]].  'Balance of trade' refers to the trade of both tangible (physical) objects as well as the trade in services &amp;ndash; collectively known as exports and imports (in other words, 'visibles plus services') &amp;ndash; while the 'balance of payments' also includes transfers of Capital in the form of loans, investments in shares or direct investment in projects.

A nation may have a visibles balance surplus but this can be offset by a larger deficit in the invisibles balance (creating a Balance of Trade deficit overall) – if, for example, there are large payments made to foreign businesses for invisibles such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, a Visibles Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the invisibles balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.

In a similar way, a nation may also have a surplus 'balance of trade' because it exports more than it imports but a negative (or deficit) 'balance of payments' because, it has a much greater shortfall in transfers of capital. And, just as easily, a deficit in the 'balance of trade' may be offset by a larger surplus in capital transfers from overseas to produce a balance of payments surplus overall.

==Balance of payments problems and the invisible balance==
Problems with a country's balance of trade (or balance of payments) are often associated with an inappropriate valuation of its currency, its country's foreign exchange rate.

If a country's exchange rate is too high, its exports will become uncompetitive as buyers in foreign countries require more of their own currency to pay for them. In the meantime, it also becomes cheaper for the citizens of the country to buy goods from overseas,as opposed to buying locally produced goods), because an overvalued currency makes foreign products less expensive.

The simultaneous decline in currency inflows from decreased exports and the rise in outflows, due to increased imports, sends the balance of trade into deficit, which then needs to be paid for by a transfer of funds in some form, either invisible transfers (aid, etc.) or capital flows (loans, etc.). However, relying on funds like that to support a trade deficit, is unsustainable, and the country may eventually  require its currency to be devalued.

If, on the other hand, a currency is undervalued, its exports will become cheaper and therefore more competitive internationally. At the same time, imports will also become more costly, stimulating the production of domestic substitutes to replace them. That will result in a growth of currency flowing into the country and a decline in currency flowing out of it, resulting in an improvement in the country's balance of trade.

Because a nation's exchange rate has a big impact on its 'balance of trade' and its 'balance of payments', many economists favour freely [[floating exchange rate]]s over the older, fixed (or pegged) rates of foreign currency exchange. Floating exchange rates allow more regular adjustments in exchange rates to occur, allowing the greater opportunity for international payments to maintain equilibrium.

==Career==
Following a few years as usability consultant in the late 90’s and a few years at the [[Swedish National Police Board]] as Product Manager,&lt;ref name="calvinayre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calvinayre.com/2012/07/24/poker/jonas-odman-bodog-recreational-poker-model/ |title=Jonas Odman and the Bodog Recreational Poker Model &amp;#124; Poker News |publisher=CalvinAyre.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ödman joined Ongame in 2004 as Product Manager for Ongame Network, Ongame’s B2B arm. Ödman worked during the sales process of Ongame to Austrian publicly traded company [[Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment|Bwin]] (then Betandwin).

On April 4, 2012, Google announced plans to offer "[[augmented]]-[[reality]] [[glasses]]", which have been given the project title, "Project Glass". Google released a 2-minute and 30-second video of how the glasses might work. The glasses will be able to control music, get directions, take pictures, give voice commands and conduct video chats. While ''[[The New York Times]]'' originally reported that the glasses would be released sometime in 2012, Google stated that the glasses would likely not be released until a later year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120404/google-unveils-project-glass-wearable-augmented-reality-glasses/?mod=atdtweet|title=Google Unveils Project Glass: Wearable Augmented-Reality Glasses|work=AllThingsD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hupfeld.jpg| thumb| Ludwig Hupfeld factory in 1911 in Böhlitz-Ehrenberg, [[Leipzig]]]]
'''Ludwig Hupfeld''' (26 November 1864 - 8 October 1949) was a musical instrument maker and industrialist.


== Life and work ==
[[File:Hupfeld Phonoliszt-Violina Model B Music Cabinet.jpg|thumb|left|Hupfeld Phonoliszt-Violina Model B music cabinet with three self-playing violins and a self-playing piano]]
[[File:Phonola.jpg| thumb | Ludwig Hupfeld AG Phonola of 1900 (the [[Castle Voigtsberg]] in [[Oelsnitz / Vogtland]].)]]
Hupfeld was born in Maberzell (now [[Fulda]] in [[Hesse]]), Germany.

Hupfeld attended the Royal Grammar School in Fulda and undertook commercial training in Cologne.

In 1892 he acquired the music trade company J. M. Grob &amp; Co., based in Leipzig which was originally a music shop and manufacturer of mechanical instruments.

After taking over the company, the name was changed to ''Hupfeld Musical Instrument Works''. When the company was converted to a [[corporation]] in 1904, the name of the company became ''Ludwig Hupfeld [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]''.

In 1911, the company moved to Leipzig, to a large factory in Böhlitz-Ehrenberg. Over the years, Hupfeld bought up several construction companies, and in 1925 following a merger with the Zimmerman company, it led the industry in Europe. In the 1920s, Ludwig Hupfeld AG was the largest manufacturer of mechanical musical works in Europe.

One of the most popular products since 1902 was the self-playing piano Phonola ''American'', the European counterpart of the [[pianola]]. Hupfield had some success with the 1908 [[reproducing piano]] ''DEA'', which later took over the role as ''Triphonola'' successfully. The mechanical violin ''Violina'', an [[orchestrion]], despite an ingenious design, was seen as aesthetically unsatisfactory and therefore less successful.
During [[World War II]], the company made ammunition boxes and fuel tanks in the factory. At the end of the war, as an ex-arms manufacturer, it was made a [[Volkseigener Betrieb|state-owned enterprise]] by the communist authorities of [[East Germany]] in 1949. The company was renamed ''VEB Deutsche Pianounion'' and continued to produce pianos under the brand name ''Hupfeld''.

Hupfeld died in Leipzig on 8 October 1949, and was buried in the Leipzig South Cemetery in his family tomb, where he was joined in 1953 by his wife Elisabeth (née Beyer, born 1874).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">'''Market price support''' (MPS) is an indicator, developed by the [[OECD]], used in the calculation of [[Producer and Consumer Subsidy Equivalents]] (PSE/CSE). The PSE and CSE acronyms were changed en 1999 to [[Producer and Consumer Support Estimate]].  MPS is the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers arising from policy measures creating a gap between domestic market prices and border prices of a specific agricultural commodity measured at the [[Farm gate value|farm gate]] level.  Conditional on the production of a specific commodity, MPS includes the transfer to producers associated with both production for domestic use and exports and is measured by the price gap applied to current production.  The MPS is net of producer levies on sales of the specific commodity or penalties for not respecting regulations such as production quotas (price levies).  In the case of livestock production MPS is net of the market price support on domestically produced coarse grains and oilseeds used as animal feed (excess feed cost).

== Disabled community’s voice in manifesto campaign ==
One of the most notable issues raised and became a manifesto of Dr Mazlan during the general election was the pledge to assist the needy particularly the disabled community in Malaysia.
Inspired by his own eldest son who's an OKU (Orang Kelainan Upaya) with blind disability from birth, Dr Mazlan is set to bring up the disabled community’s voice into parliament if he was elected into it. Notable appearance of his son was when he prayed in public for his father’s victory in the election ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-dFBPi2ym0 video]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.bharian.com.my/bharian/articles/PRU13__Anakistimewa_Mazlanharapayahmenang/m/mArticle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150413205007/http://www2.bharian.com.my/bharian/articles/PRU13__Anakistimewa_Mazlanharapayahmenang/m/mArticle |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Mazlan was quoted saying that having had a personal experience in raising a disabled child, he empathise and understand more of the feeling and challenges faced by parents with similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.nst.com.my/latest/permatang-pauh-personal-touch-of-bn-candidate-1.270651&lt;/ref&gt; He promised to adopt three existing rehabilitative centres in the constituency, namely in Kampung Pertama, Seberang Jaya and Kampung Tanah Liat.

== Social contribution ==

In the aftermath of the Malaysia’s 13th General Election where Dr Mazlan lost to the incumbent Anwar Ibrahim, he took the chance of his reputation by establishing a religious study centre for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/studies-centre-to-unite-muslims-malays |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081545/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/studies-centre-to-unite-muslims-malays |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Dalam_Negeri/20130716/dn_14/Rumah-Penyatuan-Ummah-semai-perpaduan-masyarakat-Islam&lt;/ref&gt; With the objective to unite the people regardless of political ideology, and where everyone can come and study Al Quran or hear religious sermons, Pusat Pengajian Darul Wehdah was set up in Simpang Tiga Kubang Ulu, aiming to hold programmes focusing on education, motivation, development issues and women. He criticized religious-schools that were used to incite hatred towards political enemies and these are detrimental to the people’s unity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.negarakita.com/Post-806688-Ribuan+rakyat+hadiri+Majlis+Kesyukuran+Ramadhan+Dr+Mazlan+Isnail&lt;/ref&gt;
The study centre has since organized various programmes especially the weekly sermons, Islamic event talks and others. Videos of the programmes held can be watched in [http://darulwehdah.blogspot.co.uk/ Darul Wehdah’s youtube channel] and [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Darul-wehdah/141556305922700 Facebook page].

'''Merge-in-transit (MIT)'''  is a distribution method in which several shipments from suppliers originating at different locations are consolidated into one final customer delivery.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Move it fast. Eliminate Steps. Transportation and Distribution|last = Dawe|first = R|publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This removes the need for [[Warehouses|distribution warehouses]] in the [[Supply chain management|supply chain]], allowing customers to receive complete deliveries for their orders. Under a merge-in-transit system, merge points replace distribution warehouse. In today's global market, merge-in-transit is progressively being used in [[telecommunication]]s and electronic industries.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;O'Leary. D. E. 2000. ''Reengineering Assembly, Warehouse and Billing Processes, for Electronic Commerce Using "Merge-in-Transit"''.  [online] available at https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/doleary/intellcont/Merge%20in%20Transit%202000-1.pdf [Accessed 29 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; These industries are usually dynamic and flexible, in which products have been developed and changed rapidly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Choosing a Third Party Logistics Provider. World Trade.|last = Celestino|first = M|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of merge-in-transit ==
Merge-in-transit allows company to assemble and transport goods simultaneously. It aims to remove the needs for distribution warehouse in the [[Supply chain management|supply chain]], targets at cutting down the amount of inventory stored in firm warehouses into zero, and allows customers to receive complete deliveries of their orders.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Leal, T. 2014. ''Is Merge-In-Transit the Key to Supply Chain Efficiency?''. Transvoyant. [online] Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.transvoyant.com/is-merge-in-transit-the-key-to-supply-chain-efficiency/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216204836/http://www.transvoyant.com/is-merge-in-transit-the-key-to-supply-chain-efficiency/ |archivedate=2015-12-16 |df= }} [Accessed 28 October 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transportation expenses can be lowered. From customer perspective, merge-in-transit provides value since it facilitates the delivery of a single and consolidated shipment rather than multiple smaller shipments. This also helps firms to reduce the overall inventory and process [[lean manufacturing]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Goldsby, T,J., Iyengar, D., Rao, S. 2014. ''The Definitive Guide to Transportation: Principles, Strategies, and Decisions for the Effective Flow of Goods and Services.'' New Jersey: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies of merge-in-transit ==
There are basically two ways of approaching merge-in-transit, either merging and forwarding or synchronization. Merge-in-transit depends on several factors, including the availability of multiple vendors for a customer, regularity of shipments to the customers, order size and the availability of a strategically located merge point. When these elements have been identified, a MIT operation can be created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Merge-in-transit_diagram.jpeg|alt=This illustrate the process of merge-in-transit system|frame|'''The diagram of merge-in-transit system'''. The graph illustrates the models with and without MIT system by highlighting the main differentiation (Merge Centre).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluation of Cooperative Planning in Supply Chains: An Empirical Approach of the European Automotive Industry|last = Diaz|first = Luis Martin|publisher = Springer|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Germany|pages = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;|427x427px]]

=== Merging and forwarding ===
A  [[logistics]] company receives the goods from multiple origins, and assembles them at a single point near a customer, which is called "merge point" or "merge centre".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shippers pick up separate shipments from several suppliers and deliver them to a location near their final destination (merge points), where a merge process is being undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enterprise Resources Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization|last = Langenwatler|first = Gary A|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = Florida|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no colossoal inventory is stored at these merge points. This kind of [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in time sequence delivery]] shorten the time required to consolidate, which allows an efficient delivery to customers. For example, a company bought electronic devices from three sources in Southwest Michigan. Instead of paying for three separate lorries from Southwest Michigan to Phoenix, the three shipments can be combined in Southwest Michigan, followed by a single lorry to Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Definitive Guide to Inventory Management: Principles and Strategies for the Efficient Flow of Inventory across the Supply Chain|last = Waller|first = Mathew A|publisher = Pearson of Education|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New Jersey|pages = 162|last2 = Esper|first2 = Terry L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merge-in-transit can also be regarded as a synchronization of production, in which logistics and transportation operation prevents stocking of final products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Maritime Transport: Perspectives|last = Leggate, H., McConville, J., Morvillo, A.|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Oxon|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various shipments of goods will be delivered from multiple vendors, which they are all delivered to the customers at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Synchronization is different from merging and forwarding, which the former neglects consolidation process.

== Advantages of merge-in-transit ==
Merge-in transit has various advantages comparing to the traditional method, which includes the following:

'''Increase in flexibility'''

Merge points can often be start-up expeditiously and cheaply, depending on the type of merge-in-transit system.&lt;ref&gt;Rhenus.com. (n.d.). ''Merge in transit.'' [online] available at http://www.nl.rhenus.com/services/transport-logistics/supply-chain-services/merge-in-transit.html{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [Accessed: 31 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  MIT system simplifies the receiving and deposit processes by eliminating various shipments and receipts, making it accessible for manufacturer and supplier to work together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Elimination of redundant transportation'''

The transportation time can be diminished as there are no double shipments of goods from the suppliers to the principal and the principal to the customer. Goods can be sent to the customer directly and instantly from the vendor to the customer, without the principal looking at the product.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaw. M.J. (2006). ''E-Business Management: Integration of Web Technologies with Business Models.'' New York: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reduction of inventory'''

The most direct benefit is the reduced inventory that used to sustain the system. Many organizations target cut their inventories to zero by the replacement of merge points, whereby they no longer require warehouses to store inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Bfgloballogistics.com. (n.d.). ''Merge IN TRANSIT.'' [online] Available at

http://www.bfglogistics.com/en/our-services/supply-chain-services/merge-in-transit [Accessed 31 October 2015].
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Micron Technology|Micron technology]] does not store monitors or printers in their own warehouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Curtail transportation and administration costs'''

Products are handled less frequently in merge-in-transit system due to the reduction of transportation and Inventory. Receiving and storing are not required as the products do not actually go into inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Donath, B., Mazel, J., Dubin, C., Patterson, P. (2002). ''The IOMA Handbook of Logistics and Inventory Management.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, goods are delivered directly to the customer rather than the principal then to the customer. Even the locations of merge points are placed near the customer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Consequently, the transportation and inventory costs could be exceedingly low.

'''Heighten supply chain visibility'''

Manufactures can take advantages of [[point of sale]] data, forwarding the information decoupling points further back upstream and allowing deferment both in time and form.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Gattolin, E. (2008). ''MERGE IN TRANSIT, A DISTRIBUTION METHOD IN THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT.'' [online] available at. http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:3794/fulltext01.pdf [Accessed 31 October 2015]. 
				&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the orders and material flows are separated. These may further reduce uncertainty and cost of forecasting.

'''Improved customer services'''

Merge-in-transit enables delivery to take place more rapidly, which aids the firms to generate the ability of improving customer service.&lt;ref&gt;Ala-Risku, T. (2002). ''Evaluating the costs and benefits of merge-in-transit for distributors''. [online] Available at. http://dialog.hut.fi/publications/Diplomityo_Ala-Risku.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621113631/http://dialog.hut.fi/publications/Diplomityo_Ala-Risku.pdf |date=2003-06-21 }} [Accessed 31 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Customers have the opportunity to choose among a wider variety of products and a larger pool of suppliers due to the withdrawal of inventory and the increased flexibility. The distributor may also provide better customer service by broadening its product assortment.&lt;ref&gt;Karkkainen, M., Ala-Risku, T., Holmstrom, J. (2003). ''Increasing customer value and decreasing distribution costs with merge-in-transit''. [online] Available at. http://legacy-tuta.hut.fi/logistics/publications/merge_in_transit.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [Accessed 31 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lower capital requirements'''

Merge-in-transit demands lesser capital investment as it does not need to store inventory in a warehouse. With regard of this, firms might spend fewer resources to deliver goods to the customer,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which benefits small and medium firms with limited capital.

== Disadvantages of merge-in-transit ==
Merge-in transit has several disadvantages over the traditional way, which includes the followings.

'''Advanced information systems requirement'''

The merge-in-transit system necessitates with a considerable alteration and investment in [[information technology]] and [[innovation]] processes. These system and development do not come without corresponding investments, containing an escalation of costs that might be arduous to recover from firm's revenue.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Rise in overall cost'''

Merge-in-transit system involves multiple loadings and unloading of consignments. This has the potential risk of increasing the overall cost if it is not optimized correctly, which the more times consignments is transiting, the higher the cost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Poor on-time delivery'''

Given that the time allowance is only a few days, in which each time period is commensurate with one day. Under merge-in-transit system, the firms will not schedule early or late arrivals to customers. They may easily impede and amend the delivery time. Hence, they have to provide compensations to the customers.&lt;ref&gt;Croxton, K, L., Gendron, B., Magnanti, T, L. (2000). ''MODELS AND METHODS FOR MERGE-IN-TRANSIT OPERATINONS''. [online] Available at. http://fisher.osu.edu/~croxton.4/CRT_0030.pdf [Accessed 1 November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escalate in complexity'''

As the requirements for coordination of orders and material flows are becoming more intensified, the complexity of distribution will be increased.&lt;ref&gt;Norelius, H. (2002). ''Merge in Transit – A non-stock distribution structure.'' Linköpings Studies in Science and Technology, Thesis No. 935.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, firms might often create distribution problems such as sending the wrong items and out of stocks of certain products. In addition, increasing customer orders will lead to a double of time for accessible products since there are not enough stocks available, leading to the situation that the supply does not meet with the demand in the customer order cycle.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Lack of inventory'''

Under the merge-in-transit system, there is little or zero inventory stored in a company, which aids to cut costs. However, inventory sometimes can be regarded as an advantage. For example, if a [[strike action|strike]] occurs within the company, without the stored inventory, the company will bear risks of paying compensation or closing down by the failure in delivering customer orders on time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this regard, reduction of inventory is detrimental to firms.

'''Vicious circle of delay distribution'''

Merge-in-transit system involves consolidated deliveries. The system relies heavily on the assumptions that the vendors will fulfill the order-filling operation at the identical level of efficiency and cooperation between vendors, which might involve risks. For example, a postponement in receiving a shipment form a vendor at the merge point would undoubtedly delay the shipment to the end of customer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Losing brand recognition'''

There is a potential problem that dealer other than the organization of the brand will gain brand recognition under merge-in-transit system.  Unless the products has been consolidated properly in outlook with other elements, there might be a risk that dealer might gain control of the customer for further sales. This is one of the main reasons that merge-in-transit component products gather commodities, rather than [[Product differentiation|differentiated]] or customized products from the dealers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Common usage  ==

* Instead of having a huge number of warehouse, the merge-in-transit system enables Cisco to match the location of the final customer with the location of the nearest FedEx storehouse where suppliers can store the components of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, E. (2001). ''Skipping steps. Info World.'' p.28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ultimate target is to have FedEx keep all the components until the customer order is complete.
* Cisco has successfully removed its stocked inventory.

'''Ricardo Semler''' (born 1959 in [[São Paulo]]) is the [[CEO]] and majority owner of [[Semco Partners]], a [[Brazil]]ian company best known for its radical form of [[industrial democracy]] and corporate re-engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Wherrett, Rob ''The Compleat Biz'' (2009) Reroq Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-9561305-0-1}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Under his ownership, revenue has grown from 4 million US dollars in 1982 to 212 million US dollars in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogl|first=A.J.|date=May 2004|title=The Anti-CEO|url=|journal=Across the Board|volume=41| issue =  3|pages=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his innovative business [[management]] policies have attracted widespread interest around the world. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' featured him among its Global 100 young leaders profile series published in 1994 while the [[World Economic Forum]] also nominated him. ''The Wall Street Journal'' ''America Economia'', [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s [[Latin America]]n magazine, named him Latin American businessman of the year in 1990 and he was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and 1992. ''Virando a Própria Mesa'' ("Turning the Table on Yourself"), his first book, became the best selling [[non-fiction]] book in the history of [[Brazil]]. He has since written two books in English on the transformation of Semco and workplace re-engineering: ''[[Maverick (book)|Maverick]]'', an English version of "Turning Your Own Table" published in 1993 and an international bestseller, and ''[[The Seven-Day Weekend]]'' in 2003.

==Semco 1980–1990==
Semler went to work for his father's company, originally called Semler &amp; Company, then a mixer and agitator supplier in [[São Paulo]]. Semler clashed with his father, Antonio Semler, who supported a traditional autocratic style of management whereas young Semler favoured a decentralised, participatory style. Furthermore, Ricardo favoured diversification away from the struggling shipbuilding industry, which his father opposed.

After heated clashes, the son threatened to leave the company. Rather than see this happen, Antonio Semler resigned as CEO and vested majority ownership in his son in 1980 when Ricardo was 21 years old. On his first day as CEO, Ricardo Semler fired sixty percent of all top managers.  He began work on a diversification program to rescue the company. Semler experienced health issues, culminating in a [[fainting]] spell at a pump factory ([[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], New York) when he was 25. After seeing a doctor at the [[Lahey Clinic]] (Boston), he was diagnosed with an advanced case of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maverick! : The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace|last=Semler|first=Ricardo |publisher=Arrow edition|year=1994|isbn=0099329417|location=London|pages=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired him to want a greater [[work-life balance]] for himself and his employees.

Attempts to introduce a [[Matrix management|matrix organisational structure]] in 1986 failed to achieve desired improvements.&lt;ref name="semler1993p108"&gt;{{cite book | last = Semler | first = Ricardo | title = Maverick! | origyear = 1993 | year = 1994 | publisher = Arrow | location = London | isbn = 0-09-932941-7 | chapter = 14 Too big for our own good | page = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--[[Delaware]]-based consultancy [[W. L. Gore]]'s lattice structure&lt;ref&gt;Semler 1993, op. cit., p.114&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted in 1985 with six to ten workers placed in charge of particular tasks – with a sense of ownership and financial responsibility alike – proved to be very successful as productivity rose and costs fell. While a third of middle managers left between 1985 and 1987, the system became popular with the workers as they received 25 per cent of the profits, allowing many to double or triple their wages with bonuses distributed by a democratically-elected committee.--&gt;

In the late 1980s, three engineers at Semco proposed setting up a Nucleus of Technological Innovation (NTI) to develop new businesses and product lines which Semler endorsed. At the end of the first six months, NTI had identified 18 such opportunities. Following the success of this initiative, satellite units were encouraged throughout Semco. By the late 1980s, these satellite units accounted for two-thirds of its new products and two-thirds of its employees.

An assessment of Semler's business philosophy through phenomenological analysis (within the radical change of Semco's management style), led Bombała to conclude that it was an ''"...excellent exemplification of good leadership."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bombała|first=Bronisław|date=January 2014|title=Phenomenology as the epistemological and methodological basis of management sciences|url=|journal=Contemporary Management Quarterly / Wspólczesne Zarzadzanie|volume=13| issue =  1|pages=150–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor Glor notes that the only accounts about the change in management style come from Ricardo Semler himself, rather than from the affected workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glor|first=Eleanor D.|date=2005|title=About empowerment|url=http://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/glor_about_empowerment7v10i1a9.pdf|journal=The Innovation Journal: The Public Sector Innovation Journal|volume=10| issue = 1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semco 1990–2004==
After dramatic restrictions on [[market liquidity|liquidity]] instituted by Brazilian president [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] to combat [[hyperinflation]] in 1990, the [[Economy of Brazil|Brazilian economy]] went into a severe downturn, forcing many companies to declare [[bankruptcy]]. Workers at Semco agreed to wage cuts, providing their share of profits was increased to 39%, management salaries were cut by 40% and employees were given the right to approve every item of expenditure.

Performing multiple roles during the crisis gave workers greater knowledge of the operations and more suggestions on how to improve the business. Reforms implemented during that time led to 65% reduction in inventories, a marked reduction in product delivery times and a product defects rate that fell to less than 1%. As the business climate improved, Semco's revenues and profitability improved dramatically.

{{As of|2003}}, Semco had annual revenue of $212 million, up from $4 million in 1982 and $35 million in 1994, with an annual growth rate of up to 40 percent a year. It employed 3,000 workers in 2003, as opposed to 90 in 1982. The company's units include:
* the industrial machinery unit, which now manufactures mixing equipment as opposed to pumps
* Sembobac, a partnership with [[Baltimore Air Cooler]] making cooling towers
* Cushman and Wakefield Semco, a partnership with [[Rockefeller]] property company [[Cushman and Wakefield]] managing properties in [[Brazil]] and [[Latin America]]
* Semco Johnson Controls, a partnership with [[Johnson Controls]], managing large scale facilities such as airports and hospitals
* ERM, a partnership with [[Environmental Resources Management]], one of the world's leading environmental consultants
* Semco Ventures, offering high technology and Internet services
* SemcoHR, a human resources management firm
* Semco-RGIS, an inventory control firm

As Semco grew, Ricardo Semler received a great deal of recognition. He was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and in 1992, and the [[World Economic Forum]] named him as one of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow. A high-profile committee appointed by ''[[CIO Magazine]]'' featuring [[Tom Peters]], [[Jim Champy]] and Michael Hammer selected Semco as one of the most successfully re-engineered companies in the world. The [[BBC]] included Semco in its series on ''Reengineering the Business'' for creating one of the most successful management structures in business.

== Other activities ==
Semler has reduced his involvement in Semco in the past decade to pursue other activities. He wrote a book ''[[Maverick (book)|Maverick]]'' on his experience at Semco which became a worldwide bestseller in 1993.

His second book, ''[[The Seven-Day Weekend (book)|The Seven-Day Weekend: Changing the Way Work Works]]'' was published in 2003.

He has appeared in the media around the world and speaks regularly to business schools, businesses and groups to promote his philosophy of industrial democracy. He has also been a visiting scholar at [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2004/05/09/an_iconoclasts_ideas_for_redefining_management | title = An Iconoclast’s Ideas for Redefining Management | work = The Boston Globe | first = Robert | last = Weisman | date = 9 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semler has been Vice President of the Federation of Industries of Brazil and a member of [[SOS Atlantic Forest]], the leading environmental defence organisation in Brazil. He founded The Ralston-Semler Foundation and the Lumiar School, a [[democratic school]] where children from 0 to 14 years old engage in projects of their interest. There are three such schools — one in the city of São Paulo and two in the vicinity of Campos do Jordão, in the state of São Paulo.

=== Semler principles institutions ===
As of late 2016, Semler was involved in the foundation of other ventures which intends to teach other entrepreneurs and businesspeople how to implement a people-centric management in their companies called [https://semcostyle.org/ Semco Style Institute] where people are formed to find the right way to apply Semler's principles, and [http://www.leadwise.co/?partner= Leadwise] where people learn via online courses about all the people based management styles available (Including Semler's principles described in his book [[Maverick (book)|Maverick]], [[Holacracy]], [http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Main_Page Teal Organizations], etc), they also analyze success cases of companies from different industries and countries where this kind of methodology was applied.

==Early life==
One of four children, Robert Durst grew up in [[Scarsdale, New York]]. He is the son of [[real estate]] investor [[Seymour Durst]] and his wife [[Bernice Herstein]]. His siblings are [[Douglas Durst|Douglas]], Tommy, and Wendy. Durst's paternal grandfather, [[Joseph Durst]], a penniless [[Jewish]] tailor when he emigrated from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1902, eventually became a very successful real estate manager and developer, founding the [[Durst Organization]] in 1927. Seymour Durst became head of the family business in 1974 upon his father's death.&lt;ref name=WSJHelm&gt;{{cite news|first=Dana|last=Rubinstein |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704482704576072202098963980 |title=New York Real Estate: Douglas Durst Takes Helm to Change City Landscape |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|location=new York City|date=January 10, 2011 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robert was seven, his mother died as a result of a fall from the family's Scarsdale home; he later claimed that, moments before her death, his father walked him to a window from which he could see her standing on the roof. In a March 2015 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview, however, his brother Douglas denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Dwyer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/nyregion/a-durst-sibling-recounts-the-violent-ripples-below-a-charming-surface.html?_r=0|title=A Durst Sibling Recounts the Violent Ripples Below a Charming Surface|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Jonathan|last=Bandler| title =Robert Durst admits lying about wife's disappearance on HBO|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2015/02/06/robert-durst-hbo-jinx-documentary/22999161/|newspaper =[[The Journal News]] | publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=New York City| date = February 7, 2015| accessdate =March 15, 2015| quote =Robert Durst addresses her 1950 suicide at the family's home in Scarsdale when he was 7.

==Crimes for which Durst has been investigated==
Police have directly questioned Durst, and sometimes conducted searches, in connection to the disappearance of his first wife Kathie McCormack, and two homicides, Susan Berman and Morris Black. In one of those homicides, he was tried and acquitted.

===Disappearance of Kathleen McCormack Durst===
In the fall of 1971, Durst met Kathleen McCormack, a dental hygienist, whose nickname was "Kathie". After two dates, Durst invited McCormack to share his home in Vermont, where he had opened a health food store; she moved there in January 1972.&lt;ref name=NYTSpiral /&gt; However, Durst's father pressured him to move back to New York City to work in the family real estate business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Charles V.|last1=Bagli  |first2=Kevin|last2=Flynn|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/movies/28durst.html?pagewanted=all| title =That's Me on Screen, but I Still Didn't Do It| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date =November 24, 2010| accessdate =March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst and McCormack returned to Manhattan, where they married in April 1973.&lt;ref name=NYTSpiral /&gt;&lt;ref name=JournalNewsTimeline&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2015/03/17/robert-durst-timeline/24908191/|title=Robert Durst: A timeline|work=[[The Journal News]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=White Plains, New York|date=March 25, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before her disappearance, McCormack was a student in her fourth and final year at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in [[The Bronx]] and was only a few months short of earning her degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Kevin|last1=Flynn|first2=Charles V.|last2=Bagli|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/06/nyregion/reopened-mystery-special-report-woman-s-disappearance-still-baffling-after-19.html|title=REOPENED MYSTERY: A special report.; A Woman's Disappearance Is Still Baffling After 19 Years|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 6, 2001|access-date=March 14, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had intended to become a pediatrician.&lt;ref name="CTPost"/&gt; McCormack was last seen by someone other than Durst the evening of January 31, 1982,&lt;ref name="Charley Project Kathleen"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Meaghan|last=Good|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/d/durst_kathleen.html|title=The Charley Project: Kathleen Durst Elizabeth|website=www.charleyproject.org|access-date=March 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213072427/http://charleyproject.org/cases/d/durst_kathleen.html|archivedate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/560dfny.html|title=The Doe Network: Case File 560DFNY|website=www.doenetwork.org|access-date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her best friend's [[Party#Dinner party|dinner party]] in [[Newtown, Connecticut]]. She had arrived unexpectedly and her friend noticed she was upset. She was also wearing red sweatpants, which the friend found odd since McCormack had often dressed in much better quality clothing.

After McCormack had left her friend's house, she was supposed to meet her friend at a pub called The Lion's Gate in Manhattan. When she failed to show up, her friend became concerned and repeatedly called the police for several days. Days later, Durst filed a [[missing person]] report as well. A doorman at one of the two Manhattan apartments where the couple lived claimed to have seen McCormack there on February 1, which was one day after she was last seen, but also claimed that he had seen her only from behind and couldn't be 100% sure that it was her.

McCormack had been treated at a Bronx [[hospital]] for facial bruises three weeks before. She told a friend that Durst beat her, yet she did not press charges over the incident.&lt;ref name="VanityFair"/&gt; McCormack asked Durst for a $250,000 [[divorce]] settlement.&lt;ref name="NYPostPrudence"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/28/woman-who-inspired-the-beatles-dear-prudence-once-dated-robert-durst/|title=Woman who inspired The Beatles' 'Dear Prudence' once dated Robert Durst|work=[[New York Post]]|author1=Isabel Vincent  |author2=Melissa Klein |lastauthoramp=yes |date=March 28, 2015|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst cancelled his wife's credit card, removed her name from a joint bank account, and refused to pay her medical school tuition.&lt;ref name="VultureAllGoodThings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/robert-dursts-all-good-things-dvd-commentary.html|title=The Creepiest Things Robert Durst Says in His ''All Good Things'' DVD Commentary|work=[[Vulture.com|New York Magazine (Vulture.com)]]|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2015|author=Alex Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time his wife disappeared, Durst had been dating [[Prudence Farrow]] for three years and was living in a separate apartment.&lt;ref name=NYTSpiral&gt;{{cite news|author1=Charles V.

When McCormack's friend and sister had heard she was reported missing, they broke into her [[cottage]] hoping to find her. Instead, they found the cottage ransacked and McCormack's mail left unopened. They then became afraid and left.

====Investigation and aftermath====
After McCormack went missing, police said that Durst had claimed to have last spoken to her when she called him at their cottage from Manhattan. He claimed that the last time he had seen her was at [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah train station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/crime/2015/01/27/robert-durst-wife-disappearance/22405297/|title=No answer to Kathie Durst's 1982 disappearance|work=lohud.com|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was planning to board a 21:15 train to Manhattan. He also claimed that on February 4, the supervisor at her medical school called him and said that she had called in sick on February 1 and was absent from class for the entire week. It is uncertain if it was indeed McCormack who made the call. The day after Durst received the call from McCormack's medical school, he reported her as missing. The police found his stories to be full of contradictions.

He was eventually extradited to Texas for trial. 

====Trial====
In 2003, Durst was tried for the murder of Black. He employed defense attorney [[Dick DeGuerin]] and claimed [[self-defense]]; DeGuerin conducted two mock trials in preparation for the case.&lt;ref name="MashableCriss"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Mashable]]|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015|url=http://mashable.com/2015/03/16/galveston-judge-durst-acquittal-dangerous/|author=Pamela Chelin|title=Judge who presided over Robert Durst acquittal in Texas murder: 'He's very dangerous'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst's defense team had difficulty communicating with him, so they hired psychiatrist Dr. Milton Altschuler to find out why. Altschuler spent over 70 hours examining Durst and diagnosed him with [[Asperger syndrome]], saying, "His whole life's history is so compatible with a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder." Durst's defense team argued at trial that the diagnosis explained his behavior.&lt;ref name="CBS 2004-03-15"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Mystery of Robert Durst | author = Leung, Rebecca | publisher = [[CBS News]] | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-of-robert-durst-15-03-2004/ | accessdate = December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durst claimed he and Black, a cranky and confrontational loner, struggled for control of Durst's .22-caliber target pistol after Black grabbed it from its hiding place and threatened him with it.

Durst's attorneys requested a later date for the federal weapons charge trial, saying they'd need more time to prepare after rulings on pending motions.

Holm.&lt;ref name="NYTStepsBack"/&gt;

Durst traveled and lived under dozens of aliases over the years,&lt;ref name="NewsweekWork"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-it-was-work-robert-durst-315251|title=What it was like to work for Robert Durst|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|author=Polly Mosendz}}&lt;/ref&gt; using different identities to buy cars, rent apartments, and open credit card accounts.&lt;ref name="GuardianAliases"/&gt; "He had a scanner, copier, and a laminating machine," a former office employee of Durst told ''[[Newsweek]]''. "What I didn't realize is that I unwittingly saw what would have allowed Robert Durst to make a fake driver's license."&lt;ref name="NewsweekWork"/&gt; Durst was also "a prolific user of private mailboxes," and apparently conducted business under a number of canine-themed names: Woofing LLC, WoofWoof LLC, and Igor-Fayette Inc.&lt;ref name="GuardianAliases"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, Durst owned a series of seven [[Alaskan Malamute]]s each named Igor, which according to his brother Douglas all died under mysterious circumstances. In December 2014, prior to the airing of ''The Jinx'', Douglas told ''The New York Times'' that, "In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing [of] his wife with those dogs."&lt;ref name="GuardianAliases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTRobertInterview"&gt;{{cite news|quote="Before the disappearance of my sister-in-law, Bob had a series of Alaskan Malamutes, which is like a husky," Douglas said. "He had seven of them, and they all died, mysteriously, of different things, within six months of his owning them. All of them named Igor. We don't know how they died, and what happened to their bodies. In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing of his wife with those dogs." What led him to that conclusion, Douglas said, was that Robert turned the word "Igor" into a verb and inflected it with a menace: "When he was in jail in Pennsylvania, he was recorded saying, 'I want to Igor Douglas.'"|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 1, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|title=Real Estate Chief Fears Troubled Sibling Has New Weapon: TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/series-on-troubled-scion-of-durst-real-estate-family-has-critic-his-brother.html|author=Jim Dwyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst was once recorded saying he wanted to "Igor" Douglas.&lt;ref name="NYTRobertSpeaks"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/nyregion/for-durst-family-arrest-brings-a-tremendous-sense-of-relief.html|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015|author=Jim Dwyer|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=For Durst Family, Arrest Brings a 'Tremendous Sense of Relief'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durst, however, has disputed the notion that he owned seven dogs named Igor; he owned three, he said, one that was run over and another that died in surgery after eating an apple core, "before the Igor that lasted forever."&lt;ref name="VultureAllGoodThings"/&gt;

In late 1981, while Durst was still married to McCormack, he was nearing the end of a three-year affair with Prudence Farrow, who was also married at the time. A few months before McCormack's disappearance in January 1982, Farrow called her and asked that she give him up, as friends said she wanted him all to herself. After Durst's acquittal of murdering Black in 2003, Farrow contacted law enforcement authorities with concerns for her safety, as she said Durst was angry with her for terminating their relationship three days before McCormack disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/28/woman-who-inspired-the-beatles-dear-prudence-once-dated-robert-durst/|title=Woman who inspired The Beatles’ ‘Dear Prudence’ once dated Robert Durst - New York Post|date=March 28, 2015|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial status and residences===
In mid 2002, Durst signed over a [[power of attorney]] to his wife Charatan, a real estate investor,&lt;ref name="NYT0903"/&gt; and it is believed their holdings remain closely intermingled.&lt;ref name="NewsweekCharatan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/shadowy-history-robert-dursts-real-estate-holdings-314764|work=[[Newsweek]]|title=The Shadowy History Of Robert Durst's Real Estate Holdings|author=Polly Mosendz|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Durst gave Charatan around $20 million of his $65 million trust settlement.&lt;ref name="PapersSeized"/&gt;

During that time he received $2 million a year from the trust.

On May 1, 2015, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Douglas had settled litigation against ''Jinx'' filmmaker [[Andrew Jarecki]], having confirmed that Robert was the source of videotaped depositions that appeared in the documentary. Robert's disclosure apparently violated the terms of his 2006 agreement with the Durst family, which had dispersed to him a lump sum of family trust assets. Although it was unclear whether Jarecki confirmed Robert as his source&amp;mdash;''The New York Times'' reported in March 2015 that Jarecki was given "unrestricted access" to Robert's personal records, including the videotaped material&amp;mdash;the settlement paves the way for Douglas to reclaim as much as $74 million of his brother's assets, effectively freezing those assets pending court judgment.

In November 2015, nearly 34 years after her disappearance, McCormack's three sisters and 101-year-old mother sued Durst for $100 million, citing his apparent role in her murder and his denial to her family of the "right to sepulcher", a New York law that grants immediate relatives access to a deceased person's body and the opportunity to determine appropriate burial.&lt;ref name=Bagli30Nov&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/nyregion/family-of-robert-dursts-first-wife-sues-him-for-100-million-in-her-disappearance.html|title=Family of Robert Durst's First Wife Sues Him for $100 Million in Her Disappearance|work=The New York Times|first=Charles V.|last=Bagli|date=November 30, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successful, the lawsuit could deprive Durst of most or all of his inherited fortune.&lt;ref name=Bagli30Nov/&gt; McCormack's brother James had attempted in October 2015 to file a [[wrongful death]] suit against Durst on behalf of his mother, but was challenged by one of his sisters, who holds her mother's power of attorney.&lt;ref name=Bagli30Nov/&gt; DeGuerin commented that "there is no evidence that Robert Durst had anything to do with Kathleen's disappearance.

===Other legal issues===
In 2012 and 2013, Durst's family members sought and received restraining orders against him, claiming they were afraid of him. Durst was charged with trespassing in New York for walking in front of townhouses owned by his brother Douglas and other family members. He went on trial and was acquitted in December 2014. The judge also vacated the thirteen orders of protection his family members had taken out on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =Charles V.

In July 2014, Durst was arrested after turning himself in to police following an incident at a Houston [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]] drugstore in which he allegedly exposed himself without provocation and urinated on a rack of candy.

==In popular culture==
* The events surrounding Durst inspired the 2010 film ''[[All Good Things (film)|All Good Things]]'', the title of which is a reference to a health food store of the same name set up by Durst and his wife in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Shareholder primacy''' is a theory in [[corporate governance]] holding that [[shareholder]] interests should be assigned first priority relative to all other corporate stakeholders.

'''Software Testing Outsourcing''' is software testing carried out by an independent company or a group of people not directly involved in the process of [[software development]].

Software testing is an essential phase of software development, however it is often viewed as a non-core activity for most organisations. Outsourcing enables an organisation to concentrate on its core development activities while external software testing experts handle the independent validation work. This offers many business benefits which include independent assessment leading to enhanced delivery confidence, reduced time to market, lower infrastructure investment, predictable software quality, de-risking of deadlines and increased time to focus on development.

'''Software Testing Outsourcing''' can come in different forms:

* Full [[outsourcing]], [[insourcing]] or remote insourcing of the entire test process (strategy, planning, execution and closure), often referred to as a Managed Testing Service or dedicated testing teams. 
* Provision of additional resources for major projects
* One-off test often related to load, stress or performance testing
* Beta User Acceptance Testing. Utilising specialist focus groups coordinated by an external organisation

==Top established global outsourcing cities==
According to Tholons Global Services - Top 50,&lt;ref name="Tholons_report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itida.gov.eg/Documents/Tholons_study.pdf |format=pdf |title=Top 50 Emerging Global Outsourcing Cities: A Global Services-Tholons Study |first1=Avinash |last1=Vashistha |first2=Imrana |last2=Khan |date=October 2009|access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009, Top Established and Emerging Global Outsourcing Cities in Testing function were:
# [[Bengaluru, India]]
# [[Cebu City, Philippines]]
# [[Shanghai, China]]
# [[Beijing, China]]
# [[Kraków, Poland]]
# [[Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]]

==Vietnam outsourcing==
Vietnam has become a major player in software outsourcing. Ho Chi Minh City's ability to meet clients’ needs in scale and capacity, its maturing business environment, the country’s stability in political and labor conditions, its increasing number of English speakers and its high service-level maturity make it attractive to foreign interests.&lt;ref name="PC_World_Viet_Nam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logigear.com/blog/about-logigear/software-outsourcing-recovery-and-development/ |date=January 20, 2011 |publisher=LogiGear Corporation |title=Software outsourcing: Recovery and development |access-date=December 13, 2017 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam's software industry has maintained annual growth rate of 30-50% during the past 10 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} From 2002 to 2013 revenue of the software industry increased to nearly 3 US$ billion and the hardware industry increased to 36.8 US$ billion.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Many Vietnamese enterprises have been granted international certificates (CMM) for their software development.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2014/12/09/vietnam-it-services-climb-the-value-chain/ |title=Vietnam IT Services Climb the Value Chain |first=Will |last=Greene |date=December 9, 2014 |access-date=December 13, 2017 |publisher=Forbes Media LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Global Services Location Index 2017 by [[A.T. Kearney]], Vietnam ranks sixth in global software outsourcing market. Vietnam’s position in this year’s index reflects its growing popularity for [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO). Its BPO industry earned US$2 billion in 2015 and has annually grown by 20-25% in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atkearney.com/digital-transformation/gsli/full-report|title=Read @ATKearney: The Widening Impact of Automation|website=www.atkearney.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argentina outsourcing==
Argentina’s software industry has experienced an exponential growth in the last decade, positioning itself as one of the strategic economic activities in the country. As Argentina is just one hour ahead of North America's east coast, communication takes place in real time. Argentina’s Internet culture and industry is one of the best, Facebook penetration in Argentina ranks 3rd worldwide and the country has the highest penetration of smart phones in Latin America (24%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Argentina |publisher=New Media Trend Watch |url=http://www.newmediatrendwatch.com/markets-by-country/11-long-haul/35-argentina |date=December 17, 2008 |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221020443/https://www.newmediatrendwatch.com/markets-by-country/11-long-haul/35-argentina/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the most surprising facts is that the percentage that internet contributes to Argentina’s Gross National Product (2.2%) ranks 10th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Internet aportará u$s24.700 millones al PBI de la Argentina en 2016 |date=May 3, 2012 |language=Spanish |url=https://www.infobae.com/2012/05/03/645695-internet-aportara-us24700-millones-al-pbi-la-argentina-2016/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505141837/http://www.infobae.com/notas/645695-Internet-aportara-us24700-millones-al-PBI-de-la-Argentina-en-2016.html |archive-date=May 5, 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">A '''statistical business register''' (SBR) plays a central part in a system of official economic statistics at a [[national statistics office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/coded_files/RITZEN_Jean_SBR.pdf|title=Statistical Business Register: Content, place and role in Economic Statistics.|last=Ritzen|first=Jean|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Netherlands|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[company register]] has a different purpose: protection, accountability and control of legal entities.

== Register contents ==

=== Data sources ===

Countries use whatever data sources they seem relevant. E.g. they often integrate a [[company register]] in one form or another.

=== Type of business units ===
In EU a corresponding regulation define register contents:

* all enterprises carrying on [[Types of business entity|economic activities]] contributing to the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and their local units
* the legal units of which those enterprises consist
* enterprise groups

=== Characteristics ===

* identification properties
** identification number
** name
** address
** contact info
** VAT number
* dates of creation/liquidation
* main activity
* operational status
* legal form
* links to other registries
* links to other organizations or structural units
* control
* ownership
* employees

== Business registries in the world ==

[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] provides Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers which describes the roles of the statistical business register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org:8080/index.php?id=40574&amp;L=0|title=Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers|last=|first=|date=|website=Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers|publisher=UNECE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Harder They Fall''''' is a 1956 [[boxing]] [[film noir]] directed by [[Mark Robson]] and based on [[Budd Schulberg]]'s 1947 novel. It marked [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s final film role.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Hal. {{Allmovie title|id=21565|title=The Harder They Fall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black and White]] for [[Burnett Guffey]] at the [[29th Academy Awards]]. [[Joseph Ruttenberg]] for [[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]], however, got the award.

==Plot==
Sportswriter Eddie Willis is broke after the newspaper he works for goes under. He is hired by boxing promoter Nick Benko. He recruits Toro Moreno, an Argentinian boxer. Unbeknownst to Toro and his manager Luís Agrandi, all of his fights had been fixed to make the public believe that he is for real. Toro challenges Gus Dundee, a champion boxer who died of a brain hemorrhage, after losing to Buddy Brannen. Eddie hesitates to promote Toro. Despite the misgivings of his wife, Benko convinced him otherwise, due to Eddie's attempted pay-day. Feeling guilty, Toro wishes to return to Argentina, but Eddie convinces him to work together. In the meantime, Benko plans to use Toro and places the bet against any champion boxers. Eddie teaches Toro on how to hit one of the handlers. While fighting with Brannen, Toro ends up having a broken jaw. When Eddie takes the money owed to him and Toro, he finds out that Benko has rigged the accounting and Toro earns $49.07. Ashamed, Eddie sends Toro home to Argentina with their share of the proceeds, $26,000. Eddie writes the exposure about the corruption.

==Production==
In early 1956, Bogart was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and he died on January 14, 1957. Steiger said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bogey and I got on very well. Unlike some other stars, when they had closeups, you might have been relegated to a two-shot, or cut out altogether. Bogey didn't play those games. He was a professional and had tremendous authority. He'd come in exactly at 9am and leave at precisely 6pm. I remember once walking to lunch in between takes and seeing Bogey on the lot. I shouldn't have because his work was finished for the day. I asked him why he was still on the lot, and he said, 'They want to shoot some retakes of my closeups because my eyes are too watery'. A little while later, after the film, somebody came up to me with word of Bogey's death. Then it struck me. His eyes were watery because he was in pain with the cancer. I thought: 'How dumb can you be, Rodney'!"{{sfn|Fantle|Johnson|2009|p=140}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film was released with two different endings: one where Eddie Willis (inspired by Harold Conrad) demanded that boxing be banned altogether, and the other where he merely insisted that there be a federal investigation into boxing. The video version contains the "harder" ending, while most television prints end with the "softer" message. Occasionally inaudible in a take, some lines are reported to have been dubbed in post-production by [[Paul Frees]].&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Hal. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film premiered at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3643/year/1956.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Harder They Fall|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic, [[Bosley Crowther]], liked the film, writing, "It's a brutal and disagreeable story, probably a little far-fetched, and without Mr. Schulberg's warmest character—the wistful widow who bestowed her favors on busted pugs. But with all the arcana of the fight game that Mr. Yordan and Mr. Robson have put into it—along with their bruising, brutish fight scenes—it makes for a lively, stinging film."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900E3DE1E3CE03BBC4852DFB366838D649EDE Crowther, Bosley], ''[[The New York Times]],'' film review, May 10, 1956. Accessed: August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Schwartz wrote, "The unwell Bogie's last film is not a knockout, but his hard-hitting performance is terrific as a has-been sports journalist out of desperation taking a job as a publicist for a fight fixer in order to get a bank account ... The social conscience film is realistic, but fails to be shocking or for that matter convincing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~ozus/hardertheyfall.htm Schwartz, Dennis], ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews,'' film review, December 17, 2004.

'''Thomas Bryan Martin''' (1731–1798) was an 18th-century [[English American]] land agent, justice, legislator, and planter in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later [[U.S. state]]) of Virginia and in present-day West Virginia. Martin was the land agent of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] for his uncle [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1693–1781) and served two terms in the [[House of Burgesses]].

Martin was born in [[Kent]] in 1731, and was the grandson of [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] (1657–1710) through his mother, Frances Fairfax Martin. Raised in humble surroundings in England, Martin relocated to Virginia in 1751 to assist his uncle, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax), in administering the Northern Neck Proprietary, which encompassed up to {{convert|5000000|acre|km2}}. Martin resided with his uncle on their frontier [[Greenway Court, Virginia|Greenway Court]] estate in present-day [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke County]], Virginia. He earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature and loyalty, and through Martin's growing influence Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations to Greenway Court in 1762 and made Martin steward and land agent of the proprietary.

Martin took an active role in political and civil affairs within the proprietary's domain. He served as a [[vestryman]] for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Frederick Parish, and upon the creation of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] in 1754, he presided as the county's first justice and was further appointed the County Lieutenant. He later represented Hampshire County in the House of Burgesses from 1756 to 1758 and serving with [[George Washington]], represented [[Frederick County, Virginia|Fredrick County]] from 1758 until 1761. Martin was appointed a trustee of the frontier towns of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephensburg]] (present-day Stephens City), and [[Berkeley Springs, West Virginia|Bath]] (present-day Berkeley Springs). He was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia. Though not in the best of health, Martin was relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources in response to Native American attacks. Following the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Martin refused reappointment by Governor [[Patrick Henry]] as a justice of the Frederick County Commission of Peace. Afterward, Martin retreated from civil service entirely, and retired to Greenway Court.

He maintained a low profile during the war, and his uncle Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration despite being the only resident [[Peerage|peer]] in the American colonies. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin's brother Reverend Denny Martin Fairfax inherited the Northern Neck Proprietary, and Martin was given the Greenway Court estate. He took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress and died unmarried in 1798. Martin bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} to his housekeeper Betsy Powers. Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly maintain the proprietary and conveyed the remaining lands in 1797, thus terminating the Fairfax and Martin families' interests in the proprietary before it was formally dissolved in 1806. The city of [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], was named for Martin by his friend [[Adam Stephen]].

Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) owned the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]] [[land grant]], which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719.&lt;ref name="Munske1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UVA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carter.lib.virginia.edu |title=The Diary, Correspondence and Papers of Robert "King" Carter of Virginia 1701–1732 |publisher=University of Virginia Library, [[University of Virginia]] |accessdate=January 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207150347/http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/ |archive-date=February 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proprietary constituted up to {{convert|5000000|acre|km2}} of Virginia's [[Northern Neck]] and a vast area spanning west to the [[Potomac River#North Branch Potomac River|North Branch Potomac River]] headwaters.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt; The Northern Neck Proprietary had been awarded by the exiled [[Charles II of England]] to seven of his supporters in 1649, and again in 1688 by official patent.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt; One of these seven supporters, Lord Colepeper, acquired the right to the entire proprietary in 1681, and his grandson, Lord Fairfax, inherited the land grant upon the death of his mother, Katherine Colepeper.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UVA1" /&gt; Lord Fairfax dispatched his first cousin [[William Fairfax]] (1691–1757) to replace [[Robert Carter I]] as the steward and land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary, a position in which Fairfax served until his death in 1757.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=245.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|p=37.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, Martin's uncle Lord Fairfax established himself at his hunting plantation [[Greenway Court, Virginia|Greenway Court]] estate near present-day [[White Post, Virginia|White Post]] in [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke County]] with the intention of administering the proprietary himself.&lt;ref name="Brown1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt; Lord Fairfax had previously reserved this land as his private residence in 1747, then known as "the Quarter".&lt;ref name="Lissandrello2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lissandrello|1975|p=3 of the PDF file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his cousin William Fairfax acting as land agent, Lord Fairfax sought additional assistance in managing the proprietary and scrutinized which of his family members from England would be up to the task.&lt;ref name="Brown1" /&gt; Lord Fairfax first considered his brother Robert, then his brother-in-law Denny Martin, and in 1751, he finally decided upon enlisting the assistance of his twenty-year-old nephew and Denny Martin's son, Thomas Bryan Martin.&lt;ref name="Brown1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GreenwayCourt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An early 19th-century engraving of the main house at [[Greenway Court]]]]
Lord Fairfax sent for Martin, who arrived in Virginia from England aboard the ''Hatley'' on May 24, 1751, accompanied by William Fairfax, who had been seeking an appointment to a position in England.&lt;ref name="Harrison2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2008|p=121.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Fairfax arrived in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], where they dined with Fairfax's fellow [[Virginia Governor's Council]] member John Blair, Sr., and visited the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] and the [[Capitol (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Capitol]] before beginning their journey toward the Northern Neck on May 31.&lt;ref name="Brown2" /&gt; Following his arrival at the Northern Neck Proprietary, Martin settled at Greenway Court with his uncle that autumn.&lt;ref name="Tyler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison2" /&gt; Due to his humble upbringing, Martin quickly adapted to frontier life at Greenway Court.&lt;ref name="Brown3" /&gt; He soon earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature, his loyalty, and his good eyesight, which greatly assisted his [[myopia|myopic]] uncle.&lt;ref name="Brown3" /&gt; On May 21, 1752, shortly after Martin had come of age on his twenty-first birthday, Lord Fairfax granted Greenway Court to his nephew, along with {{convert|8840|acre|km2}} of limestone lands on the west bank of the [[Shenandoah River]] across from Leeds Manor, which were "to be known and called by the name of the Manor of Greenway Court" and subject to an annual [[quit-rent]] fee of "a good buck and doe" due on the feast day of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]].&lt;ref name="Harrison6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|p=38.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenway Court had taken its name from the Culpeper family's manor in Kent.&lt;ref name="Harrison6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison3" /&gt;

Desiring a larger role for himself in the proprietary's administration, Martin sought to influence his uncle into reorganizing the management of the proprietary.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt; At Martin's suggestion, Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations {{convert|56|mi|km}} northwest from [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]] to an expressly built land office depository and archive at Greenway Court in 1762.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lissandrello1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lissandrello|1975|p=2 of the PDF file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this move, a small land office had been in operation at Greenway Court.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt; Following William Fairfax's death in 1757, his son [[George William Fairfax]] (1729–1787) had succeeded him as steward and land agent of the proprietary.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt; Martin succeeded Fairfax as the steward and land agent of the proprietary in 1762.&lt;ref name="Tyler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt; Fairfax's replacement by Martin, the transfer of the land office and Martin's increased influence over Lord Fairfax caused bitter feelings from George William Fairfax, as evidenced by his letters during this period.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt; Fairfax and his wife [[Sally Fairfax|Sally Cary Fairfax]] returned to England in 1773 prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]] and did not return afterward.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt;

While residing at Greenway Court, Martin would have preferred more comfortable quarters than the rustic estate, as their living situation there was originally supposed to have been only temporary until the construction of a grander estate.&lt;ref name="Harrison2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=354.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, Martin wrote that plans for further construction and improvements at Greenway Court "remain in status quo and in quo state they are likely to remain, ...we are building castles, tho' not on earth where one is greatly wanted, but castles in the air."&lt;ref name="Russell2" /&gt; Martin's uncle Robert Fairfax remarked on the primitive life at Greenway Court among "strange, brutish people... past all conception".&lt;ref name="Russell2" /&gt; For the next thirty years, until Lord Fairfax's death in 1781, Martin remained at Greenway Court and shared in the loneliness and solitude of his "self-exiled" uncle.&lt;ref name="Harrison3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=481.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While established at Greenway Court, Martin engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1768, Martin described tobacco as the crop "which is our all".&lt;ref name="Hofstra1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstra|1999|p=25.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other planters and farmers in the Shenandoah Valley, Martin had transitioned to the farming of wheat by 1792, at which time he wrote to his brother in England, "Are you all starving that you give such prices for our flour; farming is now my object."&lt;ref name="Hofstra1" /&gt;

== Political and civic affairs ==
In addition to his management of the proprietary, Martin began taking an active role in political and civil affairs within his uncle's domain. Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752, the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish [[Vestryman|vestrymen]] before June 15 of that year.&lt;ref name="Cartmell6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=181.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was elected as a vestryman, alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax and [[Gabriel Jones (Virginia)|Gabriel Jones]].&lt;ref name="Cartmell6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|p=55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about expanding and enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish.&lt;ref name="Cartmell6" /&gt;

In 1754, upon the creation of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Martin presided as the inaugural justice of the county's court.&lt;ref name="Brannon1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act establishing the county, the first county court was to have been held in June 1754; however, the first court was not held until December 1757.&lt;ref name="Brannon1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kercheval3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=175.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first court to be held was, in addition to Martin, composed of justices James Simpson, William Miller, Solomon Hedges, and Nathaniel Kuykendall with Gabriel Jones serving as the Clerk of Court.&lt;ref name="Kercheval3" /&gt; In 1755, Martin was further appointed as the County Lieutenant of Hampshire County.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt; Martin was then elected alongside Thomas Walker to the [[House of Burgesses]] representing Hampshire County from 1768 to 1758.&lt;ref name="Tyler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munske2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|pp=45–47.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1758, Martin and [[George Washington]] challenged the incumbents and ran for election to represent [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] in the House of Burgesses against Hugh West and Thomas Swearingen.&lt;ref name="Cartmell2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=251.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Longmore1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Longmore|1999|p=57.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Washington received considerable support from Lord Fairfax, and the leading Anglican cleric in Frederick County, William Meldrum.&lt;ref name="Longmore2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Longmore|1999|p=59.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington received the most votes with 310, followed by Martin with 240 votes, 199 votes for West, and 45 votes for Swearingen.&lt;ref name="Cartmell2" /&gt; Martin and Washington served alongside one another representing Frederick County until 1761.&lt;ref name="Munske2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=511.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin chose not to run for reelection and retired from legislative politics in 1761.&lt;ref name="Longmore3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Longmore|1999|p=63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1758, the Virginia General Assembly appointed Martin as one of the trustees of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].&lt;ref name="Norris5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=313.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was further appointed as a trustee of the town of [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephensburg]] (present-day Stephens City).&lt;ref name="Cartmell3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=228.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle Lord Fairfax, John Hite, Gabriel Jones, [[Robert Rutherford (congressman)|Robert Rutherford]], Lewis Stephens, and James Wood were also appointed trustees of the towns alongside Martin.&lt;ref name="Cartmell3" /&gt; When the town of [[Berkeley Springs, West Virginia|Bath]] (present-day Berkeley Springs) received its charter from the Virginia General Assembly in October 1776, Martin was appointed as a trustee alongside [[Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Bryan Fairfax]], Philip Pendleton, Robert Rutherford, [[Samuel Washington]], Warner Washington, [[Alexander White (Virginia)|Alexander White]], and others.&lt;ref name="Cartmell9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kercheval4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=181.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia.&lt;ref name="Tyler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=484.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Martin was not in the best of health, he could be relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources to act promptly during an emergency, especially in response to attacks by Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Russell1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Gott|2008|p=32.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County.&lt;ref name="Norris1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|pp=242–243.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor [[Patrick Henry]], along with William Booth and Warner Washington, but all three men declined to serve another term.&lt;ref name="Norris1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=231.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Norris|1890|p=137.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin did not swear into the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime, initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was a futile effort.&lt;ref name="Norris1" /&gt; The committee had also been actively arresting [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], which may have influenced Martin's decision to turn down his reappointment.&lt;ref name="Norris4" /&gt; Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely, and afterward retired to Greenway Court.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt; Prior to his death, Martin became an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref name="Norris5"/&gt;

== American Revolution and Lord Fairfax's death ==
As a Loyalist, Martin maintained a low profile following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt; By 1778, the Virginia General Assembly had abolished quit-rents, but in recognition of Lord Fairfax's loyalty, the Northern Neck Proprietary was made an exception.&lt;ref name="Russell2" /&gt; Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration by the assembly, and despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies, he was accorded all the privileges of a Virginia citizen.&lt;ref name="Harrison3" /&gt; Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, his will was recorded on March 5, 1782, and conveyed his title to the remnants of his American properties, including the Northern Neck Proprietary, to Martin's elder brother Reverend Denny Martin, who then assumed the surname and coat of arms of Fairfax.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Fairfax devised his property and title to Denny Martin on the condition that he apply to the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] for an act to authorize him to inherit the title of [[Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].&lt;ref name="Kercheval1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=159.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was appointed by his uncle, along with Gabriel Jones and Peter Hog, as an executor of his will and estate.&lt;ref name="Cartmell5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cartmell|1909|p=134.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin inherited the plantation Lord Fairfax had purchased from John Borden consisting of {{convert|600|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Cartmell5" /&gt; Martin was also bequeathed the Greenway Court estate and "all the stock of cattle, sheep, hogs, implements of husbandry, household goods and furniture" there.&lt;ref name="Tyler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell5" /&gt; Martin and his brothers Denny and Philip also inherited all Lord Fairfax's slaves.&lt;ref name="Cartmell5" /&gt; Martin's uncle and Lord Fairfax's brother Robert Fairfax appealed his claim to the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron to Parliament, and succeeded as the 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt;
[[File:Byran-fairfax-00308.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]]]
On account of his residency in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as managers of the proprietary.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt; Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them.&lt;ref name="Norris2" /&gt; The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt; In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784.&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt;

Because Denny Fairfax was a British subject residing in England, he had no legal rights under American jurisdiction; thus, he and his British relatives were considered "alien enemies" and his landholdings were confiscated under [[escheat]] laws.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartmell4" /&gt; In 1785, the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records, books, and documents pertaining to the proprietary's lands be confiscated by the state of Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar's Office in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref name="Cartmell1" /&gt; Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted, and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt; Land values in the Northern Neck continued to increase in value, which Martin noted in a 1790 letter.&lt;ref name="Hofstra2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstra|1999|p=26.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier, which Martin commented: "The emigration of inhabitants is... astonishing."&lt;ref name="Hofstra2" /&gt;

== Later life and death ==
Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress, and fathered a daughter by her.&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt; Mrs. Crawford remained Martin's mistress for several years until her death.&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt; Their daughter married British captain Francis Geldart; however, she died without issue soon after their marriage, and Martin gave Geldart {{convert|1000|acres|km2}} of Greenway Court and a number of slaves.&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt; Following the death of his daughter, Martin employed housekeeper Betsy Powers at Greenway Court.&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt; Martin died unmarried in 1798, and his will dated July 24, 1794, was proved on October 1, 1798.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt; In it, he bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} to his housekeeper Betsy Powers.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt; Powers also inherited "all houses thereon, household goods (except plate and watch), one half of stock of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs and choice of ten slaves".&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt; Martin's living sisters Frances, Sybilla, and Anna Susanna Martin received "all moneys, and remainder of personal property" not bequeathed to Powers.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt; Each of the executors of Martin's will received ten guineas.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt; Martin bequeathed the remainder of his property and the {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of Greenway Court, should Powers have predeceased him, to his will executors Gabriel Jones, Robert Mackey, and John Sherman Woodcock to divide into parcels and sell, the profits from which were to be given to Martin's sisters.&lt;ref name="Kercheval2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=160.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1926|pp=55–56.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powers also received a chariot, harness, and {{convert|160|acres|km2}} in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]] near [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]].&lt;ref name="Harrison8" /&gt; Following Martin's death, Powers married W.&amp;nbsp;Carnagy.&lt;ref name="Kercheval1" /&gt;

Due to his advanced age and his inability to relocate to America, Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly protect and maintain his American possessions and conveyed by deed on August 30, 1797, to [[James Markham Marshall]] "all and every of those divers tracts, pieces and parcels of land, being part and parcel of the proprietary of the Northern Neck of Va., with all beneficial right and interest of whatsoever nature the same may be".&lt;ref name="Cartmell4" /&gt; This conveyance thus terminated the Fairfax and Martin families' interest in the proprietary.&lt;ref name="Harrison5" /&gt; In 1799, the Virginia General Assembly authorized Marshall as the legal titleholder of Fairfax's remaining landholdings.&lt;ref name="Cartmell5" /&gt; The Northern Neck Proprietary was officially dissolved in 1806 when Virginia again became its legal owner.&lt;ref name="Munske1" /&gt;

The legality of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands continued to be contested in state and federal courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Virginia Supreme Court]] upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the [[Jay Treaty]] with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] did not address the disputed proprietary.&lt;ref name="Justia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/11/603/ |title=Fairfax's Devisee v.

Hunter's Lessee]]'', 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court.&lt;ref name="Justia1"/&gt; The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts.&lt;ref name="Justia2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/14/304/ |title=Martin v.

Hunter's Lessee]]'', 14 U.S. 304.&lt;ref name="Justia2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oyez1"/&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law.&lt;ref name="Justia2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oyez1"/&gt; Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] was forced to recuse himself from ruling in ''Martin v. Hunter's Lessee'' as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2014|p=427.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Proprietor [[Adam Stephen]], a close personal friend of Martin, had the town of [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley County]] formally established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1778.&lt;ref name="Norris2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris1" /&gt; Stephen named the town in honor of his friend Martin.&lt;ref name="Harrison7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kercheval5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kercheval|1902|p=182.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vaillancourt Fountain''''', sometimes called '''''Quebec libre!''''',  is a large fountain in [[Justin Herman Plaza]] in [[San Francisco]], designed by the [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] artist [[Armand Vaillancourt]] in 1971. It is about {{convert|40|ft|m}} high and is constructed out of [[precast concrete]] square tubes. Long considered controversial because of its stark, modernist appearance, there have been several unsuccessful proposals to demolish the fountain over the years. It was the site of a free concert by [[U2]] in 1987, when lead singer [[Bono]] spray painted [[graffiti]] on the fountain and was both praised and criticized for the action.

==Location==

The fountain is in a highly visible spot on the downtown San Francisco waterfront, in [[Justin Herman Plaza]], where [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] meets [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|The Embarcadero]].&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; The [[Hyatt Regency San Francisco|Hyatt Regency Hotel]] is at the edge of the plaza, adjacent to the other four highrise towers of the [[Embarcadero Center]]. Across The Embarcadero is the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]], and the eastern end of the [[San Francisco cable car system|California Street cable car line]] is on the other side of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

When Vaillancourt designed the fountain, the elevated Embarcadero Freeway or [[California State Route 480|Interstate 480]], was still in existence along the Embarcadero. The fountain was designed with the freeway environment in mind, but it was built to bring people to an expansive public space, as ''San Francisco Chronicle'' architecture critic John King calls it "an act of defiant distraction until the freeway came down in 1991".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Vaillancourt-Fountain-now-stands-alone-4568877.php |title=Vaillancourt Fountain now stands alone |author=King, John |date=1 June 2013 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC-170815 /&gt;

The fountain is about {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, weighs approximately {{convert|700|ST|MT}}, and is constructed out of [[precast concrete]] square tubes. The fountain is positioned in a pool shaped like an irregular [[pentagon]], and is designed to pump up to {{convert|30,000|USgal|L}} of water per minute.&lt;ref name=Fountains/&gt;

The fountain looks unfinished, like concrete that has not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza "like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open."&lt;ref&gt;Thesis by John Grande, [[Concordia University]], September 1997, [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/tape16/PQDD_0003/MQ40227.pdf ''Armand Vaillancourt's Social Sculpture'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water.&lt;ref name=SFC-170805&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Vaillancourt-Fountain-deserves-respect-and-11735554.php |title=Vaillancourt Fountain deserves respect — and water |author=Desmarais, Charles |date=5 August 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=11 September 2017}}{{subreq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US&amp;nbsp;$310,000. It was dedicated on April 22, 1971.&lt;ref name=Fountains/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that its cost was US&amp;nbsp;$607,800.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

===1987 U2 concert===
[[File:Bono as The Fly Cleveland 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|U2 lead singer Bono]]

On the first leg of [[The Joshua Tree Tour]] by the rock band [[U2]] in 1987, they performed concerts at the [[Cow Palace]] just south of San Francisco on April 24 and April 25, 1987. On the third leg of the tour, concerts had been announced for November 14 and 15, 1987, across the San Francisco Bay, at the [[Oakland Coliseum]].

On the morning of November 11, 1987, local radio stations announced that U2 would hold a free-admission concert that day in Justin Herman Plaza, with the stage set up in front of the Vaillancourt Fountain. Within a few hours, a crowd estimated at 20,000 people gathered in the plaza.&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt; The concert was jokingly called "Save the Yuppies", in reference to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]] that had taken place three weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QsQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5924,5513631| title=Spotlight: Music| newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]| date=November 12, 1987| page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band closed their nine-song performance with their hit "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]".&lt;ref name=sf-mg/&gt; During the instrumental portion in the middle of the song, [[Bono]], lead singer of the band, climbed onto the sculpture and spray painted [[graffiti]] on it, reading "Rock N Roll Stops The Traffic".&lt;!-- See video of performance of "Pride" at e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5qinlKbVOc.

This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself."&lt;ref name=Bryan/&gt; The numerous callers to [[Ronn Owens]]' radio talk show on [[KGO (AM)|KGO-AM]] were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not.&lt;ref name=sfc-side/&gt;  Bono soon apologized,&lt;ref name=sfc-side/&gt; saying "I really do regret it.

Armand Vaillancourt flew from Quebec to California after the incident, and spoke in favor of Bono's actions at U2's Oakland performance several days later.&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{cite book| last =Kootnikoff| first =David|title =U2: A Musical Biography | publisher =[[ABC-CLIO]] | year =2010| location =[[Santa Barbara, California]]| page =67| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=9tw9vnZT4REC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22Vaillancourt+Fountain%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SMFoUdiPNoXmiwKki4G4DQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Vaillancourt%20Fountain%22&amp;f=false| isbn =978-0-313-36523-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillancourt said, "Good for him.

The episode received further attention when it was featured in U2's 1988 documentary film ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.&lt;ref name=sf-mg/&gt; There, footage of it was shown over, and interspersed with, the band's opening number, "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", a song by [[Bob Dylan]] that had been a big hit for [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref name=atu2/&gt; This has led some people to misidentify the song being played when the spray painting occurred.&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt; In any case, the fountain and plaza ended up on one U2 fan site's list of recommended group-related places in the U.S. to visit.&lt;ref name=atu2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.atu2.com/news/u2-lists-top-10-places-u2-fans-must-visit-in-the-usa.html | title=U2 Lists: Top 10 Places U2 Fans Must Visit In The USA| first=Jessica| last=Guadiana

===Demolition proposals===
[[File:Embarcadero View (4879618834).jpg|right|thumb|upright|View of Justin Herman Plaza, ''Vaillancourt Fountain'', and The Embarcadero in 2010 following the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway]]
Following the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]], the elevated Embarcadero Freeway was so badly damaged that it was torn down, and was replaced by a boulevard at ground level. An architect hired by the city also proposed demolition of the fountain,&lt;ref name=DMN/&gt; but no decision was made. 

In 2004, San Francisco Supervisor [[Aaron Peskin]] renewed the call to demolish the fountain.&lt;ref name=dismantle/&gt; The water supply to the fountain had been turned off for several years, because of [[California electricity crisis|California's energy crisis]] of those years.&lt;ref name=dismantle&gt;{{cite news| last =Herel| first =Suzanne| title =Councilman wants to dismantle fountain| newspaper =[[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date =March 16, 2004| url =http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Councilman-wants-to-dismantle-2780809.php| accessdate =April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armand Vaillancourt immediately pledged that he would "fight like a devil to preserve that work".&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; Debra Lahane, a member of the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]], said that "it succeeds as a work of art if it provokes dialogue and discussion. Art that engages the public has had a measure of success."&lt;ref name=fight/&gt; Within a few months, the water was flowing again, and plans to tear down the fountain were abandoned.&lt;ref name=Eccentric/&gt;&lt;ref name=splash&gt;{{cite news|title =Vaillancourt Fountain makes a splash again|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 3, 2004| url =http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Vaillancourt-Fountain-makes-a-splash-again-2736404.php|accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On and off===
[[File:Vallaincourt Fountain (5756455219).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Vaillancourt Fountain'' in operation with interior walkway (2011)]]
At the fountain's opening in 1971, both the water flow and human participation were considered integral to the work. Alfred Frankenstein, writing for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', noted "the heart of the idea is the unique one of public entry into and intimate exploration of the fountain’s innards; in this it is unique and decidedly a success. It is not a great work of sculpture, which is like observing that an automobile is not much of a success as a horse."&lt;ref name=SFC-170805 /&gt;

The water was turned off at the fountain from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US&amp;nbsp;$200,000 per year to operate the fountain.&lt;ref name=splash /&gt; Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city would pay for the operating costs (at a revised estimate of US&amp;nbsp;$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US&amp;nbsp;$20,000 per year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://sfmayor.org/ftp/archive/209.126.225.7/archives/PressRoom_NewsReleases_2004_26517/index.html |title=San Francisco's Vaillancourt Fountain Starts Flowing Again |author= |date=2 August 2004 |publisher=City and County of San Francisco, Office of the Mayor |accessdate=13 September 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604040138/http://sfmayor.org/ftp/archive/209.126.225.7/archives/PressRoom_NewsReleases_2004_26517/index.html |archivedate=4 June 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed.

In reaction to the [[2011–17 California drought]], all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason it had not been reactivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kalw.org/post/hey-area-why-san-franciscos-vaillancourt-fountain-dry#stream/0 |author=Klemm, Jürgen |title=Hey Area: Why is San Francisco's Vaillancourt Fountain dry? |date=1 May 2017 |publisher=KALW |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US&amp;nbsp;$500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hoodline.com/2017/08/restoring-vaillancourt-fountain-would-cost-500k-or-more |title=Restoring Vaillancourt Fountain Would Cost $500K Or More |author=Sisto, Carrie |date=9 August 2017 |newspaper=Hoodline |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Desmarais]], the current art critic of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' echoed Frankenstein's comments from 1971, calling for the water to return in an August 2017 opinion article:
{{quote|text=[T]he water is as essential to [''Vaillancourt Fountain''] as it was superfluous to [the nearby ''[[Mechanics Monument]]'']. Vaillancourt is a sprawling, lifeless skeleton in its current dry state, with a chain-link fence blocking the two sets of stairs that once allowed people to peer down into the roiling maelstrom below. The chain of island-like steppingstones that made visitors feel they were walking on water is now a gantlet of precarious pedestals several feet above a rock-hard floor.

At the time of its dedication, the San Francisco chapter of the [[National Safety Council]] said that the fountain "may be a safety hazard".&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news| title =Safety Group Hits Fountain| newspaper =[[Los Angeles Times]]| date =May 3, 1971

An early comment by architecture critic [[Allan Temko]], often repeated over the years, describes "technological excrescences" that had been "deposited by a giant concrete dog with square intestines".&lt;ref name=Temko/&gt; Another pithy remark that gained press attention, from critic Lloyd Skinner, was that the fountain was "Stonehenge, unhinged, with plumbing troubles".&lt;ref name=UPI-dedic/&gt;

Artists have been critical of the work as well.  Sculptor [[Benny Bufano]] called it "a jumble of nothing", artist Willard Cox likened it to "dynamited debris", and sculptor Humphrey Diaquist said it had been created by "a figure of deranged talent".&lt;ref name=UPI-dedic/&gt; [[Ruth Asawa]] noted in 1989 that "In the attempt to provide a disguise and diversion from the freeway, the goal of the fountain as a work of art was lost."&lt;ref name=SFC-170815 /&gt;

The fountain has been called the "least revered modernist work of art" in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt;  Due to its size, it has been said that it "dominates the landscape" of the north side of Justin Herman Plaza.&lt;ref name=Walking&gt;{{cite book|last =Gans| first =Liz| last2 =Newby| first2 =Rick|title =Walking San Francisco| publisher =[[Globe Pequot Press]]| year =1999| location =[[Guilford, Connecticut]]| page =83| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zokRTbmWoKUC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22Vaillancourt+Fountain%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B8NoUd30H-XbiwKnv4GoBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Vaillancourt%20Fountain%22&amp;f=false| isbn =978-1-56044-706-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been said that the design intent was "to mock and mirror the clumsy, double-decked roadway",&lt;ref name="DMN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D271DF3C6929&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Debate spouts in San Francisco over controversial fountain Artwork impeding redesign of park|last=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 18, 1992|newspaper=[[Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the elevated [[Embarcadero Freeway]] which separated the fountain from the waterfront at the time of construction. 

Charles Birnbaum, noted Halprin expert, stated the architect "always wanted people to interact with his water features" and that Justin Herman Plaza "was intended as a total environment, a space animated by people as well as water", so the fountain was designed to attract the public to an area otherwise cut off from the waterfront by the Embarcadero Freeway.&lt;ref name=SFC-170815 /&gt;

'''Wooster Street''' is a street in [[SoHo, Manhattan]] and [[Greenwich Village]] that runs south to north from [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] to [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/tag/wooster-street/|title=Wooster Street {{!}} Forgotten New YorkForgotten New York|website=forgotten-ny.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a prime location for on-location filming and photo shoots due to its relatively low traffic, and the [[flagstone]] sidewalks and cobblestone street give it an old gritty feel.

== History ==
The street is named after an American Revolutionary War General, [[David Wooster]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://forgotten-ny.com/tag/wooster-street/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The street is home to many boutiques, restaurants (including a branch of the [[Momofuku-Milk Bar|Momofuku Milk Bar]]) and cultural institutions such as [[The Wooster Group]], an [[experimental theater]] company based at the [[Performing Garage]] at 33 Wooster Street.
