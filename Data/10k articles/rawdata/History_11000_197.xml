The '''1992 Coalisland riots''' were a series of clashes on 12 and 17 May 1992 between local [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] civilians and [[British Army]] soldiers (of the [[3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment|Third Battalion of the Parachute Regiment]]&lt;ref name=ecn&gt;[[The economist]], Volume 323, Issues 7761-4&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]]) in the town of [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland. The Third Battalion 1992 tour's codename was "'''Operation Gypsy'''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/infantry/parachute-regiment-2/parachute-regiment-3rd-bn.html British Army 1945 on locations and dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisional IRA attack==
On 12 May 1992, a unit of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade|East Tyrone Brigade]] launched a bomb attack on a British Army patrol near the republican stronghold of [[Cappagh, County Tyrone|Cappagh]], County Tyrone. One soldier of the Parachute Regiment, Alistair Hogdson,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/paratrooper-who-lost-legs-is-british-191964 Alistair Hogdson profile], mirror.co.uk; accessed 3 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cumbria/8458700.stm Cumbrian amputee claims skydiving honour] BBC News, 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David (1998). ''Paras: an illustrated history of Britain's airborne forces''. Sutton, p. 197; {{ISBN|0750917237}}&lt;/ref&gt; lost both legs as a result. The landmine was described in an IRA statement as an "anti-personnel device".&lt;ref name=may&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37019&amp;Itemid=18 "New Paratroop controversy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312034618/http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37019&amp;Itemid=18 |date=12 March 2012 }}, emigrant.ie, 18 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered a rampage by members of the Parachute Regiment in the nearby, overwhelmingly [[Irish nationalist]] town of [[Coalisland]], some ten miles to the east.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"British troops launch charm attack in Belfast", by Peter Millership, [[Reuters]], 8 August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bound/&gt; The IRA attack was described as a "provocation" tactic, devised to produce an over-reaction by troops to make them even more unpopular among local nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, C.J.M. (1998). ''Terrorists' Target Selection''. Palgrave Macmillan, p. 41; {{ISBN|0-312-21197-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment of the paratroopers, which began in April&lt;ref name=ecn/&gt;&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; had already been criticised by republican activist and former Member of Parliament [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]], who denounced beatings, shootings and damages to property reportedly carried out by the troops.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/3539 "British army terrorises Irish town"], Greenleft.org, 1 July 1992.&lt;!--very POV source so text should be reworded for NPOV--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These previous incidents included the destruction of fishing boats and equipments &lt;!-- what are "equipments"? --&gt;in the townland of Kinturk, near [[Ardboe]].&lt;ref name=green/&gt; [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] politician and [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] officer [[Ken Maginnis, Baron Maginnis of Drumglass|Ken Maginnis]], then-[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for the area, called for the withdrawal of the regiment after receiving a large number of complaints about their behaviour.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline (1997). ''The origins of the present troubles in Northern Ireland''. Longman, pg. 164; {{ISBN|0-582-10073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The confrontation==

===12 May===
Two hours after the IRA attack, members of the regiment sealed off the town of Coalisland, ten miles east of Cappagh. According to a [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) politician,&lt;!--no name provided by cited source--&gt;&lt;ref name="may"/&gt; the soldiers fabricated a bogus bomb warning, while the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) stated that the operation began when a joint police/military patrol was stoned by a crowd.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;&lt;ref name=woods&gt;Wood, Ian S. (1994). ''Scotland and Ulster''. Mercat Press, p. 161; {{ISBN|1-873644-19-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two pubs were ransacked by the troops&lt;ref name=cain&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch92.htm#May CAIN −1992 chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of civilian cars were damaged. Several people were allegedly hit with sticks. Following this, a lieutenant was suspended from duty&lt;ref name=may/&gt; and the regiment was removed from patrol duties in Coalisland.&lt;ref name=fort/&gt;

===17 May===
On the evening of 17 May, a fist-fight began at Lineside Road, where a group of young men were having a drink. A passing four-man patrol of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]] (KOSB) regiment was challenged to a 'boxing match' by the residents.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The soldiers set aside their weapons and engaged the youths. Injuries were reported on both sides, none critical. The official claim was that the patrol was attacked by a mob&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; of at least 30 people.&lt;ref&gt;Alsing-Børgesen, Kai (1993). ''The Lift: Basisbog for Hf Og Gymnasiet''. Gyldendal Uddannelse, p. 134; {{ISBN|8700106984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the melée, a rifle and a [[GPMG|light machine gun]] were stolen. The rifle was later recovered nearby.&lt;ref name=fort&gt;''Fortnight'' issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 6&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The youths smashed a [[Clansman (military radio)|backpack radio]] which had been left behind by the troops.&lt;ref name=rib&gt;McAliskey, Bernardette (1992). ''The Moral of Coalisland''. Spare Rib (issues 231–39), p. 47&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Two KOSB soldiers were hospitalised.&lt;ref name=may/&gt;

The Parachute Regiment was called to the scene again, and at 8:30 PM, a major riot started outside The Rossmore pub&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; between local people and about 20 to 25 paratroopers.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The soldiers claimed one of their colleagues was isolated and dragged by the crowd. Some witnesses claimed paratroopers were in a frenzy, showing their guns and inviting civilians to try to take them. Suddenly, shots were fired by the troops —first into the air and then towards the people outside the pub. Three civilians were rushed to hospital in [[Dungannon]] with gunshot wounds, while the soldiers returned to their barracks.&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; Another four civilians suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt; One of the wounded was the brother of IRA volunteer Kevin O'Donnell, who had been killed by the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) in February during an [[Clonoe ambush|ambush at the nearby hamlet of Clonoe]], shortly after carrying out a machine-gun attack on the local RUC base.&lt;ref name=rib/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Coalisland - geograph.org.uk - 275069.jpg|thumb|220px|One of the roads to Coalisland centre, which was blocked by British paratroopers on 12 May 1992]]
About 500 people attended a protest rally in Coalisland on 19 May, and the wisdom of deploying the troops to patrol the town was questioned by members of the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] in Dublin. The  [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[David Andrews (Irish politician)|David Andrews]], asked the British Government to withdraw the regiment. As a result, the paratroopers were redeployed outside the urban areas.&lt;ref name=may2&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37020&amp;Itemid=18 ''The Irish Emigrant''], "Paratroopers remain in North". Issue No. 277, 25 May 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=su/&gt; The RUC claimed that the stolen machine gun was found 11 days later at Cappagh, along with another light machine gun and an [[AK-47]] rifle.&lt;ref&gt;''Fortnight'', issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans questioned whether the weapon had really been stolen, suggesting this was merely an excuse for the soldiers' rampage in Coalisland.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;&lt;ref name=rib/&gt; British officials accused [[Sinn Féin]] of being the instigators of the riots,&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; while [[Michael Mates]], then [[Minister of State]] at the [[Northern Ireland Office]], stated that the incidents were due to "a gang of thugs motivated by the IRA".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1992-05-21/Orals-1.html House of Commons, Thursday, 21 May 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the battalion's 1992 tour in Northern Ireland was scaled down, with the patrols suspended before the official end of the deployment. The Third Brigade's commander, Brigadier Tom Longland,&lt;ref name=usa&gt;Irish America (1992), Irish Voice, Inc., volume 8&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced by Brigadier Jim Dutton.&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=su&gt;Wood, Ian S.

The last patrol took place on 27 June, when two paratroopers drowned while crossing the [[River Blackwater, Ulster|River Blackwater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationbanner.com/roh/default.asp?MonthAsNumber=6 Operation Banner Deaths: Roll of Honour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930162715/http://www.operationbanner.com/roh/default.asp?MonthAsNumber=6 |date=30 September 2011 }}, operationbanner.com; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fortnight, issues 302-12, Fortnight Publications, 1992, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, there were further clashes with local residents, this time in the town of [[Cookstown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1992.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1992 – [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] news, 27 June 1992], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six soldiers faced criminal charges for their roles in the May riots,&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ulster-soldiers-to-face-charges-1554277.html The Independent], 29 September 1992&lt;/ref&gt; but were acquitted one year later. Five were [[bind over|bound over]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fortnight'', Issues 324-34, Fortnight Publications, 1994&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice McHugh, the presiding magistrate, averred that the soldiers were "not entirely innocent", while Sinn Féin sources dubbed the ruling "a farce". Dungannon priest Father [[Denis Faul]] was of the opinion that the soldiers should have been charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=bound&gt;[[David McKittrick|McKittrick, David]].  [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/coalisland-soldiers-not-entirely-innocent-five-paratroopers-bound-over-by-court-2323551.html "Coalisland 'soldiers not entirely innocent': Five paratroopers bound over by court"], independent.co.uk, 18 May 1993; accessed 17 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Andrew Sanders and Ian S.

[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Armenia)|Armenia’s Foreign Ministry]] confirmed and condemned Azerbaijan’s actions at the border as "unacceptable and irresponsible steps aimed at escalating the situation". They also said that "it is regrettable but at the same time very predictable practice of Azerbaijan to exploit any display of goodwill and humanistic approach [from] Armenia for its own propagandistic purposes". They also warned that "any provocative action on the Azerbaijani side will be immediately stopped and will trigger the adequate response from the Armenian side".&lt;ref name="ocnakhchevan"/&gt;

== Background ==
Armenian forces seized control of [[Günnüt|Gyunnyut]], which is located [[Sharur District]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]], in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GÜNNÜT KƏNDİ 26 İLDƏN SONRA İŞĞALDAN AZAD OLUNUB|url=http://cbc.az/az/az/v_story/gnnt-knd-26-ldn-sonra-aldan-azad-olunub|publisher=cbc.az|accessdate=20 June 2018|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2018 [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Ilham Aliyev]] visited the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]]. He stated that Nakhchivan branch of the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces|Azerbaijani Army]] possessed missiles which could easily reach [[Armenia]]'s capital, [[Yerevan]].&lt;ref name="sputnik-nakhchivan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sputnik.az/news/20180516/415335809/ilham-eliyev-naxchivandadir.html |title=Prezident İlham Əliyev Naxçıvanda səfərdədir |location=Baku |date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |publisher=[[Sputnik (news agency)|sputnik.az]] |language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on 17 May Armenia's new [[Defence minister of Armenia|Minister of Defence]] and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Armenia)|Foreign Affairs]] visited the [[Armenia]]n–[[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] border to inspect military positions.&lt;ref name="am-defence-minister"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mil.am/en/news/5289 |title=Defence minister visits south-western sector of borderline |location=Yerevan |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |publisher=[[Defence minister of Armenia|Armenian Ministry of Defence]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clashes ==
According to some Azerbaijani military bloggers and news sites, Azerbaijani positions in the [[Sharur District]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] became exposed to artillery fire of the [[Armed Forces of Armenia|Armenian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="ocnakhchevan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oc-media.org/azerbaijan-makes-territorial-gains-in-nakhchivan/ |title=Azerbaijan ‘makes territorial gains’ in Nakhchivan |date=12 June 2018 |accessdate=30 June 2018 |publisher=oc.media.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On next day, [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani Army]] concluded that a counter-attack is necessary. With an order of the [[Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan|Defence Minister]] [[Zakir Hasanov]], Nakhchivan Separate Combined-arms Army launched an offensive operation near Gyunnyut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputnik.az/azerbaijan/20180608/415715553/daha-bir-kend-isgaldan-azad-olundu.html|title=Azərbaycan ordusu daha bir kəndi işğaldan azad etdi - RƏSMİ|date=8 June 2018|accessdate=21 June 2018|publisher=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik.az]]|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; In result, according to [[Media of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani media]], Azerbaijan regained 110 or 10 km² of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musavat.az/xeber/11-min-hektar-erazi-ve-gunnut-kendi-azad-edildi-video-66648 |title=11 min hektar ərazi və Günnüt kəndi azad edildi - Video |date=8 June 2018 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |publisher=[[musavat.az]] |language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{COI source|date=October 2018}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018|reason=It is published by a party of conflict, not an independent side}}

== Aftermath ==
Gyunnyut clashes were the largest military confrontation on the [[line of contact]] between the [[Armenian-Azerbaijani border conflict|Armenian and Azerbaijani]] troops since [[2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes|April War]] that ended on 5 April 2016. There are various speculations about the beginning of the operation. Azerbaijani military experts accused [[Armenia]] of planning an attack on [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hərbi ekspert: Laçın yoluna nəzarət işğaldan qurtulmaq üçün addımdır|url=https://oxu.az/war/262525|publisher=oxu.az|accessdate=20 June 2018|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2018 [[Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defence]] reported the death of infantryman Adil Tatarov who died while "carrying out an official assignment on the border of [Nakhchivan] and Armenia".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4802">[[File:Alexander Balan 1.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Monument to Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan]]
'''Aleksandar Stoyanov Teodorov-Balan''' ({{lang-bg|Александър Стоянов Теодоров-Балан; 27 October 1859 &amp;ndash; 12 February 1959}}) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[linguist]], [[historian]] and [[bibliographer]].

Balan was born in the village of Kubey, Russian Empire, today [[Chervonoarmiyske]], [[Odessa Oblast]], [[Ukraine]], to a [[Bessarabian Bulgarians|Bessarabian Bulgarian]] family. The Bulgarian general [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]] was his brother. Balan studied in [[Prague]] and [[Leipzig]] graduating in [[Slavistics]] from the [[Charles University in Prague]]. In 1884 he settled in [[Sofia]], the capital of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], spending four years working for the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment. He became professor of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[ethnography]] and [[dialectology]] and [[history of the Bulgarian language]], since 1893 head of the Bulgarian and Slavic literature department of the High Pedagogical School (the future [[Sofia University]]). On 29 January 1889, he was elected the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university and reelected several times (1896–1897, 1902–1903); he was also dean of the Faculty of History and Philosophy (1899–1900, 1904–1905).

In the late 19th and early 20th century, he was secretary of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], and from 1939 on he was ''[[doctor honoris causa]]'' of the Sofia University, as well as an active member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. From 1907 to 1910 he was also the head secretary of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]]. Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan was also among the founders of the [[tourism|tourist]] movement in Bulgaria, a long-standing chairman of the Bulgarian Tourist Association and editor of the ''Bulgarian Tourist'' magazine. In addition, he was also Grand Master of the Grand [[Masonic Lodge]] of Bulgaria.

Among his most important scientific contributions ranks his work on [[Bulgarian grammar]], the peculiarities of Bulgarian [[phonology]], his struggle against [[loanword]]s ([[linguistic purism]]), the enrichment of the language using dialectal words. He also published works in the field of literary history. Some of his publications (including posthumous) include:

* A study on ''[[Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya|Slavonic-Bulgarian History]]'', [[Plovdiv]], 1898
* ''[[Sophronius of Vratsa]]'', Sofia, 1906
* ''[[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]]. Passionals'', Sofia, 1920
* ''New Bulgarian grammar'', Sofia, 1940
* ''Struggle for modern orthography (1921-1923)'', Sofia, 1924
* ''New Bulgarian grammar for everyone'', Sofia, 1958
* ''Selected works'', Sofia, 1987
* ''A book about myself'', Sofia, 1988

Balan's scientific legacy amounts to 886 titles, including books, studies, articles and notes, of which 310 devoted to the Bulgarian language, as well as many successful [[neologism]]s. Despite his numerous contributions, Balan lived in relative poverty, with his [[French people|French]] wife often suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. Balan survived to almost [[centenarian]] age, he died in Sofia on 12 February 1959.

[[Balan Ridge]] on [[Alexander Island]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after Aleksandar Balan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136895 SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica:] Balan Ridge.&lt;/ref&gt; as is the [[Sofia Metro]]'s [[Akademik Aleksandar Teodorov - Balan Metro Station]] in the [[Mladost, Sofia|Mladost]] district.

'''Bagrat Arshaki Ulubabyan''' ({{lang-hy|Բագրատ Արշակի Ուլուբաբյան}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Баграт Аршакович Улубабян}}; December 9, 1925 – November 19, 2001) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] writer and historian, known most prominently for his work on the histories of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and [[Kingdom of Artsakh|Artsakh]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Ulubabyan was born in the village of Mushkapat in the [[Martuni Rayon|Martuni]] region of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO), [[Azerbaijan SSR]], on December 9, 1925. In 1944, he graduated from [[Shusha]]'s [[Pedagogical]] Institute. Two years later, he received his degrees in [[Armenian language]] and [[Armenian literature]] from [[Baku]]'s Pedagogical Institute. From 1949 until 1967, he returned to Nagorno-Karabakh and was the head of the province's [[USSR Union of Writers|Writers Union]]. During those years, he was also a writer for the Armenian language newspaper ''Sovetakan Gharabagh'' (''Soviet Karabakh'') and a deputy to the head of NKAO's executive committee. In 1968, Ulubabyan moved from the NKAO to [[Yerevan]], the capital of the [[Armenian SSR]], and in the following year, became a senior researcher in the history department at the [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} Anon. ''"Ուլուբաբյան, Բագրատ Արշակի"'' (Ulubabyan, Bagrat Arshaki). [[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]. vol. xii. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1986, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works===
Ulubabyan's first works were in the field of poetry. In 1952 and 1956, he completed two works, "Songs about Work and Peace" and "This Morning". He, however, shifted his focus and began writing short stories as well as epics: "[[Aygestan]]" (1960), "Tartar" (1963), "The Grain Never Dies" (1967), and "Lamp" (1976). He also wrote two novels, ''Armenian Land'' in 1959 and ''The Man'' in 1963.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; One of his most prominent works was the historical novel ''[[Battle of Sardarapat|Sardarapat]]''.

Many of Ulubabyan's work concern the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1975, he published ''The Principality of Khachen, From the 10th to 16th centuries'', a political and cultural history of the [[medieval]] [[principality of Khachen]]. In 1979, he published ''A Gold Chain'', a collection of historical essays from the stories of [[Movses Kaghankatvatsi]] until the era of the principalities of Karabakh, depicting the role of Nagorno-Karabakh in the history of Armenia. Several years later, in 1981, he published ''Studies in the History of the Eastern Provinces of Armenia'' and ''[[Gandzasar]]''. More recently, he authored ''A History of Artsakh: From the Beginning Until Our Days'' (1994).&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; Another work on the region, ''The Survival Struggle of Artsakh'', was published in the same year and was a study focusing on the Nagorno-Karabakh during the Soviet era (from 1918 until the 1960s). As an expert in [[Grabar|Classical Armenian]] literature, he translated two works of the 5th-century Armenian chronicler [[Ghazar Parpetsi]], ''A History of Armenia'' and ''A Letter to Vahan Mamikonian'', into Armenian in 1982.

===Later life===
In the late 1980s, with the beginning of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], Ulubabyan took part in the demonstrations in Yerevan which called on Soviet authorities to turn Karabakh over to the control of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk_file/article/53_b.html Excerpts of a speech delivered by Ulubabyan during Karabakh demonstrations]. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia. Accessed May 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, Ulubabyan had also been the author and one of thirteen signatories of a letter sent to Moscow, asking that the Soviet Union to consider Karabakh's incorporation into Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Janyan, Bogdan. "[http://www.hayastan.com/shrjadardz/04september04.pdf Bagrat’s Widow]." ''Shrjadarts.'' September 2004. № 4, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2001, in honor of his work in regards to Armenian history, he was decorated with the Order of Saint [[Gregory the Illuminator]] by the [[Nagorno Karabakh Republic]]'s then-president, [[Arkady Ghukasyan]]. After suffering from a long bout of [[lung disease]], Ulubabyan died on November 19, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Anon.

Retrieved July 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endorsement, recognition and criticism==
In modern academic world Bagrat Ulubabyan is acknowledged as a respected scholar in the field of [[Caucasiology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Among the many scholars currently working in the field of Caucasiology, and whose work has contributed to its emergence as a respected discipline in the modern academic world, we may mention Jahukyan, Diakonoff, Yuzbashian, Harut'yunyan, Melik'-Bakhshyan, Ulubabyan, Mouraviev, and Perikhanian in Russia and Caucasia; Bryer. Winfield, Dowsett, Thomson. Walker, and Sinclair in Great Britain; Mahé, Mouradian. Donabedian, Mutafian, [[Georges Charachidzé|Charachidze]], and the Thierrys in France; Anan-ian, Bolognesi, and Alpago-Novella in Italy; Leloir and Van Esbroeck in Belgium; Assfalg in Germany; Weitenberg in the Netherlands; Schütz in Hungary; Petrowicz in Poland; Stone in Israel; and, in the United States, Garsoïan, Hovannisian, Bardakjian, Kouymjian. Matthews, Aronson. Bournoutian, Maksoudian, Russell, Cowe, Edwards, Suny, Papazian, Terian, Tölölyan, and, among the younger generation, Avdoyan, Marashlian, Der Mugrdechian, Dudwick, Evans, Merian, Taylor, Rapp, and many others too numerous to name here. To the preliminary studies of the pioneering specialists of the early part of this century, which, however dated, remain rich in value and are always worthy of consultation, the present generation of Caucasiologists has added a formidable library of scholarly achievement that includes dictionaries, grammars, bibliographies, histories, geographies, political analyses, literary criticism, anthropological research, demographic and epigraphic studies, collections of colophons, surveys of art and architecture, and, above all, editions and translations of fundamental texts.''
[[Cyril Toumanoff]], Rome November 11, 1995. quoted in: [[Robert H. Hewsen]], Armenia: a Historical Atlas. University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. xi. {{ISBN|0-226-33228-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western scholars, such as [[Robert Hewsen]] or Patrick Donabedian, have extensively used Ulubabyan's research on eastern lands of Armenia, directly or indirectly endorsing his statements and views.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewsen|Hewsen, Robert H]]. ''Armenia: a Historical Atlas''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chorbajian, Levon; Donabedian Patrick; Mutafian, Claude. ''The Caucasian Knot: The History and Geo-Politics of Nagorno-Karabagh''. NJ: Zed Books, 1994, pp. 51–82&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay on the kingdom of Artsakh, Hewsen also referred to Ulubabyan's ''Principality of Khachen'' as an "important work" and suggested it as a supplemental source to readers who are interested in learning more about the region and its medieval history.&lt;ref&gt;Hewsen, Robert H. "The Kingdom of Arc'ax" in ''Medieval Armenian Culture ([[University of Pennsylvania]] Armenian Texts and Studies)''. Thomas J. Samuelian and Michael E. Stone (eds.) [[Chico, California]]: Scholars Press, 1984, p. 55, {{ISBN|0-89130-642-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Russian historian [[Victor Schnirelmann]] considers Ulubabyan as one of several scholars who tried to create an Armenian "myth" of the history of Nagorno-Karabakh. Schnirelmann criticized Ulubabyans contention that in the early Middle Ages the [[Caucasian Albanian]]s populated only the lands to the north of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]], and that despite the traditional point of view according to which the [[Udi people]] represent the descendants of medieval Albanian tribe of Utis, Ulubabyan claimed that the latter were not only Armenicized very early, but were almost originally Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Shnirelman, Viktor A.

The '''Basque Museum of the History of Medicine and Science''' '''Jose Luis Goti''' was founded in 1982 to preserve the historic memory of medicine in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and conserve its scientific heritage. The [[Museum]] is located on the university campus of [[Leioa]] ([[University of the Basque Country]]) and is important in the training of students in the Faculty of Medicine and the students coming from other faculties and schools. Its nowadays director is the professor and doctor [[Anton Erkoreka]]. 

Its permanent exposition comprises approx. 6,000 medical objects of the 19th and 20th centuries arranged, thematically in 24 rooms devoted to different medical specialities: [[folk medicine]], unconventional medicine, [[pharmacy]], weights and measures, [[asepsis]] and [[antisepsis]], [[microscope]]s, laboratory material, X-rays, obstetrics and [[gynaecology]], [[surgery]], [[anesthesia]], endoscope, [[odontology]], [[cardiology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[electrotherapy]], pathological anatomy and natural sciences. 

Teaching and research constitute two of the pillars of the Museum that are complemented with publications and the organization of conferences, lectures and other activities.

'''Benedetto Croce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|tʃ|i}}; {{IPA-it|beneˈdetto ˈkroːtʃe|lang}}; 25 February 1866 – 20 November 1952) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[idealist philosophy|idealist]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]] and [[politician]], who wrote on numerous topics, including [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[historiography]] and [[aesthetics]]. In most regards, Croce was a [[Liberalism|liberal]], although he opposed ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[free trade]] and had considerable influence on other Italian intellectuals, including both [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]]. Croce was President of [[PEN International]], the worldwide writers' association, from 1949 until 1952. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] sixteen times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=2027|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Croce was born in [[Pescasseroli]] in the [[Abruzzo]] region of Italy. His family was influential and wealthy, and he was raised in a very strict Catholic environment. Around the age of 16, he quit Catholicism and developed a personal [[philosophy of life|philosophy of spiritual life]], in which religion cannot be anything but a historical institution where the creative strength of mankind can be expressed. He kept this philosophy for the rest of his life.

In 1883, an earthquake occurred in the village of Casamicciola on the island of [[Ischia]] near [[Naples]], where he was on holiday with his family, destroying the home they lived in. His mother, father, and only sister were all killed, while he was buried for a long time and barely survived. After the earthquake he inherited his family's fortune and—much like [[Schopenhauer]]—was able to live the rest of his life in relative leisure, devoting a great deal of time to philosophy as an independent [[intellectual]] writing from his [[palazzo]] in [[Naples]] (Ryn, 2000:xi&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;).

He studied law, but never graduated, at the [[University of Naples]], while reading extensively on [[historical materialism]]. His ideas were publicized at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] towards the end of the 1890s by Professor [[Antonio Labriola]]. Croce was well acquainted with and sympathetic to the developments in European socialist philosophy exemplified by [[August Bebel]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Paul Lafargue]], [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], and [[Filippo Turati]].

Influenced by Neapolitan-born [[Gianbattista Vico]]'s thoughts about art and history,&lt;ref&gt;Croce, Benedetto 'The Philosophy of [[Giambattista Vico]]' trans R.G.Collingwood London, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; he began studying philosophy in 1893. Croce also purchased the house in which Vico had lived. His friend, the philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]], encouraged him to read [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]. Croce's famous commentary on Hegel, ''What is Living and What is Dead in the Philosophy of Hegel'', was published in 1907.

=== Political involvement ===
As his fame increased, Croce was persuaded, against his initial wishes,{{Verify source|date=November 2012}} to become involved with politics. He was appointed to the Italian Senate, a lifelong position, in 1910 (Ryn, 2000:xi&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;). He was an open critic of Italy's participation in [[World War I]], feeling that it was a suicidal trade war. Though this made him initially unpopular, his reputation was restored after the war. In 1919, he supported the government of [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] while also expressing his admiration for the nascent [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rizi |first1=Fabio Fernando |title=Benedetto Croce and Italian Fascism |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Minister of Public Education between 1920 and 1921 for the 5th and last government headed by [[Giovanni Giolitti]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] assumed power slightly more than a year after Croce's exit from the government; Mussolini's first Minister of Public Education was Giovanni Gentile, an independent who later became a fascist and with whom Croce had earlier cooperated in a philosophical [[polemic]] against [[positivism]]. Gentile remained minister for only a year but managed to begin a comprehensive [[education reform|reform]] of Italian education that was based partly on Croce's earlier suggestions. Gentile's reform remained in force well beyond the Fascist regime, and was only partly abolished in 1962.

Croce was instrumental in the relocation of the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III]] to Naples' [[Royal Palace of Naples|Palazzo Reale]] in 1923.

=== Relations with Fascism ===

Croce initially supported Mussolini's [[Italian Fascism|Fascist government]] that took power in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mack Smith, "Benedetto Croce: History and Politics", ''Journal of Contemporary History'' Vol 8(1) Jan 1973 pg 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the assassination by Fascists of the socialist politician [[Giacomo Matteotti]] in June 1924 shook Croce's support for Mussolini. In May 1925 Croce was one of the signatories to the [[Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals]] which had been written by Croce himself; however, in June of the previous year, he had voted in the Senate in support of the Mussolini government. He later explained that he had hoped that the support for Mussolini in parliament would weaken the more extreme Fascists who, he believed, were responsible for Matteotti's murder.

In 1928, Croce voted against the law which effectively abolished free elections in Italy by requiring electors to vote for a list of candidates approved by the Grand Council of Fascism.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; He became increasingly dismayed by the number of ex-democrats who had abandoned their former principles.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; Croce frequently provided financial assistance to anti-Fascist writers and dissidents such as [[Giorgio Amendola]], [[Ivanoe Bonomi]], and [[Meuccio Ruini]], as well as those who wanted to maintain intellectual and political independence from the regime, and covertly helped them get published.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; Croce's house in Turin became a popular destination for anti-Fascists, and after the war, Amendola along with communists such as Eugenio Reale reflected that Croce offered aid and encouragement to both liberal and Marxist resistance members during the crucial years.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt;  

Croce was seriously threatened by Mussolini's regime, though the only act of physical violence he suffered at the hands of the fascists was the ransacking of his home and library in Naples in November 1926.&lt;ref&gt;See the detailed description in a letter by Fausto Nicolini to Giovanni Gentile published in {{cite book |title=Per invigilare me stesso |first=Gennaro |last=Sasso |authorlink= |publisher=Il mulino |location=Bologna |year=1989 |isbn= |pages=139–40 |page= |accessdate= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he managed to stay outside prison thanks to his reputation, he remained subject to surveillance, and his academic work was kept in obscurity by the government, to the extent that no mainstream newspaper or academic publication ever referred to him. Croce later coined the term ''onagrocrazia'' (literally "government by asses") to emphasize the anti-intellectual and boorish tendencies of parts of the Fascist regime.&lt;ref&gt;It is a disdainful term for misgovernment, a late and satirical addition to [[Aristotle]]'s famous three: [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, in describing Fascism as anti-intellectual Croce ignored the many Italian intellectuals who at the time actively supported Mussolini's regime, including Croce's former friend and colleague, Gentile. Croce also described Fascism as ''malattia morale'' (literally "moral illness"). When Mussolini's government adopted [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies in 1938, Croce was the only non-Jewish intellectual who refused to complete a government questionnaire designed to collect information on the so-called "racial background" of Italian intellectuals.

=== The new Republic ===
In 1944, when democracy was restored in Southern Italy, Croce, as an "icon of [[liberal anti-fascism]]", became minister without portfolio in governments headed by [[Pietro Badoglio]] and by [[Ivanoe Bonomi]] (Ryn, 2000:xi–xii&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;For about a month in the so-called Second Badoglio government and again for a month in the Second Bonomi government.&lt;/ref&gt; He left the government in July 1944 but remained president of the [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] until 1947 (Ryn, 2000:xii&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;).

Croce voted for the Monarchy in the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|Constitutional referendum]] of June 1946, after having persuaded his Liberal party to adopt a neutral stance. He was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] which existed in Italy between June 1946 and January 1948. He spoke in the Assembly against the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Peace treaty]] (signed in February 1947), which he regarded as humiliating for Italy. He declined to stand as provisional [[President of Italy]].

Croce's most interesting philosophical ideas are expounded in three works: ''Aesthetic'' (1902), ''Logic'' (1908), and ''Philosophy of the Practical'' (1908), but his complete work is spread over 80 books and 40 years worth of publications in his own bimonthly literary magazine, ''La Critica'' (Ryn, 2000:xi&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;History as the story of liberty: English translation of Croce's 1938 collection of essays originally in Italian; translation published by [[Liberty Fund Inc.]] in the US in 2000 with a [[foreword]] by [[Claes G. Ryn]]. {{ISBN|0-86597-268-0}} (hardback). See {{harvnb|Croce|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) Croce was philosophically a pantheist, but, from a religious point of view, an [[agnostic]];&lt;ref&gt;La Critica. Rivista di Letteratura, Storia e Filosofia diretta da B. Croce, 1, 1903 p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did publish an essay entitled "Why We Cannot Help Calling Ourselves [[Christians]]". This essay shows the Christian roots of European culture, but religion is considered by Croce a mere propaedeutic study for philosophy, which is the only true science: philosophy is in fact the science of spirit (the "Philosophy of Spirit").

==Philosophy of spirit==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Heavily influenced by [[Hegel]] and other German Idealists such as  [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], Croce produced what was called, by him, the Philosophy of Spirit. His preferred designations were "[[absolute idealism]]" or "absolute historicism". Croce's work can be seen as a second attempt (contra [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]) to resolve the problems and conflicts between [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]] (or sensationalism and transcendentalism, respectively). He calls his way ''immanentism'', and concentrates on the lived human experience, as it happens in specific places and times. Since the root of reality is this immanent existence in concrete experience, Croce places [[aesthetics]] at the foundation of his philosophy.

===Domains of mind===
Croce's methodological approach to philosophy is expressed in his divisions of the spirit, or mind. He divides mental activity first into the theoretical, and then the practical. The theoretical division splits between aesthetic and logic. This theoretical aesthetic includes most importantly: intuitions and history. The logical includes concepts and relations. Practical spirit is concerned with economics and ethics. Economics is here to be understood as an exhaustive term for all utilitarian matters.

Each of these divisions have an underlying structure that colors, or dictates, the sort of thinking that goes on within them. While  Aesthetic is driven by beauty, Logic is subject to truth, Economics is concerned with what is useful, and the moral, or Ethics, is bound to the good. This schema is descriptive in that it attempts to elucidate the logic of human thought; however, it is prescriptive as well, in that these ideas form the basis for epistemological claims and confidence.

==History==
Croce also had great esteem for [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], and shared his opinion that history should be written by philosophers. Croce's ''On History'' sets forth the view of history as "philosophy in motion", that there is no "cosmic design" or ultimate plan in history, and that the "science of history" was a farce.

==Aesthetics&lt;!--'Aesthetic expressivism' redirects here--&gt;==
Croce's work ''Breviario di estetica'' (''The Essence of Aesthetics'') appears in the form of four lessons (''quattro lezioni'') in [[aesthetics]] that he was asked to write and deliver at the inauguration of [[Rice University]] in 1912. He declined an invitation to attend the event, but he wrote the lessons and submitted them for translation so that they could be read in his absence.

In this brief, but dense, work, Croce sets forth his theory of [[art]]. He believed that art is more important than science or metaphysics since only art edifies us. He claimed that all we know can be reduced to imaginative knowledge. Art springs from the latter, making it at its heart, pure imagery. All thought is based in part on this, and it precedes all other thought. The task of an artist is then to invent the perfect image that they can produce for their viewer since this is what beauty fundamentally is&amp;nbsp;– the formation of inward, mental images in their ideal state. Our intuition is the basis for forming these concepts within us.

Croce was the first to develop a position later known as '''aesthetic expressivism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref name=RCA&gt;Berys Gaut and Dominic McIver Lopes, ''The Routledge Companion to Aesthetics'', Routledge, 2002, ch. 11: "Expressivism: Croce and Collingwood."&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that art expresses emotions, not ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetto Croce, ''Breviario di estetica'', 1912: "Not the idea, but the feeling, is what confers upon art the airy lightness of a symbol: an aspiration enclosed in the circle of a representation—that is art." [''Non l'idea, ma il sentimento è quel che conferisce all'arte l'aerea leggerezza del simbolo: un'aspirazione chiusa nel giro di una rappresentazione, ecco l'arte''.]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[R. G. Collingwood]] later developed a similar thesis.)&lt;ref name=RCA/&gt;

Croce's theory was later debated by such contemporary Italian philosophers as [[Umberto Eco]], who locates the aesthetic within a semiotic construction.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''A Theory of Semiotics'' (Indiana University Press, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to liberal political theory==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
Croce's [[liberalism]] differs from the theories advocated by most proponents of liberal political thought, including those in Britain and in the United States of America: while Croce theorises that the individual is the basis of society, he rejects [[Atomism (social)|social atomism]], and while Croce accepts [[limited government]], he disputes the idea that the government should have fixed legitimate powers.

Croce did not agree with [[John Locke]] about the nature of liberty.  Croce believed that liberty is not a [[natural right]] but an earned right that arises out of continuing historical struggle for its maintenance.

Croce defined civilization as the "continual vigilance" against barbarism, and liberty conformed to his ideal for civilization as it allows one to experience the full potential of life.

Croce also rejects [[egalitarianism]] as absurd. In short, his variety of liberalism is [[aristocracy|aristocratic]], as he views society being led by the few who can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty, with the great mass of citizens, simply benefiting from them but unable to fully comprehend their creations (Ryn, 2000:xii&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt;).

In ''Etica e politica'' (1931), Croce defines liberalism as an ethical conception of life that rejects dogmatism and favors diversity, and in the name of liberty and free choice of the individual, is hostile to the authoritarianism of fascism, communism, and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Rizi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rizi |first1=Fabio Fernando |title=Benedetto Croce and Italian Fascism |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |pages=124-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Croce realizes that democracy can sometimes threaten individual liberty, he sees liberalism and democracy as predicated on the same ideals of moral equality and opposition to authority.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; Furthermore, he acknowledged the positive historic role played by the Socialist parties in Italy in their struggles to improve conditions for the working class, and urged modern socialists to swear off dictatorial solutions.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; In contrast to the socialists, who Croce viewed as part of modernity along with liberals, his condemnation of reactionaries is unremittingly harsh.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; 

Croce also draws a distinction between liberalism and capitalism or ''laissez-faire'' economic doctrines.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; For Croce, capitalism only emerged to meet certain economic needs of society, and could be changed or even replaced if better solutions to those needs were found, if it failed to promote freedom, or if economic values clashed with higher values.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; Thus liberalism could welcome socialistic proposals so long as they promoted freedom.&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt; Croce's ideas on the separation between liberalism as an ethical principle and the contingent ''laissez-faire'' economic doctrines which accompanied it in certain contexts would influence Italian social democrats such as [[Leo Valiani]] and [[Giuseppe Saragat]] as well as the [[liberal socialist]] synthesis of [[Carlo Rosselli]].&lt;ref name="Rizi" /&gt;

Komorowski served as [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|Minister of Defence]] from 2000 to 2001. As [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (Speaker of the lower house of Parliament), Komorowski exercised the powers and duties of head of state following the death of President [[Lech Kaczyński]] in a [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|plane crash on 10 April 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=115087|title=Parliament Head Komorowski Becomes Poland President after Kaczynski's Death|work=novinite.com|accessdate=10 April 2010|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Komorowski was then the governing [[Civic Platform]] party's candidate in the resulting [[Polish presidential election, 2010|presidential election]], which he won in the second round of voting on 4 July 2010. He was sworn in as President on 6 August 2010. Komorowski thus became the second person to serve on two occasions as Polish head of state since 1918, after [[Maciej Rataj]]. 
On 25 May 2015, Komorowski conceded the presidency of Poland to the rival candidate [[Andrzej Duda]], after the latter won the second round of [[Polish presidential election, 2015|the 2015 presidential election]].

==Early life and education==
Bronisław Maria Komorowski was born in [[Oborniki Śląskie]]. Born as a son of Zygmunt Leon Komorowski (1925–1992), professor of African Studies at the University of Warsaw and Jadwiga Komorowska (née Szalkowska) {{nowrap|(1921–)}}.&lt;ref name=AS-PS-ZW&gt;Andrzej Stankiewicz, Piotr Śmiłowicz, Zofia Wojtkowska, [http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/polska/bronislaw-komorowski--czlowiek--ktory-plynie-z-pradem,55444,1  "Bronisław Komorowski.

From 1957 to 1959 he lived in [[Józefów]] near [[Otwock]]. From 1959 to 1966 he also attended elementary school in [[Pruszków]]. In 1966 he transferred to [[Warsaw]] and graduated from [[Cyprian Kamil Norwid]] High School no. 24. For many years he was affiliated with the [[Scout Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;He belonged to the 75th Mazovian Scout Team in [[Pruszków]].&lt;/ref&gt; During his studies he was a Scout instructor in 208 WDHiZ "Parasol" Battalion in [[Mokotów]]. He met his future wife through Scouting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bronislawkomorowski.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=12 bronislawkomorowski.pl]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410155324/http://www.bronislawkomorowski.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=12 |date=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 he finished his studies in history at the [[University of Warsaw]]. From 1977 to 1980 he was an editor at the journal ''Słowo Powszechne''.

==Dissident activity==
In the [[People's Republic of Poland]], Komorowski took part in the democratic movement as an [[underground press|underground publisher]] and co-operated with [[Antoni Macierewicz]]&lt;ref name=M-J&gt;Mariusz Janicki, [http://www.polityka.pl/kraj/ludzie/1504592,1,komorowski-bronislaw.read "Komorowski Bronisław.

==Third Republic==
[[File:20070907 sejm rp 100B5101.jpg|thumb|left|Bronisław Komorowski as Deputy Marshal in Sejm, September 2007]]
From 1989 to 1990, he was the manager minister [[Aleksander Hall]]'s office, and from 1990 to 1993, the civil vice minister of national defence in the governments of [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], [[Jan Krzysztof Bielecki]] and [[Hanna Suchocka]]. In the early 1990s he was involved with the [[Democratic Union (Poland)|Democratic Union]] and [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]]. From 1993 to 1995, he was the general secretary of these parties.

[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy in Polish Parliament (2008).JPG|thumb|right|Bronisław Komorowski with [[Lech Kaczyński]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]]]
As a candidate of the Democratic Union he was elected to parliament [[Polish parliamentary election, 1991|in 1991]] and [[Polish parliamentary election, 1993|in 1993]]. In 1997, during the 2nd Sejm, together with a group of Warsaw University activists under the management of [[Jan Rokita]] he created Koło Konserwatywno-Ludowe. In the same year Koło Konserwatywno-Ludowe joined the newly created [[Conservative People's Party (Poland)|Conservative People's Party]] (SKL), which joined [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS). [[Polish parliamentary election, 1997|In September 1997]] Komorowski was elected as a candidate of AWS. From 1997 to 2000 he presided over the Parliamentary National Defence Committee, and from 2000 to 2001 served as the [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|minister of national defence]] in the government of [[Jerzy Buzek]]. In 2001, while still a minister in the minority AWS government, Komorowski, along with some activists from SKL, became a member of [[Civic Platform]] (PO). He stood for [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|election to the 4th Sejm]] as a candidate of PO. Again he was elected, this time for the Warsaw constituency. After the inauguration of the new parliament he resigned from SKL. Since 2001 he has been a member of the National Civic Platform Board. In the 4th Sejm he was the deputy chairman of the Parliamentary National Defence Committee and a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs.

He won [[Polish parliamentary election, 2005|election to the 5th Sejm]] in a district outside [[Warsaw]]. On 26 October 2005, he was elected Vice Speaker of the Sejm. 398 MPs voted in favour of his candidacy. His party had earlier recommended him as a candidate for Speaker. His candidacy, in defiance of precedent, was rejected by [[Law and Justice]] (PiS) which voted for [[Marek Jurek]]. This created an unfavourable climate further discussions regarding a PO-PiS coalition.

After the resignation of Marek Jurek as Speaker of the Sejm on 25 April 2007 Civic Platform announced Komorowski's candidacy for Speaker. On 27 April 2007 the Sejm rejected his nomination, and [[Ludwik Dorn]] from PiS became a new marshal. 189 MPs voted for Komorowski. Komorowski became Vice Speaker.

Komorowski took first place on the PO list for the Warsaw constituency in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]] and received 139,320 votes.

==Marshal of the Sejm==
On 5 November 2007, in the first session of the 4th Sejm of the Polish Republic Bronisław Komorowski was elected Speaker by 292 votes. He stood against [[Krzysztof Putra]] from PiS who received 160 votes. [[Stefan Niesiołowski]], Krzysztof Putra, [[Jarosław Kalinowski]], [[Jerzy Szmajdziński]] were elected Vice Speakers.

On 27 March 2010, he was [[Civic Platform presidential primary, 2010|chosen by PO members]] to be their candidate in [[Polish presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]].

Komorowski became acting president on 10 April 2010 following the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|death of President Lech Kaczyński]]. His first decision was to announce seven days of [[National day of mourning|national mourning]] beginning on 10 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/webBPKS.nsf/pub/EPIA-84DFZC|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713165737/http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/webBPKS.nsf/pub/EPIA-84DFZC|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 July 2012|title=Biuro Prasowe Kancelarii Sejmu|website=Orka.sejm.gov.pl|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Constitution of Poland]], Komorowski was required to set a date for the next presidential election within 14 days of assuming the position, the election date coming within 60 days of that announcement. On 21 April, his office announced that the election would be held on 20 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8633981.stm "Poland's snap presidential elections set for 20 June."] ''[[BBC News]]'', 21 April 2010.

In the runoff Komorowski was elected president (8 933 887 valid votes, 53,01%) and formally took office on 6 August 2010.

Following the death of [[Władysław Stasiak]], the chief of the [[Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland]], Komorowski appointed [[Jacek Michałowski]] to succeed him on an acting basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/12690,1651793,0,1,nowy-szef-kancelarii-prezydenta,wiadomosc.html|title=Nowy szef kancelarii Prezydenta|publisher=[[TVN24]]|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high number of vacancies following the Smolensk crash necessitated numerous other appointments. On 12 April, he appointed retired General [[Stanisław Koziej]] head of the [[National Security Bureau (Poland)|National Security Bureau]] in place of the late [[Aleksander Szczygło]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=ła|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80269,7762298,Gen__Stanislaw_Koziej_nowym_szefem_BBN_u.html|title=Pierwsze decyzje Komorowskiego: Gen.

On 29 April 2010, Komorowski signed into law a parliamentary act that reformed the [[Institute of National Remembrance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arabnews.com/world/article48418.ece |author=Gabriela Baczynska |title=Poland's Komorowski approves shakeup of archive body. |work=[[Arab News]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=21 May 2010 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320113126/http://arabnews.com/world/article48418.ece |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2010, Komorowski nominated [[Marek Belka]], former Finance Minister and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] (2004–2005) of a then-leftist government, to be the [[National Bank of Poland|president of the National Bank of Poland]] in place of the late [[Sławomir Skrzypek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80269,7941888,Komorowski__Marek_Belka_kandydatem_na_prezesa_NBP.html ''Komorowski: Marek Belka kandydatem na prezesa NBP.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522035342/http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80269,7941888,Komorowski__Marek_Belka_kandydatem_na_prezesa_NBP.html |date=22 May 2011 }} gazeta.pl. 27 May 2010.

Following his election, Komorowski announced that he would resign from the Sejm on 8 July 2010, and thus cease to be a marshal and an acting president (his successor as an acting president was the next marshal of the Sejm [[Grzegorz Schetyna]], who held the position for about a month before Komorowski's formal inauguration).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80271,8108088,Krotko_Borusewicz__pozniej_Schetyna__To_oni_beda_kolejno.html Shortly Borusewicz, Schetyna later.

Retrieved 7 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Komorowski currently resides and works in the [[Belweder Palace]] instead of the Presidential Palace.

On 25 May 2015, following his defeat in the second round of the [[Polish presidential election, 2015|2015 presidential election]], Komorowski conceded the presidency to rival [[Andrzej Duda]], after the latter won a 51.5% majority. This was the tightest election of Polish history. His term ended on 6 August 2015, when Duda was sworn in as a new president.

==Personal life==
Komorowski has been married to [[Anna Komorowska|Anna Dembowska]] since 1977. The couple has five children: Zofia Aleksandra (born 1979), Tadeusz Jan (born 1981), Maria Anna (born 1983), Piotr Zygmunt (born 1986) and Elżbieta Jadwiga (born 1989).

'''Camp''' is an [[aesthetic]] style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[irony|ironic]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Babuscio (1993, 20), Feil (2005, 478), Morrill (1994, 110), Shugart and Waggoner (2008, 33), and Van Leer (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Camp aesthetics disrupt many of [[modernism]]'s notions of what art is and what can be classified as [[high art]] by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005"&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick (2005) "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture", ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' Vol.35 №1 pp. 1–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp can also be a social practice. For many it is considered a style and performance identity for several types of entertainment including film, cabaret, and [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallan, Kerry, McGills, Roderick. "Between a Frock and a Hard Place: Camp Aesthetics and Children's Culture". ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' (2005) 35:1 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Where high art necessarily incorporates beauty and value, camp necessarily needs to be lively, audacious and dynamic. "Camp aesthetics delights in impertinence." Camp opposes satisfaction and seeks to challenge.&lt;ref name="Mallan, Kerry 2005" /&gt;

Camp art is related to—and often confused with—[[kitsch]], and things with camp appeal may also be described as "cheesy". When the usage appeared in 1909, it denoted "ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical", or "[[effeminate]]" behaviour, and by the middle of the 1970s, the definition comprised "banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal".&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, 1976 edition, sense 6, [Slang, orig., homosexual jargon, Americanism] banality, mediocrity, artifice, ostentation, etc. so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal&lt;/ref&gt; The American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s essay "[[Notes on 'Camp']]" (1964) emphasized its key elements as: artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and 'shocking' ''excess''. Camp as an aesthetic has been popular from the 1960s to the present.

Camp aesthetics were popularized by filmmakers [[George Kuchar|George]] and [[Mike Kuchar]], [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and his film ''[[Flaming Creatures]]'', and later [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], including the last's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', and ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]''. Celebrities that are associated with camp personas include [[drag queen]]s and performers such as [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[RuPaul]], [[Paul Lynde]], and [[Liberace]]. Camp was a part of the anti-academic defence of [[popular culture]] in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the widespread adoption of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] views on art and culture. Television programs as varied as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', and ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' have been described as camp.

== Origins and development ==
In 1909, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gave the first print citation of ''camp'' as
{{quote|ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical; effeminate or homosexual; pertaining to, characteristic of, homosexuals. So as a noun, 'camp' behaviour, mannerisms, et cetera. (cf. quot. 1909); a man exhibiting such behaviour.}}

[[File:Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Carmen Miranda]] in the trailer for ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]'' (1943)]]

According to the dictionary, this sense is "etymologically obscure". ''Camp'' in this sense has been suggested to have possibly derived from the French term ''se camper'', meaning "to pose in an exaggerated fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=camp (adj.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camp|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm Entry "camper"], in: ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'', ninth edition (1992). "'''2.''' Fam: Placer avec fermeté, avec insolence ou selon ses aises.] ''Il me parlait, le chapeau campé sur la tête.'' Surtout pron. ''Se camper solidement dans son fauteuil. Se camper à la meilleure place. Il se campa devant son adversaire.'' '''3.''' En parlant d'un acteur, d'un artiste: Figurer avec force et relief. ''Camper son personnage sur la scène. Camper une figure dans un tableau, des caractères dans un roman''." ('''Familiar:''' To assume a defiant, insolent or [[wiktionary:devil-may-care|devil-may-care]] attitude. '''Theatre:''' To perform with forcefulness and exaggeration; [[wiktionary:overact|to overact]].{{indent|12}}To impose one's character assertively into a scene; [[wiktionary:upstage|to upstage]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it evolved into a general description of the aesthetic choices and behaviour of working-class homosexual men.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Esther Newton (1978): ''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America'', University Of Chicago Press. {{worldcat|name=''Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America''|oclc=257048012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it was made mainstream, and [[adjective|adjectivized]], by [[Susan Sontag]] in a landmark essay (see below).

The rise of post-modernism made ''camp'' a common perspective on aesthetics, which was not identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[gay]] male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=newton /&gt; Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: [[Swish (slang)|swish]] and [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things "over the top", including women posing as female impersonators ([[faux queen]]s), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of [[Carmen Miranda]]. It was this version of the concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines ''camp'' as "queer parody".&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2010): ''An Archaeology of Posing: Essays on Camp, Drag, and Sexuality'', Macater Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9814924-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moe Meyer (2011): ''The Politics and Poetics of Camp'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-51489-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary culture ==
=== Television ===
Much of the cult following of camp today grew rapidly during the transition from black-and-white to [[colour television]] in the early 1960s. Network programming during that time sought entertainment content that would display the new medium with the use of bright colours and high stylization. The concept of the comicbook [[superhero]] (an individual in a highly stylized, outlandish and possibly impractical costume avenging otherwise serious matters such as murder) could be interpreted as camp. However, since it was aimed initially at children, it is camp only in a secondary perspective. It was not until the 1960s television version of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (one of the more famous examples of camp in popular culture, 1966–1968) that the link was made explicit, with the inherent ridiculousness of the concept exposed as a vehicle for comedy. The villains of series as divergent as ''Batman'' and ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' (1968–1973) were costumed as to take advantage of new colours and changing fashion styles, in ways that took advantage of camp. 

Ironically, even ''Batman'' fell victim to contemporaneous parodies, with the release of ''[[Captain Nice]]'' and ''[[Mister Terrific (TV series)|Mr. Terrific]]'', which layered extra camp onto the already overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of ''Batman'' may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]]'s essay ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' which led to the comics' industry-sponsored [[Comics Code]]), as the ''Batman'' comic books were very dark and [[Film noir|noirish]] until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.

Television series such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1961–1969), ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'' (both 1964–1966), ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964–1967), ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (1965–1968), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1965–1969), ''[[Get Smart (TV series)|Get Smart]]'' (1965–1970), ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' (1972–1985), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976–1981), ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' (1977–1984) and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977–1983) are enjoyed into the 21st century for what are interpreted as their "camp" aspects. Some of these series were developed 'tongue-in-cheek' by their producers.

In a ''[[Monty Python]]'' sketch of their [[Monty Python's Flying Circus|television show]] (Episode 22, "Camp Square-Bashing", repeated in their film ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', 1971), the British Army's 2nd Armoured Division has a Military "Swanning About" Precision Drill unit in which soldiers "camp it up" in unison.

TV soap operas, especially those that air in primetime, are often considered camp. The over-the-top excess of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978–1991)  and ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (1981–1989) were popular in the 1980s. The Channel 4 series ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]'' (1993–2004) was a television programme produced using the inherent ridiculousness of its subject matter for comedic effect, often using camp dubbing in regional accents and overexaggerated stereotypical characterisations (such as an aristocratic artist based on [[Brian Sewell]]) to puncture the interviewees' pretence of seriousness. However, an obituary to [[Lolo Ferrari]] was given straight dubbing as a mark of respect at odds with its irreverence. However, the subject matter would have offended many British viewers and fallen foul of [[OFCOM]] if it was done with any seriousness. Again, this is an example of doing a programme in a camp manner to get around the likelihood of censorship. [[Mentos]] television commercials during the 1990s developed a [[cult following]] due to their camp "[[Eurotrash (term)|Eurotrash]]" humour. In the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|Season 8]] episode "[[Homer's Phobia]]" (1997) of the American [[animated comedy]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', gay secondary character John (played by gay director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]) defines to [[Homer Simpson]] the meaning of the word ''camp'' to be "tragically ludicrous", or "ludicrously tragic": Homer gives a misinterpreted example of ''camp'' as "when a clown dies".

The [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Strangers with Candy]]'' (1999–2000), starring comedian [[Amy Sedaris]], was a camp spoof of the ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-PAURpOlB8C&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=%22strangers+with+candy+which+was%22+camp&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGsYeZ8sHVAhVl_IMKHVcbAyAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22strangers%20with%20candy%20which%20was%22%20camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/2006/07/06/strangers-with-candy-after-school-special-sedaris-style/]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESPN Classic]] show ''[[Cheap Seats without Ron Parker]]'' (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on ''[[ABC's Wide World of Sports]]'' during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine [[ballet]] with skiing ([[ski ballet]]), the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] holding a televised exhibition game at the notorious [[Attica State Prison]] in upstate New York, small-time regional [[professional wrestling]] and [[roller derby]]. The television series ''[[Tim &amp; Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from [[Public-access television]] productions, early morning [[infomercial]]s, and the use of celebrity status in [[telethon]]s and other televised charity appeals.

=== Film ===
[[File:Coca Sarli 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|Argentine [[pop icon]] and [[sex symbol]] [[Isabel Sarli]], whose [[sexploitation film]]s made alongside [[Armando Bó]] are celebrated for their camp tone.]]
Some classic films noted for their camp tone include:
* [[John Huston]]'s ''[[Beat the Devil (1953 film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953, starring [[Humphrey Bogart]]), an exaggerated ''film noir'' send-up.
* Filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] directed a number of camp films such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), ''[[Female Trouble]]'' (1974), ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977), ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' (1981), ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988), ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990), ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) and ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'' (2004).
* Filmmaker [[Todd Solondz]] uses camp music to illustrate the absurdity and banality of bourgeois, suburban existence. In Solondz's [[cult film]] ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' (1995), the eleven-year-old girl protagonist kisses a boy while [[Deborah Gibson]]'s "[[Lost in Your Eyes]]" plays on a [[Fisher-Price]] tape recorder.

Films such as ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1967), ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'' (1981), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), and ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) gained camp status primarily due to the filmmakers' attempting to produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like [[Patty Duke]] in ''Valley of the Dolls'' and [[Faye Dunaway]] in ''Mommie Dearest'', gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from gay, male audiences.

The second part of the 1978 movie ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' set in fictional Metropolis takes on a campy [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] tone after the seriousness of the origin story.

Educational and industrial films form an entire subgenre of camp films, with the most famous being the much-spoofed 1950s ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' could be seen as [[kitsch]], even though it is very chilling to watch (it was never shown on grounds of [[national security]] and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British [[Public Information Film]]s gained a camp cult following, such as the famous [[Charley Says]] series. Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ [[Kenny Everett]], who came from an [[advertising]] background as a [[copywriter]].

Some films are intentionally and consciously camp, such as ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s black comedy crime film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) has also fallen into this category, with film critic [[Nicholas Christopher]] calling it "more gangland Camp than neo-noir". In [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] the archetypal camp film cult is the outrageous long-running, 30-film [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'' series]] (1958–1978). Another cult is built around ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975). ''[[Preaching to the Perverted (film)|Preaching to the Perverted]]'' (1997), written and directed by [[Stuart Urban]], broke out of traditional British comedy style to portray the fetish and [[BDSM]] scene under assault from Christian crusaders and the authorities. It portrayed both the fetish scene and the Establishment in a cartoon, stylized visual manner. Lambasted by most traditional critics, lauded by gay, music and fashion press, it went on to build a lasting cult reputation.

Movie versions of camp TV shows in recent years have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of [[George Kuchar]] and his brother [[Mike Kuchar]], [[ASS Studios]], launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and [[Jen Miller]], began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film ''[[Satan, Hold My Hand]]'' (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.&lt;ref&gt;filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-hi...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/|title=COURTNEY FATHOM SELL: SO YOU WANNA BE AN UNDERGROUND FILMMAKER?|work=Filmmaker Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion ===
[[File:Clarkes on Belmont.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The banner of a diner featuring a 1950s-era camp advertisement]]

Retro-camp fashion is an example of modern [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] employing camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The classic camp yard ornament is the pink [[plastic flamingo]]. The [[yard globe]], [[garden gnome]], wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a [[lawn jockey]]) and ceramic statues of [[white-tailed deer]] are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.

The [[Carvel (restaurant)|Carvel]] chain of soft-serve ice cream stores is famous for its camp style, camp low-budget TV commercials and camp ice-cream cakes such as [[Cookie Puss]] and [[Fudgie The Whale]].

== Distinguishing between kitsch and camp ==
The words "camp" and "[[kitsch]]" are often used interchangeably; both may relate to art, literature, music, or any object that carries an aesthetic value. However, "kitsch" refers specifically to the work itself, whereas "camp" is a mode of performance. Thus, a person may consume kitsch intentionally or unintentionally. Camp, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture "in quotation marks."&lt;ref name="Sontag2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sontag|title=Against Interpretation and Other Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLdQPwAACAAJ|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=2 July 2009|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=978-0-14-119006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sontag also distinguishes the difference between "naive" and "deliberate" camp. Kitsch, as a form or style, certainly falls under the category "naive camp" as it is unaware that it is tasteless; "deliberate camp", on the other hand, can be seen as a subversive form of kitsch which deliberately exploits the whole notions of what it is to be kitsch. (Sontag, 1964)

== Around the world ==
[[File:Mika Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pop singer [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] is known for his camp-styled performances]]

Thomas Hine identified 1954–1964 as the campiest period in modern US history. During this time, Americans had more money to spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of [[Femininity|feminine]] gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian [[Kenneth Williams]] wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: "Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Davies]] (1993) ''The Kenneth Williams Diaries'', Harper-Collins Publishers {{ISBN|978-0-00-255023-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes the fact that he is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character [[Daffyd Thomas]] in the English comedy skit show ''[[Little Britain]]''. "Camp" forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp.

The Australian theatre and opera director [[Barrie Kosky]] is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the [[Western canon]] including [[Shakespeare]], [[Wagner]], [[Molière]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Kafka]] and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company ''The Lost Echo'', based on [[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' and [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. In the first act ("The Song of Phaeton"), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the musical arrangements feature [[Noël Coward]] and [[Cole Porter]]. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban [[middle class]], which is suggestive of the style of [[Dame Edna Everage]]. For example, in ''The Lost Echo'' Kosky employs a chorus of [[Secondary school|high school]] girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, "Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on ''[[Australian Idol]]''." See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular "Strictly Ballroom".

Since 2000, the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increased element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the gay communities—in their stage performances, especially during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many [[Eurovision]] performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called "the Eurovision kitsch drive", with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.

== Literature ==
The first post-World War II use of the word in print, marginally mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s 1954 novel ''The World in the Evening'', where he comments: "You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making fun ''out'' of it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance."  In the American writer [[Susan Sontag]]'s 1964 essay "[[Notes on "Camp"|Notes on 'Camp']]", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included [[Tiffany lamp]]s, the drawings of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], Tchaikovsky's ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and Japanese science fiction films such as [[Rodan (film)|''Rodan'']], and ''[[The Mysterians]]'' of the 1950s.

In Mark Booth's 1983 book ''Camp'' he defines camp as "to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits." He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and ''camp fads and fancies'', things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.

==Analysis==
As a cultural challenge, camp can also receive a political meaning, when minorities appropriate and ridicule the images of the dominant group, the kind of activism associated with [[multiculturalism]] and the [[New Left]]. The best known instance of this is the [[gay liberation]] movement, which used camp to confront society with its own preconceptions and their historicity.  The first positive portrayal of a gay secret agent in fiction appears in a series, ''[[The Man from C.A.M.P.]]'' in which the protagonist is, paradoxically, effeminate yet physically tough. Female camp actresses such as [[Mae West]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Joan Crawford]] also had an important influence on the development of feminist consciousness: by exaggerating certain stereotyped features of femininity, such as fragility, open emotionality or moodiness, they attempted to undermine the credibility of those preconceptions. The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.

As a part of its adoption by the mainstream, camp has undergone a softening of its original subversive tone, and is often little more than the recognition that popular culture can also be enjoyed by a sophisticated sensibility.  Mainstream [[comic books]] and B [[Western (genre)|Western]]s, for example, have become standard subjects for academic analysis. The normalisation of the outrageous, common to many [[avant-garde|Vanguardist]] movements—has led some critics to argue the notion has lost its usefulness for critical art discourse.

According to the sociologist [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], camp engages in a redefinition of cultural meaning through a juxtaposition of an outmoded past alongside that which is technologically, stylistically, and sartorially contemporary. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a "throwaway Pop aesthetic", camp works to intermingle the categories of "high" and "low" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, "tends to refer to a subjective process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who identify objects as “camp” commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, "unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, "afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camp-style performances may allow certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist critics argue that drag queens are misogynistic because they make women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of the black and white minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.

Camp aesthetics became the curious site of personal liberation from the stranglehold of the corporate, capitalist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the capitalist environment of constant consumption, camp rediscovers history's waste, bringing back objects thought of as refuse or of bad taste. Camp liberates objects from the landfills of history and reinvokes them with a new charisma. In doing so camp creates an economy separate from that of the state. In Ross's words, camp, "is the re-creation of surplus value from forgotten forms of labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is perhaps why camp often faces criticism from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, the most obvious argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar to be recognized as valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the "yuck factor". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction. In a sense objects that fill their beholders with disgust fulfill Sontag's definition of the ultimate camp statement, "it's good because it's awful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From flea markets to thrift stores, the 'bad taste' of camp has been increasingly reinculcated with the cultural capital that it had intended to break away from. In an attempt to "present a challenge to the mechanisms of control and containment that operate in the name of good taste", the camp aesthetic has fallen flat on its face and has been appropriated by artists such as [[Macklemore]] with his hit single "[[Thrift Shop]]".&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Ross (sociologist)|title=No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture |year=1989 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, his fame is only enjoyed at the expense of others, as Ross writes, "it [the pleasure of camp] is the result of the (hard) work of a producer of taste and 'taste' is only possible through exclusion and depreciation."&lt;ref name="Ross 1989 153" /&gt;

'''Carl Axel Gottlund''' (February 24, 1796 in [[Ruotsinpyhtää]] – April 20, 1875 in [[Helsinki]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] explorer, collector of folklore, historian, cultural politician, linguist, philologist, translator, writer, publisher and lecturer of [[Finnish language]] at the [[University of Helsinki]].  He was a colorful cultural personality and one of the central Finnish national awakeners and — later — one of the leading dissidents at the same time.

Gottlund pursued the creation of an autonomous [[Finland|Finnish]] territory from the [[Forest Finns|Finn Forests]] on both sides of the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] border, with great economic and political independence.

Gottlund is commonly attributed with saving the folklore of the [[Forest Finns]].  Among ideas promoted by Gottlund was the view that all languages are interconnected by the same roots.

==Life==

===Early life===

In 1796, Carl Axel Gottlund was born in the Southern Finnish coastal town of [[Ruotsinpyhtää]] into the family of a Finnish clergyman Mattias Gottlund, one of the most outstanding representatives of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas in Finland.  Accordingly, Carl Axel was raised in the spirit of the Enlightenment, and the basic structure of his thinking represented rationalistic Enlightenment ideals.

Matthias Gottlund, Carl Axel's father, worked as the chaplain of the local congregation at the time.  Carl Axel's mother Ulrika Sophia was from the upper-class family of ''Orraeus'' in the nearby town of [[Porvoo]].

In 1805, the Gottlund family settled in [[Juva]], in the Finnish province of [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]], where Gottlund's father had landed to a financially lucrative job as a vicar.

During his childhood years, Carl Axel Gottlund's interest towards the Finnish culture and language had been inspired by his father, to the most part.  The opportunity in his childhood for Carl Axel to meet with the known Finnish nationalist author ''Jaakko Juteini'' is also believed to have boosted his future career choices and patriotism.

In 1810, Carl Axel enrolled with the Gymnasium of [[Porvoo]], a junior college in Southern Finland. In 1814, he began studies at the [[Royal Academy of Turku]].  At the academy, he had awakening in the Finnish [[national romanticism]].

In 1815–1816, Carl Axel collected various types of Finnish folklore material from his home county:  poems, songs, spells, children's stories and plays, nursery rhymes, etc.

===Finn Forests' autonomy in Central Scandinavia===

In 1816, Carl Axel Gottlund began studies at the [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]].  In [[Uppsala]], Gottlund studied classical languages, natural sciences, history and philosophy.

In 1817, Gottlund made an exploration trip to the [[Finns|Finnish]]-inhabited [[Dalarna]] area of Central [[Sweden]], to collect Finnish folklore and other ethnographic data as well as genealogical information, the latter partly because he wanted to improve the social circumstances of the Forest Finns and to prevent Sweden from taking ownership of their land.  He recorded total of about 50 Finnish language poems, songs and spells during this expedition.

Soon after this, Gottlund published his first book, ''Pieniä runoja Suomen poijille ratoxi I'' ("Small Poems for the Enjoyment of Finnish Boys - Part I"), consisting of folklore which he had collected at his home county of Juva in Finland.  A 'part II' was published shortly after.

In the summer of 1821, Gotlund launched another expedition to a Finnish-inhabited part of Sweden, this time covering the south-central Swedish area of [[Värmland]].  The expedition lasted until January 1822, after which Gottlund began acting as a political advocate on behalf of the Finnish population of Sweden.  Among his accomplishments, Gotlund founded three congregations for the Forest Finns.

Furthermore, in 1821 starting Gottlund began pursuing the creation of an autonomous Finnish county called ''Fennia'' from the [[Forest Finns|Finn Forests]] on both sides of the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Norway|Norwegian]] border, north and northeast from the modern-day Norwegian area of [[Oslo]], with great economic and political independence.  The tax border would have been removed and land ownership by Swedes and Norwegians would have been restricted.  The Swedish-Norwegian border had not been properly established before 1751.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fennia.nu Fennia.nu] - a page pertaining to the Finn Forests.&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempts to have the Finnish population of Sweden Proper "Swedified" and assimilated into the mainstream Swedish society, the use of the Finnish language had become strictly prohibited in Sweden Proper in the mid-17th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Wallin Väinö: ''Metsäsuomalaiset Ruotsissa'' ("Forest Finns in Sweden"). Helsinki, Otava, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Gottlund estimated that in the beginning of the 19th century the Central Scandinavian [[Forest Finns|Finn Forests]]' areas which he had visited alone were still home to approximately 40,000 Finnish-speaking Finns, of whom about 14,000 lived in Värmland - this in addition to other Finns such as the [[Tornedalians]] and their descendants and the Forest Finns in other parts of Sweden and Norway. It is estimated that "one of each five Swedes has their roots amongst the Forest Finns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1024&amp;artikel=5091950 Sverigesradio.se] - one of each five Swedes descends from the Forest Finns.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually - however -, due to his political activism, Gottlund nearly became expelled from Sweden.  He was banned from operating in Stockholm, and - amidst his lobbying and campaigning - he was finally exiled from Stockholm to Uppsala. In spite of this total political failure in the creation of the Central Scandinavian autonomous Finnish area, Gottlund had positive cultural influence on the Forest Finns and became a legendary, heroic character in the Finn Forests.

While still living in [[Uppsala]] and while attending the [[Uppsala University]] part-time, Gottlund began preparing an ambitious publication, ''Otava'', aimed to become a Finnish literary monument.  Otava was published in three parts between 1828 and 1832.  It consisted of articles pertaining to linguistics, history, ethics, religion, folklore and poetry.

However, in Finland, Otava was not met with the type of enthusiasm which Gottlund had hoped for.  The work was considered to favor too much the [[Savonian dialects]] of Finnish language, and its mainly enlightenment-spirited contents were overshadowed by the current of romanticism which now had encaptured Finland, producing epics such as [[The Kalevala]] in 1835 and [[The Tales of Ensign Stål]] in 1848.

In 1831, Gottlund married Charlotta Augusta Brink.  Over time, the two gave birth to total of 10 children together.

===Returning to Finland===

In 1834, Gottlund returned to Finland, bringing his family along.  The family settled in [[Kuopio]], where Gottlund's now widowed mother lived.

In 1839, Gottlund became a lecturer of Finnish language in the [[University of Helsinki]], which then was known as the ''Imperial Alexander University of Finland'' (from 1828 to 1919).

In 1842, Gottlund was granted a permission to launch a printing house in [[Helsinki]], the opening of which was delayed until a few years later.

[[File:Suomalainen 31.1.1846.png|thumb|right|250px|The first number of the ''Suomalainen'' newspaper, published by Carl Axel Gottlund in Finnish, beginning on January 31, 1846.]]

In 1846, Gottlund published a poetic album named ''Sampo''.  The same year, in 1846, Gottlund founded the ''Suomalainen'' newspaper, which was printed in Finnish.  Following the publication of a certain polemic article in the paper, the Finnish Senate discontinued the publishing of the paper.  However, Gottlund came up with another similar newspaper, ''Suomi'', which was in circulation from 1847 to 1849.

===Battle for professorship===

In 1850, Gottlund sought the professorship of [[Finnish language]] at the [[University of Helsinki]]. However, Gottlund was found unqualified for the job, following his doctoral thesis - written in Finnish - becoming confiscated, after Gottlund had prematurely published it against the approval of the government-guided censorship.  [[M. A. Castrén]] was elected for the job.  However, he died already a year later.  Gottlund now ran for the job against the famed Finnish author [[Elias Lönnrot]].  This time Gottlund's doctoral thesis was written in Swedish, but - for the second time - it was disapproved.

Through his life, Gottlund was passionately interested in archaeology, about which he wrote e.g. in his ''Otava'' series.  In the 1850s, he continued exploring the history and culture of the Finnish people. In 1859, Gottlund received a grant from the Senate of Finland to sponsor his archaeological expeditions in various parts of Finland.  He promoted the establishment of the professorship of archaeology in Finland, to no prevail.

Following the retirement of Elias Lönnrot as the Professor of Finnish language in Helsinki, in 1862, Gottlund's doctoral thesis was finally approved, but again that professorship which he had sought was given to another candidate,

In the 1860s, Gottlund continued writing and publishing actively. In 1865, he published ''Läsning för finnar'', in which he criticizes his adversaries and discusses the injustices which he had had to experience on his academic career.  Among his other accomplishments in the 1860s, Gottlund translated the poetry of the Swedish [[Carl Michael Bellman]] into Finnish.

Gottlund sought financial backing from [[Norway]], Sweden and Finland for further publications relating to the Forest Finns of Norway and Sweden, to no prevail.  In the 1870s, Gottlund participated in publishing of the ''Työmiehen Ystävä'' ("Friend of the Working Man") newspaper, for which he also wrote.

==Banned folklore==

Some of the folklore poetry collected by Gottlund in the early 19th century was considered sexually too explicit to be published during his lifetime, and even until quite recently.  Some poems collected by him stayed archived until 1997, when they became included in the book ''[[Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot]]'' ("Old Poems of the Finnish People").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/Sisuradio/programsidor/amnessida.asp?programID=1003&amp;Nyheter=&amp;grupp=2689&amp;artikel=1228349 Housumato ja sudenkita – seksi kansanrunoudessa].&lt;/ref&gt;

* The closing ceremony began at 20:14 [[Moscow Time|MSK]] at [[Fisht Olympic Stadium]]. It featured the traditional elements of Olympic closing ceremonies such as the parade of flags and athletes; the handover ceremony to the site of [[2018 Winter Olympics|the next Winter Olympics]], [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]]; and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame. During the ceremony, Russia poked fun at the opening ceremony, where one of the Olympic rings did not open; the fifth group of dancers representing the rings took longer than the others to open. It did eventually open, to cheers from the Russian audience.&lt;ref name="Day17-Closing ceremony"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sochi2014.com/en/news-sochi-2014-closing-ceremony-unites-olympic-generations | title=Sochi 2014 Closing Ceremony Unites Olympic Generations | work=Sochi 2014 | date=23 February 2014 | accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colonial architecture''' is an architectural style from a mother country that has been incorporated into the buildings of settlements or colonies in distant locations. Colonists frequently built settlements that synthesized the architecture of their countries of origin with the design characteristics of their new lands, creating hybrid designs.&lt;ref name="ovaita"&gt;{{cite book |last=Guaita |first=Ovidio |year=1999 |title=On distant shores: colonial houses around the world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BRUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=world+colonial+architecture&amp;dq=world+colonial+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=obfkUqKfFIqKiQfB2oFA&amp;redir_esc=y |location= |publisher=Monacelli Press |isbn=9781580930512 |accessdate=January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dauvray Cup''' was a early [[championship]] [[trophy]] awarded in the sport of [[professional baseball]] in the [[United States]] from 1887 to 1893.&lt;ref name=90feet&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbins |first=Mike |date=2004 |title=Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls with Baseball Immortality |location=New York |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |pages=269–70 |isbn=0-7867-1335-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorn1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ourgame.mlblogs.com/2011/11/03/baseballs-lost-chalice/ |title=Baseball’s Lost Chalice |last=Thorn |first=John |date=November 3, 2011 |website=Our Game |publisher=MLBlogs Network |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named after famed actress on the stage, [[Helen Dauvray]] (1859-1923), who presented the cup, it was initially awarded to the winner of the professional baseball championship series tournament (similar to the later inter-league [[World Series#The original World Series|World Series]] established 1903, between the National and newly organized [[American League]] of 1901) then between the two major baseball leagues of the time - the [[National League]] (organized 1876) and the  [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] which played 1882 to 1891. It was the first "World Series" style  trophy for the championship team and representative city of American professional sport of [[Baseball|baseball]].&lt;ref name=Thorn1 /&gt; 

The last National League-American Association series was in 1890, with the latter circuit collapsing after the end of the following season of 1891. The cup was then awarded to the winner of the [[List of National League pennant winners|National League pennant]]. 

Like the longtime iconic [[Stanley Cup]] of professional [[ice hockey|ice hockey's]] [[National Hockey League]], the same trophy was used each season held by the winner then carrying on to the next year's champions rather than a new one being made.&lt;ref name=90feet /&gt; The Dauvray Cup has since been lost in a mysterious controversy.

==History==
[[File:Helen Dauvray, 1896.png|thumb|right|170px|Helen Dauvray in 1896]]
The cup was named for its presenter, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actress [[Helen Dauvray]].&lt;ref name=Thorn1 /&gt; In 1887, Dauvray began a relationship with [[John Montgomery Ward]], [[shortstop]] for the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] and future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]]. Their marriage was announced in October of that year during the World Series.&lt;ref name=Thorn2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ourgame.mlblogs.com/2011/11/04/baseballs-lost-chalice-part-2/ |title=Baseball’s Lost Chalice, Part 2 |last=Thorn |first=John |date=November 4, 2011 |website=Our Game |publisher=MLBlogs Network |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dauvray first announced her intentions to present the trophy in newspapers on May 21, 1887. The announcement described the cup as "a $500 silver cup" in "the form of a true lovers' cup ... about twelve inches high".&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/just-a-bit-outside/story/gone-forever-in-search-of-baseball-s-lost-treasures-090214 |title=Gone Forever?

When some, including National League president [[Nicholas Young (executive)|Nicholas Young]], suggested that the trophy was more for the owner of the winning team than the players, Dauvray agreed to award gold medals to the players of the winning team as well as one umpire.&lt;ref name=Thorn2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MLB.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/25881152/ |title=Dauvray Cup was once a coveted possession |last=Newman |first=Mark |date=November 3, 2011 |website=MLB.com |publisher= |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BtBS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2010/12/29/1901483/history-of-the-dauvray-cup-1887-world-series |title=History of the Dauvray Cup: 1887 World Series |last=Rogers |first=Mike |date=December 29, 2010 |website=Beyond the Box Score |publisher=SBNation |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some newspapers at the time, including the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'' and ''[[National Police Gazette|Police Gazette]]'', dismissed the trophy as a publicity stunt designed more to promote Dauvray herself than out of a fondness for baseball.&lt;ref name=Thorn2 /&gt;

The Dauvray Cup was first won in 1887 by the [[Detroit Wolverines]] of the NL, who defeated the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] in the [[1887 World Series]].&lt;ref name=BtBS /&gt; It would also be won twice by Ward's Giants, in 1888 and 1889.&lt;ref name=90feet /&gt; The cup was last awarded in 1893 to the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Beaneaters]]. The Beaneaters had won the cup three years in a row, having won the NL pennant in 1891 and 1892 as well. The rules established at the creation of the cup stated that it would permanently belong to the first team to win it three years in a row.&lt;ref name=90feet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;&lt;ref name=MLB.com /&gt; Dauvray, by that time no longer much interested in either Ward&amp;mdash;they would divorce in November that same year&amp;mdash;or baseball, took no steps to provide a new Dauvray Cup to replace the retired one.&lt;ref name=Thorn3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ourgame.mlblogs.com/2011/11/04/baseballs-lost-chalice-part-3/ |title=Baseball’s Lost Chalice, Part 3 |last=Thorn |first=John |date=November 4, 2011 |website=Our Game |publisher=MLBlogs Network |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement would be provided by [[William Chase Temple]], president of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], which became known as the [[Temple Cup]].&lt;ref name=90feet /&gt;

According to [[John Thorn]], official historian of [[Major League Baseball]], the last mention of the presence of the Dauvray Cup was on November 12, 1893, in [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]], [[Kentucky]]. By June 1894, ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' was wondering in print what had happened to it.&lt;ref name=Thorn3 /&gt; The current location of the Dauvray Cup is unknown.

'''Evagrius Scholasticus''' ({{lang-el|Εὐάγριος Σχολαστικός}}) was a [[Syrian people|Syrian]] scholar and intellectual living in the 6th century AD, and an aide to the patriarch [[Gregory of Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roger Pearse |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/evagrius_0_intro.htm |title=Account of author and his writings |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2002-10-19 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His surviving work, ''Ecclesiastical History'' ({{lang|grc|Ἐκκλησιαστικὴ Ἱστορία}}), comprises a six-volume collection concerning the Church's history from the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431) to [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]’s reign during his life.

==Life==

Evagrius Scholasticus was born in [[Hama|Epiphania]], a Syrian town located next to the [[Orontes River]] in the heart of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Controversy exists as to the date on which Evagrius was born, since historian G. F. Chesnut asserts that he was born in either 536 or 537, yet the researcher Whitby claims that he was born in 535.&lt;ref&gt;Chesnut, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; His first written work addressed the  plague outbreak which infected a vast segment of the population. Evagrius himself was infected by the outbreak yet miraculously managed to survive this disaster during his youth. According to his own account, close members of his family died from the outbreak, including his wife at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Ecclesiastical History'', Preface, pgs. vii–viii&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Whitby reasons that Evagrius was born into a wealthy aristocratic family with close ties to the political elite.

His education was long-ranging and comprehensive since early childhood, starting with a specialization in Grammar and transitioning to classical Greek literature. This eventually culminated in Evagrius’s pursuit of legal studies, which upon completion, earned him the prestigious title of “Scholasticus” when he was in his late 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; His first notable official endeavor was accompanying [[Gregory of Antioch]] to Constantinople in order to defend him against charges related to sexual misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;''Ecclesiastical History'', Preface, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Evagrius again remarried in Antioch, where his own records testify to his prestige among the professional elite since displays of grandeur and a massive audience were present during this wedding ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated to the  emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] Evagrius wrote many works on theological matters, but none of these survives.&lt;ref&gt;''Ecclesiastical History'', Preface, pgs ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; His remaining work, ''The Ecclesiastical History'' was complete in 593, a six-volume compilation of Christian history from the [[first Council of Ephesus]] to his own present time.&lt;ref&gt;Chesnut, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Evagrius was explicitly a Christian in the Chalcedonian tradition, critiquing both [[Zacharias Rhetor]] and [[Zosimus]] for theological differences, two popular historians during his own time. He respected the former scholar for his contributions to the histories of the 5th and 6th centuries AD but chastised him for his [[Monophysite]] position. However, he was especially hostile towards Zosimus, a pagan historiographer, for his vehemently anti-Christian views, stating “ ‘You, O accursed and totally defiled one, say that the fortunes of the Romans wasted away and were altogether ruined from the time when Christianity was made known”, challenging Zosimus's assumption that Rome’s fall began with Constantine’s conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Chesnut, pgs 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===''Ecclesiastical History''===
[[File:Евагрий Схоластик.png|thumb|right|Evagrius Scholasticus,'' Historia ecclesiastica'' (1524 copy; [[British Library]] Egerton MS 2626)]]
Evagrius’s only surviving work, ''Ecclesiastical History'', addresses the history of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from the official beginning of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] controversy at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431 to the time in which he was writing, 593. The book’s contents focus mainly on religious matters, describing the events surrounding notable bishops and holy men.

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' was published in 1544 under the name of Robertus Stephanus (better known as [[Robert Estienne]]). [[John Christopherson]], bishop of Chichester, made a Latin translation of the ''Ecclesiastical History'', which was published after his death in 1570. Translations into English appeared much later: the first was by Edward Walford, which was published at London in 1846; Michael Whitby's translation was published in 2001 by Liverpool University Press as part of their "Texts in Translation Series."

Some historians, particularly [[Pauline Allen]], allege that Evagrius’s [[Chalcedonian]] theological stance directly influenced his selection of information, in order to defend Chalcedonian-aligned political agents against negative reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt; Whitby, however, emphasizes the legal scholar's acceptance and inclusion of information written by other historians who adopted opposing stances, when he discerned that their accounts were reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, p. xl&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Evagrius Scholasticus  relies heavily on Zachariah’s textual study of history even though he was a monophysite, occasionally omitting minor facets of his work that explicitly promote his theology, but largely considering him to be dependable. Allen also reasons that Evagrius built on Zachariah’s work because his was the only comprehensive historical account of events taking place from [[Theodoret of Cyrus]]’s time till his own era. Unfortunately, however, Zachariah’s original manuscripts have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. 488&lt;/ref&gt;

Evagrius is much less critical of the Emperor [[Justinian]] and his wife [[Theodora (wife of Justinian I)|Theodora]], in comparison with [[Procopius]], who described the two as physically manifest demons. Because of regional affiliations Evagrius depicts the emperor in a more sympathetic light, praising his moderate approach to justice and his restraint towards excessive persecution, yet still decrying his heresy and displays of wealth. Evagrius’s ambivalence to Justinian is especially evident when he describes him as a virtuous man yet blind to impending defeat in his self-initiated war with Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Pazdernik, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Chesnut also comments on how the Roman historian and scholar endues his ''Ecclesiastical History'' with a dramatic style, using themes from classical Greek tragedies to characterize Justinian’s life, particularly Fortune’s grand fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Chesnut pgs 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

Evagrius builds upon the documents written by Zachariah, Symeon Stylites the Elder, [[Eustathius of Epiphania]], [[John Malalas]], [[Zosimus]], and [[Procopius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, pgs xxii–xxx&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ecclesiastical History'' is considered an important and relatively authoritative account of the timeline it traces, since Evagrius draws on other scholars’ material, explicitly acknowledging his sources. He meticulously organizes information taken from other written historical works in order to validate his account more effectively than other theological scholars of his time, thus diminishing confusion for future historian’s interested in studying his work.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians acknowledge that there are serious logical errors inherent in Evagrius’s surviving work, which is common for its epoch, namely the problematic chronological sequencing and skimming over of undeniably notable events such as major wars and other secular events. When the scholar mentions important occasions in his own life, lack of chronological labeling is especially evident – which can provide complications to those analyzing his book.&lt;ref&gt;Whitby, pg. liii&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into a modest family of [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] in the [[Drôme]] department where his father ran a machine shop, Fernand Courby experienced from childhood the taste to translate through drawing the expression of his thought. A brilliant student in high school in Valence, then a scholarship holder for license and aggregation at the Faculty of Arts of Lyon, he was formed by the teaching of Henri Lechat [[Maurice Holleaux]] and [[Philippe-Ernest Legrand]] and chosen to be a member of the [[French School at Athens]] in 1905.

After a stay at the Académie de France in Rome (Villa Medici), he joined the great archaeological sites of [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]] under the leadership of Maurice Holleaux. An archaeologist coupled with a designer and very expert in architecture, he realized the then so rare type of archaeologist-architect that was missing in the French School at Athens, and contributed to a capital change in French methods in archeology.&lt;ref&gt;Hellmann, Marie-Christine. Les architectes de l'École française d'Athènes. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', Volume 120, livraison 1 (1996),(pp.&amp;nbsp;191-222).&lt;/ref&gt;

At Delos, he became interested in 1906 in the proto-history of the sanctuary, unearthed the ''Portico Antigone'' with one of the tombs of the Hyperborean Virgins (the Theke), and discovered the remains of a Minoan and Mycenaean Delos in the sanctuary of Apollo and Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. ''Le Portique d'Antigone ou du Nord-Est et les constructions voisines''. Exploration archéologique de Délos, Fascicule V, París : Fontemoing (1912) (prix Zographos de l'Association des études grecques).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Notes topographiques et chronologiques sur le sanctuaire d'Apollon délien. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'' Volume 45 (1921), (pp.&amp;nbsp;174-241).&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Charles Picard]], he prepared the enhancement of the excavations of the city and the Temple of Zeus by a mission to Stratos (Acarnania).&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. ''Recherches archéologiques à Stratos d'Acarnanie''. De Boccard (1924). (with Charles Picard).&lt;/ref&gt; At Delphi, his studies on the tholos of the Sicycone Treasury,&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. La tholos du trésor de Sicyone à Delphes. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', Volume 35 (1911), (pp.&amp;nbsp;132-148).&lt;/ref&gt; the east pediment of the archaic temple&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Le fronton oriental du temple archaïque d'Apollon à Delphes. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', Volume 38 (1914), (pp.&amp;nbsp;327-350).&lt;/ref&gt; on the nearby monument of the opisthodomos,&lt;ref&gt;Courby Fernand. Monument étolien de la place de l'opisthodome à Delphes. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', Volume 50 (1926), (pp.&amp;nbsp;120-123) (with P. de La Coste-Messelière).&lt;/ref&gt; and especially the terrace of the temple&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Fouilles de Delphes, ''Architecture et topographie : la terrasse du Temple d'Apollon'', Fascicule I, EFA (1915).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Fouilles de Delphes, ''La Terrasse du Temple'', fascicule II, EFA (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; renewed the knowledge of Delphic monuments.

Mobilized in 1914 and assigned in 1915 to the 176th Infantry Regiment, it was in the uniform of an adjutant (and under the Turkish balls) that he participated in the development of Macedonia excavations, especially the necropolis of Elaeusin in Thrace, unearthed during work entrenchment in the Dardanelles in early June 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient. Fouilles archéologiques sur l'emplacement de la nécropole d'Éléonte de Thrace. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'' Volume 39 (1915), (pp.&amp;nbsp;135-240) (with Édouard Dhorme and [[Joseph Chamonard]].)&lt;/ref&gt; He cumulated these archaeological activities with the function of officer-interpreter by the 2nd office of the General Staff of the Armies of the East in Salonika. His role in the development of the victorious offensive which forced Bulgaria to ask for an armistice September 29, 1918 earned him the Greek [[Medal of Military Merit (Greece)|Medal of Military Merit]] and the French [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] with citation to the order of the Eastern Army.&lt;ref&gt;Picard, Charles. L'École française d'Athènes de 1914 à 1919. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', Volume 44 (1920), (pp.&amp;nbsp;25-35).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthieu, René-Hubert. Des hellénistes en guerre, Le parcours atypique des membres de l'École française d'Athènes durant la Première Guerre mondiale. In ''Revue historique des armées'', 261 (2010), (pp.&amp;nbsp;88-105).&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as 1919, resuming the publication of the monuments of the terrace of the temple of Apollo at Delphi interrupted by the war, he undertook a comprehensive study of the altar of Pythian Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Fouilles de Delphes, ''La Terrasse du Temple'', fascicule III, EFA (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stikas, Eustase. 1979. La restauration de l'autel d'Apollon à Delphes. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique''103, (pp.&amp;nbsp;479-500).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Delos that Fernand Courby started his study on [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rbph_0035-0818_1924_num_3_2_6295_t1_0359_0000_1 ''Les vases grecs à reliefs''] (from prehistoric to Roman times), which he made the subject of his doctoral thesis published in 1922. This book of reference on the [[pottery of ancient Greece]] earned him the medal of the [[Institut de France]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Vases à reliefs appliqués du musée de Délos. In ''Bulletin de correspondance hellénique'', Volume 37 (1913), (pp.&amp;nbsp;418-442).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. ''Les vases grecs à reliefs''. Bibliothèque des Écoles françaises d'Athènes et de Rome, fascicule 125, 598 pages, Paris, De Boccard (1922).&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed a professor of Greek philology and epigraphy at the University of Lyon in 1922, Fernand Courby founded in 1923 the ''Institut d'épigraphie grecque'', which in 1961 took the name ''Institut Fernand Courby'' (a laboratory of the [[CNRS]] since 1967).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/ouvrages/home/prescript/article/mom_0243-8046_1998_hos_5_1_1581 ''L'Institut Courby et la mission de Salamine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Fernand Courby published his last book on Delos, ''Les temples d'Apollon''.&lt;ref&gt;Courby, Fernand. Exploration Archéologique de Délos XII: ''Les temples d'Apollon''. Paris: De Boccard (1931) (Ambalietos prize of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery was performed too late for a mastoiditis and he died of meningitis March 6, 1932, aged 54.

At the time of his death he was preparing a study on Greek house for the series ''La vie publique et privée des anciens Grecs'' ([[Collection Budé]]). He was twice holder of the Grand silver medal of the [[Académie d'architecture|Société centrale des architectes français]].

Left a widower in 1914 with two young daughters, Anne (born in 1912) and Irène (born 1914), Fernand Courby remarried in 1922 with the daughter of the Hellenist Fernand Allègre, with whom he had a daughter, Françoise (born 1924).

== Biography ==

Buzatu finished elementary and high school in the city of [[Râmnicu Sărat]] and later studied history and linguistics at the [[University of Iași]]. In 1971, he received his PhD in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gds.ro/Bani-afaceri/2009-04-16/Profesorul+Gheorghe+Buzatu%2C++la+70+de+ani/ "Profesorul Gheorghe Buzatu, la 70 de ani"]. ''GAZETA de SUD''.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1992, he worked as a researcher at the Iași institute for archeology and history and was the chief researcher in the Center for History and European studies of the [[Romanian Academy]]. In 1992, he became the director of this center.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radu Cinpoes|title=Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQQCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124|date=21 September 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85772-030-6|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publications ===

Buzatu published 25 books and was involved in the writing of several others. One of his best-known works is the book ''Românii în arhivele Kremlinului'' (Romanians in the Kremlin's archives),&lt;ref name="Bucur2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Bucur|title=Heroes and Victims: Remembering War in Twentieth-century Romania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsjKklCzmN0C&amp;pg=PA289|year=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-22134-X|pages=289–}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1996.

In this chapter, Buzatu claimed that the Jews have the main responsibility for the Holocaust of the Romanian people which began in 1940 with the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BfQoxsH9bbwC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=gheorghe+buzatu+holocaust+denial#v=onepage&amp;q=gheorghe%20buzatu%20holocaust%20denial&amp;f=false | title = Holocaust Denial: The Politics of Perfidy | isbn = 9783110288216 | author1 = Wistrich | first1 = Robert S | date = 2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2001, Buzatu organized a Symposium on the subject of the Holocaust of the Jews in Romania. This symposium, titled "Holocaust în România?", mainly questioned the existence of the Holocaust of the Jewish people in Romania and the responsibility of the Romanian government for the mass murders committed on Romanian-controlled territories taken from the Soviet Union in 1941.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent"&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2005-03-10/pdf/romanian/chapter_13.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616054929/https://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2005-03-10/pdf/romanian/chapter_13.pdf |date=June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the symposium, Buzatu established "Liga pentru Combaterea Antiromânismului" (the league against anti-Romanianism) with himself as president.&lt;ref name="Mudde2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cas Mudde|title=Racist Extremism in Central and Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azJ-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT278|date=9 October 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25252-7|pages=278–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust historian Randolph Braham described Buzatu as a "Holocaust denier historian and an expert in manipulating public opinion".&lt;ref&gt;[Braham, Randolph L.: Romanian Nationalists and the Holocaust: Attempts to Whitewash the Past, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carey2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry F.

=== Political career ===

Between 2000 and 2004, Buzatu represented [[Iași County]] in the [[Romanian Senate]].&lt;ref name="cvdep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Minkenberg2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Minkenberg|title=Historical Legacies and the Radical Right in Post-Cold War Central and Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eA3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173|date=15 April 2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-3-8382-6124-9|pages=173–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barany2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zoltan Barany|title=The Future of NATO Expansion: Four Case Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=txlteD2HG9EC&amp;pg=PA131|date=21 July 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44044-8|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, after parliament passed a law forbidding [[Holocaust denial]], Buzatu offered to change the definition of "Holocaust". According to the proposal, the definition should be "a mass organized annihilation of Jewish population in Europe, committed by the Nazi authorities". Thus, Buzatu's proposal would have had the effect of saying there was no Holocaust in Romania because Nazi Germany did not directly rule Romania during the war.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent" /&gt;

In 2004, Buzatu was awarded the [[Order of the Star of Romania]] by president [[Ion Iliescu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160204163031/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=a9754d2a-5412-4ee2-958c-5c875c781e2b "Romanian anti-Semitism continues"].

'''Harita''' (also known as Harita, Haritsa and Haritasa) was an ancient prince of the [[Suryavansha]] dynasty, best known as the ancestor of the [[Kshatriya]] lineage, Harita [[gotra]].

Although a [[Brahmin]] lineage, this gotra is descended from Kshatriya prince of the Suryavansha dynasty who was the great grandson of legendary King [[King Mandhata|Mandhatra]]. [[King Mandhata|Mandhatra]] was killed by Lavanasura who was killed later by Rama's brother Shatrughna. This is one of ancient India's most prominent and famous lineages, having produced [[Rama]] and his 3 brothers  (See [[Genealogy of Rama]]) and Yadava lineage from Ikshvaku King Haryaswa in which [[Krishna]] was born. [[Jayadratha]] of Mahabharata also belonged to solar line. The first notable king of the dynasty was [[Ikshvaku (Hinduism)|Ikshvaku]].  Other Brahmin gotras from solar line are [[Vatula]], [[Shatamarshana gothra|Shatamarshana]], Kutsa, Bhadrayana and Vishnuvriddha. Of these Kutsa and Shatamarshana also descend from King Mandhatra like Harita gotra and have either Mandhatra or his sons (Ambarish/Purukutsa) as part of their Pravaras. The ''[[Puranas]]'', a series of Hindu mythological texts, document the story of this dynasty.  Harita was separated from Ikshvaku by twenty-first generations.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp095.htm|title=The Vishnu Purana: Book IV: Chapter III|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day, many [[Kshatriya]]s claim descent from the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] dynasty to substantiate their claims to royalty.

Brahmins of the Harita gotra trace their lineage to the eponymous prince. While most Brahmins claim to be descended from ancient sages, those of the Harita gotra claim to be descended from Kshatriyas trained by the Brahmin [[Angiras (sage)|Angirasa]] and hence they have some kshatriya and some brahmin qualities.  This created, according to the ''[[Linga Purana]]'', "Brahmins with the qualities of Kshatriyas".&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt; 

This is recorded in the Hindu tradition in the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'':

''Ambarishasya Mandhdtus tanayasya Yuvanasvah putro bhut tasmad Harito yato ngiraso Haritah''. "The son of Ambarisha, son of [[Mandhatri]] was Yuvanasva From him sprang Harita from whom the Harita Angirases were descended.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;

and in the ''Linga Purana'':

''Harito Yuvanasvasya Harita yata atmajah ete hy Angirasah pakshe kshattropeta dvijatayah''. "The son of Yuvanasva was Harita of whom the Haritash were sons". "They were on the side of Angiras twice born men." "Brahmans of Kshattriya lineage."&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;

and in the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'':

''they were the sons of Haritash / Angiras, twice-born men (Brahmans), of Kshatriya race,''&lt;ref&gt;Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History, and Literature by John Dowson&lt;/ref&gt; or sons of Harita raised up by Sage Angiras.&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"/&gt;

Accordingly, from both Linga Purana and Vayu Purana it can be inferred that brahmins with Harita gotra belong to Ikshvaku lineage and because of the training and tapo sakti of Angirasa and blessings of Lord Adi Kesava obtained Brahmin qualities, and became twice born.   

The [[Pravaras|{{IAST|Pravara}}]] of this gotra, used in ceremonies to reference the ancestors of the participant Brahmin has 2 variations:
*[[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]], [[Ambarisha]], Yuvanaswa, which is most commonly used
*'''Harita''', [[Ambarisha]], Yuvanaswa.

== Harita Smriti ==

Sage Harita, son of Chyavana, wrote the Harita Smriti, a work of law, and taught his student, [[Bappa Rawal]] of Guhilot (later to be called Sisodia) martial arts and the four cardinal duties for the service of the state:{{cn|date=July 2016}}

# To follow the principles of Manav [[Dharma]] (the Religion of Man) and preserve [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] Culture. 
# To serve all God's Creations as a service to [[God]], the Creator of all life. 
# To endeavour constantly to keep the [[human]] soul awakened and alive, in order that human beings would value the Dignity of Man. 
# To help recognise Man's special status in the hierarchy of God's creations-the eternal principles underlying cosmic [[creation myth|creation]].

== The story of how he became a brahmin ==

This [[Sthalapuranam]] was narrated by Mudal (first) [[Thirthakar]] (priest) of the [[Sriperumpudur]] temple.

Once there lived a great King named Haritha; he was the grandson of King [[Ambareesha]], who is an ancestor of Sri Rama.

Once he was passing by a dense forest where he hears the shrill moaning of a cow. He goes in the direction where the voice was coming; he sees that a tiger has caught the cow and was about to kill the cow.

Since he is a [[Kshatriya]] and a king, he feels that it is his duty to protect the weak, and that there is no sin in killing the tiger. He aims at the tiger. Meanwhile, the tiger also  thinks it should do something that the king also suffers and with that it kills the cow and King Haritha kills the tiger.

Since he has witnessed the Go Hatya(Death of sacred cow) taking place, the king is affected by the Go Hathi [[Dosham]] (sin). He gets worried, when suddenly he hears an [[Asareeri]]  (Divine Voice) which asks him to proceed to [[Sathyavratha Kshetram]] and to take bath in [[Ananthah Sarasu]] and worship Lord [[Adhi Keshava]], whereby his sins will vanish.

King Harita goes back to [[Ayodhya]] and consults [[Vashishta]] Maharishi, who tells him about the [[Sriperumpudur Mahatyam]] and narrates how the [[Bhootha Ganas]] (those who serve Lord Shiva in Shiv Lok) got rid of their [[Saapam]] (curse) there,and also the route to that place. King Haritha then makes alternative arrangement to run the kingdom and proceeds to [[Sriperumpudur]] (near Chennai, Tamil Nadu).

He takes bath in [[Ananthah Sarasu]] and prays to Lord [[Adhi Kesava]]; after a while the merciful lord appears before Haritha Maharaja and instructs him on all the Mantras which would help in getting rid of the [[Dosham]]. He also says that though all these years he was a Kshtriya, due to his blessings he has  now become a Brahmin, and henceforth his descendants will also be Brahmins (even today his descendants are known as Brahmins of Haritha  Gothra). The Lord also gives [[Upadesham]] of all [[Mantras]] to him. Haritha Maharaja rebuilds the Adhi Kesava temple, and performs consecration of the temple on an auspicious day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sriperumpudur.ramanujartemples.net/sp.htm|title=spuranam|website=www.sriperumpudur.ramanujartemples.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume of Kretschmayr's work "The History of Venice" as "''Geschichte von Venedig''"  was published in 1905, the second was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] and did not appear until 1920, and for the destruction of his notes in a 1927 fire, the third not until 1933. Attempts to publish an Italian translation were equally star-crossed: both Kretschmayr and his Italian translator died in 1939, the project was put on hold during the [[World War II|Second World War]], then completed in the post-war years, but inexplicably never published. His work outgrew the 19th century tradition in historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Venetian History, 1400-1797|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ascAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=11 July 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-25252-3|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">'''Jacob Katz'''  ([[Hebrew]]: יעקב כ"ץ) (born 15 November 1904 in [[Magyargencs]], [[Hungary]], died 20 May 1998 in Israel) was a [[Jewish]] [[historian]] and [[educator]]. He established the history curriculum used in Israel's [[High School]]s.

Katz described "traditional society" and deployed sociological methods in his study of Jewish communities, with special attention to changes in [[halakhah]] (Jewish law) and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. He pioneered the modern study of Orthodoxy and its formation in reaction to [[Reform Judaism]].

==Years 1945-1950==
In the year 1945 Jacob Katz presented to a conference of historians his article "Marriage and Sexual Relations at the close of the Middle Ages" which was published that year in the periodical ''Zion''. Katz, who lived at that time in [[Tel Aviv]] and worked as a lecturer at College of Education, had already been credited with a few articles in the fields of education, psychology, and pedagogy, and their publication had given him a good reputation in the field. However, this reputation alone did not make him happy; he even suspected that it might distance him from what he craved most of all: to get back to engagement in history research. It was [[Ben-Zion Dinur]] who encouraged Katz not to give up on his research even in the absence of an academic post. Indeed, despite the difficulty of setting aside time for research, Katz succeeded in completing the article mentioned. Its publication in the pages of ''Zion'' gave rise to favourable responses, and even won Katz an invitation to the first International Congress of Jewish studies in Jerusalem in 1947. With hindsight it is possible to claim that Katz's article on "Marriage and Sexual Relations" in [[''Zion'']] paved the way for his joining the faculty of [[Hebrew University]]. At the approach of the academic year 1949-1950, the University invited Katz to serve as an adjunct instructor, offering him 25% of a full-time post.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Etkes&lt;/ref&gt;

Katz became a specialist in Jewish-gentile relations, the Jewish Enlightenment, or [[Haskalah]], [[anti-Semitism]], and the [[Holocaust]]. His works in [[Hebrew]] provide much of the basis for scholarly analyses of anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/studies/vol27/gutman.html Yisrael Gutman and Otto Dov Kulka&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
* In 1980, Katz was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for "history of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web|title=Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1980 (in Hebrew) |url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashlag/Tashmab_Tashlag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tasham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090813/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashlag/Tashmab_Tashlag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tasham |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonas Danilssønn Ramus''' (27 September 1649 - 16 May 1718) was a Norwegian priest, author and historian. He is principally known as an author of religious and historical writings. &lt;ref&gt;Hallgeir Elstad [http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Jonas_Ramus/utdypning ''Jonas Ramus'']   (Store norske leksikon)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ramus was born at [[Aukra]]  in [[Møre og Romsdal]], Norway. His parents were parish priest Danil Johnsen Ramus (d. 1654) and Anna Christensdatter Bernhoft (1624–1705). Ramus belonged a family of clerics, with the father, grandfather, stepfather and two brothers, clerics and scholars in various positions. He lost his father early, but her stepfather, Hans Olsen Brejer, took responsibility for his basic education. After studies at the [[Trondheim Cathedral School]], in 1665 he was discharged to the [[University of Copenhagen]] with two of his brothers. For the next 15 years, he is believed to have continued studying in [[Copenhagen]].

==Career==
[[File:Nordrehaug i Ringeriget - no-nb digimanus 73490.jpg|thumb|250 px| ''Nordrehaug i Ringeriget'' by [[Peter Andreas Brandt]]  (1792-1862]]
In the 1680s Ramus became personnel chaplain in [[Sørum|Sørum Church]] (''Sørum kirke'') in [[Romerike]] under the priest Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg.  From 1690 Ramus was senior priest of [[Norderhov|Norderhov Church]] (''Norderhov kirke'') at [[Ringerike (traditional district)|Ringerike]] in [[Buskerud]].  Ramus became a magistrate in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.broadpark.no/~ornulfs/PappasAner/f420.htm ''Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg'' (Family Group Sheet)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717034844/http://home.broadpark.no/~ornulfs/PappasAner/f420.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680, he published his first book, ''Naadens aandelige Markets-Tiid''. It quickly became popular and was issued in both Swedish and Danish editions. Ramus also wrote about the famous [[Maelstrom]] at [[Moskenstraumen]].  His work was read by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and featured in his  short story  ''[[A Descent into the Maelström]]'' (1841).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.eapoe.org/works/ingram/jhi74110.htm|title=   A Descent Into The Maelström|publisher=   The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black, vol. I, 1874, pp. 150-167 |author= John H. Ingram,  ed.  |accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps his best known book was  ''Norges Beskrivelse'' which contains a poem about a [[feral child]], ''Jostedalsrypa''. She was the only survivor  of  the [[Black Death]] in the remote valley of  [[Jostedal]] after of the [[Black Death]] (''Svartedauden'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Jostedalsrypa|title=  Jostedalsrypa|publisher=  lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Jostedalsrypa|title=  Jostedalsrypa|publisher=  Store norske leksikon|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://www.norgeshistorie.no/senmiddelalder/mennesker/1001-pesten-kommer.html|title=   Svartedauden |publisher=  Norges historie|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anna Colbjørnsdatter==
[[File:Ringerikes museum på Ringerike.JPG|thumb|250 px|Former Norderhov Rectory now Ringerikes Museum]]
In 1682, he married [[Anna Colbjørnsdatter]] (ca. 1667- 1736), the daughter of pastor Colbjørn Torstensen Arneberg (1628–1720) in Sørum.  They had five children: Ole (1683-1714), Daniel (1684-1727), Johanna (1685-1717), Christian (1686-1714) and Anna Sophie (1687-1722), all of whom were born in Sørum. Their son, Daniel Ramus  followed his father as a priest in Norderhov from 1717, when his father was sick. Ramus died in 1718 at [[Norderhov]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringeriksporten.no/Engelske_sider/Anna_Colbjornsdatter_Arneberg.htm ''Anna Colbjornsdatter Arneberg''] (RingeriksPorten) &lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Colbjørnsdatter became known for her role in the skirmish at Norderhov (''Slaget på Norderhov'') between Norwegian-Danish and Swedish forces on 29 March 1716. She and her family were residing in the Norderhov Rectory in Ringerike. Reportedly she alerted the Norwegians to the presence of the troops of King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the church yard at Norderhov, where they had taken shelter in and  around the rectory. The event itself was first published by [[Peter Andreas Munch]] in his book, ''Norges, Sveriges og Danmarks Historie til Skolebrug''  (1838).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringeriksporten.no/Engelske_sider/The_skirmish_at_Norderhov.htm ''Skirmish at Norderhov''] (RingeriksPorten) &lt;/ref&gt;

Her half-brothers, Hans Colbjørnsen (1675-1754) and  Peder Colbjørnsen (1683–1738), were successful timber merchants in [[Fredrikshald, Norway|Fredrikshald]]. Both were active in leading the civilian resistance to the Swedish attacks of Fredrikshald during 1716 and 1718. &lt;ref&gt; Frank Kiel Jacobsen [http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Hans_Colbj%C3%B8rnsen/utdypning ''Hans Colbjørnsen''] ( Norsk biografisk leksikon)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kiel Jacobsen [http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Peder_Colbj%C3%B8rnsen/utdypning ''Peder Colbjørnsen''] (Norsk biografisk leksikon)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''(John) Joseph Knight''' (1829–1907) was an English dramatic critic and theatre historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Knight, Joseph|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|page=999|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnzpt1;view=1up;seq=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joseph Knight's book-plate.jpg|thumb|Joseph Knight, from a book plate]]

==Life==
Born at [[Leeds]] on 24 May 1829, he was elder son of Joseph Knight, a cloth merchant from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], and Marianne, daughter of Joseph Wheelwright. He was educated at [[Bramham College]] near [[Tadcaster]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Knight, Joseph (1829-1907)|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining his father in business at age 19, Knight began collecting books. With [[Alfred Austin]], his junior by six years, he helped to found a [[Mechanics' Institute]] at Leeds, at which he lectured on literary subjects. On 7 April 1854 he lectured on ''The Fairies of English Poetry'' to the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. At Leeds, too, he made the acquaintance of [[William Edward Forster]], who stayed at Knight's house while he was parliamentary candidate for the constituency in 1859. Knight seconded Forster's nomination.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1860 Knight moved to London as a journalist. He found early employment as dramatic critic for the ''[[Literary Gazette]]'', through a chance meeting with the editor [[John Morley]]. He then concentrated on writing about the contemporary stage. In 1869 he succeeded [[John Abraham Heraud]], as dramatic critic of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'', and retained the post for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1871, during the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|siege of Paris]], Knight used his influence to secure the invitation to the [[Comedie Française]] to act at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in London. He also acted as dramatic critic for the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Globe (London newspaper)|The Globe]]'', and for the ''[[Daily Graphic]]'' from 1894 to 1906.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In London Knight moved in literary and dramatic circles. Early associates included [[John Westland Marston]] and [[Sebastian Evans]]. At Marston's house he met authors and playwrights; [[Thomas Purnell (critic)|Thomas Purnell]] introduced him to [[Swinburne]], to whom and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] he became close.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Knight contributed the causerie signed "Sylvanus Urban" to the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' from 1887 till near his death, and he was a reviewer of general literature for the ''Athenæum''. In July 1883, on the death of [[Henry Frederic Turle]], he became editor of ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', and retained the position for life. A bohemian and clubman, he was a leading member of the [[Arundel Club]]; after 1883, when he was elected to the [[Garrick Club]] (3 March), he was mainly found there. On 4 July 1905 the dramatic profession entertained him, as the oldest living dramatic critic, to dinner at the [[Savoy Hotel]]. [[Sir Henry Irving]] took the chair, and [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin]] and [[Gabrielle Réjane]] were among the guests.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;
[[File:Joseph Knight, F.S.A. (ætat 67).jpg|thumb|Joseph Knight, age 67]]
On 4 May 1893 Knight was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]]. A book collector through life, he twice had to sell up, on the second occasion in 1905. He died at his house, 27 Camden Square, on 23 June 1907, and was buried in [[Highgate cemetery]]. A posthumous portrait in oils by Margaret Grose was presented to the Garrick Club in 1912 by Knight's friend [[Henry Benjamin Wheatley]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Knight wrote on theatre history, and was the main contributor of the lives of actors to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', first edition and first supplement. His articles numbered over 500. The biography of [[David Garrick]] was the basis of a separate memoir (1894). He published in 1893 [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001692594 ''Theatrical Notes 1874-1879''] (1893), a collection of articles on the drama from the ''Athenæum'', and he edited in 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{worldcat|oclc=4825259|name=Roscius Anglicanus, or, An historical review of the stage from 1660 to 1706}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/4825259.html ''Roscius Anglicanus''] of [[John Downes (prompter)|John Downes]]. In 1887 Knight published the [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007648236 ''Life of Rossetti''] in the "[[Great Writers series]]".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
Knight married at the parish church, Leeds, on 3 June 1856, Rachel (d. 1911), youngest daughter of John Wilkinson of Gledhall Mount near Leeds. He had issue a son Philip Sidney, b. 2 Feb. 1857, who emigrated to Australia; and two daughters, Gertrude who married Ian Forbes Robertson, parents of [[Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale]]; and Florence Mabel, who married Edward Mansel Sympson, of Lincoln, on 3 October 1888.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The British Medical Journal |title=Births, Marriages, and Deaths |volume=2 |issue=1451 |date=20 October 1888 |page=914 |jstor=20217648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Justinas Staugaitis.jpg|thumb|200px|Justinas Staugaitis]]
'''Justinas Staugaitis''' (14 November 1866 near [[Šakiai]] – 8 July 1943, [[Telšiai]]) was a [[Lithuania]]n [[Roman Catholic]] [[bishop]], politician, educator, and author. He [[Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania|one of the twenty signatories]] to the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]].

Staugaitis graduated from the [[Sejny Theological Seminary]] and was [[ordain]]ed in 1890. At that time, the use of the written Lithuanian language was prohibited, and his cousin Antanas Saugaitis participated in the underground movements that smuggled in such books and periodicals (see [[Knygnešiai]]). He then served as a curate in a number of parishes in Lithuania and [[Poland]].

In [[Marijampolė]], he founded the educational [[Žiburys Society]], and was instrumental in founding several schools, an old age home, and an orphanage. From 1909 to 1912 he served on the editorial staff of the periodical ''Vadovas'' (The Guide). At the [[Vilnius Conference]] in 1917, he was elected to the [[Council of Lithuania]], and signed the Act of Independence in 1918.

As a member of the Christian Democratic Party, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1920, serving alternately as speaker or deputy speaker. In 1926 Staugaitis was consecrated Bishop of Telšiai, a newly formed [[diocese]] in northwestern Lithuania that had been part of the [[Samogitia]]n diocese. He established a [[Telšiai Bishop Vincentas Borisevičius Priest Seminary|theological seminary in Telšiai]] and contributed numerous articles to periodicals, as well as writing several books. These included a history of the church, a history of the Lithuanian State Council, and a novel depicting the life of a loyal priest.

When the Jews of Telsiai turned to Staugaitis for help after the German invasion of the city in 1941, he refused to help them. He also actively participated in their degradation on 13 July 1941, two days before the mass murder of the Jewish men of the city.&lt;ref name=Telsiai&gt;{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kwz0OlESYR4uwCmJ0XltQaWLpH0yyse-8oWyORkR7c4/edit |title=Telsiai |accessdate=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karen Yuzbashyan''' ({{lang-hy|Կարեն Նիկիտի Յուզբաշյան}}, {{IPA-hy|kaɾen juzbaʃˈjan}}; {{lang-ru|Карен Никитич Юзбашян}}; January 6, 1927 &amp;ndash; March 5, 2009) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[historian]]-[[oriental studies|orientalist]] and expert on medieval [[Byzantine]]-Armenian relations. Yuzbashyan was the author of over 200 books and articles in his lifetime (published in Armenian, Russian, and other languages) on the political, legal, and cultural aspects and relations of the two countries and a researcher on the development of [[Armenian studies]].

==Biography and scholarly activity==
Born in [[Tiflis]] into the family of an engineer (originally from [[Shusha]]) in 1927, Yuzbashyan attended [[Yerevan State University]] from 1946 to 1948 and studied at [[Leningrad State University]] (now Saint Petersburg State University) from 1948 to 1951, receiving his degree in history.&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;{{Ru icon}} Friends and Colleagues. "[http://caucasica.orientalstudies.ru/rus/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2235&amp;Itemid=48 Умер К.Н.Юзбашян]." [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]]. March 29, 2009. Accessed April 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked and carried out research at the [[Matenadaran]] in [[Yerevan]] beginning in 1955 until he transferred to the Leningrad branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies in 1958.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} Hakobyan, A. ''«Յուզբաշյան, Կարեն Նիկիտի»'' (Yuzbashyan, Karen Nikiti). [[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]]. vol. viii. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1982, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he received his ''[[doktor nauk]]'' after defending his thesis on the work of the eleventh century Armenian historian [[Aristakes Lastivertsi]]. Four years later, he was promoted to the head of the group for Historical and Cultural Studies at Leningrad's Department of Near Eastern Studies.&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt; From 1981 to 1991, Yuzbashyan headed the Leningrad branch of the Palestine Society. Just prior to the Soviet Union's collapse, Yuzbashyan was elected into the [[Armenian parliament]] and he served there for a term of five years (1990–1995).&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt;

Yuzbashyan's works spanned the early and medieval eras of Armenia's history. In 1963, he published the first critical edition of the Aristakes Lastivertsi's history (in the original [[classical Armenian]] language); he also translated Aristakes' work into Russian in 1968.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1988, Yuzbashyan published a highly important work on the [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia]] and its relations with the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt; Working at the Russian Academy of Sciences, he wrote in many international journals and participated in and organized numerous international congresses and conferences. He taught at Saint Petersburg State University and was the doctoral adviser of many students who entered the field of Byzantine studies. His most recent work (2005) was the compilation and cataloging of [[Armenian illuminated manuscript]]s at the university.

In addition to works concerning Armenia's history, Yuzbashyan also completed a biography on his mentor, [[Joseph Orbeli]], in 1964.

{{History of Japan |image=Shoso-in.jpg |caption=[[Shōsōin]]}}

{{nihongo|'''Kōka'''|弘化|}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号,|''nengō'',|literally "year name"}} after ''[[Tenpō]]'' and before ''[[Kaei]].''  This period spanned the years from December 1844 through  February 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005).

==Change of era==
* '''December 2, 1844''' ({{nihongo|''Kōka gannen''|弘化元年}}): The new era name of ''Kōka'', meaning "Becoming Wide or Vast", was created to mark a fire at [[Edo Castle]] in ''Tenpō 15.''

The nengo was not changed concurrent with the accession of Emperor Komei; instead, the Kōka era was retained until about a year after the new emperor was enthroned.&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Donald.

A '''historical state''' or '''historical sovereign state''' is a state that once existed, but has since been dissolved due to conflict, war, rebellion, annexation, or uprising.

This page lists [[sovereign states]], [[country|countries]], [[nation]]s, [[empire]]s or [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] that have ceased to exist as political entities, grouped geographically and by constitutional nature.
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Criteria for inclusion==
The criteria for inclusion in this list is similar to that of the [[List of states with limited recognition]]. To be included here, a polity must have claimed statehood and either:
* had de facto control over a territory, a population, a government, a capacity to enter into relations with other states, or
* have been recognised as a state by at least one other state.

For purposes of this list, the cutoff between medieval and early modern states is the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.

==Ancient and medieval states==
* [[List of sovereign states in the 35th century BC]]
* [[List of Bronze Age states]]
* [[List of Classical Age states]]
* [[List of Iron Age states]]
* [[List of states during Late Antiquity]]
* [[List of states during the Middle Ages]]

==Modern states and territories by geography==

|-
|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]
|The whole of North America (including the [[Inuit]] of the Arctic).
|[[Native Americans in the United States]] and the [[First Nations]] of Canada had established varying levels of governmental organization before contact with Europeans. The most advanced civilizations of North America were represented by the [[indigenous peoples in Mexico]] and [[Central America]].
| All the native peoples were eventually incorporated into the United States, Mexico, Canada and Central America, but many retain various levels of self-government and autonomy within those nations.
|
|-
|[[Cahokia]]
|[[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]] and parts of [[Ohio]].
|The population of the town at Cahokia exploded circa 1050 AD, indicating the establishment of a large "chiefdom".
|The population of Cahokia dispersed in the 14th century, indicating the decline of the Cahokia "chiefdom".
|Other political bodies existed in the [[Mississippian culture]]; the Mississippian culture article has a list of [[Mississippian culture#Known Mississippian chiefdoms|Known Mississippian Chiefdoms]].
|-
|[[Wyandot people|Huron]] Confederacy
|Central [[Ontario]].
|Confederacy of five [[Iroquoian]] tribes and several smaller groups. Controlled trade in corn and furs in the upper Great Lakes area and sporadically through the Ottawa and St. Lawrence River valleys.
|The Hurons were dispersed by the Iroquois in 1649. Many fled to the northern Lake Michigan region and Quebec, while a large group joined the Iroquois.
|
|-
|[[File:Flag_of_the_Iroquois_Confederacy.svg|20px|border]] [[Iroquois]] Confederacy
|[[Upstate New York]] and surrounding areas.
|Formed before European contact; arguably as early as 31 August 1142, though also likely sometime in the 15th to 17th centuries.
|The [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], signed in 1794, established relations between the United States government and the Iroquois; the treaty is still in force, though the Confederacy is no longer effectively an independent nation.

|Originally in the southeastern United States, primarily [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]], and parts of [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]]. Parts of The Nation (and its government structures) ended up in present-day [[Oklahoma]].
|The original Cherokee Nation was unified from an interrelated society of city-states in the late 18th century. They enjoyed relatively peaceful relations with the Spanish, British, French, and later (with the exception of the [[Chickamauga Indian|Chickamauga factions]]), to the U.S.
|The modern [[Cherokee Nation]], the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] and the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]] are the three federally recognized tribal successors to the original Cherokee Nation, being somewhat autonomous within the United States.

The '''Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry''', also known as the '''Berger Inquiry''' after its head Justice [[Thomas R. Berger|Thomas Berger]], was commissioned by the [[Government of Canada]] on March 21, 1974 to investigate the social, environmental, and economic impact of a proposed [[gas]] pipeline that would run through the [[Yukon]] and the [[Mackenzie River]] Valley of the [[Northwest Territories]]. This proposed pipeline became known as the [[Mackenzie Valley Pipeline]].

The inquiry cost C$5.3&amp;nbsp;million, and produced over 40,000 pages of text and evidence, comprising 283&amp;nbsp;volumes. The commission recommended that no pipeline be built through the northern Yukon and that a pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley should be delayed for 10&amp;nbsp;years.

==Proceeding==
The commissioner of the inquiry was Justice Thomas Berger. Justice Berger heard testimony from diverse groups with an interest in the pipeline. Fourteen groups became full participants in the inquiry, attending all meetings and testifying before the commission. The inquiry was notable for the voice it gave to the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal people]] whose traditional territory the pipeline would traverse. 

Berger travelled extensively in the North in preparation for the hearings. He took his commission to all 35 communities along the Mackenzie River Valley, as well as in other cities across Canada, to gauge public reaction. In his travels he met with aboriginal (i.e. [[Dene]], [[Inuit]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]) and non-aboriginal residents. He held formal hearings in [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories|Yellowknife]] to get the views of experts about the proposal. Following this, he held community hearings across the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and this played an important role in shaping his views.

==Findings==
Berger's report first volume was released on June 9, 1977 and followed with a second volume several months later. Titled ''Northern Frontier, Northern Homeland'', the two-volume report highlighted the fact that while the Mackenzie Valley could be the site of the "biggest project in the history of [[Capitalism|free enterprise]]," it was also home to many peoples whose lives would be immeasurably changed by the pipeline. 

===Environmental impact===
The Berger Report concluded that the northern Yukon was too susceptible to environmental harm. Berger cautioned that a gas pipeline would be a precursor to an [[oil pipeline]]. The energy transportation corridor thus created would require an immense infrastructure of roads, airports, maintenance bases and new settlements to support it. The impact on the [[ecosystem]] (both the natural habitat and its people) would be equivalent to building a railway across Canada. The commission even recommended that no energy corridor be built in the Mackenzie Delta region. At the same time, the commission saw no significant environmental risk further south through the Mackenzie Valley. Berger suggested that a number of sanctuaries and protected areas be created for [[threatened species|threatened]] and [[endangered species]], particularly [[Porcupine caribou]], white whales, several bird species, and other animals inhabiting the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] ([[ANWR]]).

===Economic impact===
The commission found no significant economic benefit from the pipelines. The report concluded that large-scale projects based on [[non-renewable energy]] sources rarely provide long-term employment, and that those locals that did find work during construction could only fill low-skill, low-wage positions. In addition, Berger feared that pipeline development would undermine local economies which relied on hunting, fishing, and trapping, possibly even increasing economic hardship in the area. Berger ultimately found that the economy of the region would not be harmed by ''not'' building the pipeline.

===Social impact===
The commission believed that the pipeline process had not taken native culture seriously, and that any development needed to conform to the wishes of those who lived there. Berger predicted that the "social consequences of the pipeline will not only be serious&amp;mdash;they will be devastating." The commission was particularly concerned about the role of natives in development plans. At the time the report was released, there were several ongoing negotiations over native land claims in the area, and Berger suggested that pipeline construction be delayed until those claims were settled. The commission found that the local population would not accept development activity without some native control. In addition, land claims were part of a broader native rights issues that needed to be settled between the government and the [[First Nations]]. In Berger's view, rapid development in the north would preclude settlement of these important issues due to the influx of non-native populations and growing business interests.

==Recommendations==
Justice Berger recommended a ten-year moratorium to deal with critical issues&amp;mdash;such as settling Aboriginal [[land claim]]s and setting aside key [[Conservation ethic|conservation areas]]&amp;mdash;before attempting to build the proposed pipeline.

Initiated in 1999 by Aboriginal leaders from across the Northwest Territories, the Mackenzie Gas Project constitutes the second attempt to build a gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley.

'''María Martina Ibaibarriaga Elorriaga''' (26 January 1788 – 6 June 1849) was a Spanish guerrilla leader during the [[Peninsular War]] (1807–14).
A legend later grew up that she pretended to be a man, enlisted in the Spanish army, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Life==

María Martina Ibaibarriaga Elorriaga was a native of [[Berriz]], Biscay.{{sfn|Estornés Lasa|2013}}
She was born on 26 January 1788.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}

In 1810 Martina Ibaibarriaga's family was based in [[Durango, Biscay]].
The French arrested and interrogated them, and found that Martina, dressed as a man, had joined the band of the guerrilla Belard, "''El manco''".
The next year Ibaibarriaga was in command of her own force of 50 men.
The municipalities complained to the guerrilla leaders that her fighters were taking rations and supplies by force, without paying. 
As a result, the guerrillas of [[Francisco Espoz y Mina]] captured Ibaibarriaga in [[Munguía]], Biscay on 3 July 1811 and took her to a gathering of guerrilla chiefs at [[Villarcayo]], Burgos.
The leaders included Espoz y Mina, [[Francisco de Longa]], Isidoro Salazar and Ignacio de Cuevillas.
Eight of Ibaibarriaga's men were executed by firing squad, but she was spared.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}

Ibaibarriaga was allowed to serve under Longa for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Esdaile|2014|p=114}}
She joined the ''División de Iberia'', Longa's guerrilla force.
She met Lieutenant Félix Asenjo of [[Oña]], Burgos early in 1812.
He had been sent by the Spanish government to instruct new guerrillas.
They married in March 1812.
She participated in the battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}
After the war Ibaibarriaga left the army. 
She and her husband went to live in Oña, where their son Francisco Asenjo Ibaibarriaga was born.
A record of her post-war trial for banditry, at which she was acquitted, is held in the Historical Archives of Pamplona. 
[[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] gave her the honorary title of captain.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}
In 1825 she was granted a state pension.{{sfn|Gaceta de Madrid 1825|p=147}}
She died in Oña on 6 June 1849.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}

In December 1977 a street in Vitoria was named after her.{{sfn|Estornés Lasa|2013}}
The street is wrongly named "Coronela Ibaibarriaga".{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}

==Legend==

Many of the misconceptions about Martina de Ibaibarriaga are due to her grandson, Ricardo Blanco Asenjo, who wrote a fictional story of his grandmother in the Madrid periodical ''El Imparcial'' dated 7 May 1883.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}
It was said that her father and brother, who ran a pharmacy in Bilbao, were killed by the French in August 1808. This is almost certainly a later embellishment to her story.
It is also untrue that she disguised herself as a man under the name of "Manuel Martinez" or that after reaching the rank of captain her sex was discovered at the siege of Zaragoza.
It is known that she joined the guerrillas without hiding her sex, as did other women.{{sfn|Sánchez Arreseigor|2010|pp=182–185}}

More legends and misconceptions: 
-Ibaibarriaga was commissioned in the Spanish army disguised as a man.{{sfn|Esdaile|2014|p=114}}
-She took the name of "Manuel Martínez".{{sfn|Egaña|2005|p=242}}
-She is the only known example in the [[Peninsular War]] of a woman enlisting and serving as a man.{{sfn|Esdaile|2014|p=118}}
-She was seriously wounded during the [[Second Siege of Zaragoza]] in 1809 and her true identity was discovered.{{sfn|Estornés Lasa|2013}}
When she fought in the [[Battle of Vitoria]]  she came to the attention of General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] Francisco de Longa played a joke on Wellington, praising the courage of "Martin" before revealing that she was a woman. The truth is that Wellington was several kilometers away from the area where Longa's troops fought and could not see Martina in combat. Longa and Wellington did not meet in person until several weeks later.
-She reached the rank of lieutenant colonel.{{sfn|Cantos Casenave|Durán López|Romero Ferrer|2006|p=183}}

'''Mustafa Edige Kirimal''' (1911 [[Bakhchysarai]]–1980 [[Munich]]) was a [[Crimea]]n-born politician.

Kirimal is best known for his meticulous research and publications on the history of [[Crimean Tatars]] in the first half of the 20th century. He served as the editor of Dergi, one of the publications of the Institute for the Study of the [[USSR]] in [[Munich]], and was among the first scholars to explore the fate of ethnic minorities living in the [[Soviet Union]].

== Early life ==
Edige's father Mustafa Shinkievich, who was descended from a Lithuanian Tatar or [[Lipka Tatars|Polish Tatar]] family, had moved to [[Crimea]] before [[World War I]]. He was a descendent of soldiers under the command of the [[Golden Horde#Great troubles .281359–1381.29|Golden Horde Khan Toktamish]] who had fled to [[Lithuania]] in the late 14th century.

Born in [[Bakhchysarai|Bahçesaray]] in 1911, Edige received his early education in Dereköy, near [[Yalta]] and graduated from the Russian gymnasium in Yalta. He enrolled in the Institute of Pedagogy in [[Simferopol]], now the [[Crimea State Medical University named after S. I. Georgievsky|Crimea State Medical University]], but his involvement in [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] nationalist activities made it impossible for him to remain in Crimea.

== Exile Years ==

The Soviet repression, marked by the arrest, execution and deportation of thousands of Tatars, forced Edige to flee to [[Azerbaijan]] and then to [[Iran]]. He arrived in [[Istanbul]] in 1932. Two years later, he joined his uncle Yakup Shinkievich, who was serving in [[Vilnius]], a city then under Polish rule. Edige graduated from the University of Vilnius with a degree in [[political science]] in 1939. Following the invasion of Poland by German forces in September 1939, he left for [[Berlin]] and then for Istanbul. During the German occupation of Ukraine and Crimea (1941–44), Kirimal was active in Germany, trying to secure rights and protection for the Crimean Tatars, and later helped refugees from Crimea settle in German camps. [[Gerhard von Mende]] give him the title "President of the Crimean Tatar National Central Committee".

== After World War ==

After [[World War II]] ended, Kirimal pursued his graduate studies and received his doctorate degree from the [[University of Münster]] in Germany. His often quoted monograph, 'Der Nationale Kampf der Krim-türken - The National Struggle of the Crimean Tatars' (Emsdetten/Westfalen, 1952), was based on his [[Thesis|dissertation]]. He joined the staff of the newly founded Institute for the Study of the USSR (Institut zur Erforschung de UdSSR) in Munich in 1954 and became the editor of "Dergi", the Institute's publication in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Kirimal published numerous articles on the history of Crimean Tatars under Russian and Soviet rule.

He was fluent in Turkish, [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[German language|German]]. He retired in 1972 when the Institute closed, and died in 1980 in Munich, where he was living in exile. His body was transported from Munich to [[Simferopol]] via Istanbul by the Westeuropean Crimean Tatar Cultural Center in 2007, 27 years later.

'''Natalie Zemon Davis''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC}}  (born 8 November 1928) is a Canadian and American historian of the [[early modern period]]. She is currently an Adjunct Professor of History and Anthropology and Professor of Medieval Studies at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada. Her work originally focused on France, but has since broadened to include other parts of Europe, North America, and the [[Caribbean]]. For example, ''Trickster Travels'' (2006) views Italy, Spain, [[Morocco]] and other parts of North Africa and West Africa through the lens of [[Leo Africanus]]'s pioneering [[geography]]. It has appeared in four translations, with three more on the way. Davis' books have all been translated into other languages: twenty-two for ''The Return of [[Martin Guerre]].'' She is a hero to many historians and academics, as "one of the greatest living historians", constantly asking new questions and taking on new challenges, the second female president of the [[American Historical Association]] (the first, [[Nellie Neilson]], was in 1943) and someone who "has not lost the integrity and commitment to radical thought which marked her early career".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Kwantes, "'Everything I do is directed towards making the world a better place': Interview with [[Lisa Jardine]]," ''NIAS Newsletter'', Fall 2008, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been awarded the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] and [[National Humanities Medal]] and been named Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].

==Life==
Davis was born in [[Detroit]] into a middle-class family, the daughter of 19th century [[Jewish-American|Jewish]] immigrants to the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She attended [[Cranbrook Kingswood School|Kingswood School Cranbrook]] and was subsequently educated at [[Smith College]], [[Radcliffe College]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Michigan]], from which she received her PhD in 1959. In 1948, she married [[Chandler Davis]].&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book | title=A Brief History of History | publisher=The [[Lyons Press]] | author=Wells, Colin | year=2008 | pages=294–5, 298–304 | isbn=9781599211220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and Davis had difficulties in the U.S. during the era of the [[Red Scare]]. He lost his professorship in Michigan, and in the 1960s, they moved to Canada (Toronto) with their three children.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;

Natalie Zemon Davis subsequently taught at [[Brown University]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]], and from 1978 to her retirement in 1996, at [[Princeton University]], where she became the Henry Charles Lea Professor of History and director of the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies. In addition to courses in the history of early modern France, she has taught or co-taught courses in history and anthropology, early modern Jewish social history, and history and film.  She has also been an important figure in the study of the history of women and gender, founding with [[Jill Ker Conway]] a course in that subject in 1971 at the University of Toronto: one of the first in North America.  Since her retirement, she has been living in [[Toronto]], where she is Adjunct Professor of History and Anthropology and Professor of Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto.

==Research interests==

Natalie Davis' main interests are in [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history]], especially of those previously ignored by historians. She makes use of numerous sources such as judicial records, plays, notarial records, tax rolls, early printed books and [[pamphlets]], autobiographies and folk tales. She is a proponent of cross-disciplinary history, which consists of combining history with disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]] and [[literary theory]]. In her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France'' (1975), she explored the lives of artisans and peasants: their relation to the Protestant Reformation, their carnivals, uprisings, and religious violence, and the impact of printing on their ways of thinking.

In her book best known to the public, ''The Return of Martin Guerre'' (1983), she followed a celebrated case of a [[Martin Guerre|16th-century impostor]] in a village in the [[Pyrénées]] so as to see how peasants thought about personal identity. Often linked with [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s microhistory ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'' about the radical miller Menocchio, Davis's book grew out of her experience as historical consultant for Daniel Vigne's film ''[[The Return of Martin Guerre|Le retour de Martin Guerre]]''. Her book first appeared in French in 1982 at the same time as the premiere of the film.

Davis's interest in story-telling continued with her book, ''Fiction in the Archives: [[Pardon]] Tales and their Tellers in 16th-century France'' (1987), a study of the stories people of all classes told to the king to get pardoned for homicide in the days before manslaughter was a possible plea.  In her ''Women on the Margins ''(1995), she looked at the autobiographical accounts of three 17th-century women – the Jewish merchant [[Glückel of Hameln|Glikl Hamel]], the Catholic nun [[Marie Guyart|Marie de l'Incarnation]], who came to New France, and the Protestant [[entomologist]]-artist [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]—and discussed the role of religion in their lives.

Davis's studies of the past have sometimes had present-day resonance.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to demonstrate "resonance," or else the sentence needs to be removed for editorializing|date=October 2013}} Her book on ''The Gift in Sixteenth-Century France'' (2000) is both a picture of gifts and bribes in the 16th century and a discussion of a viable mode of exchange different from the market. In ''Trickster Travels'' (2006), she describes how the early 16th-century North African Muslim "[[Leo Africanus]]" (Hasan al-Wazzan) managed to live as a Christian in Italy after he was kidnapped by Christian [[pirates]] and also sees his writings as an example of "the possibility of communication and curiosity in a world divided by violence." In 2017, she served as historical consultant for [[Wajdi Mouawad]]'s new play ''Tous des Oiseaux'' that premiered in Paris at the Théâtre de La Colline. Set in present-day New York and Jerusalem, the play follows a German/Israeli family  riven by conflict when the geneticist son wants to marry an Arab-American woman who is doing her doctoral dissertation on Hassan al-Wazzan/[[Leo Africanus]], the subject of Davis' ''Trickster Travels''&lt;ref&gt;Christian Rioux, "Wajid Mouawad triomphe a Paris,"''Le Devoir'', December 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Her book (in-process), ''Braided Histories'' on 18th-century [[Suriname]] studies [[social network|networks]] of communication and association among families, both [[slave]] and free, on the [[plantations]] of Christian and Jewish settlers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forward.com/articles/a-star-historian-opens-a-new-chapter-jewish-slave&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Davis's historical writings are extensively researched, she sometimes resorts to speculation, using analogous evidence and inserting words like "perhaps" and phrases like "she may have thought." Some critics of her work find this troubling and think that this practice threatens the empirical base of the historian's profession.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to demonstrate this fact|date=October 2013}}  Davis's answer to this is suggested in her 1992 essay "Stories and the Hunger to Know," where she argues both for the role of interpretation by historians and their essential quest for evidence about the past: both must be present and acknowledged to keep people from claiming that they have an absolute handle on "truth." She opened her ''Women on the Margins'' with an imaginary dialogue, in which her three subjects upbraid her for her approach and for putting them in the same book.  In her ''Slaves on Screen'' (2000), Davis maintains that feature films can provide a valuable way of telling about the past, what she calls "thought experiments," but only so long as they are connected with general historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Literary Criticism'' vol. 204, "Special issue on Natalie Zemon Davis, 1928–", pp. 1–65 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2010, Davis was awarded the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]], worth 4.5 million Norwegian kroner (~$700,000 US), for her narrative approach to the field of history. The awards citation described her as "one of the most creative historians writing today" who inspired younger generations of historians and promoted "cross-fertilization between disciplines". The citation said her compelling narrative "shows how particular events can be narrated and analyzed so as to reveal deeper historical tendencies and underlying patterns of thought and action".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2010/03/16/davis-scholar-university-toronto-holberg-prize-history-norway.html?ref=rss CBC Arts, "U of T Scholar Wins $768,000 Holberg Prize."]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2012, Davis was named Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], the highest class within the order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/06/29/rideau-hall-order-of-canada.html?ref=rss CBC Canada, "Ralph Klein, Pat Quinn named to Order of Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2013, Davis was awarded the 2012 [[National Humanities Medal]] by President [[Barack Obama]] for "her insights into the study of history and her exacting eloquence in bringing the past into focus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/03/president-obama-award-2012-national-medal-arts-and-national-humanities-m President Obama to Award 2012 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal] [[White House]]. Retrieved 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2013, Davis was awarded an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews.

This is a list of tables of the '''oldest people''' in the world in ordinal ranks. To avoid including [[Longevity claims|false or unconfirmed claims of extreme old age]], names here are restricted to those people whose ages have been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research, such as the [[Gerontology Research Group]] (GRG) or ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' (GWR), and others who have otherwise been [[WP:RS|reliably sourced]].

According to this criterion, the longest human lifespan is that of [[Jeanne Calment]] of [[France]] (1875–1997), who lived to the age of 122 years, 164 days. She met [[Vincent van Gogh]] when she was 12 or 13.&lt;ref name="Calment"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitney |first=Craig R. |date=5 August 1997 |title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received news media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the records of her native city, [[Arles]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=[[Jean-Marie Robine|Robine, Jean-Marie]]; Allard, Michel |year=1999 |title=Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm|location=Odense |publisher=[[University Press of Southern Denmark]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence of Calment's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian, such that her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world's oldest people.&lt;ref name="Calmentthoroughly"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Michael D. |date=1 December 2008 |title=You Say You Want to Live for a Long Time? |url=http://www.gasdetection.com/news2/health_news_digest184.html |publisher=Health News Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Life_expectancy#Sex_differences|women live longer than men on average]], combined records for both sexes are predominated by women. The longest undisputed lifespan for a man is that of [[Jiroemon Kimura]] of [[Japan]] (1897–2013), who died at age 116 years, 54 days.

Since the death of 117-year-old Chiyo Miyako of Japan on 22 July 2018, 115-year-old [[Kane Tanaka]], also of Japan, born 2 January 1903, is the oldest living person in the world whose age has been documented. Since the death of 113-year-old [[List of Spanish supercentenarians#Francisco Núñez Olivera|Francisco Núñez Olivera]] of Spain on 29 January 2018, 113-year-old [[List of Japanese supercentenarians#Masazō Nonaka|Masazō Nonaka]] of Japan, born 25 July 1905, is the world's oldest verified living man.

Systematic verification of longevity has only been practiced in recent decades and only in certain parts of the world. All ten of these people are women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11009">'''Settlement schools''' are [[social reform]] institutions established in rural [[Appalachia]] in the early 20th century with the purpose of educating mountain children and improving their isolated rural communities.

Settlement schools have played an important role in preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of southern and central Appalachia. Scholar David Whisnant has argued that settlement schools created a version of "traditional" Appalachian culture that appealed to outsiders but had little basis in the values of Appalachian people themselves.&lt;ref name=FlavellCulture&gt;Judy Flavell, [http://www.ket.org/settlement/setschools_04.html Settlement Schools and the Culture of the Mountains], KET-TV website, accessed August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Appalachian settlement schools were inspired by the [[settlement movement]] that started in [[London]] in the late 19th century and was represented in the United States by urban settlement houses, including [[Hull House]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Henry Street Settlement]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Hindmanhistory&gt;[http://www.hindmansettlement.org/about_us/mission.html Mission and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519200245/http://www.hindmansettlement.org/about_us/mission.html |date=2008-05-19 }}, Hindman Settlement School website&lt;/ref&gt; A large fraction of settlement schools were founded as [[Christian mission]]s and had a religious purpose in addition to a social welfare purpose.&lt;ref name=FlavellCulture/&gt;

Possibly the earliest manifestation of the settlement movement in southern Appalachia was the Log Cabin Settlement near [[Asheville, North Carolina]], started in September 1894 by Susan Chester. Chester, a graduate of [[Vassar College]], had experience with urban settlements in the northeastern United States. She considered the people of rural Appalachia to be "the purest Americans to be found" and envisioned her Log Cabin Settlement as an opportunity to "revive the weaving industry... and provide a good library for the community" in cooperation with a mission chapel and district school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/web_exhibits/writers_and_mountains/07_insider_outsider/insider__outsider2.htm |title=INSIDER &amp; OUTSIDER, FRESH AIR, QUARE WOMEN, &amp; THE COUNTRY LIFE MOVEMENT |publisher=Special Collections &amp; University Archives, University of North Carolina, Asheville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hindman Settlement School]], in [[Hindman, Kentucky]], is considered the first rural social settlement school in the [[United States]], established in 1902 by [[May Stone (educator)|May Stone]] and [[Katherine Pettit]] at the forks of Troublesome Creek in [[Knott County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Hindmanhistory/&gt;

The women's fraternity [[Pi Beta Phi]] opened the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]], in 1912 to provide education, economic opportunity, and health care to the rural area at the edge of the [[Great Smoky Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pibetaphi.org/philanthropies/arrowmont.html Arrowmont] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010104404/http://www.pibetaphi.org/philanthropies/arrowmont.html |date=2007-10-10 }} from the Pi Beta Phi web site&lt;/ref&gt;  The school also conducted arts and crafts classes in an effort to preserve and promote the region's crafts tradition.

[[Pine Mountain Settlement School]], in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]], was founded by [[William Creech, Sr.]], in 1913. Creech, a local resident, donated land for the school and recruited Katherine Pettit and [[Ethel DeLong]] to establish and run the institution.&lt;ref name=PineMtnHistory&gt;[http://www.pinemountainsettlementschool.com/history.php History], Pine Mountain Settlement School website&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement schools typically had large [[campus]]es, including [[dormitories]] for boarding students.&lt;ref name=KETsetschools&gt;[http://www.ket.org/settlement/setschools_01.html The Appalachian Settlement Schools], KET, Lexington, Kentucky&lt;/ref&gt; They functioned not only as schools, but also as community centers.&lt;ref name=KETsetschools/&gt;

With the establishment of [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s in the region in the 1920s and 1930s, settlement schools relinquished their role in the general education of children. Pine Mountain was a [[boarding school]] for elementary and [[middle school]]-age children until about 1930, when it became a residential [[high school]] after public elementary schools were established in the region.&lt;ref name=PineMtnHistory/&gt; Some settlement schools closed, but others assumed new functions over time.&lt;ref name=KETcurrent/&gt; Hindman Settlement School offers [[adult education]], including [[GED]] test preparation, and operates a tutorial program for people with [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref name=Hindmanhistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=KETcurrent/&gt; Since the early 1970s Pine Mountain Settlement School has specialized in [[environmental education]]; it also has operated an [[elderhostel]] program.&lt;ref name=PineMtnHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=KETcurrent&gt;Jennifer Minton, [http://www.ket.org/settlement/setschools_05.html The Current Roles of Settlement Schools], KET, Lexington, Kentucky&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pi Beta Phi Settlement School began an extension called the Craft Work Shop in 1945 in cooperation with the [[University of Tennessee]];&lt;ref name=knoxnews&gt;Josh Flory, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/16/pi-beta-phi-fraternity-sell-arrowmont-land/ Pi Beta Phi fraternity to sell Arrowmont land], Knoxville News Sentinel, August 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; it is now an independent [[nonprofit organization]] known as the [[Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts]] that provides college and graduate-level courses in arts and crafts.&lt;ref name=knoxnews/&gt;

== Location ==
The museum is situated in three [[Middle Ages]] buildings, remains of a former castle as part of the town walls of Rapperswil, as of today in the so-called ''Breny house'', a [[keep]], and in the ''Breny tower'' and an intermediate section that was a [[battlement]] of the town wall at ''Herrenberg'' hill. The buildings are situated between [[Schloss Rapperswil]], [[Stadtpfarrkirche Rapperswil]] and ''Engelplatz'' square.

== Breny house and Breny tower ==
Breny house and Breny tower are part of the remains of the northeastern town walls of the medieval city of [[Rapperswil]]. The buildings date back to early 13th century AD, when the lords of Russikon (Russinger) built a [[keep|residential tower]] respectively a small [[castle]] as servants (Ministerials) of the [[Counts of Rapperswil]]. In its present form, it was built in 1492 by the knight Hans of [[Landenberg]] from the [[Töss Valley]] replacing the former seat of the lords of Russikon. The Landenberg family officiated in Rapperswil as mayors and councils to 1530. Subsequent occupants were from 1530 to 1660 the Göldlin family, then the Good family, and from 1758 the Breny family. The former castle with its {{convert|28|m|ft|0}} high residential tower at the so-called ''Herrenberg'' ("[[Rapperswil Castle|castle hill]]") marked in the 16th century the urban expansion of the [[Middle Ages]] city to the northeast. The buildings were part of the northeasterly town walls at the bay of [[Kempraten]] on [[Lake Zürich]] shore heading to the so-called ''Herrenbergtor'' gate (broken in 1848).&lt;ref name="kulturbaukasten"&gt;[http://www.kulturbaukasten.ch/ Kulturbaukasten Rapperswil-Jona, 36&amp;nbsp;Museen ohne Dach]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largely conserved residential facilities date back to the 16th century when the castle was owned by Thuring Göldli. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] hall with beamed ceiling and flower garlands, like the other rooms in the initial stage of construction, is largely preserved. The living room is decorated with late Gothic and partly overpainted wall painting among them the [[coats of arms]] of the Landenberg and Hünenberg families (as of 1492). The Breny room ("Breny-Stube") and the Landenberg room (as of 1503) are in their original condition.&lt;ref name="kulturbaukasten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|23797|Göldli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|21865|Göldli, Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first [[Rapperswil Rose Gardens|roses in Rapperswil]] blossom at the Breny tower and at the [[Stadtpfarrkirche Rapperswil]] next to the [[Schloss Rapperswil]] because their medieval sandstone walls are exposed to the sun all through the year.

== Museum of local history and art ==

=== History ===
Under the patronage of the transport association (''Verkehrsverein'') [[Rapperswil-Jona]], the museum was established in 1943 as "Heimatmuseum lokaler Geschichte und Kunst" (museum of local history and art). As a legacy of the sisters Paulina and Henrika Breny, the buildings, as of today commonly called "Breny-Haus" and "Breny-Turm", are situated at former ''Obere Halsgasse'', and administrated by the city of Rapperswil. In 2008, some Rapperswil residents petitioned local authorities to evict the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil|Polish Museum]] from its home in the [[Rapperswil Castle]], as two historical museum locations (''Stadtmuseum'' and Polish Museum) estimated to be too expensive. The Polish Museum is conducting a petition campaign to retain the Museum in the castle;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapperswil-castle.com Petition to Retain Polish Museum in Rapperswil's Castle]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stadtmuseum'' will be kept respectively in 2010/11 renewed at its actual location.&lt;ref name="stadtverwaltung_janus"&gt;November 12, 2009: [http://www.rapperswil-jona.ch/News_Einzelansicht.171.0.html?&amp;cHash=5513371dc5&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=11&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3573 Rapperswil-Jona official website: ''Das geplante neue Stadtmuseum baut auf neuem Selbstverständnis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001920/http://www.rapperswil-jona.ch/News_Einzelansicht.171.0.html?&amp;cHash=5513371dc5&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=11&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3573 |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities ===
[[File:Rapperswil - Stadtmuseum - Abschluss Erneuerung 2011-11-16 16-19-27 (SX230HS) ShiftN.jpg|thumb|upright|A new building connecting the two historical museum buildings was completed in 2011]]
In December 2009, the project "Janus" presented the results of an evaluation for public vote by the citizens of Rapperswil-Jona. The city museum will be renewed from January 2010 to autumn 2011, and therefore will be closed for visitors. Its historical intermediate section between Breny house and Breny tower will probably replaced by a purposive construction integrated into the historic street-scape between [[Stadtpfarrkirche Rapperswil|''Stadtpfarrkirche'']] (parish church) and ''Engelplatz'' square. This new building serves both, as an exhibition space as well as connection between the two historical museum buildings. The formative north side of the town walls will be kept as it is. Investment and operating costs of around 5.6 million Swiss francs will be borne equally between local community and political community Rapperswil-Jona. Simultaneously with the realization of the project, the accumulated maintenance work on the facades, windows and roofs of the historic buildings and the town wall will be done.&lt;ref name="stadtverwaltung_janus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rapperswil-jona.ch/News_Einzelansicht.171.0.html?&amp;cHash=aad6d9b268&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=11&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2605 Rapperswil-Jona website: ''Stadtmuseum im Breny Haus - Ideenwerkstatt zu Nutzungsfragen Schloss''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707002155/http://rapperswil-jona.ch/News_Einzelansicht.171.0.html?&amp;cHash=aad6d9b268&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=11&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2605 |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlzd.ch/index___l%3Dde&amp;id%3Dprojects!kultur!janus.html Contest Stadtmuseum Rapperswil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110095220/http://www.mlzd.ch/index___l%3Dde%26id%3Dprojects%21kultur%21janus.html |date=2011-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sights ===
Along with temporary exhibits, main sights are the prehistoric and [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman]] archaeological finds, particularly from the extensive excavations at [[Kempraten]], the former Roman ''vicus [[Centum Prata]]''. Other exhibits are medieval coat of arms of the city of Rapperswil, a goblet of Countess Elizabeth of Rapperswil, the late Gothic  living hall and religious goldsmiths, including the mitre, the crosier,  particulate monstrance from the monastery treasury of Premonstratensian [[Rüti Abbey]]. The intermediate section (as of October 2009) is home to the Breny and Göldli rooms with antique portraits from the Renaissance, the Curti room of Rapperswil silk merchants from the 15th century and the Greith room. In the Breny tower there are a scale model of the city of Rapperswil showing the city as it was in 1800, further information on history and the city fortifications as well as examples of medieval weapons, pharmacy, shoe-making and kiln ceramics from Rapperswil.

The previous conventional presentation of the collection objects was replaced in 2012/12 by a multimedia "history experience", i.e., by visual and audible interaction with the visitors.

The '''Sun Temple''' is a Hindu temple dedicated to the solar deity [[Surya]] located at [[Modhera]] village of [[Mehsana district]], [[Gujarat]], India. It is situated on the bank of the river Pushpavati. It was built after 1026-27 CE during the reign of [[Bhima I]] of the [[Chaulukya dynasty]]. No worship is offered now and is protected monument maintained by  [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. The temple complex has three components: ''Gudhamandapa'', the shrine hall; ''Sabhamandapa'', the assembly hall and ''Kunda'', the reservoir. The halls have intricately carved exterior and pillars. The reservoir has steps to reach bottom and numerous small shrines.

==History==
The shrine proper of the Sun Temple was built during the reign of [[Bhima I]] of [[Chaulukya dynasty]].{{efn-ua|The decoration of ''torana'' and columns resembles that of Vimala Vasahi Adinath temple of [[Dilwara Temples]] built in 1031-32 which confirms its period.}}&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia|title=The Archaeology of Gujarat: Including Kathiawar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvAdAAAAMAA|archive-url=http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/51876|archive-date=2015|year=1941|publisher=Natwarlal &amp; Company|pages=70, 84–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun-Temple at Modhera (Gujarat)|url=http://ignca.nic.in/nl002206.htm|access-date=9 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429110946/http://ignca.nic.in/nl002206.htm|archivedate=29 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapoor2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Subodh Kapoor|title=The Indian Encyclopaedia: Meya-National Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncL8Ve9FqNwC&amp;pg=PA4871|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications|isbn=978-81-7755-273-7|pages=4871–4872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/annualreportofth014526mbp|title=Annual Report of the Director of Archaeology, Baroda State, 1934-35|last=Sastri|first=Hirananda|date=November 1936|publisher=Oriental Research Institute|others=|year=|isbn=|location=Baroda|pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, during 1024-25, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] had invaded Bhima's kingdom, and a force of around 20,000 soldiers had unsuccessfully tried to check his advance at Modhera. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Sun Temple might have been built to commemorate this defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Asoke Kumar Majumdar |title=Chaulukyas of Gujarat |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ffAdAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |year=1956 |oclc=4413150 |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a block in western wall of cella, there is an inscription "[[Vikram Samvat]] 1083" upside down carelessly incised in [[Devnagari script]] which correspond to 1026-1027 CE. No other date is found. As the inscription is upside down, it evidences the destruction and reconstruction of the cella. Due to position of the inscription, it is not firmly considered as the date of construction. On the stylistic ground, it is known that the ''kunda'' with its corner shrines was built earlier in the beginning of the 11th century. The inscription is rather considered as the date of destruction by Ghazni instead of the construction. Soon after Bhima had returned to the power. So the temple proper, the miniature and the niche shrines in the tank was built shortly after 1026 CE. The dancing hall was added much later in the third quarter of the 12th century along with the gateways, the porch of the temple proper and the doorframes of the temple and the cella during the reign of the [[Karna (Chaulukya dynasty)|Karna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Wibke |last=Lobo|title=The Sun Temple at Modhera: A Monograph on Architecture and Iconography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89EjAAAAMAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Verlag C.H.

==Architecture==
The temple complex is built in Maru-Gurjara style (Chaulukya style). The temple complex has three axially aligned components; the shrine proper (''garbhagriha'') in a hall (''gudhamandapa''), the outer or assembly hall (''sabhamandapa'' or ''rangamandapa'') and a sacred reservoir (''kunda'').&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ward|title=Gujarat–Daman–Diu: A Travel Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7EHTBl_pyQC&amp;pg=PA153|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Orient Longman Limited|isbn=978-81-250-1383-9|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sabhamandapa'' is not in continuation with ''gudhamandapa'' but is placed little away as a separate structure. Both are built on paved platform.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt; Their roofs have collapsed long ago leaving behind few lower-most courses. Both roofs are 15' 9" in diameter but are constructed differently.&lt;ref name="Dhaky 1969"/&gt; The platform or plinth is inverted lotus shaped.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===''Gudhamandapa'' and ''garbhagriha''===
[[File:Sun Temple, Modhera - Guda Mandap 02.jpg|thumb|''Gudhamandapa'']]
The ''Gudhamandapa'' measures 51 feet 9 inches by 25 feet 8 inches. It is almost equally divided into ''Gudhamandapa'', the hall and ''garbhgriha'', the shrine proper. Both are rectangular in plan with one projection on each of the smaller sides and two projections on each of the longer sides. This projections on the smaller sides form the entrance and the back of shrine. The three projections of outer wall of ''Gudhamandapa'' had windows on each side and the east projection had the doorway. These windows had perforated stone screens; the northern is in ruins and the southern is missing. ''Pradakshinamarga'' is formed by the passage between the walls of ''garbhgriha'' and the outer walls of ''gudhamandapa''. The roof of passage has stones slabs carved with rosettes. The ''Shikhara'' of the it no longer exists.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

====''Garbhagriha''====
The ''Garbhagriha'', the shrine proper or sanctum sanctorum is square measuring 11 feet from inside.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

The shrine had two cells; a cell below the level of upper cell. The floor of upper cell is now fallen which once housed the image of deity. The seat of image is now in pit. The lower cell was probably used for storage.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

The walls inside shrine is plain and outer wall is decorated. The doorway has carved figures of seated Surya in panels surrounded by dancers and amorous couples. All figures are mutilated and the images on the door-lintel is completely destroyed.{{efn-ua|It may have had [[Ganesha]] as in other Surya or Vishnu temples.}}&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

The sanctum sanctorum is designed in a way that the first rays of rising sun lit up the image of Surya during solar [[equinox]] days&lt;ref name="Ward1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapoor2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeshGujarat2007"&gt;{{cite web | title=21st March brings special sunrise to Modhera Sun temple(Video) | website=DeshGujarat | date=25 March 2007 | url=http://deshgujarat.com/2007/03/25/21st-march-brings-special-sunrise-to-modhera-sun-templevideo/ | accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rastogis2009"/&gt; and on [[summer solstice]] day, the sun shines directly above the temple at noon casting no shadow.&lt;ref name="BhatnagarLivingston2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arvind Bhatnagar|author2=William Livingston|title=Fundamentals of Solar Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLfUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|date=7 April 2005|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4486-91-0|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Gudhamandapa''====

;Base mouldings
The outer walls of shrine is highly decorated.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;
The base and walls of the shrine and hall are divided into several stretches with unique carvings. the ''pitha'' or ''adhisthana'', base has the two square members called ''bhat'' followed by a cymarecta carving (lower part convex and upper part concave). It is followed by ''padma'' or ''padmaka'', the moulding in form of inverted lotus. The next is ''antarita'', a fillet or an astragal with a sharp edge between two recesses. Above this is ''patta'' having thin moulding called ''chhaja'' at its lower edge. The next is another ''chhaja'' separated by neck, ''alinga''. The next broad band, ''patti'', is ''gajathara'' carved with elephants. The following band ''narathara'' has figures of men in different attitudes.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

;''Mandovara'' or wall mouldings
''Mandovara'', the wall mouldings starts with ''kumbha'', a pitcher. It has a broad undecorated band at lower part while middle part is decorated with oval discs. It is followed by ''kalasha'', a pitcher. The next is broad band with ''chaitya''-windows called ''kevala'' followed by similar called ''manchi''. These two bands are separated by a deep band. There is a thin fillet above which the major paneled face of wall called ''jangha'' exist. This panels are decorated with figures of gods but the figures of Surya are placed prominently than others as the temple is dedicated to him. Other panels are decorated with dancers and other figures.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

The figures of Surya are prominently carved on three niches of shrine proper as well as on the each side of three windows in the outer wall of ''Gudhamandapa''. The figures of Surya is in standing position with two arms holding lotuses and driven by seven horses.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt; It has some Persian influences.&lt;ref name="Kapoor2002"/&gt; The walls have 12 niches showing the different aspects of Surya in each month. Other figures include eight Dikpals, [[Vishwakarma]], [[Varuna]], [[Agni]], [[Ganesha]], [[Saraswati]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Every figure in panel has a small cornice over it surmounted with triangular pediment consisting of ''chaitya''-window which is called ''udgam''. The next projecting band with ''chaitya''-window and ''kirtimukha'' is called ''malakval''. The top most is the major cornice called ''chhajli''.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

This is followed by ''shikhara'' which no longer exist.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt; The ''Vimana'' had horizontal geometrical and figurative bands which rising to create the [[Mount Meru]]-like ''shikhara''. The central spire had ''Urushringa'', the miniature shrines. It is judged by the shrines on the steps of ''Kunda''.&lt;ref name="Kapoor2002"/&gt;

;''Mandapa''

''Sabhamandapa'' or ''Rangamandapa'', the assembly hall or dancing hall is parallelogram in plan with rows of pillars opening entrance on each side diagonally. The extensively carved exterior has series of recessed corners giving impression of the star like plan of it.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt; There are 52 intricately carved pillars. [[Madhusudan Dhaky]] has suggested that the ''sabhamandapa'' may has been later addition based on style and construction.&lt;ref name="Dhaky 1969"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dhaky | first=M.

;Base mouldings
The ''pitha'' is almost similar to the ''Gudhamandapa'' but smaller as two courses of fillets are omitted. The ''padma'' is carved richly here with floral ornamentation.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

;Wall mouldings
Above the ''Narathara'', there is a band with figures of dancers and gods known as ''rajasena''.

There are erotic figures on it interrupted by rail-patterns.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

;Ceiling and ''torana''
The roof was in shape of stepped pyramid but it no longer exists. Inside, the walnut-shaped ceiling rises in tiers which has numerous floral girdles. It is 23 feet high.&lt;ref name="Kapoor2002"/&gt; It is supported by pillars arranged in an octagon. These pillars have stilts which supports the lintels. ''Torana'' or the decorated cusped arches arise from the lower brackets of the pillars and touch the lintels in middle. There are two types; semicircular and triangular. The semicircular arches has cusped arches with tips while triangular arches has round apex and wavy sides. Both types has broad band decorated with figures and tips which are now defaced and damaged. The lower brackets has ''makara'' which gives the name of ''makara-torana'' while decoration gives name of ''chitra-torana''.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

===Pillars===
[[File:Modhera Sun Temple Sabhamandap Side view.JPG|thumb|Long and short pillars, semicircular and triangular arches]]

The pillars of ''Sabhamandapa'' and ''Gudhamandapa'' are of two types; short and tall. The short pillars rests on walls and supports the roof. The tall pillars rise from the floor.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

;Short pillars
The shaft is square in shape till half of its height followed by vase and then followed by octagonal shaft. It is surmounted by a capital and a bracket. The square part has floral design in circle on each side of faces. The vase is decorated similarly on its corners. The octagonal part have four bands; the top most has ''kirtimukha''.

The next is triangular pediment with ''chaitya''-windows.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

The next is beginning of shaft. It is first decorated with standing figures, mostly dancers, on all eight faces enclosed in ringed pilasters. The next band with scenes of men and beasts is separated from it by round pillow-like band. It is followed by still smaller band with sixteen standing human figures separated by small annultet below. The next is band of leaves. Then the shaft becomes circular and had three or four bands having row of male warriors, lozenges, circles and ''kirtimukha'' at last. The ''kirtimukha''s are separated by chain and bell ornamentation.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

It follows capital similar to small pillars crowned with ''makara'' brackets if eight stilted pillar and dwarfs in the rests. the eight stilted pillars have one more shaft and similar type of capital which is crowned with brackets of volutes and pendant leaves.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

The depicted scenes on small flat ceilings and lintels of ''sabhamandapa'' are from epics like [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt;

===''Kirti-torana''===
There was a ''kirti-torana'', the triumphant arch, in front of ''sabhamandapa''. The pediment and ''torana'' no longer exists but two pillars remains. The moulding and decoration is similar to that of walls of ''sabhamandapa'' and pillars.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941"/&gt; There were two more ''kirti-torana'' on each side of the ''kunda'' of which only one exists without upper part.

===''Kunda''===

''Kunda'', a tank or reservoir is known as ''Ramakunda'' or ''Suryakunda''. The flight of steps through ''kirti-torana'' leads to the reservoir. It is rectangular. It measures 176 feet from north to south and 120 feet from east to west. It is paved with stones all around. There are four terraces and recessed steps to descend to reach the bottom of the tank. The main entrance lies on west. There are steps to reach from one terrace to another on right angle to terrace. These steps are rectangular or square except the first step of each flight of steps which is semicircular. Several miniature shrines and niches in front of terrace-wall have images of gods including many Vaishnavite deities and goddesses such as [[Shitala]].&lt;ref name="Ferrari2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fabrizio M.

== Foundation ==
Many scholars have noted [[Biblical allusions in Shakespeare|religious allegories]] and references in Shakespeare's plays. For example, quotations from the Bible are used in 3,000 places as shown by professor [[Naseeb Shaheen]], and 14 different translations are used.&lt;ref&gt;Naseeb Shaheen, Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays, University of Delaware Press (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  In a few places the playwright has translated the Book of Genesis using the original Hebrew.  In addition, there are many other church and religious references.  For example, in 1999 in his study of ''Julius Caesar'', Professor Steve Sohmer argues that the playwright "set out to interrogate the truth of the Gospels".&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sohmer, Shakespeare's Mystery Play;The Opening of the Globe Theatre 1599, Manchester University Press (1999), pgs 188,197&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in 1988 Linda Hoff posited that ''Hamlet'' is entirely a religious allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Kay Hoff, Hamlet's Choice; Hamlet A Reformation Allegory, Lewiston; E.Mellon Press (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the study by [[Peter Milward]], ''King Lear'', ''Antony and Cleopatra'', ''Hamlet'', ''Richard III'', ''Henry VIII'' all include detailed Apocalypse allegories.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Milward, Shakespeare's Apocalypse, London; St Austin Press, (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabethan literature]] routinely used allegories to communicate hidden meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shadowplay|last=Asquith|first=Clare|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58648-387-6|location=New York|pages=20=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary literary critics advised that instead of feasting on the verse, readers should look beneath the surface to "digest the allegory", as Sir John Harington put it in the introduction to his translation of [[Orlando Furioso]]. State Decipherers sitting in audiences attempted to detect hidden meanings in the plays being staged, as recorded by Ben Jonson.

Dark Lady Players was founded by John Hudson, a Shakespeare scholar most notable for his advocacy of the theory that the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] were written by [[Emilia Lanier|Emilia Bassano Lanier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dark Lady: The Woman Who Wrote Shakespeare's Plays|last=Hudson|first=John|publisher=Amberley|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4456-2160-9|location=Stroud|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/was-shakespeare-a-woman/article1207502/?page=all|title=Was Shakespeare a woman?|last=Posner|first=Michael|date=January 15, 2010|website=The Globe and Mail|publisher=|access-date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-hudson/shakespeares-dark-lady-amelia-bassano-lanier/|title=Shakespeare's Dark Lady|last=Kirkus Reviews|first=|date=February 6, 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/culture/196969/the-secret-jewish-history-of-william-shakespeare/|title=The Secret Jewish History of William Shakespeare|last=Rogovoy|first=Seth|date=April 23, 2014|website=Forward|publisher=|access-date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hudson received a graduate degree from the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham, and is currently the artistic director of the Dark Lady Players.

== Allegory in performance ==
In  2007 the Dark Lady Players performed an allegorical production of '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTtDvyApMFk&amp;feature=related 'A Midsummer Night's Dream''] at the Abingdon Theater in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/022808/ltKosherBard.html|title=Kosher bard {{!}} New Jersey Jewish News|website=njjewishnews.com|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The allegory was based on work by Professor Patricia Parker in her article 'Murals and Morals; A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1998). She believes that Pyramus and Thisbe were an allegory for Jesus and the Church, the Wall is the Partition that comes down on the day of Apocalypse, Peter Quince is Saint Peter, and Puck is the Devil. In addition, the production used work by [[John Hudson (Shakespeare scholar)|John Hudson]],  in his 2008 thesis at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, to show the allegorical identity of all the other characters.&lt;ref name=Hudson&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson|first=John|title=A Midsummer Night's Dream: An Experiment in Allegorical Staging|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15262132/A-Midsummer-Nights-Dream-An-Experiment-in-Allegorical-Staging|work=The Shakespeare Institute|publisher=University of Birmingham|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a consistent religious allegory—but one that was Jewish in nature rather than Christian—because it ends with a [[Jewish Apocalypse of Ezra|Jewish Apocalypse]] featuring a dew blessing, after the comic re-union in Quince's play-within-the-play ended in the deaths of both protagonists.

In 2008 the Dark Lady Players performed two different versions of ''As You Like It'', which draws on the allegory hypothesized by Richard Knowles.&lt;ref name=Knowles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knowles|first=Richard|title=Myth and Type in As You Like It|journal=ELH|date=March 1966|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/2872131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop production was directed by Greeman as part of the Shakespeare Symposium at ManhattanTheaterSource. The subsequent production in summer 2008 at the Midtown International Theatre Festival was directed by the  [[Stephen Wisker]].&lt;ref name=Aliano /&gt; A film was made for Manhattan cable television on the [http://blip.tv/file/1254195/ production]. The work was presented at Eastern Connecticut State University on 11 November 2009, and their lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwX5sM3xLsM Who Wrote Shakespeare?] is available at the University website.&lt;ref&gt;http://nutmeg.easternct.edu/mt-static/press_releases/2009/11/shakespearean-theorists-to-speak-at-eastern.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On 15 December 2009 at Manhattan Theater Source they produced a festival of short plays written about Amelia Lanier by nine New York City playwrights. Playwright Bella Poynton was the festival winner, and then commissioned by the company to write a full-length play detailing Lanier's life.

In September 2009 the Dark Lady Players produced a piece titled ''Shakespeare's Three Virgin Marys'', which examined the allegorical [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] figures identified in the academic literature by researchers such as Chris Hassel, Linda Hoff, and Steve Sohmer. Extracts from the production were featured in a TV news feature on the Dark Lady Players that was broadcast on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GXI5S85Jms The Jewish Channel] on  September 11, 2009. The Dark Lady Players produced [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEA_4V0mk_A Hamlet's Apocalypse], an allegorical version of Hamlet in November 2010 at Manhattan Theatre Source in [[Greenwich Village]].

In 2011, the company performed a site-specific museum-style tour of ''Shakespeare's Gospel Parodies'', subtitled "A Medieval Mystery Tour" at The Center at West-Park Church, in repertory with the Woodshed Collective's The Tenant. The show featured docents, played by actors, who led audience members on tours through 12 scenes from Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=Malin /&gt; In 2012 the DLP presented a one-night lecture event on Shakespeare's Annunciation Parodies, featuring scenes from ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Twelfth Night'', ''Hamlet'', and ''Othello''. The Dark Lady Players entered an ensemble piece roughly titled "Shakespeare Flash Mob" for the 2012 Figment Festival  and performed a full-length original play by Bella Poynton, ''Midsummer Madness'', in August 2012 at the [[Central Park]] Bandshell. In 2014 the company is performing a version of Othello that suggests the Emilia character is an allegory for Amelia Bassano Lanier, as described in an article in Howlround (http://www.howlround.com/a-new-approach-to-othello-shakespeares-dark-lady). IN March 2014 Amberley Publishing is releasing a book "Shakespeare's Dark Lady" which argues the case for Lanier's authorship of these plays as Jewish satires. An advance review in Kirkus Reviews on February 6, 2014 describes it as 'Well-researched, fascinating and thought-provoking' (www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-hudson/shakespeares-dark-lady-amelia-bassano-lanier/ ). However, Hudson's theories have not been widely accepted by Shakespeare scholars.

{{quote|Some directors anachronistically set the plays at the [[North Pole]] or in outer space or in a [[Mafia]] village. They therefore destroy and suppress the allusions that the plays contain and make them impossible to discern. I understand why directors who do not understand the plays might resort to such misleading devices. But they should do so no longer, and should use their staging to reveal what the author really meant.&lt;ref name="Honig Friedman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Honig Friedman|first=Rebecca|title=Was the Bard a Beard?

[[The Kilroys' List#Statistical Research and Analysis|Recent statistical research]] released in November 2015, entitled ''The Count'', gathered that 22% of total surveyed professional productions from 2011-2013 annual seasons were written by women playwrights, 3.8% of the total were written by women playwrights of color, and 0.4% of the total were written by foreign women playwrights of color.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 78% of total surveyed professional productions were written by men playwrights.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

First released in June 2014, The list is an annual collection of highly recommended contemporary plays written by female and [[Transgender|trans*]] identified authors, which are read or seen by an industry professional within the last twelve months.  The list was established by ''The Kilroys'', a group of Los Angeles-based female-identified playwrights and producers who were tired of their plays remaining unproduced while artistic directors claimed "We chose the best plays" for their theater companies' annual seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Kilroys Were Here: Moving Female Playwrights into Production|url = http://howlround.com/the-kilroys-were-here-moving-female-playwrights-into-production|website = HowlRound|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The namesake of ''The Kilroys'' originated from the World War II graffiti tag, "[[Kilroy was here|Kilroy Was Here]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Group Called the Kilroys Releases List of Plays by Women|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/theater/call-for-theaters-to-produce-more-plays-by-women.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-06-16|access-date = 2015-10-26|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Healy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tagline for ''The Kilroys'' is "We Make Trouble and Plays."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Kilroys|url = http://thekilroys.org|website = The Kilroys|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kilroys members include: Zakiyyah Alexander,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/2963/zakiyyah-alexander|title = Zakiyyah Alexander|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bekah Brunstetter, [[Sheila Callaghan]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/166/sheila-callaghan|title = Sheila Callaghan|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carla Ching,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/1906/carla-ching|title = Carla Ching|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Annah Feinberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/927/annah-feinberg|title = Annah Feinberg|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Gubbins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/2962/sarah-gubbins|title = Sarah Gubbins|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Jacqmin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/634/laura-jacqmin|title = Laura Jacqmin|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Meads, Kelly Miller, Meg Miroshnik,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/3174/meg-miroshnik|title = Meg Miroshnik|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daria Polatin, Tanya Saracho,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org/users/2935/tanya-saracho|title = Tanya Saracho|date = |accessdate = |website = New Play Exchange|publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marisa Wegrzyn]].

In 2014 the list featured the Top 46, a collection of 46 plays highly recommended by selected Nominators. The Nominators consisted of a number of contemporary theater artists and administrators currently working in the theater industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Group Called the Kilroys Releases List of Plays by Women|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/theater/call-for-theaters-to-produce-more-plays-by-women.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-06-16|access-date = 2015-11-11|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patrick|last = Healy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 List: The top 7% featured 53 plays.

== Eligibility ==
To qualify as eligible for The List, a play must be:
* "unproduced or have had only a single professional production"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About The List|url = http://thekilroys.org/list/|website = The Kilroys|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* written by a playwright who self-identifies as female or trans*
* read or seen by an industry professional in the past twelve months
* not included in the in previous years

== Gender parity ==
Gender Parity is a term that has grown to widespread popularity in the theater industry in recent years. There have been several initiatives started to address the underrepresentation of, and discrimination against, women and [[Transgender|trans*]] artists and administrators.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Centre for Women Playwrights - Gender Equity Facts|url = http://www.womenplaywrights.org/research|website = www.womenplaywrights.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this work has been statistical research based on numbers of women and [[Transgender|trans*]] artists and administrators filing roles within a theater organization's staff and theatrical season.

=== Statistical research and analysis ===
Considered the most recent statistical research and analysis on gender disparity, ''The Count'' was founded by playwrights and co-founders of the ''[[Lilly Awards]]'', [[Marsha Norman]] and [[Julia Jordan]], and Rebecca Stump of the [[Dramatists Guild of America|Dramatists Guild]].  This research was presented at the annual ''Lilly Awards'' in July 2015 and published in November 2015 by the |Dramatists Guild.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dramatists Guild National Conference: #writechange - The Count - LA FPI|url = http://lafpi.com/2015/07/dramatists-guild-national-conference-writechange-the-count/|website = LA FPI|accessdate = 2015-11-09|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theaters that were eligible for survey must be not-for-profit and regional, including Off-Broadway and Off-Off Broadway.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dramatistsguild.com/media/PDFs/TheCount.pdf|title = The Count|date = November–December 2015|accessdate = 2015-11-09|website = |publisher = The Dramatist|last = Norman|first = Marsha|last2 = Jordan|first2 = Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway theaters were not included in the survey. In total, 153 theater companies' 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 seasons were included in the national survey.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Julia Jordan has been quoted saying, "We wanted to create a baseline and to document the change."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Small Gains for Female Playwrights|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/theater/small-gains-for-female-playwrights.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-07-15|access-date = 2015-11-09|issn = 0362-4331|first = Cara|last = Buckley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This baseline consists of percentage breakdowns based on the coined terms'','' "Unique Writers," which allows each individual produced writer to be counted once within the data, and "Unique Productions," which allows each individual production of a writer's play to be counted once within the data.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For instance, while [[Lynn Nottage]] is considered a "Unique Writer," each production of her play ''[[Intimate Apparel (play)|Intimate Apparel]]'' would be considered a "Unique Production." Within these categories, ''The Count'' measured representations based on the playwright's self-identified intersections of race, gender, and nationality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These percentages can be seen below in ascending order of percentage: 
{| class="wikitable"
!Unique writers by gender, race, and nationality&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
|-
|0.4% Foreign women of color
|-
|0.4% Foreign men of color
|-
|2.5% Foreign white women
|-
|3.4% American women of color
|-
|6.0% American men of color
|-
|10.6% Foreign white men
|-
|14.0% American white women
|-
|62.7% American white men
|}

In addition, ''The Count'' included percentage breakdowns by a U.S. regional map and by individual city. Selected cities consisted of:
{| class="wikitable"
!Selected cities
!Selected cities: productions of female writers
!Selected cities: productions of female writers of color&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Count will continue to be updated on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Additional gender parity initiatives ===
One of the first initial statistical research and analyses on ''gender disparity'' was an honors research project completed by, then Princeton undergraduate student, Emily Glassberg Sands titled, ''Opening the Curtain on Playwright Gender: An Integrated Economic Analysis of Discrimination in American Theater''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Rethinking Gender Bias in Theater|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/theater/24play.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-06-24|access-date = 2015-11-09|issn = 0362-4331|first = Patricia|last = Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After what has become known as "the Summit"—a gathering of artistic directors and artists in Washington D.C., when an artistic director made a controversial comment about no plays by women in the American theater industry "pipeline"—the '''We Exist''' google document was created to document the names of women and trans* identified playwrights across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The New Definition Of Women Writers|url = http://thefederalist.com/2014/04/04/the-new-definition-of-women-writers/|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Unsung Gender-Parity Warriors|url = http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/09/21/the-unsung-gender-parity-warriors/|website = American Theatre|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Suzy|last = Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other gender parity initiatives include [[Theatre Communications Group]]'s ''82 Theatre Companies With Playwriting Parity'' ''(and Better)'', published by American Theatre Magazine in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 82 Theatre Companies With Playwriting Parity (and Better)|url = http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/09/21/78-theatre-companies-with-playwriting-parity-and-above/|website = American Theatre|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Suzy|last = Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there have been formations of citywide Women's Playwriting Festivals such as the 2015 ''D.C. Women's Voices Theater Festival'', which produced 56 new plays by women at 51 theaters across the greater D.C. area, and city-based Gender Parity Task Force Groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = We Are Part of the Problem---and of the Solution|url = http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/09/21/we-are-part-of-the-problem-and-of-the-solution/|website = AMERICAN THEATRE|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = For 44 D.C. area theater companies, new plays by women will take center stage in fall of 2015|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/for-44-dc-area-theater-companies-new-plays-by-women-will-take-center-stage-in-fall-of-2015/2014/01/23/7c253020-844f-11e3-a273-6ffd9cf9f4ba_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2014-01-23|access-date = 2015-11-09|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Peter|last = Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been increased scholarship in uncovering plays by women, for instance Susan Jones's ''The Other Canon'', a list of plays by women that date back 10 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Other Canon: 10 Centuries of Plays by Women|url = http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/09/21/the-other-canon-10-centuries-of-plays-by-women/|website = American Theatre|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Susan|last = Jonas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are annual theater awards for recognition of contemporary women playwrights such as the ''Lilly Awards'', named after playwright [[Lillian Hellman]], which was founded in 2010 by playwrights Marsha Norman, Julia Jordan]], and Theresa Rebeck]], as well as theater companies dedicated to producing work written and directed by women such as the [[Women's Project Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Livestreaming The Sixth Annual Lilly Awards Ceremony—hosted by Tony Award nominee Lisa Kron—Mon, June 1—#lillyawards|url = http://howlround.com/livestreaming-the-sixth-annual-lilly-awards-ceremony-hosted-by-tony-award-nominee-lisa-kron-mon-june|website = HowlRound|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = It's All About You: The March Towards Parity in the American Theatre|last = Crosby|first = Julie|date = December 2010|journal = Theatre Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|issue = 4|volume = 62|pages = 571–574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Play Exchange ==
For the 2015 List, the ''Kilroys'' partnered with the [[National New Play Network - (NNPN)|National New Play Network]] for their online database, the New Play Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://newplayexchange.org|title = New Play Exchange|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = National New Play Network|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange allows playwrights to create accounts to include their professional work in the form sample pages or full-length plays.  The website is an initiative to address how professional theaters can use a more efficient selection process to determine which plays will be produced for their annual seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Theatre – November 2013|url = http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/issue/featuredstory.cfm?story=8&amp;indexID=37|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015602/http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/issue/featuredstory.cfm?story=8&amp;indexID=37|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-11-17|website = www.tcg.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous years, "There had been hundreds of conversations about how the submission model was broken, how people filled their offices and built furniture out of unread scripts, how playwrights waited for years to hear back about the plays they just knew were perfect."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Doers Gonna Do—National New Play Network &amp; the New Play Exchange|url = http://howlround.com/doers-gonna-do-national-new-play-network-the-new-play-exchange|website = HowlRound|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to uploading samples pages or full length pages of scripts and musical scores, playwrights can include information on casting breakdowns, keywords, and past production history. Anyone can create profiles to find playwrights, to read and privately evaluate plays, build a "private library," and "watch" others on the New Play Exchange as they add more to their profiles.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It will serve as a "tool for students, audiences, and new play lovers everywhere to access new works. It will serve organizations so that they can let playwrights know what they are looking to read, to develop, and to produce."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Impact of the lists ==
The ''Kilroys' List'' has been covered nationwide in newspapers and other online media sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PRESS {{!}} The Kilroys|url = http://thekilroys.org/press/|website = The Kilroys|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2014 list was released, the Kilroys were determined to expand the nominating pool "to increase [writer] representation along class, ability, sexual orientation, and gender lines (including genderqueer, trans*, and other non-binary gender identities)."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Advocates Make Another List of Plays by Women Deserving of Productions|url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/advocates-make-another-list-of-plays-by-women-deserving-of-productions/?_r=3|website = ArtsBeat|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, American Theatre Magazine wrote, "The impact of that initial list is hard to measure precisely, particularly given the long lead times of some theatres’ season planning, but the Kilroys have reported that 28 of the original 47 plays have since been produced, and individual writers cited on the list have reported more interest and requests for their scripts, if not a spate of production commitments."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Kilroys Make Another List of Plays by Women You Should Know|url = http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/06/22/the-kilroys-make-another-list-of-plays-by-women-you-should-know/|website = American Theatre|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Rob|last = Weinert-Kendt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt; In addition, there have been publicly promoted initiatives to utilize the lists, including a reading series of 3 selected plays from the 2014 List, hosted by the ''Lilly Awards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Kilroys Were Here (at the Lillys' Behest)|url = http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/03/18/the-kilroys-were-here-the-lillys-hosted/|website = American Theatre|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, playwright Sheila Callaghan&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; is quoted in American Theatre Magazine saying, “A school is doing a class on just the Kilroys plays...That’s part of the movement, too.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''''The Virtual Revolution''''' is a British television [[documentary]] series presented by [[Aleks Krotoski]], which began airing on [[BBC Two]] on 30 January 2010. A co-production between the [[BBC]] and the [[Open University]], the series looks at the impact the [[World Wide Web]] has had since its inception 20 years ago. The series took a different approach to BBC documentary making by encouraging an open and collaborative production.

==Production==
The series was announced on 10 July 2009, under the working title of ''Digital Revolution'', to examine the impact the [[World Wide Web]] has had on society over its first 20 years. Technology journalist and academic [[Aleks Krotoski]] would present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/07_july/10/digital.shtml|title=BBC Two set to engage public in unique look at how the web has revolutionised our lives|date=10 July 2009|publisher=[[BBC]] Press Office|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was launched with an event at the BBC to mark the twentieth anniversary of the World Wide Web, which saw [[Tim Berners-Lee]] (credited with inventing the World Wide Web), [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield|Susan Greenfield]], [[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] and [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]] discuss the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/07/the_web_at_20.html|title=The Web at 20|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|authorlink=Rory Cellan-Jones|date=10 July 2009|work=dot.Life|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production team took a different approach to the development of the series, described by series producer [[Russell Barnes]] as "radical" and "open-source": "We don't just want to observe bloggers from on high; we want to blog ourselves and get feedback and comment on our ideas."&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8144570.stm|title=Charting the Digital Revolution|last=Barnes|first=Russell|date=10 July 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the four phases the production would take; firstly conducting interviews and inviting comments from users on the programme's blog, the second would see [[Dailies|rushes]] released for others to re-use under a permissive license,&lt;ref name=license /&gt; thirdly, web users would be engaged, working with the [[Web Science Research Initiative]], and the fourth would be an online, interactive version of the series available after it has finished.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

The programme team interviewed a number of people who have played a part in the development of the web, including its inventor [[Tim Berners-Lee|Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] and founders of notable brands; [[Bill Gates]] ([[Microsoft]]), [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]]), [[Chad Hurley]] ([[YouTube]]), [[Jimmy Wales]] ([[Wikipedia]]), [[Stewart Brand]] ([[The WELL]]), [[Biz Stone]] and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] ([[Twitter]]), [[Peter Thiel]] ([[PayPal]]) and [[Martha Lane Fox]] ([[lastminute.com]]). Academics, including [[Terry Winograd]], [[Sherry Turkle]], [[A. C. Grayling]], [[David Runciman]], [[Ross J. Anderson (professor)|Ross Anderson]] and [[Nigel Shadbolt]], commentators, including [[David Weinberger]], [[Lee Siegel (cultural critic)|Lee Siegel]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Andrew Keen]] and [[Stephen Fry]], and [[President of Estonia|Estonian President]] [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves|Toomas Ilves]] were also interviewed. Footage of the interviews was also made available on the programme's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution/interviews.shtml|title=Interviewees clips|work=The Virtual Revolution website|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 and while being interviewed for the series, Stephen Fry made a request on [[Twitter]] for people to suggest names for the series, with the final decision being made by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/inspiration-wanted-help-us-nam.shtml|title=Inspiration wanted: help us name the series #bbcnamestorm|last=Biddle|first=Dan|date= 6 October 2009|work=The Virtual Revolution blog|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chosen title, ''The Virtual Revolution'', is described by the producers as "a mashup between us and you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution/about.shtml|title=About ''The Virtual Revolution''|work=The Virtual Revolution website|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary    = The first programme examines the idea of the [[World Wide Web]] as a "great leveller", and how this has shaped the development of the web.

Looking at the web as an empowering tool and the access provided to knowledge, Krotoski visits Einar Kvaran, contributor to the online encyclopaedia [[Wikipedia]]. To understand how the web gave rise to Wikipedia, she looks at early online community [[The WELL]], which flourished from the counter-culture and libertarianism of the 1960s, speaking to founder [[Stewart Brand]] and [[John Perry Barlow]], who spoke up for online freedom.

[[Al Gore]] speaks about blogs and expressing ideas, and Krotoski visits Ory Okolloh, founder of [[Ushahidi]], which gave people a voice following the unrest after the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|2007 Kenyan elections]].

She then talks with [[Tim Berners-Lee|Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] about inventing the World Wide Web while he was at [[CERN]] in the 1980s. [[Kenya]]n farmer Kudjo Agbevi discusses empowerment, and Berners-Lee, Barlow and [[Andrew Keen]] speak about the lack of a controlling authority and hierarchy.

Krotoski then examines the conflict between freedom/collaboration and making a profit, speaking to [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[Charles Leadbeater]]. [[Shawn Fanning]] then talks about the beginnings of [[Napster]], challenging traditional business models. [[YouTube]] founder [[Chad Hurley]] talks about [[user-generated content]] and rapper [[Master Shortie]] tells Krotoski about using the web as a promotional tool.

[[Arianna Huffington]] of [[The Huffington Post]] talk about combining old and new media, Keen talks about hierarchy and Berners-Lee warns of central control. Krotoski speaks to [[Jimmy Wales]] of Wikipedia about the community structure and to conclude, contributors talk about hierarchy.

Other contributors include [[Lee Siegel (cultural critic)|Lee Siegel]], [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Stephen Fry]].

Krotoski also interviews [[Austin Heap]] in relation to a piece of software called '[[Haystack (software)|Haystack]]', an anti-censorship tool for use against the authorities in Iran, being developed by Austin Heap at the time.

Krotoski looks at the history of Twitter, and how in the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]] aftermath, it helped civilians send information about [[2009 Iranian election protests|the protests]] to the rest of the world. She then speaks to [[Biz Stone]] and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] about the use of Twitter. She then looks at what the [[internet]] was originally designed for, and goes to [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] who designed [[ARPANET]]. Krotoski talks to [[Vint Cerf]], who, along with [[Bob Kahn]], invented internet protocols and [[packet switching]]. Includes interviews with [[Al Gore]], [[Jeff Bezos]], [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], [[Clay Shirky]], [[Stephen Fry]], Ishtiaq Hussain, [[Martha Lane Fox]], [[Paul Meijer]] and [[Persiankiwi|oxfordgirl]].

|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|2|13|df=y}}
|Aux4            = &lt;!-- Twenty years on from its invention, Dr Aleks Krotoski continues her investigation of how the World Wide Web is transforming almost every aspect of our lives. She gives the lowdown on how, for better and for worse, commerce has colonised the web - and reveals how web users are paying for what appear to be 'free' sites and services in hidden ways.

Joined by some of the most influential business leaders of today's web, including Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon), Eric Schmidt (CEO of Google), Chad Hurley (CEO of YouTube), Bill Gates, Martha Lane Fox and Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix), Aleks traces how business, with varying degrees of success, has attempted to make money on the web.

She tells the inside story of the gold rush years of the dotcom bubble and reveals how retailers such as Amazon learned the lessons. She also charts how, out of the ashes, Google forged the business model that has come to dominate today's web, offering a plethora of highly attractive, overtly free web services, including search, maps and video, that are in fact funded through a sophisticated and highly lucrative advertising system which trades on what we users look for.

Aleks explores how web advertising is evolving further to become more targeted and relevant to individual consumers. Recommendation engines, pioneered by retailers such as Amazon, are also breaking down the barriers between commerce and consumer by marketing future purchases to us based on our previous choices.

On the surface, the web appears to have brought about a revolution in convenience. As companies start to build up databases on our online habits and preferences, Aleks questions what this may mean for our notions of privacy and personal space in the 21st century.

==Reception==
Overnight estimates indicated that 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people watched the first episode, a 5% audience share.&lt;ref name="Ratings1" /&gt;

In reviewing the first episode, [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] in ''[[The Independent]]'', "glad" the programme contained the "odd sceptic too", said Krotoski was a "fine presenter" that the series was both "premature and overdue":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Premature because when you're in the middle of a forest fire you can have no sensible idea of how it will eventually burn out. Overdue, because the flames have been raging for 15 years now and it's excellent that the BBC is at last sticking a dampened finger in the air to see which direction the wind is blowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-weekends-television-mo-sun-channel-4brthe-virtual-revolution-sat-bbc2-1884958.html|title= The Weekend's Television: ''Mo'', Sun, Channel 4; ''The Virtual Revolution'', Sat, BBC2|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|date=1 February 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For ''[[The Times]]'', Andrew Billen gave the first episode three out of five, saying that Krotoski "offered paradox and dialectic before reaching her bland conclusion that the web was constantly re-inventing itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article7008730.ece|title=Weekend TV|last=Billen|first=Andrew|date=1 February 2010|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Tim Dowling]] said that the first episode "made a better fist of it than most" and that "the contributors struck a nice balance between big name cheerleaders and glowering dissenters". He described Krotoski as "convincingly authoritative" but found that "the big picture was sometimes hard to hold in your head" and "the term 'empowering tool' was deployed frequently but without enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jan/31/mo-virtual-revolution-tv-review|title=''Mo''; ''The Virtual Revolution''|last=Dowling|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Dowling|date=31 January 2010|work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan Lambie for Den of Geek said that "the phrases 'empowering tool' and 'ultimate leveller' are repeated far too many times" and that "the programme's makers apparently assume that the average viewer has never seen or used the Internet in their life", but felt Krotoski was "engaging and enthusiastic" as host, however "her constant presence in every other shot is strangely distracting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/408109/the_virtual_revolution_episode_one_review.html|title=''The Virtual Revolution'' episode one review|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=1 February 2010|work=Den of Geek|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Scotsman]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Paul Whitelaw, who also said the camera was "fixated on Krotoski", felt the first programme was a "disjointed essay which proved fascinating when focusing on the origins of the web, but less so when dealing with more recent and familiar developments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://living.scotsman.com/tvradio/TV-review-The-Virtual-Revolution.6029955.jp|title=TV review: ''The Virtual Revolution'' &amp;#124; ''Seven Ages of Britain''|last=Whitelaw|first=Paul|date=1 February 2010|work=[[The Scotsman]]|publisher=[[Johnston Press]]|accessdate=3 February 2010|location=[[Edinburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Progressivism}}
'''Transnational progressivism''' is a term [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Hudson Institute]] Fellow [[John Fonte]] in 2001 to describe an [[ideology]] which endorses a concept of postnational [[global citizen]]ship and promotes the authority of international institutions over the sovereignty of individual nation-states.&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;

==Overview==

Fonte argued that the core beliefs of this view include:

*Advocating the goals of an identity group rather than individual:  "The key political unit is not the individual citizen...but the ascriptive group (racial, ethnic, or gender) into which one is born."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"&gt;John Fonte, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/archives_roll/2002_04-06/fonte_ideological/fonte_ideological.html "The Ideological War Within the West,"] ''Watch on the West'', Volume 3, Number 6, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"&gt;John Fonte, [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf "Liberal Democracy vs. Transnational Progressivism: The Future of the Ideological Civil War Within the West,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202204141/http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf |date=2008-12-02 }} ''Orbis'', Summer 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"&gt;John Fonte, [http://www.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=31179 "Global Governance vs. the Liberal Democratic Nation-State,"] ''Front Page Magazine'', June 04, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*An oppressor/victim dichotomy: "Transnational ideologists have incorporated the essentially [[Hegel]]ian [[Marxist]] "privileged vs. marginalized" dichotomy," with "immigrant groups designated as victims."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Proportional representation by group:  "Transnational progressivism assumes that "victim" groups should be represented in all professions roughly proportionate to their percentage of the population. If not, there is a problem of "underrepresentation."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Change in institutional values:  "the distinct worldviews of ethnic, gender, and linguistic minorities must be represented" within dominant social and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Change in the [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] [[paradigm]]:  "The traditional paradigm based on the assimilation of immigrants into an existing American civic culture is obsolete and must be changed to a framework that promotes "diversity," defined as group proportionalism."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Redefinition of democracy:  "Changing the system of majority rule among equal citizens to one of power sharing among ethnic groups composed of both citizens and non-citizens."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Deconstruction of Western national narratives and national symbols in favor of post-modern multiculturalist views.&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;

==Transnational progressivism in fiction==
In [[John Ringo]]'s [[military science fiction]] series [[Legacy of the Aldenata]], the Aldenata are described disparagingly as "galactic tranzis".

[[Tom Kratman]] references tranzi in "Caliphate", a near future science fiction novel.  In the afterword, which is not fiction, he describes how the tranzi's policy of appeasement and inertia cause the subjection of Europe to Islamic control.

{{Refimprove|auto=yes|date=February 2012}}

'''Twentieth-century theatre''' describes a period of great change within the [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[culture]] of the 20th century, mainly in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. There was a widespread challenge to long-established rules surrounding theatrical representation; resulting in the development of many new forms of theatre, including [[modernism]], [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]], [[Impressionism]], [[political theatre]] and other forms of [[Experimental theatre]], as well as the continuing development of already established theatrical forms like [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realism]].

Throughout the century, the artistic reputation of theatre improved after being derided throughout the 19th century. However, the growth of other media, especially [[History of film|film]], has resulted in a diminished role within the culture at large. In light of this change, theatrical artists have been forced to seek new ways to engage with society. The various answers offered in response to this have prompted the transformations that make up its modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain, Preface, ''Twentieth-Century Theatre: A Sourcebook," Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in areas like [[Gender studies|Gender theory]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodern philosophy]] identified and created subjects for the theatre to explore. These sometimes explicitly meta-theatrical performances were meant to confront the audience's perceptions and assumptions in order to raise questions about their society. These challenging and influential plays characterized much of the final two decades of the 20th-century.

Although largely developing in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] through the beginning of the century, the next 50 years saw an embrace of non-Western theatrical forms. Influenced by the dismantling of empires and the continuing development of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial]] theory, many new artists utilized elements of their own [[culture]]s and [[Society|societies]] to create a diversified theatre.

==Realism==
[[File:MAT original company 1899.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The original company of the Moscow Art Theatre in 1899]]

Realism focuses on the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions or implausible, exotic and supernatural elements. For many theatre artists throughout the century, realism was meant to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life.

Influenced by the ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Charles Darwin]] and others, many artists began to find a [[psychological]] approach to theatre that emphasized the inner dimensions of the characters onstage. This was carried out both on the stage in [[acting]] styles, in [[Playwright|play writing]] and in [[Scenic design|theatrical design]]. Beginning with the work Russian playwrights [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] and continued by [[Emile Zola]] in France and [[Henrik Ibsen]] in Norway in the late [[Nineteenth century theatre|19th Century]], realism came to dominate most of the theatrical culture of the 20th century in Britain and North America.

===Russia===

In Russia, the movement towards realism began earlier than anywhere else in the world. Building on the work of earlier pioneers, [[Constantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898, wanting to reform a Russian theatre dominated by [[melodrama]] to one in which high-quality art was available to the general public. In perhaps the most important theatrical meeting of the 20th century, the two met for an epic 18-hours, from 2 pm to 8 am the next morning, and laid the foundation for one of the most influential companies of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, Jean. 1991. The Moscow Art Theatre Letters. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they would forge a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity, selecting actors from Nemirovich's class at the Philharmonic school and Stanislavsky's amateur Society of Art and Literature group, along with other professional actors; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically [[Gesamtkunstwerk|unified aesthetic]] would bring together the techniques of the [[Meiningen Ensemble]] and those of [[André Antoine]]'s [[Théâtre Libre]] (which Stanislavsky had seen during trips to Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1989, 18) and (1999, 61–62)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1898, the theatre opened [[Anton Chekhov]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|The Seagull]] with Stanislavski himself playing the role of Trigorin and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] as Treplev in "one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest developments in the history of world drama."&lt;ref&gt;Rudnitsky (1981, 8) and Benedetti (1999, 85)&lt;/ref&gt; Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a [[dam]] breaking and the production received unanimous praise from the press.&lt;ref name="b86"&gt;Benedetti (1999, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysts attribute the production's success to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1981, 64).&lt;/ref&gt; Productions of Ibsen, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and Chekhov's [[Uncle Vanya]], [[The Cherry Orchard]] and [[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]] were also very successful in the early days of the company.

After the success of the Moscow Art Theatre, Stanislavski set out to create a [[Stanislavski's system|unified system of acting]] that would train actors and actresses to create believable characterizations for their performances. Developed mainly between 1911 and 1916 and revised throughout his life, the approach was partly based on the concept of emotional memory for which an actor focuses internally to portray a character's emotions onstage. Areas of study include concentration, voice, physical skills, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis. The Stanislavsky system was widely practiced in the Soviet Union and in the United States, where experiments in its use began in the 1920s and continued in many schools and professional workshops.

In the early part of the 20th century, Russia experienced a cultural [[Russian literature#Silver Age|Silver Age]] and the theatre was no exception. By 1916, the total number of producing theatres in Moscow alone totaled close to 200. These year-round and seasonal theatres produced mainly farces, comedies, vaudevilles and even melodramas, but there were also a significant number of theatres offering realistic or [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] theatre. These included [[Aleksey Suvorin]]'s [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] and the Moscow Dramatic Theatre (1914–19). While there were a number of actress-managers in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] like [[Vera Komissarzhevskaya]] and [[Ida Rubinstein]], the course of Russian theatre in the Silver Age was largely dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;Golub, 278-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First World War]] and the [[Russian Revolution]], many theatre artists left Russia for other countries, including [[Georges Pitoëff]] to France, [[Theodore Komisarjevsky]] to Britain, and, famously, [[Michael Chekhov|Mikhael Chekhov]] to the United States, exporting the Stanislavski system and contributing to the development of a 'director's theatre' in the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, 379&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugene O'Neill 1936.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eugene O'Neill]] had a huge influence on the development of modern American drama.]]

===United States===

In the United States, [[William Vaughn Moody]]'s plays ''The Great Divide'' (1906) and ''The Faith Healer'' (1909) pointed the way to a more realistic American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights signaling the move to realism in the beginning of the century include [[Edward Sheldon]], [[Charles Rann Kennedy]] and [[Rachel Crothers]]. Onstage, the American theatre was dominated by the [[Barrymore family]]: [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Ethel Barrymore]] (the "First Lady of American Theater") and [[John Barrymore]] ("... the most influential and idolized actor of his day."). They were so popular that a play was even written about them: [[The Royal Family (play)|The Royal Family]] by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Edna Ferber]], a parody of the Barrymores, with particular aim taken at John and Ethel Barrymore.

Through the early century, no American dramatist had as much influence on the development of drama as [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Born into the theatre from a young age, he spent much of his youth on trains and backstage at theatres, before developing his talent with the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. Between 1916 and 1920, he wrote several plays for the company before debuting his first critical hit ''[[Beyond the Horizon (play)|Beyond the Horizon]]'' in 1920, which went on to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. He followed that with critical and commercial successes, including ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'' (Pulitzer Prize 1922), ''[[Desire Under the Elms]]'' (1924), ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' (Pulitzer Prize 1928), ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931), ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1939) and his only well-known comedy, ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]''. After his death, his magnum opus and masterwork ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' was published and is often regarded to be one of the finest American plays of the 20th century.

The economic crisis of the [[Great Depression]] led to the creation of the [[Federal Theatre Project]] (1935–39), a [[New Deal]] program which funded theatre and other live artistic performances throughout the country. National director [[Hallie Flanagan]] shaped the project into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and made it possible for millions of Americans to see theatre for the first time. The project directly employed 15,000 men and women and played 1,200 productions to nearly 30 million people in 200 theatres nationwide, with 65% being presented free of charge, at a total cost of $46 million.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key figures of the early century include [[George S. Kaufman]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Sidney Howard]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]], and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, [[Philip Barry]], [[Thornton Wilder]] and [[William Saroyan]].

==Modernism==
Modernism was a predominantly European movement that developed as a self-conscious break from traditional art forms. It represents a significant shift in cultural sensibilities, often attributed to the fallout of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Modris Ekstein, ''Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age,'' Lester &amp; Orpen Dennys, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the modernist theatre was in large part an attempt to realize the reformed stage on [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] principles as advocated by [[Émile Zola]] in the 1880s. However, a simultaneous reaction against naturalism urged the theatre in a much different direction. Owing much to [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], the movement attempted to integrate poetry, painting, music, and dance in a harmonious fusion. Both of these seemingly conflicting movements fit under the term 'Modernism'.&lt;ref&gt;Drain 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theatre==
[[File:Augusto Boal nyc5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A workshop of [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] in 2008.]]
Political theatre is an attempt to rethink the nature and function of theatre in the light of the dynamics of the society outside it and audience involvement within it. It led to profound and original theories of [[acting]], staging and [[Playwright|playwriting]].&lt;ref&gt;Drain 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular theatre==
At the beginning of the 20th century, many viewed theatre as an "all-too-popular affair."&lt;ref&gt;Drain 153&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the true reformers of the early part of the century called for increasingly smaller theatres, where their techniques could register on a select audience. Still, these same practitioners often dreamed that their art would be a true people's theatre: a theatre for the people. Inspired by an understanding of the [[Greek theatre]] and heavily influenced by [[Nietzsche]], they sought a profound or ecstatic ritual event that involved music and movement, in a space without a [[proscenium arch]]. Later, practitioners like [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] would initiate an attempt to bridge the "gulf" between modernism and the people.&lt;ref&gt;Drain 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===

==Post-modern theatre==
Post-modern theatre is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the [[postmodern philosophy]] that originated in Europe in the middle of the 20th century. Post-modern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most post-modern productions are centered around highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, post-modern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

==Global theatre==
At the beginning of the 20th-century, many European audiences were exposed to the "exotic" theatrical world of [[Japanese theatre|Japanese]] and [[Chinese theatre|Chinese]] performances. This led to many Western practitioners interpreting and incorporating these styles into their own theatres: most notably [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s adaptation of [[Chinese opera]] to support his 'Alienation' effect. The influence of the non-western theatre on theatrical culture in the 20th-century has often been crucial to new developments. However, the period during and after the advent of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial]] theory in the 1960s and 1970s, has led to a tremendous amount of development in theatre practice all over the world. This has created, for the first time, a truly global theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Drain 293&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant figures==
Significant figures and some landmark theories and movements of the period include:
* [[Constantin Stanislavski]] (1863-1938) and his [[Stanislavski's system|system]]: a "naturalistic" method of drawing on the actor's own emotional memories to convey a character's thoughts and emotions
* [[Antonin Artaud]] (1896-1948) and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]: a plan to force the audience to shed their illusions
* [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1898-1956) and [[Epic theatre]]: a reaction against Stanislavski's naturalistic method, Epic theatre makes clear that the audience is watching a play and an artifice
* [[Lee Strasberg]] (1901-1982) and [[Method acting]]: which trains actors to draw upon their own emotions and memories, to convincingly portray a part.
* [[Jerzy Grotowski]] (1933–1999), who introduced the concept of "poor theatre"
* [[Eugenio Barba]], Grotowski's disciple and founder of the [[Odin Theatret]], introducing the concepts of theatrical anthropology
* [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906-1989) and [[Theatre of the Absurd]]: in a modern world without meaning or purpose, a play's dialog, plot and characters give up the threads of "logic" or "message".  (related to [[Existentialism]])
* [[Hans-Thies Lehmann]]'s theory of [[Postdramatic theatre]]: focused more on effect on the audience than on the original text.

===Nobel laureates===
During the twentieth-century the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] was awarded to the following who were primarily [[Playwright|dramatist]]s:

* 1904 - [[José Echegaray]] — Spanish; ''El gran Galeoto''
* 1910 - [[Paul Heyse]] — German

* 1936 - [[Eugene O'Neill]] — American
* 1969 - [[Samuel Beckett]] — Irish
* 1986 - [[Wole Soyinka]] — Nigerian
* 1997 - [[Dario Fo]] — Italian

The 2005 Nobel Prize in  Literature was awarded to the Englishman [[Harold Pinter]], most of whose [[Works of Harold Pinter|works]] originated in the twentieth-century.
