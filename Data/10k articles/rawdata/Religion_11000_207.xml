The roots of the Bahá'í Faith in the region go back to the first days of the [[Bábí]] religion in 1844.&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt; Four Babis are known from India in this earliest period; it is not known from what sub-region they came from, but at least some of them were known as [[Sufi]]s and some were termed [[Sayyid]].&lt;ref name="sepher01"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Manuchehri | first = Sepehr | editor-last = Walbridge | editor-first = John | title = Historical Accounts of two Indian Babis: Sa'in Hindi and Sayyid Basir Hindi | journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 05 | issue = 02 | pages = | publisher = | location = | date = April 2001 | url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol5/hunud.htm | issn =  | accessdate = 4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was [[Shaykh]] Sa'id Hindi, one of the [[Letters of the Living]], who was from somewhere in what was then India.&lt;ref name="sepher99"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Manuchehri | first = Sepehr | editor-last = Walbridge | editor-first = John | title = The Practice of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) in the Babi and Bahai Religions| journal =  Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies| volume = 03| issue = 03| pages = | publisher = | location = | date = September 1999 | url =http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol3/taqiya.htm | issn =  | accessdate = 4 April 2009 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four other Indians were listed among the 318 Bábís who fought at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi]].&lt;ref name="momen99"/&gt;

===Early Bahá'í period===
During [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to India.&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt; In 1878, a Bahá'í moved through Chittagong and Dhaka, passing through on his way to [[Burma]] from [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt; This may have been [[Jamál Effendi]], an early Bahá'í who travelled there.&lt;ref name="momen99"/&gt; Regardless it is clear that Effendi undertook a second trip to south-east Asia in about 1884-5. Effendi was asked to return to the region by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and this time accompanied by Sayyid Mustafá. They set off for India and eventually stopped in Dhaka, the capital of [[Bangladesh]] where they met some people including a professor of Arabic at [[Dhaka College]]. Much later, around 1891, Jamál Effendi was confused with a terrorist and reported on by British agents among the Indian population, as confirmed by records found in the Indian government's national archives.&lt;ref name="momen99"/&gt; Following the passing of Bahá'u'lláh, as the leadership of the religion fell to [['Abdu'l-Bahá]], he in turn sent further representatives in his stead – both Persian and American.&lt;ref name="garlington"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garlington | first = William | editor-last = R.I.

As early as 1910 the national community in India/Burma was urged to visibly distinguish itself from Islam by Bahá'í institutions of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Letter from the House of Spirituality of Bahais, Chicago, Ill., U.

Representatives from India's major religious communities were present as well as Bahá'í delegates from throughout the country.

===Middle period===
In 1923, still as part of India, a regional [[National Spiritual Assembly]] was formed for India and Burma which then included the area now part of Bangladesh as well as Pakistan.&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{cite web| last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies | work = Research notes | publisher = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation  | doi =| accessdate = 21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first Bahá'ís in the area that would later become Bangladesh was when a Bengali group from Chittagong accepted the religion while they were in Burma.&lt;ref name="encyc"/&gt; In 1937, [[John Esslemont]]'s ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' was translated and published in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (Baha'u'llah o nab zug) in Chittagong under the authority of the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | authorlink = Bahá'í International Community | title = "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era" editions and printings held in Bahá'í World Centre Library Decade by decade 1920 -2000+ | work = General Collections | publisher = International Bahá'í Library | url = http://library.bahai.org/gc/bne.html | doi = | accessdate = 4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Enoch Olinga]], later a prominent Bahá'í, was stationed in what was then [[East Pakistan]] as a member of the British military before he left the military and became a member of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Francis | first = Richard | title = Enoch Olinga Hand of the Cause of God Father of Victories | work = Collected Biographies | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | year = 1998 | url =http://bahai-library.com/francis_olinga_biography  | accessdate = 4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950 there were enough members of the religion to begin setting up administrative bodies. These were Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] and they were elected in [[Chittagong]] and [[Dacca]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; With independence as part of Pakistan in 1958, East and West Pakistan elected a separate national assembly from India.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw18"&gt;{{Cite book

==In more recent times==
In 1996 the [[Universal House of Justice]] commented:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Universal House of Justice | first = | authorlink = Universal House of Justice | title = Ridvan Letter to South Asia | work = Published by the Universal House of Justice | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | date = April 1996 | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ridvan_1996_southasia  | accessdate = 4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Bahá'í community of Bangladesh, flourishing in the midst of a Muslim society, is a source of joy to the entire Bahá'í world. In recent years and with astonishing rapidity, that community began to achieve extraordinary success in the teaching field, and throughout the Three Year Plan it has sustained consistently large-scale expansion. Its institutions have demonstrated their capacity to mobilize the human resources at their disposal, and those who have responded to the call for action have sacrificially and with the utmost devotion spread the Divine Teachings among the Muslim, Hindu and tribal populations of that country. The purity of their motives and the sincerity of their efforts to address the needs of society have won them recognition from government officials in the highest circles. Their exertions to promote love and unity among the majority Muslim and minority Hindu populations are bearing increasing fruit, a striking testimony to the potency of Bahá'u'lláh's Revelation."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern community==
In Bangladesh the Bahá'ís have had the right to hold their public meetings, establish academic centres, teach their faith, and elect their administrative councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wardany | first = Youssef | title = The Right of Belief in Egypt: Case study of Baha’i minority | work =  | publisher = Al Waref Institute | year = 2009 | url = http://www.alwaref.org/en/accueil/39-human-rights/89-the-right-of-belief-in-egypt-case-study-of-bahai-minority | accessdate = 4 April 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090315233147/http://alwaref.org/en/accueil/39-human-rights/89-the-right-of-belief-in-egypt-case-study-of-bahai-minority | archivedate = 15 March 2009 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the government of Bangladesh voted against the United Nations resolution ''Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran'' on 19 December 2001 raised in response to the [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | authorlink = Bahá'í International Community | title = UN General Assembly Resolution 2001 | work = | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | year = 2008 | url =http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-3-23.html | doi = | accessdate = 4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Bahá'ís in Bangladesh have been able to co-ordinate and act in groups. About 150 gathered for a summer school in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bangladesh | journal = Bahá'í News |date=February 1978 | issue = 563 | page = 17 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 300 attended the winter school held February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Around the World; Bangladesh | journal = Bahá'í News |date=June 1978 | issue = 567 | page = 13 | url = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zena Sorabjee of the [[Bahá'í International Community]], shared a platform with [[Pope John Paul II]] during his visit to India in 1999 and the meeting was aired through satellite television.

The Bahá'ís went in groups to request their travel documents, with many of them waiting up to three days even to reach the door. In the end, most were turned away without the visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = The Kolkata Regional Conference | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | pages = | date =  23 November 2008 | url =http://news.bahai.org/community-news/regional-conferences/kolkata.html | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bahá'í marriage''' is union of a man and a woman.  Its purpose is mainly spiritual and is to foster harmony, fellowship and unity between the two partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=42|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] teachings on [[marriage]] call it a ''fortress for well-being and salvation'' and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of [[society|human society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=205|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-105.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual nature ==

The Bahá'í teachings on marriage see it as an eternal bond that survives past the lives of the partners in the physical life, and into the [[Bahá'í cosmology|spiritual worlds]].  Thus the teachings stress that during courting the partners must take the utmost care to become acquainted with each other's character.  Furthermore, the husband and wife should be united not only physically, but also spiritually, so that they can improve the spiritual life of each other, and that they can spiritually advance towards God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=369|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engagement ==

The [[Parenting|parents]] cannot interfere with the selection of the person their child wants to get married to, but marriage has been conditioned, once the couple’s wish is known, upon the permission of their parents.&lt;ref name="Abdu'l-Bahá: Selections from the Writings of Abdu'l-Bahá, p. 118"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=376|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of this law is to foster unity between the two families, since the Bahá'í teachings see marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure and society, and having disunity between two families is not conducive to that.  The consent of all parents is needed even if one of the partners is not a Bahá'í.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=207|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-109.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís{{who|date=December 2017}} see this aspect of Bahá'í marriage as combining marriages practices from the East and West;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} in the East arranged marriage is common, and in the west marriages sometimes go forward with no input from the parents.  The Bahá'í marriage gives full freedom of the individuals to select their partner, but places certain gratitude and respect to the parents.

:"A couple should study each other's character and spend time getting to know each other before they decide to marry, and when they do marry it should be with the intention of establishing an eternal bond." &lt;ref&gt;The Universal House of Justice. ''Baha'i Marriage and Family Life''. November 2, 1982, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waiting period===
The time between the official public announcement of the marriage and the wedding ceremony should not exceed 95 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahá’u’lláh’s Marriage Law|url=http://www.bahaimarriage.net/Baha'iMarriageLaws-BahaiCanadaExcerpt-Feb2011.pdf|pages=37–38|date=January–February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=120|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-15.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=fa:گنجينه حدود و احكام|pages=166|url=http://reference.bahai.org/fa/t/c/|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 95-day period of engagement is currently applicable only to Persian
believers.&lt;ref&gt;National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States. "[https://www.scribd.com/doc/279529/NSA-USA-Developing-Distinctive-Bahai-Communities Developing Distinctive Baha'i Communities]". Office of Assembly Development, Evanston, Illinois, 1998, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremony ==

The Bahá'í marriage ceremony is done differently in each culture. The only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] which both the groom and the bride recite:

:''We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.'' &lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh. [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-15.html#gr6 The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: The Most Holy Book]. Bahá'í Publishing Trust, 1873, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

in the presence of two witnesses to be recorded through a Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]]. Legal recognition depends on the civil laws of the country.

Most Bahá'í marriage ceremonies consist of the reading of Bahá'í writings, prayers and music followed by a talk about the spiritual nature of Bahá'í marriage, and then the reading of the vows.

== Laws ==

There are a number of laws that concern Bahá'í marriage

*Marriage is not obligatory, but is highly recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=149|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Marriage is defined between a man and a woman (see [[Homosexuality and Bahá'í Faith]]).
*Only married couples may engage in sexual activity.
*Both partners must be at least 15 years of age at the time of engagement. (The civil laws of their country must be obeyed)
*Marriage is conditional on the consent of both parties and their parents.&lt;ref name="The Kitáb-i-Aqdas"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=150|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Marriage with non-Bahá'ís is permitted&lt;ref name="The Kitáb-i-Aqdas"/&gt; (see [[Interreligious marriage#Bahá'í Faith|Interreligious marriage]]).
*The period of engagement must not exceed ninety-five days.&lt;ref name="The Kitáb-i-Aqdas"/&gt; (Not currently universally applicable)
*A marriage should condition a payment of a dowry. The payment, if the husband lives in a city, is nineteen [http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/glossary.html#Mithqal mithqáls] (approx. 2.22 troy ounces) of pure gold, and if the husband lives in a village the same amount in silver. However, it is preferable to content oneself with the lowest level that is nineteen mithqáls of silver for both city and village dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas|page=209|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-112.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bahá'u'lláh also set a maximum permitted dowry amount of 95 mithqáls (approx. 11.1 troy ounces). (Not currently universally applicable)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws from the Kitab-i-Aqdas Not Yet Binding|url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_laws_not_binding|author=Universal House of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and parenting==

Following the natural and appropriate extension of the union of marriage, children, whether adopted or biological, should be raised in this same spiritual atmosphere. Formal duties exist between parents and children (of education and obedience, training and respect.) Second to discovering God for oneself is respect for one's parents. Reversing the degradation of women and children is a subject of much attention in the Bahá'í Faith.

John (Baptist) '''Canut of Bon''' Gil ([[Valencia]], September 30, 1846 - [[Santiago]], November 9, 1896) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] preacher, best known for spreading his Protestant faith and founding evangelical churches in [[Chile]] during the [[19th century|nineteenth century]].

== Background ==
At age 18, John Canut of Bon entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Balaguer|Balaguer, Leida]]. It is likely that he was of low socioeconomic status and was in training to become a [[tailor]]. After two years of training, he declared his religious vows and was sent to the [[Jesuit college|Jesuit College]] of [[Tortosa]] by the tailor shop he was working at.

The political situation in [[Spain]] at the time ([[Carlist Wars]] between clergy and laity) made it difficult for Canut of Bon to stay in the country, so he was reassigned to [[Argentina]] where he learned [[homeopathy]]. He later moved to [[Chile]] and then retired from the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] in 1871, not because he lost his Catholic faith, but because he wanted to study. In 1872, he settled in [[Andes|The Andes]] where he devoted himself to the sale of fabrics and continued to work as a tailor. In August 5 of that year, he married Virginia Aguilar Robles, with whom he had three children.

In December 1876, he found a copy of the [[New Testament]] on a platform of a railway station in [[Quillota]] from the Bible Society of [[Valparaíso|Valparaiso]]. He defined this episode as the first meeting he had with the [[Gospel]].In 1880, he had the opportunity to meet a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] preacher named Robert MacLean, with whom he became friends. Canut of Bon then went on to become the first Spanish-speaking preacher in Chile.

His preaching in a country that was mostly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] led him to become a sort of outcast amongst from the foreign Presbyterians who feared deportation from Chile for violating the rules contained in the Constitution of 1833, which gave priority to the Official State Church over other religions. Canut of Bon was soon expelled for his new religion.

He asked for a reinstatement to the [[Catholic Church]] in 1884 in [[Curicó|Curico]]. However, his "Catholic Period" came to an end in 1888, when he met an [[Americans|American]] [[Methodism|Methodist]] pastor named [[William Taylor (bishop)|William Taylor]] (1821-1902) who preached in [[Africa]] and [[India]] between 1856 and 1883. In 1890, Canut of Bon was consecrated as bishop of the Methodist faith. His way of preaching, which was spirited and filled with knowledge, attracted many. However, this also meant that many enemies and his previous clients abandoned him. Despite this, he began to preach full-time, relying on his knowledge in the field of homeopathy to stay in the area. To avoid rejection from the [[Catholic priests]], he enlarged his preaching territory to southern cities and places where the Catholic Church had much less of an influence. For five years, he preached the Gospel and founded churches in [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]], [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], [[Concepción, Chile|Concepcion]], [[Traiguén|Traiguen]], [[Angol]], Los Angeles, Victoria, and [[Temuco]].

Unfortunately, in 1896, he had to move to [[Santiago]] for health reasons where he died on November 9. His remains rest in the Patio of Dissenters of the General Cemetery of Santiago.

== Legacies ==
In the context of secular struggles caused by the non-separation of church and state, his style of street preaching caused him persecution and ridicule, but also a group of followers who decided to call themselves "Canutos," or "Followers of Canut." In the early [[20th century|twentieth century]], a writer and anarchist, Jose Santos Gonzalez Verades, described police offers arresting a group of evangelicals preaching and singing their way into prison, proclaiming themselves to be Canutos. Although this term has been extended to all members of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical churches]], whether of not they are followers of Canut of Bon, on occasion, the term is used to refer to any very religious person who effusively professes his or her religion in public. Some sectors of the evangelical cult reject this nickname and consider it burlesque, but it is accepted by the vast majority of evangelicals.

'''Charles Wendell''' "'''Chuck'''" '''Colson''' (October 16, 1931&amp;nbsp;– April 21, 2012) served as [[White House Counsel|Special Counsel]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] from 1969 to 1973. Once known as President Nixon's "hatchet man," Colson gained notoriety at the height of the [[Watergate scandal]], for being named as one of the [[Watergate Seven]], and pleaded guilty to [[obstruction of justice]] for attempting to defame [[Pentagon Papers]] defendant [[Daniel Ellsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917055,00.html A Gallery of the Guilty]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. January 13, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he served seven months in the federal [[Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery|Maxwell Prison]] in [[Alabama]] as the first member of the Nixon administration to be incarcerated for Watergate-related charges.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colsoncenter.org/the-center/the-chuck-colson-center/about-chuck-colson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101235915/http://www.colsoncenter.org/the-center/the-chuck-colson-center/about-chuck-colson|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 1, 2009|title=About Chuck Colson|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson became an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian in 1973. His mid-life religious conversion sparked a radical life change that led to the founding of his non-profit ministry [[Prison Fellowship]] and, three years later, [[Prison Fellowship International]], to a focus on [[Christian worldview]] teaching and training around the world. Colson was also a public speaker and the author of more than 30 books.&lt;ref name="demossnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demossnews.com/breakpoint/press_kit/chuck_colson_bio|title=Chuck Colson Bio|accessdate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203061122/http://demossnews.com/breakpoint/press_kit/chuck_colson_bio|archivedate=February 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder and chairman of The Chuck Colson Center for Christian Worldview, which is "a research, study, and networking center for growing in a Christian worldview", and includes Colson's daily radio commentary, [[BreakPoint]], heard on more than 1,400 outlets across the United States (and continues to be broadcast with an alternating panel from the Colson Center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colsoncenter.org/the-center/the-chuck-colson-center|title=The Chuck Colson Center|accessdate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418172729/http://www.colsoncenter.org/the-center/the-chuck-colson-center|archivedate=April 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demossnews.com/breakpoint/press_kit/colson_center_fact_sheet|title=Colson Center Fact Sheet|accessdate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426031816/http://demossnews.com/breakpoint/press_kit/colson_center_fact_sheet|archivedate=April 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson was a principal signer of the 1994 ''[[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]]'' ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and [[Roman Catholic]] leaders in the United States.

Colson received 15 [[honorary doctorates]], and in 1993 was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] for Progress in Religion, the world's largest annual award (over US$1&amp;nbsp;million) in the field of religion, given to a person who "has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension". He donated this prize to further the work of Prison Fellowship, as he did all his speaking fees and royalties. In 2008, he was awarded the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[George W. Bush]].

== Early life, education and family ==
Charles Wendell Colson was born on October 16, 1931, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the son of Inez "Dizzy" (née Ducrow) and Wendell Ball Colson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-6987-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk4G-52QT-8C&amp;pg=PA261 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of Swedish and British descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=Jonathan|title=Charles Colson: A Life Redeemed|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-8030-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHVam0Ufv10C&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth Colson had seen the charitable works of his parents. His mother cooked meals for the hungry during the Depression and his father donated his legal services to the United Prison Association of New England.&lt;ref name=Aitken /&gt; Historian [[Jonathan Aitken]] notes "Wendell's compassion for prisoners flowed from his Christian ethics, which he instilled into his son's upbringing."&lt;ref name=Aitken /&gt; Aitken also notes that "Mrs. Colson was proud of being a member of the Episcopal Church and even prouder of her acquaintance with its diocesan bishop, Bishop Fisk, who she thought would be a splendid role model for her Charlie."&lt;ref name=Aitken /&gt; Aitken holds that his mother's suggestion to the young Colson "You ought to be a minister," were motivated by "social rather than religious" reasons and holds "she had no believing relationship in Christ, and neither did her husband or her son."&lt;ref name=Aitken /&gt; Noting that "None of them ever read the Bible" and holding that "their extremely rare visits to church were purely nominal", Aitken concludes "religious belief had no part to play in the early upbringing of Charles Colson."&lt;ref name=Aitken&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles W. Colson: A Life Redeemed|author=Jonathan Aitken|pages=28–29|location=Colorado Springs, CO|publisher=Waterbrook Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Colson organized fund-raising campaigns in his school for the war effort that raised enough money to buy a [[Jeep]] for the [[United States Army|army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

pages=9, 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Colson volunteered in the campaign to re-elect the [[Governor of Massachusetts]], [[Robert F. Bradford|Robert Bradford]].

After attending [[BB&amp;N|Browne &amp; Nichols School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] in 1949, he earned his AB, with honors, in history from [[Brown University]] in 1953, and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], with honors, from [[George Washington University Law School]] in 1959. At Brown, he was a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]].

Colson's first marriage with Nancy Billings, in 1953, bore three children: Wendell Ball II (born 1954), Christian Billings (1956), and Emily Ann (1958). After some years of separation, the marriage ended in divorce in January 1964. He married Patricia Ann Hughes on April 4, 1964.

== Early career ==
Colson served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] from 1953 to 1955, reaching the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Marine Corps)|Captain]]. From 1955 to 1956, he was Assistant to the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Material)]]. He then worked on the successful 1960 campaign of [[Leverett Saltonstall]] ([[U.S. Republican Party]] for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]), and was his Administrative Assistant from 1956 to 1961. In 1961 Colson founded the [[law firm]] of Colson &amp; Morin, which swiftly grew to a Boston and Washington, D.C. presence with the addition of former [[Securities Exchange Commission]] chairman [[Edward Gadsby]] and former [[Raytheon Company]] general counsel [[Paul Hannah]]. Colson and Morin shortened the name to Gadsby &amp; Hannah in late 1967. Colson left the firm to join the [[Richard Nixon]] administration in January 1969.

== Nixon administration ==

=== White House duties ===

In 1968, Colson served as [[counsel]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Richard Nixon]]'s Key Issues Committee.&lt;ref name=nixon_archives&gt;[http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/special/smof/colson.php Special Files: Charles W. Colson], United States National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1969, Colson was appointed as [[White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs|Special Counsel]] to [[U.S. President|President]] Nixon.&lt;ref name=nixon_archives /&gt;

Colson was responsible for inviting influential private special-interest groups into the [[White House]] policy-making process and winning their support on specific issues. His office served as the President's political communications liaison with [[organized labor]], [[veterans]], [[farmers]], [[conservationists]], industrial organizations, citizen groups, and almost any organized lobbying group whose objectives were compatible with the administration's. Colson's staff broadened the White House lines of communication with organized constituencies by arranging presidential meetings and sending White House news releases of interest to the groups.&lt;ref name=nixon_archives /&gt;

In addition to his liaison and political duties, Colson's responsibilities included performing special assignments for the president, such as drafting legal briefs on particular issues, reviewing presidential appointments, and suggesting names for White House guest lists. His work also included major [[lobbying]] efforts on such issues as construction of an [[antiballistic missile]] system, the president's [[Vietnamization]] program, and the administration's revenue-sharing proposal.&lt;ref name=nixon_archives /&gt;

=== "The ''Evil Genius'' of an Evil Administration" ===

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine writer [[David Plotz]] described Colson as "Richard Nixon's hard man, the 'evil genius' of an evil administration."&lt;ref name=plotz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/77067

Colson authored the 1971 memo listing Nixon's major political opponents, later known as [[Nixon's enemies list]]. A quip that "Colson would walk over his own grandmother if necessary" mutated into claims in news stories that Colson had boasted that he would run over his own grandmother to re-elect Nixon.&lt;ref name=BA5 /&gt; In a February 13, 1973, conversation, Colson told Nixon that he had always had "a little prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Nagourney|Nagourney, Adam]] (December 10, 2010) [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html "In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks"].

=== New York City Hard Hat Riot ===
{{Main|Hard Hat Riot}}
On May 4, 1970, four students were shot dead at [[Kent State University]] in [[Ohio]] while protesting the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Cambodian Campaign|incursion into Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kifner, "4 Kent State Students Killed by Troops," ''New York Times,'' May 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; As a show of sympathy for the dead students, [[Mayor Lindsay]] ordered all flags at New York City Hall to be flown at half-staff that same day.

A transcription made of a White House tape recording dated May 5, 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19810924&amp;id=zwAtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Cc4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1256,1203545&amp;hl=en "Tape: Nixon Wanted Thugs to Assault Demonstrators".] ''The Palm Beach Post''.

September 25, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; documents that the planning phase of the [[Hard Hat Riot]] took place in the White House Oval Office. Colson is heard successfully instigating several New York State [[AFL-CIO]] union leaders into organizing an attack against student protesters in New York. These officials then armed some 200 construction workers down in [[Lower Manhattan]] with lengths of steel [[re-bar]] which they, along with their hard hats, proceeded to use against about 1,000 high school and college students protesting the Vietnam War and the [[Kent State shootings]]. The initial attack was near the intersection of [[Wall Street]] and [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]], but the riot soon spread to [[New York City Hall]] and lasted a little more than two hours. More than 70 people were injured, including four policemen. Six people were arrested.&lt;ref name=plotz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Republican Gomorrah: Inside The Movement That Shattered The Party.'' pp. 59–60. Max Blumenthal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the Hard Hat Riot, Colson arranged a White House ceremony honoring the union leader most responsible for the attack, [[Peter J. Brennan]], president of the Building and Construction Trades local for New York City.  Brennan was later appointed [[U.S. Secretary of Labor]] and served under Presidents Nixon and [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;''Republican Gomorrah: Inside The Movement That Shattered The Party.'' p. 60. Max Blumenthal.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firebombing the Brookings Institution ===

Colson also proposed firebombing the [[Brookings Institution]] and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put the fire out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Mehren|title=Insanity in Nixon's White House |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 18, 2003}} (Text available [http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/2003/2003-February/004943.html here.])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=John|title=Blind Ambition|year=1976|isbn=0-671-81248-3 |pages= 35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watergate'', by Fred Emery.

=== Attacking the young Vietnam veteran John Kerry ===

Colson's voice, from archives from April 1969, is heard in the 2004 movie ''[[Going Upriver]]'' deprecating the anti-war efforts of [[John Kerry]]. Colson's orders were to "destroy the young [[demagogy|demagogue]] before he becomes another [[Ralph Nader]]."&lt;ref name=boston_061703&gt;[http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061703.shtml With antiwar role, high visibility], Boston Globe, June 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc_040316&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4534274/ Nixon targeted Kerry for anti-war views], Brian Williams, NBC News, March 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a phone conversation with Nixon on April 28, 1971, Colson said, "This fellow Kerry that they had on last week...He turns out to be really quite a phony."&lt;ref name=boston_061703 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc_040316 /&gt;

== Watergate and Ellsberg scandals ==
{{Watergate|White House}}
Colson attended some meetings of [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP or CREEP). However, he and the White House Staff "had come to regard the Committee to Re-elect the President as a rival organisation... those Jackasses over at CREEP".&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 2005, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  When Colson had taken charge of the Office of Communications, he was offered but rejected [[Jeb Magruder]] as a senior staffer, and Magruder was instead sent over to CRP, as 

{{quote|"At least he can't do any harm there" replied Colson.  It was one of his less prescient judgements.  Unknown to Colson and most other White House personnel, Magruder had been doing enormous harm by authorizing a series of James Bond-style clandestine operations against the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 2005, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At a CRP meeting on March 21, 1971, it was agreed to spend US$250,000 on "intelligence gathering" on the Democratic Party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/29/AR2008052903171.html?noredirect=on|title=THE STRONG MAN - John Mitchell and the Secrets of Watergate|last=Rosen|first=John|date=June 2008|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Colson and [[John Ehrlichman]] had recruited [[E. Howard Hunt]] as a $100-a-day White House consultant,&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 2005, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; though Hunt never worked directly for Colson, he did several odd jobs for Colson's office prior to working for [[Egil Krogh|Egil "Bud" Krogh]], head of the [[White House Plumbers|White House Special Operations Unit (the so-called "Plumbers")]],&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 2005, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; which had been organized to stop leaks in the Nixon administration. Hunt teamed with [[G. Gordon Liddy]], and the two headed the Plumbers' attempted burglary of [[Pentagon Papers]]-leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s psychiatrist's office in Los Angeles in September 1971. The Pentagon Papers were a group of military documents comprising an exhaustive study of the United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. Their publication helped increase opposition to the war. Colson hoped that revelations about Ellsberg could be used to discredit the [[anti-war|anti-Vietnam War]] cause. Colson admitted to leaking information from Ellsberg's confidential [[FBI]] file to the press, but denied organizing Hunt's burglary of Ellsberg's office.&lt;ref name=BA5 /&gt; In his 2005 book, ''The Good Life'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although not discovered until several years after Nixon had resigned and Colson had finished serving his prison term, transcripts of a tape-recorded June 20, 1972 White House conversation between Nixon and Colson has denials from both men of the White House's involvement in the break-in; Hunt had been off the payroll for three months, Colson asks "Do they think I'm that dumb?".  Nixon does comment that "we have got to have lawyers smart enough to have our people de-, delay (unintelligible) avoiding--depositions, of course, uh, are one possibility. We've got--I think it would be a quite the thing for the judge to call in Mitchell and have a deposition in the middle of the campaign, don't you?" to which Colson responds that he would welcome a deposition because "I'm not--,
because nobody, everybody's completely out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title="TRANSCRIPT OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND CHARLES COLSON" June 20, 1972 White House conversation of Richard Nixon and Charles Colson, p.15| url=http://millercenter.org/images/presidentialrecordings/watergate/wspf_transcripts/WSFP_342-027.pdf| publisher=Watergate Special Prosecution Force Transcripts| accessdate=2015-08-13| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222105120/http://millercenter.org/images/presidentialrecordings/watergate/wspf_transcripts/WSFP_342-027.pdf| archivedate=December 22, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 1973, seventeen months before Nixon's resignation, Colson resigned from the White House to return to the private practice of law, as Senior Partner at the law firm of Colson and Shapiro, Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=BGC&gt;[http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/275.htm Papers of Charles Wendell Colson – Collection 275] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423160655/http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/275.htm |date=April 23, 2010 }}, Archives, Billy Graham Center, December 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Colson was retained as a special consultant by Nixon for several more months.&lt;ref&gt;''Watergate'', by Fred Emery, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-684-81323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indicted ===
On March 1, 1974, Colson was indicted for conspiring to cover up the Watergate burglaries.&lt;ref name=nixon_archives /&gt;

=== Introduced to Evangelical  Christianity ===
As Colson was facing arrest, his close friend, [[Raytheon Company]] chairman of the board Thomas L. Phillips, gave Colson a copy of ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], which, after reading it, led Colson to become an [[evangelical Christian]]. Colson then joined a prayer group led by [[Douglas Coe]] and including Democratic Senator [[Harold Hughes]], Republican congressman [[Al Quie]] and Democratic congressman [[Graham B. Purcell, Jr.]] When news of the conversion emerged much later, several U.S. newspapers, as well as ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'',&lt;ref name="buckley"&gt;William Buckley. "Colson Christianity skepticism unfounded," originally in ''Washington Star'' and reprinted in ''The Dallas Morning News'', June 28, 1974, p. 21A.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ridiculed the conversion, claiming that it was a ploy to reduce his sentence.&lt;ref name="softball"&gt;{{cite journal |title =The Man Who Converted to Softball|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date =June 17, 1974|url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,879314,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1975 memoir ''Born Again'',&lt;ref&gt;Colson, Charles W. ''Born Again.'' Chosen Books, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Colson noted that a few writers published sympathetic stories, as in the case of a widely reprinted [[UPI]] article, "From Watergate to Inner Peace."&lt;ref name="inner"&gt;United Press International. "From Watergate to Inner Peace," ''The Dallas Morning News'', December 20, 1973, p. 8A.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pleads guilty, imprisoned ===
After taking the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] on the advice of his lawyers during early testimony, Colson found himself torn between his desire to be truthful and his desire to avoid conviction on charges of which he believed himself innocent. Following prayer and consultation with his fellowship group, Colson approached his lawyers and suggested a plea of guilty to a different criminal charge of which he did consider himself to be culpable.&lt;ref name="prayer"&gt;Maryln Schwartz. "Prayer for Colson," ''The Dallas Morning News'', June 7, 1974, p. 8A.&lt;/ref&gt;

After days of negotiation with Watergate [[Special Prosecutor]] [[Leon Jaworski]] and Watergate Trial Judge [[Gerhard Gesell]], Colson pleaded guilty to [[obstruction of justice]] on the basis of having attempted to defame Ellsberg's character in the build-up to the trial in order to influence the jury against him. Journalist [[Carl Rowan]] commented in a column of June 10, 1974 that the guilty plea came "at a time when the judge was making noises about dismissing the charges against him", and speculated that Colson was preparing to reveal highly damaging information against Nixon,&lt;ref name="rowan610"&gt;Carl Rowan. "Colson could bring swift end to puzzle," ''The Dallas Morning News'', June 10, 1974, p. 23A.&lt;/ref&gt; an expectation shared by columnist [[Clark Mollenhoff]]; Mollenhoff even went so far as to suggest that for Colson ''not'' to become a "devastating witness" would cast doubt on the sincerity of his conversion.&lt;ref name="mollenhoff"&gt;Clark Mollenhoff. "Colson could mean trouble," ''The Dallas Morning News'', June 29, 1974, p. 19A.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 1974, Colson was given a one-to- three-year sentence and fined $5,000.&lt;ref name=nixon_archives /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap0622"&gt;Associated Press. "Colson ordered to serve 1 to 3 years in prison," ''The Dallas Morning News'', June 22, 1974, p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently [[Disbarment|disbarred]] in the [[District of Columbia]], with the expectation of his also being prohibited from using his licenses from Virginia and Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="disbarred"&gt;"Court Disbars Charles Colson," ''The Dallas Morning News'', June 27, 1974, p. 12A.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interest in prison reform ===
''Born Again'', Colson's personal memoir reflecting on his religious conversion and prison term, was made into [[Born Again (film)|a 1978 dramatic film]] starring [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Colson, [[Anne Francis]] as his wife Patty, and [[Harold Hughes]] as himself. Actor [[Kevin Dunn]] portrayed Colson in the 1995 movie ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.

During his time in prison, Colson had become increasingly aware of what he saw as injustices done to prisoners and incarcerates and shortcomings in their rehabilitation; he also had the opportunity, during a three-day furlough to attend his father's funeral, to pore over his father's papers and discover the two shared an interest in prison reform. He became convinced that he was being called by God to develop a ministry to prisoners with an emphasis in promoting changes in the justice system.

== Career after prison ==

=== Prison ministry ===
After his release from prison, Colson founded [[Prison Fellowship]] in 1976, which today is "the nation's largest outreach to prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families".&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demossnews.com/pf/press_kit/pfm_history_a_timeline |title=Prison Fellowship: A Timeline |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615123655/http://demossnews.com/pf/press_kit/pfm_history_a_timeline |archivedate=June 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prisonfellowship.org/why-pf/news/entry/37/15488 |title=Nation's Largest Prison Ministry Announces Appointment of New CEO |date=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501151357/http://www.prisonfellowship.org/why-pf/news/entry/37/15488 |archivedate=May 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Colson worked to promote prisoner rehabilitation and reform of the prison system in the United States, citing his disdain for what he called the "lock 'em and leave 'em" warehousing approach to criminal justice. He helped to create prisons whose populations come from inmates who choose to participate in [[Faith-based organization|faith-based programs]].

In 1979, Colson founded [[Prison Fellowship International]] to extend his prison outreach outside the United States. Now in 120 countries, [[Prison Fellowship International]] is the largest, most extensive association of national Christian ministries working within the criminal justice field, working to proclaim the Gospel worldwide and alleviate the suffering of prisoners and their families. In 1983, [[Prison Fellowship International]] received special consultative status with the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations]]. During this time, Colson also founded Justice Fellowship, using his influence in conservative political circles to push for bipartisan, legislative reforms in the U.S. criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justicefellowship.org/|title=Justice Fellowship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2003, Colson was invited by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to the [[White House]] to present results of a scientific study on the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships|faith-based initiative]], InnerChange, at the [[Carol Vance Unit]] (originally named the Jester II Unit) prison facility of the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] in [[Fort Bend County, Texas]]. Colson led a small group that includes Dr. Byron Johnson of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who was the principal researcher of the InnerChange study, a few staff members of [[Prison Fellowship]] and three InnerChange graduates to the meeting. In the presentation, Johnson explained that 171 participants in the InnerChange program were compared to a matched group of 1,754 inmates from the prison's general population. The study found that only 8 percent of InnerChange graduates, as opposed to 20.3 percent of inmates in the matched comparison group, became offenders again in a two-year period. In other words, the recidivism rate was cut by almost two-thirds for those who complete the faith-based program. Those who are dismissed for disciplinary reasons or who drop out voluntarily, or those who are paroled before completion, have a comparable rate of rearrest and incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nicic.org/Library/019041|title=NICIC.gov: CRRUCS Report 2003:  InnerChange Freedom Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Christian advocacy ===
Colson maintained a variety of media channels which discuss contemporary issues from an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian worldview. In his ''[[Christianity Today]]'' columns, for example, Colson opposed [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref name=christianpost&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080702/the-coming-persecution.htm "The coming persecution: how same-sex 'marriage' will harm Christians,"] ''Christian Post'', July 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that [[Darwinism]] is used to attack Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928234416/http://www.breakpoint.org/listingarticle.asp?ID=2951 God Versus Darwin: What Darwinism Really Means], ''Breakpoint'' (a Prison Fellowship publication).&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against Darwinism and in favor of [[intelligent design]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakpoint.org/listingarticle.asp?ID=2250 Chuck Colson's Ten Questions about Origins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211055804/http://www.breakpoint.org/listingarticle.asp?ID=2250 |date=February 11, 2009 }}, ''Breakpoint''&lt;/ref&gt; saying Darwinism helped cause forced sterilizations by [[eugenics|eugenicists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/ChuckColson/2006/04/07/deadly_exports|title=Deadly exports|author=Chuck Colson|work=townhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson was an outspoken critic of [[postmodernism]], believing that as a cultural worldview, it is incompatible with the Christian tradition. He debated prominent [[evangelicalism#Post-evangelicalism|post-evangelicals]], such as [[Brian McLaren]], on the best response for the evangelical church in dealing with the postmodern cultural shift. Colson, however, came alongside the [[creation care]] movement when endorsing Christian environmentalist author [[Nancy Sleeth]]’s ''Go Green, Save Green: A Simple Guide to Saving Time, Money, and God's Green Earth''. In the early 1980s, Colson was invited to New York by [[David Frost]]'s variety program on [[NBC]] for an open debate with [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], the [[Atheism|atheist]] who in 1963, brought the court case (''[[Abington School District v. Schempp|Murray v. Curlett]]'') that eliminated official public school prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colson |first=Charles W. |title=The Good Life |author2=Harold Fickett |isbn=0-8423-7749-2 |publisher=[[Tyndale House]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson was a member of [[The Fellowship (Christian organization)|the Family]] (also known as the Fellowship), described by prominent evangelical Christians as one of the most politically well-connected fundamentalist organizations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Sharlet| authorlink = Jeff Sharlet (writer) |title=[[The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-055979-3 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 1991, Colson was invited to deliver a speech as part of the Distinguished Lecturer series at [[Harvard Business School]]. The speech was titled ''The Problem of Ethics'', where he argued that a society without a foundation of moral absolutes cannot long survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/031/The%20Problem%20of%20Ethics%20By%20Charles%20W%20Colson_031_6_.htm The Problem of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140634/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/031/The%20Problem%20of%20Ethics%20By%20Charles%20W%20Colson_031_6_.htm |date=November 23, 2010 }}, Charles W. Colson, April 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson was later a principal signer of the 1994 ''[[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]]'' ecumenical document signed by leading Evangelical Protestants and [[Roman Catholic]] leaders in the United States, part of a larger ecumenical rapprochement in the United States that had begun in the 1970s with Catholic-Evangelical collaboration during the [[Gerald R. Ford Administration]] and in later para-church organizations such as [[Moral Majority]] founded by [[Jerry Falwell|Rev. Jerry Falwell]] at the urging of [[Francis Schaeffer]] and his son [[Frank Schaeffer]] during the [[Jimmy Carter administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement That Shattered The Party. "Creating A Monster". pp.24-27, {{ISBN|978-1-56858-398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Colson was a principal writer and driving force behind an ecumenical statement known as the ''[[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]]'' calling on evangelicals, Catholics and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demossnews.com/manhattandeclaration/press_kit/manhattan_declaration_signers|title=demossnewspond.com|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901171332/http://demossnews.com/manhattandeclaration/press_kit/manhattan_declaration_signers|archivedate=September 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously had ignited controversy within Protestant circles for his mid-90s common-ground initiative with conservative Roman Catholics ''[[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]]'', which Colson wrote alongside prominent Roman Catholic [[Richard John Neuhaus]]. Colson was also a proponent of the Bible Literacy Project's curriculum ''[[The Bible and Its Influence]]'' for public high school literature courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibleliteracy.org/Site/PressRoom/Press20050922/Press051130Endorsements.htm What Scholars and Leaders are Saying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721024041/http://www.bibleliteracy.org/site/PressRoom/Press20050922/Press051130Endorsements.htm |date=July 21, 2009 }} {{Primary source inline|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colson has said that Protestants have a special duty to prevent anti-Catholic bigotry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorclaveau.com/htm_html/Anti-Catholicism/new_anticatholic_bigotry.htm|title=victorclaveau.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political engagement ===
In 1988, Colson became involved with the Elizabeth Morgan case,&lt;ref&gt;url=[[:simple:Elizabeth Morgan case]]&lt;/ref&gt; visiting Morgan in jail and lobbying to change federal law in order to free her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Matza |url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-09-28/news/26100732_1_eric-foretich-morgan-contempt |title=Readjusting To Life After Jail Elizabeth Morgan Talks Of Her Plans – But Reveals Little About Hilary, Her Daughter In Hiding |work=philly.com |date=September 28, 1989 |accessdate=October 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2002, Colson was one of the co-signers of the [[Land letter]] sent to President [[George W. Bush]]. The letter was written by [[Richard D. Land]], president of the [[Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission]] of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and co-signed by four prominent American evangelical Christian leaders with Colson among them. The letter outlined their theological support for a [[just war]] in the form of a pre-emptive [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

On June 1, 2005, Colson appeared in the national news commenting on the revelation that [[W. Mark Felt]] was [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8060320/ Nixon aides say Felt is no hero]. MSNBC. June 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Colson expressed disapproval in Felt's role in the Watergate scandal, first in the context of Felt being an FBI employee who should have known better than to disclose the results of a government investigation to the press (violating a fundamental tenet of FBI culture), and second in the context of the trust placed in him (which demanded a more active response, such as a face-to-face confrontation with the FBI director or Nixon or, had that failed, public resignation). His criticism of Felt provoked a harsh response from former ''[[Washington Post]]'' executive editor [[Benjamin Bradlee]], one of only three individuals to know who Deep Throat was prior to the public disclosure, who said he was "baffled" that Colson and Liddy were "lecturing the world about public morality" considering their role in the Watergate scandal. Bradlee stated that "as far as I'm concerned they have no standing in the morality debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradlee|first=Ben|title=Transcript: Deep Throat Revealed|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/06/01/DI2005060101457.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson also supported the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]]. He signed his name to a full-page ad in the December 5, 2008 ''[[The New York Times]]'' that objected to violence and intimidation against religious institutions and believers in the wake of the passage of Proposition 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/faith/ci_11189333|title=New ad blasts earlier ad condemning Prop 8 violence|last=Fletcher Stack|first=Peggy|date=December 2008|website=The Salt Lake Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad stated that "violence and intimidation are always wrong, whether the victims are believers, gay people, or anyone else."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/705268362/New-York-Times-ad-blasts-ire-aimed-at-LDS.html|title=New York Times ad blasts ire aimed at LDS|last=Aaron Falk and Jens Dana|first=|date=December 2008|website=Desert News Utah|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen other religious and human rights activists from several different faiths also signed the ad, noting that they "differ on important moral and legal questions," including Proposition 8.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Awards and honors ==

From 1982 to 1995, Colson received [[honorary doctorates]] from various colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=BPbio /&gt;

In 1990, [[The Salvation Army]] recognized Colson with its highest civic award, the Others Award. Previous recipients of the award include [[Barbara Bush]], [[Paul Harvey]], [[US Senator]] [[Bob Dole]] and the [[Meadows Foundation (Dallas, Texas)|Meadows Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20060328054937/http://www.theeagle.com/community/092604fundraiser.php Dinner to begin local Salvation Army campaign], The Bryan-College Station Eagle, September 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Colson was awarded the [[Templeton Prize]] for Progress in Religion, the world's largest cash gift (over $1&amp;nbsp;million), which is given each year to the one person in the world who has done the most to advance the cause of religion. He donated this prize, as he did all speaking fees and royalties, to further the work of [[Prison Fellowship]].

In 1994, Colson was quoted in contemporary Christian music artist [[Steven Curtis Chapman]]'s song "[[Heaven in the Real World]]" as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where is the hope? I meet millions of people who feel demoralized by the decay around us. The hope that each of us has is not in who governs us, or what laws we pass, or what great things we do as a nation. Our hope is in the power of God working through the hearts of people. And that's where our hope is in this country. And that's where our hope is in life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1999, Colson co-authored ''How Now Shall We Live?'' with [[Nancy Pearcey]] and published by [[Tyndale House]]. The book was winner of the [[Evangelical Christian Publishers Association]] 2000 [[Gold Medallion Book Award]] in the "Christianity and Society"  category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On February 9, 2001, the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]] (CCCU) presented Colson with the Mark O. Hatfield Leadership Award at the Forum on Christian Higher Education in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The award is presented to individuals who have demonstrated uncommon leadership that reflects the values of Christian higher education. The award was established in 1997 in honor of [[US Senator]] [[Mark Hatfield]], a long-time supporter of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cccu.org/news/newsID.83,parentNav.Archives/news_detail.asp Charles Colson receives prestigious leadership award], Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, February 15, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Colson was presented with the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[George W. Bush]].

== Later years ==
In 2000, [[Florida Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]] reinstated the rights taken away by Colson's felony conviction, including the [[right to vote#Prisoners and felons|right to vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America: Charles Colson|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1993235_1993243_1993264,00.html|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most adherents of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] will wear a cross attached to either a chain or a ''matäb'', a silk cord.&lt;ref name="eotc_cross"&gt;{{Cite web | title=The Sacramental: The cross and the crucifix | url=http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/miscellaneous/sacramental.html#crucifix | work=The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church | author=The Ethiopian Orthodox Church | editors=Aymero W. and Joachim M | publisher=Ethiopian Orthodox mission | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322232640/http://ethiopianorthodox.org/english/miscellaneous/sacramental.html | archivedate={{Date|2013-03-22}} | dead-url=yes | via=Ethiopianorthodox.org | location=[[Addis Ababa]] | date={{Date|2003}} |orig-year={{Date|1970}} | accessdate={{Date|2015-04-30}} | quote=Attached to a cord or fine chain [the cross] is worn around the neck of nearly all Christians right from childhood until death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=See explanation at WP:RSN, Archive 179, regarding Ethiopianorthodox.org|date=April 2015}}  The matäb is tied about the neck at the time of baptism, and the recipient is expected to wear the matäb at all times.&lt;ref name=Ethiopia&gt;{{cite book|author=Siegbert Uhlig|title=Encyclopædia Aethiopica: He-N|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|quote=The Matäb, an emblem of Christianity in Ethiopia, is a blue (sometimes black) silk cord tied around the neck of a child during the baptism ceremony.… Women may later append various elements on the M., though a simple cord is already considered a fully valuable M.

In some nations, such as the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], an [[atheist state]], the wearing of cross necklaces was historically banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin E.

Religious orders were abolished, and all religious rituals, including the celebration of the sacraments, were prohibited and punishable by the death penalty for those officiating. The people were not even allowed to have religious necklaces or to wear such things as small crosses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian [[bishop]]s of several denominations, such as the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]], wear the [[pectoral cross]] as a sign of their [[Holy orders|order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Ogilvie Buchanan|title=Historical dictionary of Anglicanism|year=2006 |publisher=Scarecrow Press|quote=A pectoral cross is conventional among bishops also.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5Ig4SDJFgkC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=pectoral+cross+anglican#v=onepage&amp;q=pectoral%20cross%20anglican&amp;f=false|isbn=9780810853270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two highly publicised British cases, nurse Shirley Chaplin and [[British Airways]] flight attendant [[Nadia Eweida]] were disciplined for wearing cross necklaces at work, in breach of their employment terms.

CHJCC has created a multi-racial, faith, and community-based program called "Project Care". Project Care has explored new avenues of communication and cooperation between local civic and religious leaders within the community. The project promotes social and economic development in Crown Heights.&lt;ref name="ch listing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyc listing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ColCare"/&gt;

==Organizational structure==
CHJCC is run by a [[council]], headed by the council [[chairman]]; the chairman and other members of the council are appointed in a [[election|public election]], held every three years.

===Elections===
The elections are overseen by a council representing all Crown Heights [[synagogue]]s, referred to as the "N’tzigim". In the event the N'tzigim are unable, or otherwise refuse to supervise the election, CHJCC must hire an outside firm to oversee the election.&lt;ref name="by laws"&gt;[http://thejfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BY_LAWS_VAAD_HAKOHOL_CH.pdf CHJCC bylaws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031233845/http://thejfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BY_LAWS_VAAD_HAKOHOL_CH.pdf |date=2013-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfile"&gt;[http://thejfile.com/chjcc-in-state-of-confusion-over-upcoming-elections/ jfile.com.

In 2008, at her request, she wished for Stanhope to be involved in an [[assisted suicide]] with a mixture of cocktails and prescription morphine.

At age 12, Stanhope's school [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] wrote a letter to his mother detailing his concern with Stanhope's tendency to sketch gory images and adult themed cartoons, suggesting he was "in need of professional help".&lt;ref name=guardian2011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/10/doug-stanhope-interview-tim-jonze|title=Doug Stanhope: pro-choice, pro-drugs, but defiantly anti-Guardian|first=Tim|last=Jonze|date=9 September 2011|work=the Guardian|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanhope quit school at fifteen.&lt;ref name=independent2004/&gt; Among his early comedy influences were [[Monty Python]] and [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]].&lt;ref name=apt/&gt; Before he started comedy full time, Stanhope worked in telemarketing, "borderline legal stuff, trying to scam people basically".&lt;ref name=guardian2011/&gt;

==Career==
===1990s===
Stanhope began his stand-up comedy career in 1990 at age 23,&lt;ref name=guardian2011/&gt; having moved to [[Las Vegas]] after six months in [[Los Angeles]]. He did his first routine at an open mic night at a local bar, where it made him "sit down and write jokes".&lt;ref name=apt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apt613.ca/comedian-doug-stanhope-at-ottawa-little-theatre-05-15-18/|title=Preview: Doug Stanhope at Ottawa Little Theatre—05.15.18|publisher=Apt613|first=Asim|last=B|date=May 9, 2018|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his act in Las Vegas before he moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where he landed a gig as a house [[Master of ceremonies|MC]] at a comedy club.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2011/&gt; He also lived in [[Orlando, Florida|Florida]], [[Oceanside, California]], [[Idaho]], and at one point returned to [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=apt/&gt; Stanhope lived out of his car for three years.

In 1995, he settled in [[Hollywood|West Hollywood]] which he "hated [...] so much" partly due to the slump in comedy acts at the time.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; Among his regular spots were the [[Hollywood Improv]] or [[The Comedy Store]], before he became based in [[Playa del Rey]] and worked in clubs outside the city center.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; Around this time, he landed a development deal and "flirted" with the idea of producing a sitcom by co-writing a pilot episode with a writer of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; He later described the script as a "piece of shit", and felt thankful it was never picked up.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; In 1995, Stanhope won the [[San Francisco International Comedy Competition]] against [[Dane Cook]] in a three-week contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sanfranciscocomedycompetition.com/articles/great-dane-took-a-bite-out-of-the-competition-in-1995 |title=Great Dane took a bite out of the Competition in 1995 |author=Globie |publisher=San Francisco Comedy Competition |date=2007-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221212650/http://sanfranciscocomedycompetition.com/articles/great-dane-took-a-bite-out-of-the-competition-in-1995 |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]], Stanhope received some criticism from audiences over his comments regarding the event. This included protests outside of his gigs and attacks on stage.&lt;ref name=independent2004/&gt;

In July 2002, Fox aired back-to-back episodes of Stanhope's hidden camera television show ''Invasion of the Hidden Cameras''.&lt;ref name=globe2002/&gt; The project began in 1999, with Stanhope writing and producing various pranks for it, before the network decided to withdraw its broadcast.&lt;ref name=globe2002&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7725579.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|title=Off the shelf at last|date=July 12, 2002|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanhope accused ''[[Spy TV]]'' of stealing half of his ideas and achieving good ratings as a result.&lt;ref name=globe2002/&gt; He starred as one of the pranksters on ''Spy TV''.

In August 2002, Stanhope won the Strathmore Press Award for his week-long run at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], as voted by 40 press critics. The prize was £1,000 and a feature in the British celebrity magazine ''[[OK!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanhope is critics' choice|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2002/08/22/1623/stanhope_is_critics_choice|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=August 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the run, Stanhope signed with his longtime manager [[Brian Hennigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13001455.html|title=Fringe stars opt for local management talent|newspaper=The Scotsman|first=Mike|last=Wade|date=26 November 2002|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004, Stanhope co-hosted the [[List of The Man Show episodes#Season 5|fifth]] and [[List of The Man Show episodes#Season 6|sixth]] seasons of ''[[The Man Show]]'' with [[Joe Rogan]]. He agreed to the project in order to become more financially stable.&lt;ref name=guardian2006/&gt; Among the show's segments included Stanhope lasting five rounds in a boxing match with [[Tonya Harding]], and his mother reviewing pornographic films.&lt;ref name=independent2004/&gt; He hosted his own radio show on [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvDvMDqSvIg|title=Doug Stanhope Live at Leeds pt 2/2|publisher=YouTube|date=2010-01-19|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Stanhope hosted ''[[Girls Gone Wild: America Uncovered]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xAO28e-jT8 Doug Stanhope Trashes 'Girls Gone Wild' Joe Francis!

Stanhope established a group of touring comics known as ''[[The Unbookables]]'' featuring such artists as [[Andy Andrist]], [[James Inman]], and [[Brendon Walsh]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379206|title=''Unbookables'' on IMDb|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unbookables' first CD, ''[[Morbid Obscenity]]''.

In 2005, Stanhope moved to [[Bisbee, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

He appeared in the film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', telling a caustic joke to a baby.

In June 2006, Stanhope was booked to perform several shows at the [[Cat Laughs|Cat Laughs Comedy Festival]] in [[Kilkenny]], Ireland. However, roughly ten minutes into his set, a joke about Irish men committing pedophilia because of the ugliness of Irish women for raping caused a hostile reaction from the audience. The incident led to the cancellation of Stanhope's remaining appearances at the festival.&lt;ref name=guardian2006&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/jul/31/comedy.edinburgh2006|title=If You're Offended, Then You're Not Listening|work=The Guardian|date=July 31, 2006|accessdate=September 5, 2006|location=London, UK|first=Brian|last=Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt; That August, he returned to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], agreeing to a full three-week residency.&lt;ref name=guardian2006/&gt; At one show, one of his routines sparked a violent affray with an angered audience member and the police were called in, causing Stanhope to leave the venue.&lt;ref name=statesman&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1147007911.html|title=The heir to Bill Hicks|date=2 October 2006|magazine=New Statesman|first=Brian|last=Logan|accessdate=18 July 2018|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained 5-star reviews from the press.

Stanhope announced his intention to seek election as the United States President in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]] on the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] ticket. He added: "It seemed like a funny thing to do [...] But people were either amused or horrified at the idea of me representing their party".&lt;ref name=guardian2011/&gt; His focus was for "[[Liberty|individual freedom]], [[Self-governance|self-government]] and making America fun again".&lt;ref name=guardian2006/&gt;

His live show was placed in the top 5 of the ''20 Best Live Shows of 2009'' by [[London]]'s ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brian Logan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/27/comedy-2009-best-live-shows|title=20 best comedy live shows for summer/autumn 2009|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 27, 2009|accessdate=2010-08-13|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, actress [[Amber Heard]] sued Stanhope for his "defamatory" claim that she was blackmailing her ex-husband Johnny Depp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amber Heard sues Doug Stanhope for defamation, alleges Johnny Depp ‘suffocated’ her once|author=Meera Jagannathan|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]| location= New York City|date=June 3, 2016|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/heard-sues-stanhope-defamation-claims-depp-suffocated-article-1.2660430|accessdate=June 3, 2016| archivedate=June 4, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604132454/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/heard-sues-stanhope-defamation-claims-depp-suffocated-article-1.2660430 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heard dropped the lawsuit in the aftermath of her and Depp's $7 million divorce settlement.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/02/you-re-all-f-cking-industry-tools-the-ballad-of-doug-stanhope-a-stand-up-scumbag|title='You're All F*cking Industry Tools': The Ballad of Doug Stanhope, a Stand-Up Scumbag|date=2 April 2017|first=Matt|last=Wilstein|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Stanhope released his third book, ''This is Not Fame''. It is a collection of stories about being an infamous comedian.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==Political activism==
Although his views have led people to believe that he is a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], he does not accept this characterization. Stanhope says that [[libertarianism]] was a phase he went through, but he now describes himself as an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/40464-interview-doug-stanhope-on-politics |title=Interview: Doug Stanhope on politics |last=Boyle |first=Niki |date=February 16, 2012 |publisher=List.co.uk |access-date=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |number=933561532109094912 |user=DougStanhope |title=Libertarian was a phase I went through. |author=Doug Stanhope |date=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, he endorsed the [[Free State Project]], a proposed political migration of at least 20,000 libertarians to a single low-population state, in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas. According to Stanhope this is an idea "that could produce tangible change in our lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freestateproject.org/about/endorsements#stanhope|title=Doug Stanhope's endorsement of the Free State Project|accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Stanhope originally supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2012|Ron Paul]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], but later endorsed [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Gary Johnson presidential campaign, 2012|Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougstanhope.com/journal/2012/9/12/presidents-apocalypse-and-death.html|title=Presidents, Apocalypse, and Death|work=DougStanhope.com|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2002, Stanhope and his girlfriend Renee Morrison staged a marriage ceremony in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. He later said that it was "mocking the institution of marriage", and that it was not legal.&lt;ref name=punchline2007&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042825/http://www.punchlinemagazine.com/index.php?page=185|url=http://www.punchlinemagazine.com/index.php?page=185|archivedate=28 September 2007|date=2007|title=Doug Stanhope: Out of Darkness Comes Comedy|work=Punchline Magazine|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, the two were expecting a child but opted for [[abortion]], and Stanhope got a [[vasectomy]].&lt;ref name=independent2004/&gt; Stanhope dated comedian and former attorney Betsy Wise for 18 months.&lt;ref name=independent2004/&gt; Around 2005 Stanhope met his current partner, Amy "Bingo" Bingaman who he has referred to as his girlfriend and wife.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2011/&gt; Stanhope is opposed to having children and cites [[overpopulation]] as a reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelaughbutton.com/features/burning-bridges-interview-doug-stanhope |title=Burning Bridges: An Interview with Doug Stanhope|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate= September 30, 2017|publisher=TheLaughButton.com|archivedate= September 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170930192351/http://thelaughbutton.com/features/burning-bridges-interview-doug-stanhope/|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DvaitaInfobox}}

'''Dvaita Vedanta''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|v|aɪ|t|ə|_|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|ə}}; {{lang-sa|द्वैत वेदान्त}}) is a sub-school in the [[Vedanta]] tradition of [[Hindu philosophy]]. Alternatively known as ''Bhedavāda'', ''Tattvavāda'' and ''Bimbapratibimbavāda'', Dvaita Vedanta sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar [[Madhvacharya]].&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p342"/&gt; The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that [[God]] (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls ([[jiva|jīvātman]]) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct. The Dvaita school contrasts with the other two major sub-schools of Vedanta, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of [[Adi Shankara]] which posits [[advaita|nondualism]] – that ultimate reality ([[Brahman]]) and human soul are identical and all reality is interconnected oneness, and [[Vishishtadvaita]] of [[Ramanuja]] which posits qualified nondualism – that ultimate reality ([[Brahman]]) and human soul are different but with the potential to be identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D. Fowler|title=Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlB4v85S1EC|year=2002|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-94-3|pages=238–243, 288–293, 340–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 1 &amp; 2, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 12-13, 213-214, 758-759&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dvaita''' (द्वैत) is a Sanskrit word that means "duality, dualism".&lt;ref name=mmwsat507&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0500/mw__0540.html Dvaita], A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 507&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to any premise, particularly in theology on the temporal and the divine, where two principles (truths) or realities are posited to exist simultaneously and independently.&lt;ref name=mmwsat507/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p342"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D. Fowler|title=Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlB4v85S1EC|year=2002|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-94-3|pages=340–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the [[Vedas]], espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the only independent reality (svatantra-tattva), states the Dvaita school, is that of [[Vishnu]] as Brahman.{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=340-344}} Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Myers (2000), Brahman: A Comparative Theology, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700712571}}, pages 124-127&lt;/ref&gt; The second reality is that of dependent (asvatantra-tattva) but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul, matter, and the like exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy, as opposed to monistic [[Advaita Vedanta]], is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.{{sfn|Etter|2006|pp=59-60}}

Like [[Ramanuja]], Madhvacharya also embraced [[Vaishnavism]]. Madhvacharya posits God as being [[personal god|personal]] and ''saguna'', that is endowed with attributes and qualities. To Madhvacharya, the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas was Vishnu. He stated "''brahmaśabdaśca Viṣṇaveva''", that Brahman can only refer to [[Vishnu]]. To him, Vishnu was not just any other [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]], but rather the one and only [[Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Edwin |last= Bryant| title=Krishna : A Sourcebook (Chapter 15 by Deepak Sarma)| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 2007| isbn= 978-0195148923| page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stokeriep&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhva (1238-1317) |first= Valerie| last= Stoker| publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011 |accessdate=29 February 2016| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/madhva/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta acknowledges two principles; however, it holds one of them (the sentient) as being eternally dependent on the other. The individual souls are depicted as reflections, images or shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha]] (liberation) therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=340-344}}

Five fundamental, eternal and real differences are described in Dvaita school:{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=340-344}}&lt;ref name=stokeriep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), Madhva, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 396&lt;/ref&gt;
# Between the individual souls (or jīvātman) and God ([[Ishvara|Brahmātmeśvara]] or Vishnu).
# Between matter (inanimate, insentient) and God.
# Between individual souls (jīvātman)
# Between matter and jīvatman.
# Between various types of matter.

These five differences are said to explain the nature of the universe. The world is called ''prapañca'' (''pañca'' "five") by the Dvaita school for this reason.

Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of [[eternal damnation]]. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, ''[[mukti-yogyas]]'', qualifies for liberation, another, the ''[[nitya-samsarins]]'', subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, ''[[tamo-yogyas]]'', who are condemned to eternal [[hell]] (''andhatamasa'').&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami. ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths.

== Influence ==
* Dvaita Vedanta and [[Madhvacharya]]'s historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer, has been salutary, but not extensive.&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Sharma, the influence of Dvaita Vedanta ideas have been most prominent on the Chaitanya school of [[Bengal]] Vaishnavism,{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=22-23}} and in [[Assam]].{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=xxxii-xxxiii, 514-516}}
* Madhva's theology influenced later scholars such as [[Nimbarka]], [[Vallabha Acharya]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. B.N.K. Sharma notes that Nimbarka's theology is a loose ''réchauffé'' of Madhva's in its most essential aspects.
* Dvaita Vedanta's discussion of the eternal differences and the gradation between the concept of God, human beings and the observed nature led some early colonial-era Indologists such as [[George Abraham Grierson]] to suggest that its founder, the 13th-century Madhva was influenced by [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt; but later scholars rejected this theory.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}}

'''Eileen Egan''' (1912–2000) was a journalist, Roman Catholic activist, and co-founder of the Catholic peace group, American PAX Association and its successor Pax Christi-USA, the American branch of International Pax Christi. Starting 1943 she remained an active member of [[Catholic Relief Services]], and a longtime friend of [[Mother Teresa]], she wrote her biography ''Such A Vision: Mother Teresa, the Spirit, and the Work'', and marched with [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] at Selma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FRIEND WATCHED MISSION GROW|author= Jim Dwyer|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/09/07/1997-09-07_friend_watched_mission_grow.html |publisher=[[New York Daily News]] |date= September 7, 1997}}{{dead link|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first coined the term "[[seamless garment]]" to describe the unity of Catholic teaching on life issues.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Wales]], she moved with her family to [[New York City]] in 1926, and completed her secondary education at [[Cathedral High School (New York City)|Cathedral High School]]. Later she graduated from [[Hunter College]] in 1933,&lt;ref name=crs/&gt; and began a career as a freelance journalist.

==Career==
In 1943 she joined the staff of the U.S. Bishops' War Relief Services (later known as [[Catholic Relief Services]], or CRS) as its first professional layperson.&lt;ref name=crs/&gt; Her first assignment was in [[Mexico]], where she worked with displaced [[Poles|Polish]] war refugees.  The following year she was posted to [[Barcelona]], where she ministered to victims of the [[Holocaust]].  She then headed the CRS office in [[Lisbon, Portugal]].

Back in New York briefly in 1945, she was out of the office the July day a [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] crashed into the CRS headquarters on the seventy-ninth floor of the [[Empire State Building]]. Ten fellow staff members were killed. The following year, Egan was back in Europe helping to resettle waves of displaced persons. Writer Mike Aquilina observed that "...these works of mercy might involve carefully planned news leaks, sifting through propaganda or misinformation campaigns, or even ... using Chicago’s Polish vote to protect Polish refugees."&lt;ref name=Aquilina&gt;[http://www.newoxfordreview.org/briefly.jsp?did=0596-briefly Aquilina, Mike. "Review - 'For Whom There Is No Room: Scenes from the Refugee World' ", ''New Oxford Review'', May 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; She later received the highest honor awarded civilians by both the [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] governments.

In the course of her work, Egan visited [[Palestinian refugees]] in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] exiles in [[Hong Kong]], and displaced civilians in [[Pakistan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]].  In 1955 she met [[Mother Teresa]] in [[Calcutta]].  She was Mother Teresa's official biographer and helped introduce the latter's work in the West.&lt;ref name=Malone/&gt;

Egan combined CRS's practical work of providing economic assistance, food, housing, and transportation to war victims with speaking, writing and demonstrating against the causes of [[war]].  In 1962 she co-founded the American Pax Society, which under her leadership evolved into [[Pax Christi]] USA in 1972.

She marched with [[Martin Luther King]], Jr. at [[Selma, Alabama]], had a major, behind-the-scenes hand in framing the "peace" statements of [[Vatican II]], and promoted the work of Jean and [[Hildegard Goss-Mayr]], crucial to the peaceful ouster of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] of the [[Philippines]].  One of her major achievements was the 1987 recognition of [[conscientious objection]] as a universal human right by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (resolution 1987/46). She traveled widely with Dorothy Day, introducing her to Mother Teresa in 1970, and was with Day picketing for farm workers in [[California]] in 1973 when Day was arrested for the final time.

Eileen Egan was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award|Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award]] in 1989. It was named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. ''[[Pacem in terris]]'' is [[Latin]] for 'Peace on Earth'.

Egan did not consider herself a pacifist.&lt;ref name=Somerville/&gt; She did not care for the term "[[pacifist]]" because of its misleading echo in the word "passivity".  She said that she used the term "gospel nonviolence, or "gospel peacemaking" instead.  She argued that the so-called [[just war]] concept was an alien graft on the [[gospel]] of [[Jesus]].

In 1992 at age 80, Egan was mugged on the way to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and had to go to a New York hospital with a broken hip and several fractured ribs.&lt;ref name=Somerville&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-05-04/features/1995124173_1_eileen-egan-mother-teresa-retribution Somerville, Frank P. L., "Wars, mugging haven't kept Eileen Egan from a life of 'Gospel non-violence'", ''The Baltimore Sun'', May 4, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her response to her attacker was one of care and forgiveness.

She died on October 7, 2000, aged 88.&lt;ref name=Malone&gt;[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2000d/102000/102000h.htm Malone, Antonia S., "Eileen Egan, pacifist, helped start Pax Christi", ''National Catholic Reporter'', October 20, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Egan was named to the Hunter Alumni Hall of Fame in 1983. Catholic Relief Services created the "Eileen Egan Journalism Award" in May 1995 in honor of Eileen Egan. The Egan Journalism Fellowship was created by Catholic Relief Services to recognize journalists who demonstrate excellence in their reporting for Catholic media and to encourage them to increase their coverage of poverty and development issues overseas.&lt;ref name=crs&gt;[http://www.crs.org/newsroom/egan-fellowship/eileen-egan.cfm "About Eileen Egan", Catholic Relief Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124141506/http://www.crs.org/newsroom/egan-fellowship/eileen-egan.cfm |date=2014-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Pax Christi USA established the Eileen Egan Peacemaker Award to recognize a group or individual who has made a strong and extraordinary prophetic witness for peace in a time or situation of devastating violence or injustice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncnwr.org/news/news-item.php?ID=127 "Women Religious honored with the Eileen Egan Peacemaker Award", Communicators for Women Religious, June 28, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720203022/http://www.ncnwr.org/news/news-item.php?ID=127 |date=July 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Bagawat''', is an ancient Christian cemetery, one of the oldest in the world, which functioned at the [[Kharga Oasis]] in southern-central [[Egypt]] from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. It is one of the earliest and best preserved Christian cemeteries from the ancient world.

==Location==
The Necropolis of El Bagawat is located in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] in Kharga Oasis. This is one of the largest oases in Egypt and is 34 m below sea level.{{sfn|Stoppato|2003|p=135}}

==History==
The El Bagawat cemetery is reported to be pre-historic&lt;ref name=Necro/&gt; and is one of the oldest Christian cemeteries in Egypt.{{sfn|Richardson|2003|p=544}}&lt;ref name=Necro/&gt; Before Christianity was introduced into Egypt, it was a burial ground used by the non-Christians and later years by the Christians. The chapels here are said to belong to both the eras.{{sfn|Meinardus|1977|p=483}} Coptic frescoes of the 3rd to the 7th century are found on the walls.{{sfn|Gianfagna|2013|p=25}} There are 263 funerary chapels of which the Chapel of Exodus (5th or 6th century) and Chapel of Peace (of mid 4th century) have frescoes.{{sfn|Wire|Chaney|2004|p=234}}

==Features==
The El Bagawat cemetery has a very large number of tombs in the form of chapel domes.&lt;ref name=Necro/&gt;{{sfn|Ham|2010|p=176}} They are built of mud bricks. The tombs have etchings of biblical stories,&lt;ref name=Necro&gt;{{cite book|title=Egitto. 7000 Anni Di Storia. Ediz. Inglese|url=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Eva Margareta Frölich''' (c. 1650 – September 1692 in [[Stockholm]]), was a Swedish [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[prophet]], [[visionary]] and [[Pietistic]] writer.

==Biography==
Frölich was born the daughter of colonel Hans Christoffer Frölich and Elisabet von Plessen. The location and exact date is unknown. Her brother, Karl Gustaf Frölich, was an ennobled count; she became the aunt of [[Charlotta Frölich]]. 

She was married in [[Riga]] in [[Latvia]], then a Swedish province, to Johann Henning Neumeijer, colonel in the Swedish army, whom she abandoned in 1684, when she arrived in [[Stockholm]] in Sweden in the company of the goldsmith Berendt Doerchmann and made herself known as a prophet and a preacher. She was received by King [[Charles XII of Sweden]], where she predicted that he was to be the founder of the thousand-year kingdom of Christ and rule over all of Christianity. The same year, she was sentenced to exile and traveled to [[Hamburg]], where she published her work about [[millennialism]] and the seven congregations in the Bible, which caused her banishment from the city. She then settled in [[Amsterdam]], where she published many of her works and continued to be active as a prophet and a preacher, still assisted by Berendt Doerchmann.

One of her opinions was that women should be allowed to preach.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Westman Berg, "Sophia Elisabeth Brenner", ''Författarnas litteraturhistoria'', red. L.Ardelius och G.Rydström, Författarförlaget 1984, s.66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return==
She returned to Stockholm in 1692, where she held speeches against the priests "almost worse than before" and tried to publish her work.  She was arrested and put in jail, where she died the same year. 

Her theology has been described as a mix between [[spiritualism]], [[pietism]], orthodoxy and the punishment ideology from the Old Testament. She was a Lutheran, but attacked the literary version of the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Hagen, artikel i ''Svenska män och kvinnor'', del 2, Albert Bonniers förlag 1944, s.637&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ex-Muslims of North America''' ('''EXMNA''') is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] registered non-profit organization which describes itself as advocating for acceptance of religious dissent, promoting secular values, and aiming to reduce discrimination faced by those who leave Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Muslims of North America Granted 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Status|url=https://www.exmna.org/ex-muslims-of-north-america-granted-501c3-nonprofit-status/|publisher=Ex-Muslims of North America|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EXMNAtourlaunch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Muslims of North America launch campus tour|url=https://www.exmna.org/ex-muslims-of-north-america-launch-campus-tour/|publisher=Ex-Muslims of North America|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was founded in 2013 in [[Washington, DC]], by [[Sarah Haider]] and [[Muhammad Syed]] and in [[Toronto]] by Sadar Ali and Nas Ishmael. They say that it is the first organization of its kind to "establish communities exclusive to ex-muslims in order to foster a sense of camaraderie and offer a space free of judgement for lack of religiosity."&lt;ref name="New York Times Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/us/leaving-islam-for-atheism-and-finding-a-much-needed-place-among-peers.html?_r=1|title=Leaving Islam for Atheism, and Finding a Much-Needed Place Among Peers|author=|date=May 23, 2014|work=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EXMNAAbout&gt;{{cite news|title=About Us|url=https://www.exmna.org/about-us/|publisher=EXMNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NRJoshi/&gt;

==Organization==
Its stated mission is to reduce discrimination faced by those who leave Islam, advocate for acceptance of religious dissent, and promote secular values; counter the isolation facing [[non-theist]] ex-Muslims by fostering communities and support networks; and strive to amplify diverse ex-Muslim voices and experiences, and stand against those who seek to stifle criticism of Islam.&lt;ref name=EXMNAAbout/&gt;

The organization has chapters in 25 cities across North America, a [[BBC]] article says that the organization has about 1,000 volunteers in 25 cities in North America and an article in the ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'' says that the group has about 24,000 total members.&lt;ref name="BBC Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EXMNAAbout/&gt;&lt;ref name=D&amp;C&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clausen|first1=Todd|title=Clausen: Wegmans says Ex-Muslims group can buy cake|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/columnist/clausen/2016/06/23/todd-clausen-wegmans-says-let-ex-muslims-of-north-america-eat-our-cake/86281670/|work=Democrat and Chronicle|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is run by staff,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exmna.org/staff]&lt;/ref&gt; volunteers and relies on donations.&lt;ref name="BBC Owen"/&gt;

EXMNA provides emergency support and grants to ex-Muslims in dire times – from escaping abuse to finding shelter and professional assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.exmna.org/emergency-grants/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Mahad Olad, a US college student was taken to Kenya and held against his will. He was to undergo [[conversion therapy]] to cure his apostasy and homosexuality. He was rescued through EXMNA's efforts and provided a grant to pay for his flight back to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Amos |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43066082 |title=Ex-Muslims: The American who fled 'gay conversion' in Africa |publisher=BBC News |date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://theithacan.org/opinion/escaping-gay-conversion-therapy-in-kenya/ "Escaping gay conversion therapy in Kenya"]&lt;/ref&gt;

EXMNA publishes ''The Ex-Muslim'' which the organization says is the world's first and only online magazine and blogroll that offers a "nuanced insight on Islam from former Muslims."&lt;ref name=EXMNAAbout/&gt;

EXMNA spearheaded a campaign which successfully pressured [[Twitter]] to reverse its decision to submit to a request by the [[Pakistan Telecommunication Authority]] to block content and accounts which the agency deemed blasphemous in what a report by ''[[The New York Times]]'' said was the first time that the social networking service had agreed to withhold content in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 campaign groups ask Pakistan to stop its censorship of 'blasphemous' Twitter content|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2014/06/10/14-campaign-groups-ask-pakistan-stop-censorship-blasphemous-twitter-content/|publisher=Humanists UK|date=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeseretKellner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellner|first1=Mark A.|title=Secularists band together to fight Pakistan's #TwitterTheocracy blockings|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865604853/Secularists-band-together-to-fight-Pakistans-TwitterTheocracy-blockings.html|work=Deseret News|date=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellner|first1=Mark A.|title=Twitter relents, won't allow Pakistan government to block controversial messages|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865605377/Twitter-relents-wont-allow-Pakistan-government-to-block-controversial-messages.html|work=Deseret News|date=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EXMNA went on a 2017–2018 campus tour across North America in what the organization said was a first-of-its kind effort to bring Muslim apostates and other activists to colleges across the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="EXMNAtourlaunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Owen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Amos |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42090104 |title=They left Islam and now tour the US to talk about it |publisher=BBC News |date=December 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled "Normalizing Dissent Tour", they covered in collaboration with student groups a variety of questions and challenges that Islam had brought to the Western world through panels, talks and discussions.&lt;ref name="EXMNAtourlaunch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABOUT THE EX-MUSLIM TOUR|url=https://exmuslimtour.com/about/ |publisher=EXMNA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour's featured speakers included [[Simon Cottee]], [[Maryam Namazie]], [[Afzal Upal]], and [[Ibn Warraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OUR AMAZING SPEAKERS|url=https://exmuslimtour.com/speakers/|publisher=EXMNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Haider said in a 2015 address to the [[American Humanist Association]] that "''I always expected feeling unwelcome from Muslim audiences, but I did not anticipate an equal amount of hostility from my allies on the left.''" Her critics have accused her of being pro-war, on the [[far-right politics|far right]], an [[Uncle Tom]], a House Arab, and a native informant. Yet she maintains she is a progressive liberal and the organization EXMNA has no certain political affiliation.&lt;ref name=NRJoshi/&gt;

In 2016 a [[Wegmans]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], refused to make a cake for the organization that was to be used in celebration of the third anniversary of the group's founding after a supervisor deemed the name of the group offensive; the company subsequently filled the cake order free of charge and issued an apology to EXMNA after legal intervention by a staff attorney from the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] who described the decision by the employee to refuse service as "a potential civil rights violation."&lt;ref name=D&amp;C/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gryboski|first1=Michael|title=Wegmans Apologizes for Refusing to Bake Cake for Ex-Muslims|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/wegmans-apologizes-refusing-bake-cake-for-ex-muslims-north-america-165484/|work=Christian Post|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 [[Facebook]] locked out EXMNA's account for a week because it had allegedly violated the company's terms of service although it did not specify which standards the account had allegedly violated.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonazzo|first1=John|title=Facebook Blocks Posts From Atheist, Ex-Muslim Pages|url=http://observer.com/2017/05/facebook-atheist-ex-muslim-blocked/|work=Observer|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The page was subsequently unblocked, with a Facebook spokesperson saying in an email to the ''[[New York Observer|Observer]]'' that "the pages were removed in error and restored as soon as we were able to investigate."&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Bahrain]] states that [[Islam]] is the official religion and that ''[[Shari'a]]'' (Islamic law) is a principal source for legislation. ''Article 22'' of the [[Constitution of Bahrain|Constitution]] provides for freedom of conscience, the inviolability of worship, and the freedom to perform religious rites and hold religious parades and meetings, in accordance with the customs observed in the country; however, the [[Government of Bahrain|Government]] placed some limitations on the exercise of this right.

== Religious demography ==
{{main|Demographics of Bahrain#Religions}}

The citizen population in 2010 was 99.8% [[Muslim]], although the Muslim proportion falls to 70.2% when the non-national population is included.&lt;ref name="2010-census"&gt;{{cite web|title=General Tables|url=http://www.census2010.gov.bh/results_en.php|publisher=Bahraini Census 2010|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current census data doesn't differentiate between the other religions in [[Bahrain]], but there are about 1,000{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} [[Christian]] citizens and fewer than 40&lt;ref name="bahjew"&gt;{{cite web|title=Low profile but welcome: a Jewish outpost in the Gulf |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/low-profile-but-welcome-a-jewish-outpost-in-the-gulf-398656.html|work=Independent|date=2 Nov 2007|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish]] citizens. 

Muslims belong to the [[Shi'a]] and [[Sunni]] branches of [[Islam]]. There are no official figures, but the Shi'a constitute 66–70% of the Bahraini Muslim population.&lt;ref name="nyp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/why_bahrain_blew_up_NkYx4h4E1m80WGe2tXfsrI |title=Why Bahrain blew up |work=New York Post |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-15/bahrain-shiites-may-rally-after-funeral-for-second-person-killed-in-unrest.html |title=Bahrain Shiites May Rally After Funeral for Protester |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/bahrain-it-may-be-small-but-it-matters |title=Bahrain: it may be small, but it matters |publisher=Channel 4 News |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="low end"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK FCO |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/bahrain/|publisher=UK FCO|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, overwhelmingly from [[South Asia]] and other [[Arab countries]], constituted 54% of the population in 2010.&lt;ref name="2010-census" /&gt; Of these, 45% are Muslim and 55% are non-Muslim,&lt;ref name="2010-census" /&gt; including Christians (primarily: [[Catholic]], [[Protestant]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], and [[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church|Mar Thoma]] from [[South India]]), [[Hindu]]s, [[Bahá'í]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, and [[Sikh]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/168261.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report |publisher=US State Dept. |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status of religious freedom ==

=== Legal and policy framework ===
The [[Constitution of Bahrain|Constitution]] states that [[Islam]] is the official religion of the country and also provides for freedom of religion; however, there were limits on this right. The Government allows religion-based, political nongovernmental organizations to register as political "societies", which operate somewhat like parties with the legal authority to conduct political activities. Parliamentary and municipal elections were held in 2006 and all political societies participated, including the largest Shi'a political society, which had boycotted the last parliamentary elections in 2002. Of eligible voters, 73% participated in the elections. Every religious group must obtain a license from the ''Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs'' (''MOJIA'') to operate. In December 2006 the ''Ministry of Justice'' and ''Ministry of Islamic Affairs'' merged to form the ''MOJIA''. Depending on circumstances, for example, the opening of a religious school, a religious group may also need approval from the ''Ministry of Social Development'', the ''Ministry of Information'', and/or the ''Ministry of Education''. [[Christian]] congregations that are registered with the ''Ministry of Social Development'' operated freely and were allowed to offer their facilities to other Christian congregations that did not have their places of worship. The Government prohibits anti-Islamic writings. Four [[Sikh temples]] and several [[Hindu temples]] are allowed to function freely. The country's only synagogue has not been operational for nearly 60 years.

Holding a religious meeting without a permit is illegal; however, there were no reports of religious groups being denied a permit to gather. Unregistered Christian congregations exist, and there were no reports of the Government attempting to force unregistered congregations to register. The ''High Council for Islamic Affairs'' is charged with the review and approval of all clerical appointments within both the [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] communities and maintains program oversight for all citizens studying religion abroad. Historically there is evidence of discrimination against Shi'a Muslims in recruitment for the country's military and domestic security services. During the reporting period, the ''Ministry of Defense'' did not recruit Shi'a for military service. The ''Ministry of Interior'' made increasing efforts to recruit additional Shi'a into nonmilitary security agencies during the reporting period. On April 19, 2007, officials in the ''Ministry of Education'' announced that the Ministry, in conjunction with the MOJIA, was developing a new religious education curriculum to be taught in all public schools, beginning the next academic year. According to the ''Undersecretary of Islamic Affairs'', the new curriculum will focus on practices in [[Islam]] and jurisprudence and will contain content against radicalism and extremism. The ''Undersecretary for Islamic Affairs'' reportedly stressed to the ''Ministry of Education'' that the new curriculum should be inclusive of the convictions of all branches of [[Islam]]. Islamic studies are a part of the curriculum in government schools and mandatory for all public school students. The decades-old curriculum is based on the [[Maliki]] school of Sunni theology. Proposals to include the [[Ja'afari]] traditions of Shi'a Islam in the curriculum have been rejected. The civil and criminal legal systems consist of a complex mix of courts based on diverse legal sources, including Sunni and Shi'a [[Shari'a]], tribal law, and other civil codes and regulations. The number of Shi'a Shari'a judges was slightly higher than the number of their Sunni counterparts.

Although the [[Constitution of Bahrain|Constitution]] provides for women's political rights, Shari'a governs personal status. Specific rights vary according to Shi'a or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by the individual's faith, or by the courts in which various contracts originate, including marriage. While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious courts may refuse the request. Women of either branch of Islam may own and inherit property and may represent themselves in all public and legal matters. In the absence of a direct male heir, a Shi'a woman may inherit all property. In contrast, in the absence of a direct male heir, a Sunni woman inherits only a portion as governed by Shari'a; the balance is divided among brothers, uncles, and male cousins of the deceased. A Muslim woman may legally marry a non-Muslim man only if he first converts to Islam. In such marriages, the children automatically are considered Muslim. In divorce cases, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody of children until an age at which custody reverts to the father based on [[Ja'afari]] and [[Maliki]] Islamic law, respectively. In all circumstances except mental incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody decisions, retains the right to make certain legal decisions for his children, such as guardianship of any property belonging to the child, until the child reaches legal age. A noncitizen woman automatically loses custody of her children if she divorces their citizen father. There are no restrictions on the number of citizens permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]]. The Government monitors travel to [[Iran]] and scrutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue religious study there. The Government does not designate religion or sect on national identity documents. Upon the birth of a child, parents applying for a birth certificate are asked to provide the child's religion (not sect), but the government-issued birth certificate does not include this information. The law does not prohibit conversion from one religion to another. The following holidays are considered national holidays: [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]], the ''Birth of the [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'', [[Day of Ashura|Day of ''Ashura'']], and the [[Islamic New Year]]. Leaders representing many religious groups visited the country and met with government and civic leaders. These included the Metropolitan of the [[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church|Mar Thoma]] [[Church body|Church]] in [[India]], the highest official in the church.

=== Restrictions on religious freedom ===
Government policy and practice contribute to the generally free practice of religion. Members of other religious groups who practice their faith privately do so without interference from the Government and are permitted to maintain their own places of worship and display the symbols of their religion, such as crosses and statues of deities and saints. The Government funds all official religious institutions, including Shi'a and Sunni mosques, Shi'a ''ma`tams'' (religious community centers), Shi'a and Sunni ''waqfs'' (religious endowments), and the religious courts, which represent both the [[Ja'afari]] (Shi'a) and [[Maliki]] (Sunni) schools of Islamic jurisprudence. The Government permits public religious events, most notably the large annual commemorative marches by Shi'a Muslims during the Islamic months of Ramadan and Muharram. 

Converts to Islam from other religious groups were not uncommon, especially in cases of marriage between Muslim men and non-Muslim women. These converts were normally welcomed into the Muslim community. On the other hand, converts from Islam to other religious groups were not well tolerated by society. It was reported that families and communities often shunned these individuals and sometimes subjected converts to physical abuse. Some of these converts believed it necessary to leave the country permanently. 

During the [[2011–2012 Bahraini uprising|2011–2012 Arab Spring uprising]] and crackdown against Shia protest in Bahrain, "dozens" of Shia mosques have been leveled by the government according to a report in McClatchy newspapers. According to Shiite leaders interviewed by the reporter, work crews have often arrived "in the dead of night, accompanied by police and military escorts", to demolish the mosques, and in many cases, have hauled away the buildings' rubble before townspeople awake so as to leave no trace.  Sheikh Khalid bin Ali bin Abdulla al Khalifa, the minister of justice and Islamic affairs for Bahrain, defended the demolitions stating: "These are not mosques. These are illegal buildings." However the McClatchy reporter found that photos taken of several mosques before their destruction by the government "showed they were well maintained, decades-old structures."&lt;ref name="gutman"/&gt;  

The MOJIA has repeatedly denied a Bahá'í congregation a license to function, although the group has not sought official recognition in many years, and it refuses to recognize the congregation; but the Bahá'í community continued to gather and worship freely without government interference. While the MOJIA views the Bahá'í Faith as an inauthentic offshoot of Islam and blasphemous{{cn|date=May 2014}}, some other government ministries included Bahá'í as a religion choice in "drop-down" computer menus for citizens applying for certain government documents.

[[Bible]]s and other Christian publications are displayed and sold openly in local bookstores that also sold Islamic and other religious literature. [[Church (building)|Churches]] also sold [[Christian]] materials, including books, music, and messages from Christian leaders, openly and without restriction. Religious tracts of all branches of Islam, cassettes of sermons delivered by Muslim preachers from other countries, and publications of other religions were readily available. In recent years, the ''Ministry of Interior'' has made efforts to reform hiring practices and has increased the hiring of Shi'a citizens. In 2005 a Christian church with more than 1,000 members filed an application with the ''Ministry of Social Development'' to form a second parish. The diocese assigned a temporary priest to serve members of the second parish; however, he only stayed 4 months, due to [[Visa (document)|visa]] restrictions. The new parish applied for a three-year resident visa for a permanent priest. By the close of the reporting period, government officials still had not notified church leaders of a final decision on the request to allow a second parish or to grant a resident visa for a permanent priest. Further requests by church officials for information went unanswered. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

In February 2011, the tensions between the Sunni ruling minority and the Shi'a majority spilled over into street protests which was violently suppressed by police forces, resulting in multiple civilian deaths.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/world/middleeast/19bahrain.html?_r=1|title=Security Forces in Bahrain Open Fire on Protesters|date=2011-02-18|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McClatchy Newspapers/csmonitor.com reported that as of mid-May 2011, &lt;blockquote&gt;Authorities have held secret trials where protesters have been sentenced to death, arrested prominent mainstream opposition politicians, jailed nurses and doctors who treated injured protesters, seized the health care system that had been run primarily by Shiites, fired 1,000 Shiite professionals and canceled their pensions, detained students and teachers who took part in the protests, beat and arrested journalists, and forced the closure of the only opposition newspaper.&lt;ref name="gutman"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0511/Bahrain-s-Sunni-rulers-target-Shiite-mosques Bahrain's Sunni rulers target Shiite mosques], By Roy Gutman, McClatchy Newspapers, May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

Unnamed U.S. officials interviewed by McClatchy expressed concern over "vindictive" Sunni leadership in Bahrain and stated that the [[Obama administration]] was "deeply worried about Bahrain's rapid downward spiral."&lt;ref name="gutman"/&gt;

=== Forced religious conversion ===
Bahrain has no history of engaging in [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]]. Foreign nationals as well as local minorities are able to practice their religion without interference from the government or other religious groups.

=== Status of Jewish community ===
Even though the small Jewish community has been safe from attacks and vandalism. While some anti-Zionist political commentary and editorial cartoons appeared, usually linked to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], outside of a political context the Jewish minority is fully respected and allowed to operate freely. Jewish people in Bahrain regularly practice their faith privately without interference from the Government. In 2008 Bahrain named [[Houda Nonoo|Houda Ezra Ebrahim Nonoo]], a Jewish female lawmaker, ambassador to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inplacenews.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/muslim-country-selects-jewish-ambassador |title=Muslim Country Selects Jewish Ambassador « iNPLACENEWS |publisher=Inplacenews.wordpress.com |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improvements and positive developments in respect for religious freedom ===
Parliamentary and municipal elections were conducted in November and December 2006. Candidates associated with religion-based political societies won 32 of the 40 seats in the Council of Representatives. During the elections, candidates from religious political groups conducted their campaigns without any interference from the Government. There was one [[Jew]]ish member and one [[Christian]] member of the 40-member upper house of Parliament, the Shura Council, whose members were appointed in December 2006 by the King, following elections for the lower house. The Christian member was chosen by her colleagues to be the second deputy speaker for the Shura Council and is also one of the country's four representatives to the Arab Parliament. There was one Christian municipal council candidate in the elections, but he was defeated. In April 2007 the ''Bahrain Businesswomen Society'' initiated a public awareness campaign on family law by sponsoring a panel discussion, the first public event on the topic for several months. The issue was not raised in any significant way during the November/December 2006 elections, despite an awareness campaign by the Supreme Council for Women in the fall of 2005 and seminars by civil society groups, which highlighted the need for a family law. This was followed by public debate and rallies both in favor of and against such a law. During the reporting period, members of the [[Awali Community Church]] visited Christian prison inmates approximately monthly, to provide clothing and Christian literature and messages from their home. Members of other churches also made periodic visits to Christian prison inmates.

'''George Fielden MacLeod, Baron MacLeod of Fuinary''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|MC|size=100%|sep=,}} (17 June 1895 &amp;ndash; 27 June 1991) was a Scottish soldier and clergyman; he was one of the best known, most influential and unconventional [[Church of Scotland]] ministers of the 20th century. He was the founder of the [[Iona Community]] at the island of Iona.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Glasgow]] in 1895. His father (Sir [[Sir John MacLeod, 1st Baronet|John MacLeod]]) was a successful businessman before entering politics as a [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] MP; his mother Edith was from a wealthy [[Lancashire|Lancastrian]] family (owning cotton mills). From this background and heir to a baronetcy, George MacLeod was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millar|first1=Barbara|title=The war hero who fell  to his knees and  surrendered to Christ|url=http://www.scottishreview.net/Backpage135.shtml|publisher=Scottish Review|accessdate=17 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123151549/http://www.scottishreview.net/Backpage135.shtml|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was the highly respected Revd [[Norman Macleod (1812–1872)|Norman MacLeod]] of the [[Barony Church]], [[Glasgow]], a [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and Chaplain to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

==World War I service==
Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914,  MacLeod joined the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], rising to the rank of [[Captain (land)|Captain]]. He first saw active service in Greece. After falling ill with [[dysentery]], he was sent back to Scotland to recuperate, after which he was posted to [[Flanders]]. He saw action at [[Ypres]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) and the French [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for bravery.

==Ministry==
His experience of this total war profoundly affected MacLeod, leading him to train for the ministry. He studied divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]], followed by a year at [[Union Theological Seminary (Manhattan)|Union Theological Seminary]], New York City (1921-1922). Upon return to Scotland he was invited to become Assistant at [[St Giles' Cathedral]]. During this period he became increasingly concerned over the issue of social inequality in Scotland. In 1924 he was ordained as a [[Church of Scotland]] minister, to be Padre of [[Toc H]] (Talbot House) in Scotland. Such non-parochial appointments were extremely unusual at the time. Following a disagreement, he resigned from Toc H in 1926, but was invited to become associate minister at [[St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh]].

His wartime experiences, combined with a profound disillusionment by post-World War I political rhetoric of "a land fit for heroes," deeply affected him. Confronted by the realities of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|depression]] and unemployment faced by those less privileged than he, MacLeod gradually moved towards supporting [[socialism]] and [[pacifism]]. From 1937 he became actively involved with the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU), and from 1958 with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND).

Meanwhile, in 1930, to considerable surprise, he decided to leave St Cuthbert's Church to become minister at [[Govan Old Parish Church]]&amp;mdash;encountering the considerable social problems caused by poverty in this part of Glasgow. The pace of work took its toll and in 1932 he suffered a [[mental breakdown|breakdown]]. He spent some time recuperating in [[Jerusalem]] in early 1933. While worshipping in an [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on [[Easter Day]] he felt a profound spiritual experience, feeling a sense of recovery of the Church as the corporate [[Body of Christ]]. This would strongly influence the rest of his life.

He resigned (giving up the financial security of a [[parish]] minister's [[stipend]]) to become the full-time leader of the [[Iona Community]], which he founded in 1938. The idea of rebuilding [[Iona Abbey]] using ministers, students and unemployed labourers working together influenced his thinking; the Iona Community developed as an international [[ecumenical]] community, with offices in [[Govan]] and a presence on the Isle of [[Iona]]. Underpinning the fellowship of the Community were four emphases: mission, political involvement, a ministry of healing, and worship, by which MacLeod and the Community sought a way to connect the Church with an industrial age. He led a series of parish missions (sometimes known as a 'Message of Friendship') in Scottish parishes associated with the Community, and supported the 1950 Glasgow Churches' Campaign and the 1950s [[Tell Scotland Movement]]. However, he opposed the invitation promoted by Rev. [[Tom Allan (minister)|Tom Allan]] to Dr [[Billy Graham]] that led to the 1955 All-Scotland Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Highet|first1=John|title=The Scottish Churches: a review of their state 400 years after the Reformation|date=1960|publisher=Skeffington &amp; Son|location=London|pages=127–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
During World War II, he served as [[locum]] minister at [[Canongate Kirk]] in Edinburgh&amp;mdash;a parish also then afflicted by poverty.

In 1948 (aged 53) he married Lorna; immediately after the wedding they travelled to Australia for a preaching tour. The 1940s and early 1950s were a difficult period professionally. MacLeod was involved in what became known as the "Govan Case." He was invited by the congregation to return to [[Govan Old Parish Church]] in 1948, but the Presbytery of Glasgow refused to approve his appointment, given his wish to continue his active leadership of the Iona Community. The case was referred to the General Assembly; ultimately he was refused permission to combine the two posts.

Despite a feeling of hurt and rejection over the "Govan Case", MacLeod remained one of the highest-profile figures in the [[Church of Scotland]]. In 1957 he was elected [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], following one Commissioner standing up and asking whether it was appropriate that a man who had been described as being "half way to Rome and half way to Moscow" should be Moderator.

In 1967 MacLeod was awarded a [[peerage]], becoming '''Baron MacLeod of Fuinary''', of [[Fuinary]] in [[Morven, Argyll|Morven]] in the [[County of Argyll]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=44243 |date=7 February 1967 |page=1429}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; the only Church of Scotland minister to have been thus honoured. He later became the first peer to represent the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Derek Wall (1994-03) ''Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the UK Green Party'' (published March 1994 to mark the 21st anniversary of the Party) {{ISBN|1-873557-08-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

George MacLeod's influence on the [[Church of Scotland]] was considerable. His initial emphasis on parish mission was generally welcomed and favourably compared to the campaigns of his contemporary, [[D.P. Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardgett|first1=Frank|title=Scotland's Evangelist: D.P. Thomson|date=2010|publisher=The Handsel Press|location=Haddington|isbn=978-1-871828-71-9|pages=170–172, 199–200, 213–214, 302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dismissed by some as a maverick, he helped to raise awareness of [[pacificism]], [[ecumenism]] and [[social justice]] issues, and inspired many to become involved with such questions. Through the creation of the [[Iona Community]], he was a pioneer of new forms of ministry (outside more conventional parish or [[chaplain]]cy structures).

"'''Get Born Again'''" is a song by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Alice in Chains]] and, along with "[[Died (Alice in Chains song)|Died]]", one of the last two songs recorded with vocalist [[Layne Staley]] before his death in 2002. The song was released as the lead single from the compilation ''[[Nothing Safe: Best of the Box]]'' (1999) on June 1, 1999.&lt;ref name="release"/&gt; It peaked at No. 4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, and at No. 12 on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. "Get Born Again" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="grammy"/&gt; The song was also included on the compilation albums ''[[Music Bank (album)|Music Bank]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Essential Alice in Chains]]'' (2006).

==Origin and recording==
The music was written by guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]] for what would eventually become his second solo album, ''[[Degradation Trip]]''.&lt;ref name=PopMatters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/cantrell-jerry-021226/ |title=Degradation Trip: An interview with Jerry Cantrell |work=PopMatters |date=26 December 2002|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after he showed the song to Alice in Chains vocalist [[Layne Staley]], Staley decided to write lyrics to the song, and it was eventually recorded with Alice in Chains in 1998.&lt;ref name=PopMatters/&gt; 

In interview with radio program [[Rockline]] in 1999, Staley stated that the song is based around "religious hypocrisy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8w-r7ApfW0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15m19s |title=Alice in Chains - "Nothing Safe" Rockline Interview, Jul 19. 1999 |accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[liner notes]] of 1999's ''[[Music Bank (album)|Music Bank]]'' box set collection, Jerry Cantrell said of the song:	
{{cquote|We tried to work with [[Dave Jerden]] again and that didn't work out for various uncomfortable reasons. We had tracked with him in L.A., and then we went up to Seattle with [[Toby Wright]]. So considering it was done in different states with different producers, I think it turned out to be pretty classic Alice.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, ''[[Music Bank (album)|Music Bank]]'' box set. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also of note was Staley's condition while recording the song which was made known by ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]'' producer Dave Jerden—who was originally chosen by the band for the production—who said "Staley weighed eighty pounds...and was white as a ghost." Cantrell refused to comment on the singer's appearance, simply replying "I'd rather not comment on that…", and band manager Susan Silver said she hadn't seen the singer since "last year".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Blair R. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/malice-in-chains-19980904 "Malice in Chains?"]. ''rollingstone.com''. September 4, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
"Get Born Again" was released to radio stations on June 1, 1999.&lt;ref name="release"/&gt; The single peaked at number four on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/alice-in-chains/chart-history/hot-mainstream-rock-tracks/song/64127 |title=Alice in Chains "Get Born Again" Chart History – Mainstream Rock |date=July 17, 1999 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at number 12 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/alice-in-chains/chart-history/alternative-songs/song/64127 |title=Alice in Chains "Get Born Again" Chart History – Alternative Songs |date=June 26, 1999 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="grammy"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/grammys.htm |title=42nd Grammy Awards - 2000 |publisher=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 	

The song is sometimes credited with being one of the band's most bleak singles. James Hunter of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the song as "a drone lifted by ominous chorales, hardened by slashing guitars and set off with Layne Staley intoning, 'Just repeat a couple lies.'"&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Hunter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aliceinchains/albums/album/175774/review/6210919/nothing_safe_the_best_of_the_box |title=Nothing Safe: Best of the Box |accessdate=2008-10-05 |work=Album Reviews |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1999-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Get Born Again" was released in 1999 and was directed by [[Paul Fedor (director)|Paul Fedor]]. The video shows a disfigured insane scientist trying to duplicate his own version of the band. Footage of Staley, Cantrell, and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] was pulled from the "[[Sea of Sorrow]]" video and bassist [[Mike Inez]] from the "[[What the Hell Have I]]" video. The video is available on the home video release 
''[[Music Bank: The Videos]]''.

'''Herbert Lockyer''' (1886–1984) was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] and best-selling [[author]] of over 50 books, including the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herbert_Lockyer_All_Series.jpg 21-volume "All" series].&lt;ref name="meet"&gt;Meet Herbert Lockyer, http://www.christianbook.com/html/authors/3221.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[International Christian College|Glasgow Bible Institute]], afterwards receiving honorary degrees at Northwestern Evangelical Seminary, and the International Academy in [[London]].&lt;ref name="meet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitaker"&gt;Herbert Lockyer - Author Info. Whitaker House Website. http://www.whitakerhouse.com/DeskTop.aspx?page=AuthorInfo&amp;author=399. Accessed on October 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He was most influential, however, after crossing the Atlantic to preach and write in the [[United States]].

Dr. Lockyer was invited to preach at the 50th anniversary of the opening of the [[Moody Bible Institute]], and this began his ministry in the United States.&lt;ref name="whitaker"/&gt; In the 1930s, the Institute published a number of his sermons, and Zondervan soon began to do the same. Dr. Lockyer also became influential in the Keswick [[Higher Life movement]], ministering and publishing on both sides of the Atlantic. In his later life, his ministry was entirely focused on publishing, and his son, Herbert Lockyer, Jr., became his editor.&lt;ref name="meet"/&gt;

[[Billy Graham]] wrote, "Dr. Lockyer was unquestionably one of the spiritual giants of our century, and his prolific writings will continue to make an impact on countless Christians for generations to come if our Lord tarries."&lt;ref name="meet"/&gt;

Lockyer wrote the Introduction to the [[Zondervan]] reprint edition of [[Charles Ellicott|''Ellicott's'']] ''Commentary on the Whole Bible'',  (1959 and 1981) which he begins by saying, "As I journey back through almost half a century of Christian witness, of the many books that helped to shape my ministry, none has been so eagerly consulted as the volumes comprising Ellicott's ''Bible Commentary for English Readers'', now known as 'Ellicott's Commentary on the Whole Bible.' This valuable eight-volume set is conspicuous among Commentaries for its adherence to the divine inspiration of Holy Scripture; it's conservative approach to foundational truths; its comprehensive treatment of books, chapters and verses."&lt;ref&gt;Ellicott, Charles John, ed. ''Ellicott's Commentary on the Whole Bible'', vol. I, Reprint ed. Zondervan, 1959. p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
The '''Imperial cult of ancient Rome''' identified [[Roman emperor|emperors]] and some members of their families with the [[Divine right of kings|divinely sanctioned]] authority (''[[auctoritas]]'') of the [[Roman State]]. Its framework was based on Roman and Greek precedents, and was formulated during the early [[Principate]] of [[Augustus]]. It was rapidly established throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] and its [[Roman province|provinces]], with marked local variations in its reception and expression.
[[File:MaisonCarrée.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Maison Carrée]] in [[Nîmes]], one of the best-preserved [[Roman temple]]s.  It is a mid-sized [[Augustus|Augustan]] provincial temple of the Imperial cult.]]
Augustus's reforms transformed Rome's [[Roman Republic|Republican]] system of government to a ''de facto'' monarchy, couched in [[mos maiorum|traditional Roman practices]] and Republican values. The ''[[princeps]]'' (later known as Emperor) was expected to balance the interests of the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]], [[SPQR|Senate and people]], and to maintain peace, security and prosperity throughout an ethnically diverse empire. The official offer of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cultus]]'' to a living emperor acknowledged his office and rule as divinely approved and constitutional: his Principate should therefore demonstrate [[pietas|pious respect]] for traditional Republican deities and [[mos maiorum|mores]].

A deceased emperor held worthy of the honor could be voted a state divinity (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divus]]'', plural ''divi'') by the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Senate]] and elevated as such in an act of [[apotheosis]]. The granting of apotheosis served religious, political and moral judgment on Imperial rulers and allowed living Emperors to associate themselves with a well-regarded lineage of Imperial ''divi'' from which unpopular or unworthy predecessors were excluded. This proved a useful instrument to [[Vespasian]] in his establishment of the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian Imperial Dynasty]] following the death of [[Nero]] and civil war, and to [[Septimius Severus|Septimius]] in his consolidation of the [[Severan]] dynasty after the assassination of [[Commodus]].

The Imperial cult was inseparable from that of Rome's official deities, whose cult was essential to Rome's survival and whose neglect was therefore treasonous. Traditional cult was a focus of Imperial revivalist legislation under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]]. [[Christian apologists]] and [[martyrology|martyrologists]] saw the cult of the Emperor as a particularly offensive instrument of pagan impiety and persecution.&lt;ref&gt;See Bowersock ''et al'' for "pagan" as a mark of socio-religious inferiority in Latin Christian polemic: [https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA625&amp;dq=pagus+paganus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore became a focus of theological and political debate during the ascendancy of Christianity under [[Constantine I]]. The emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] failed to reverse the declining support for Rome's official religious practices: [[Theodosius I]] adopted Christianity as Rome's state religion. Rome's traditional gods and Imperial cult were officially abandoned. However, many of the rites, practices and status distinctions that characterized the cult to emperors were perpetuated in the theology and politics of the Christianized Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Brent, ''The Imperial Cult and the Development of Church Order: Concepts and Images of Authority in Paganism and Early Christianity before the Age of Cyprian'' (Brill, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Roman===
[[File:Mars Venus Louvre Ma1009.jpg|thumb|upright|Venus and Mars sculpture group reworked to portray an Imperial couple (created 120–140 AD, reworked 170–175)]]
For five centuries, the [[Roman Republic]] did not give worship to any historic figure, or any living man, although surrounded by divine and semi-divine monarchies. Rome's legendary kings had been its masters; with their removal, Republican Romans could identify [[Romulus]], the founder of the city, with the god [[Quirinus]] and still retain Republican liberty. Similarly, Rome's ancestor-hero [[Aeneas]] was worshipped as [[Jupiter Indiges]].&lt;ref&gt;It is unclear whether the worship of Aeneas as Jupiter Indiges was an official (and thus, state sponsored) cult.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans worshipped several gods and demi-gods who had been human, and knew the theory that all the gods had originated as human beings, yet Republican traditions ''([[mos maiorum]])'' were staunchly conservative and anti-monarchic. The aristocrats who held almost all Roman magistracies, and thereby occupied almost all of the Senate, acknowledged no human as their inherent superior. No citizen, living or dead, was officially regarded as divine, but the honors&lt;ref&gt;As opposed to offices&lt;/ref&gt; awarded by the state — crowns, garlands, statues, thrones, processions — were also suitable to the gods, and tinged with divinity; indeed, when the emperors were later given state worship, it was done by a decree of the Senate, phrased like any other honor.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, pp. 32–52, as is much of this section.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the highest of honors was the [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. When a general was acclaimed ''[[imperator]]'' by his troops, the Senate would then choose whether to award him a triumph, a parade to the Capitol in which the ''triumphator'' displayed his captives and spoils of war in the company of his troops; by law, all were unarmed. The triumphator rode in a chariot, bearing divine emblems, in a manner supposed to be inherited from the ancient [[kings of Rome]], and ended by dedicating his victory to Jupiter Capitolinus. Some scholars have viewed the triumphator as impersonating or even becoming a king or a god (or both) for the day but the circumstances of triumphal award and subsequent rites also functioned to limit his status. Whatever his personal ambitions, his victory and his triumph alike served the Roman Senate, people, and gods and were recognised only through their consent.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of disparate viewpoints regarding the status of the triumphator (and thus the meaning of the Triumph) can be found in Versnel, 56–93: limited preview via [https://books.google.com/books?id=DswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Within+the+range+of+opinions%22+inauthor:Versnel&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Within%20the%20range%20of%20opinions%22%20inauthor%3AVersnel&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 272-5: the very few accounts of a public slave (or other figure) who stands behind or near the triumphator to remind him that he "is but mortal" or prompts him to "look behind" are open to a variety of interpretations; moreover they are post-Republican. Nevertheless, they imply a tradition that the triumphator, whatever his kingly appearance, temporary godlike status or divine associations, was publicly reminded of his mortal nature. There is no reason to assume this an innovation of Empire.&lt;/ref&gt;

In private life, however, tradition required that some human beings be treated as more or less divine; cult was due from familial inferiors to their superiors. Every [[paterfamilias|head of household]] embodied the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' – the generative principle and guardian spirit – of his ancestors, which others might worship and by which his family and slaves took oaths;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; his wife had a [[Juno (mythology)|juno]]. A [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client]] could call his patron "Jupiter on earth".&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, p.46, citing Plautus – this is Plautus' addition to the Greek originals; Gradel also suggests that the ''[[corona civica]]'' began as an acknowledgement by A.A. that N.N. had saved his life – as a god might – by crowning N.N. with the leaves of Jupiter's tree.&lt;/ref&gt; The dead, collectively and individually, were gods of the underworld or afterlife (''dii [[manes]]''). A letter has survived from [[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]], the mother of the [[Gracchi]], expecting that when she was dead, her sons would venerate her as ''[[parentalia|deus parens]]'', a parental (or a nurturing) divinity; such piety was expected from any dutiful son.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 55"&gt;Taylor, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent clan might claim divine influence and quasi-divine honors for its leader. [[Death mask]]s (''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'') were made for all notable Romans and were displayed in the ''[[atrium (architecture)|atria]]'' of their houses; they were used to represent their ghostly presence at family funerals. The mask of [[Scipio Africanus]], Cornelia's father and victor over [[Hannibal]], was stored in the temple of Jupiter; his epitaph (by [[Ennius]]) said that he had ascended to Heaven.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 55"/&gt; A tradition arose in the centuries after his death that Africanus had been inspired by prophetic dreams, and was himself the son of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Walbank, 120-37. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Scipio+Africanus+Jupiter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-x52EP3M4L&amp;sig=s1kkbafdnOCyiCpbuGNmMbHyX7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pN-eSvzKNc_Z-Qav_dXaCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Scipio%20Africanus%20Jupiter&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Convenience link&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several cases of unofficial cult directed at men viewed as saviors, military or political. In [[Further Spain]] in the 70s BC, loyalist Romans greeted the proconsul [[Metellus Pius]] as a savior, burning incense "as if to a god" for his efforts to quash the [[Lusitania]]n rebellion led by the Roman [[Sertorius]], a member of the faction which called itself "men of the People" (''[[populares]]''). This celebration, in Spain, featured a lavish banquet with local and imported delicacies, and a mechanical statue of [[Victoria (goddess)|Victory]] to crown Metellus, who wore (extralegally) a triumphator's ''toga picta'' for the occasion. These festivities were organized by the [[quaestor]]&lt;ref&gt;most likely an [[aide-de-camp]] of Metellus, and not a provincial official.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaius Urbinus, but were not acts of the state. Metellus liked all this, but his older and pious (''veteres et sanctos'') contemporaries thought it arrogant and intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.48; she cites [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'', 3.13.9, which is largely an otherwise unknown quotation from [[Sallust]]; ''quasi deo supplicabatur'' is from Sallust. The year is uncertain, possibly 77 BC, after a battle at Saguntum.&lt;/ref&gt; After the land reformers [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]] were both murdered by their opponents, their supporters "fell down" and offered daily sacrifice at the statues of the Gracchi "as though they were visiting the shrines of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;Vout, 119: citing Plutarch, Gaius Gracchus, 10, 18.2. Loeb edition available at Thayer: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caius_Gracchus*.html Penelope.Uchicago.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Gaius Marius]] defeated the [[Teutones]], private citizens would offer food and drink to him alongside their household gods; he was called the third founder of Rome after Romulus and [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.48, citing Plutarch's ''Marius'', 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 86 BC, offerings of incense and wine were made at [[Compitalia|crossroad shrines]] to statues of the still-living [[Marcus Marius Gratidianus|Marius Gratidianus]], the nephew of the elder Marius, who was wildly popular in his own right, in large part for monetary reforms that eased an economic crisis in Rome during his [[praetor]]ship.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 51, citing Cicero, ''De officiis'', 3.80: [http://www.stoics.com/cicero_book.html#Gyges3 Stoics.com] (accessed 2 August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek===
[[File:Roman - Pendant with Portrait of Alexander the Great - Walters 57526.jpg|thumb|[[Repoussé]] pendant of Alexander the Great, horned and diademed like [[Zeus Ammon]]: images of Alexander were worn as magic charms (4th-century Roman).]]
When the Romans began to dominate large parts of the Greek world, Rome's senior representatives there were given the same divine honours as were [[Hellenistic]] rulers. This was a well-established method for Greek [[polis|city-states]] to declare their allegiance to an outside power; such a cult committed the city to obey and respect the king as they obeyed and respected Apollo or any of the other gods.

The cities of [[Ionia]] worshipped the [[Sparta]]n general [[Lysander]], when he personally dominated Greece, immediately following the [[Peloponnesian War]]; according to [[Plutarch]], this was the first instance of [[ruler cult]] in Greek history. There were similar instances of divine cult to humans in the same century, although some rulers, like [[Agesilaus]], declined it.&lt;ref&gt;When the messengers of [[Thasos]] announced to him that the city had declared him a god, he told them that if they could make men into gods, they should make ''themselves'' into gods; he would then believe that they could make him into one. Taylor, p. 12, citing Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 210d.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clearchus of Heraclea|Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea]], dressed up like [[Zeus]] and claimed godhood; this did not stop the Heracleots from assassinating him. [[Isocrates]] said of [[Philip II of Macedon]] that after he conquered the [[Persian Empire]], there would be nothing for him to attain but to become a god; the city of [[Amphipolis]], and a private society at Athens, worshiped him even without this conquest; he himself set out his statue, dressed as a god, as the thirteenth of the [[Twelve Olympians]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] who made the divinity of kings standard practice among the Greeks. The Egyptians accepted him as [[Pharaoh]], and therefore divine, after he drove the Persians out of Egypt; other nations received him as their traditional divine or quasi-divine ruler as he acquired them. In 324, he sent word to the Greek cities that they should also make him a god; they did so, with marked indifference&lt;ref&gt;The Spartan decree was "Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god"; at Athens, [[Demades]] argued against provoking Alexander over this: don't protect Heaven and lose the earth; [[Demosthenes]] said "Let him be the son of Zeus – and Poseidon too, if he likes."&lt;/ref&gt; – which did not stop them from [[Lamian War|rebelling]] when they heard of his death next year.

His immediate successors, the [[Diadochi]], offered sacrifices to Alexander, and  made themselves gods even before they claimed to be kings; they put their own portraits on the coinage, whereas the Greeks had always reserved this for a god or for an emblem of the city. When the Athenians allied with [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]], eighteen years after the deification of Alexander, they lodged him in the [[Parthenon]] with [[Athena]], and sang a hymn extolling him as a present god, who heard them, as the other gods did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=A0_lgVLT0lsC&amp;dq=Deipnosophists%20inauthor%3AYonge&amp;pg=RA1-PA398#v=onepage&amp;q=Demetrius&amp;f=false 6.63 Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euhemerus]], a contemporary of Alexander, wrote a fictitious history of the world, which showed Zeus and the other established gods of Greece as mortal men, who had [[Euhemerism|made themselves into gods]] in the same way; [[Ennius]] appears to have translated this into Latin some two centuries later, in [[Scipio Africanus]]' time.

The [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] of Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] claimed godhood as long as they lasted; they may have been influenced in this by the Persian and Egyptian traditions of divine kings – although the Ptolemies had separate cults in Egyptian polytheism, as Pharaoh, and in the Greek. Not all Greek dynasties made the same claims; the descendants of Demetrius, who were kings of [[Macedon]] and dominated the mainland of Greece, did not claim godhead or worship Alexander (cf. [[Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great]]).

===Romans among the Greeks===
The Roman magistrates who conquered the Greek world were fitted into this tradition; games were set up in honor of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|M. Claudius Marcellus]], when he conquered Sicily at the end of the [[Second Punic War]], as the Olympian games were for Zeus; they were kept up for a century and a half until [[Verres|another Roman governor]] abolished them, to make way for his own honors. When [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|T. Quinctius Flamininus]] extended Roman influence to Greece proper, temples were built for him and cities placed his portrait on their coinage; he called himself godlike (''isotheos'') in an inscription at [[Delphi]] – but not in Latin, or at Rome. The Greeks also devised a goddess [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], not worshipped at Rome, who was worshipped with Flamininus (their joint cult is attested in 195 BC); she would become a symbol of idealised ''[[romanitas]]'' in the later Roman provinces, and a continuing link, whereas a Marcellus or Flamininus might only hold power for a couple years.&lt;!--consulate and proconsulate together--&gt;

When King [[Prusias I of Bithynia]]  was granted an interview by the Roman Senate, he prostrated himself and addressed them as "Saviour Gods", which would have been etiquette at his own court; [[Livy]] was shocked by [[Polybius]]' account of this, and insists that there is no Roman source it ever happened.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 40–41, citing Polybius 30.16, Livy, 45.44; also, as a parallel case, [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] VI 374, from the [[Laodicea (Arcadia)|Laodicea]]ns to the Roman people.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worship and temples appear to have been routinely offered by Greeks to their Roman governors, with varied reactions. [[Cicero]] declined a temple proposed by the city officials of [[Roman Asia]] to [[Quintus Cicero|his brother]] and himself, while the latter was proconsul, to avoid jealousy from other Romans; when Cicero himself was Governor of [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]], he claimed to have accepted no statues, shrines, or chariots. His predecessor, [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 54 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]], was so pleased, however, when the Cilicians built a temple to him that, when it was not finished at the end of Claudius' year in office, Claudius wrote Cicero to make sure it was done, and complaining that Cicero was not active enough in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;In general, see Price, 48; Fishwick, Vol 1, 1, 6–20; for details, Taylor, Chapter 2 and 3, ''passim''. Attested statuary of Roman magistrates  in Rome may well have been largely commissioned by Greek allies, unaware of the potential for controversy aroused by public display of "Hellenised" images of the Roman military aristocracy. See Christopher Hallett, ''The Roman Nude'', Oxford University Press, 2005. (limited preview available) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-CZ4n3HOeAIC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=Flamininus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u8Rwxb2waG&amp;sig=b_2YuZi0Af4_xOiw58MSA49m27A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wMxcSsX8DqHLjAestNXeDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 Books.Google.co.uk], citing descriptions in Plutarch, ''Lives,'' Flamininus, &amp; Cicero, ''Rabiurus Postumus,'' 10.26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermediate forms===
The Romans and the Greeks gave religious reverence to and for human beings in ways that did not make the recipients gods; these made the first Greek apotheoses easier. Similar middle forms appeared as [[Augustus]] approached official divinity.

The Greeks did not consider the dead to be gods, but they did pay them homage, and give them sacrifices – using different rituals than those for the gods of Olympus.  The Greeks called the extraordinary dead – founders of cities and the like – [[Greek hero cult|heroes]]; in the simplest form, hero cult was the burial and the memorials which any respectable Greek family gave their dead, but paid for by their City in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Most heroes were the figures of ancient legend, but some were historical: the Athenians revered [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]] as heroes, as saviours of Athens from tyranny; also, collectively, those who fell at the [[Battle of Marathon]].  Statesmen did not generally become heroes, but [[Sophocles]] was the hero Dexion ("the Receiver") – not as a playwright, nor a general, but because when the Athenians took  [[Asclepius]]' cult during the Peloponnesian War, Sophocles housed an image of Asclepius until a shrine could be built.  The Athenian leader [[Hagnon, son of Nikias|Hagnon]] founded [[Amphipolis]] shortly before the Peloponnesian War; thirteen years later, while Hagnon was still alive, the Spartan general [[Brasidas]] liberated it from the Athenian empire, and was fatally wounded in the process. The Amphipolitans buried him as a hero, declaring him the second founder of the city, and [[damnatio memoriae|erased]] Hagnon's honors as much as they could.

The Greeks also honored founders of cities while they were still alive, like Hagnon. This could also be extended to men who did equally important things; during the period when [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]] ruled in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the Syracusans gave him "heroic honors" for suppressing the tyrants, and repeated this for [[Timoleon]]; these could also be described as worshipping his good spirit (''agathos daimon'', [[agathodaemon]]; every Greek had an agathodaemon, and the Greek equivalent of a toast was offered to one's agathodaemon).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Appendix II, citing [[Athenaeus]], Book 10, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Timoleon was called ''savior''; he set up a shrine to Fortune (''Automatia'') in his house; and his birthday, the festival of his ''daimon'', became a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 9–10, citing [[Diodorus]], 16.20; [[Cornelius Nepos]], ''Timoleon'' 5, [[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 542 E, ''Dion'' 46 and ''Timoleon'' 36,39; Timoleon is the first Greek whose birthday is recorded.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other men might claim divine favor by having a patron among the gods; so [[Alcibiades]] may have had both [[Eros]] and [[Cybele]] as patrons;&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Munn,  ''The School of History: Athens in the Age of Socrates'', pp. 11,172&lt;/ref&gt; and Clearchus of Heraclea claimed to be "son of Zeus". Alexander claimed the patronage of Dionysus and other gods and heroes;&lt;ref&gt;Chiefly Zeus, as identified with Ammon, and his ancestors [[Achilles]] and [[Hercules]].&lt;/ref&gt; he held a banquet at [[Bactra]] which combined the toast to his ''agathos daimon'' and [[libation]]s to Dionysus, who was present within Alexander (and therefore the celebrants saluted Alexander rather than the hearth and altar, as they would have done for a toast).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Appendix 2; this was the ritual in which [[Callisthenes]] declined to take part, one of the offenses for which Alexander killed him.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not always easy to distinguish between heroic honors, veneration for a man's good spirit,  worship of his patron deity, worship of the Fortune of a city he founded, and  worship of the man himself. One might slide into another: In Egypt, there was a cult of Alexander as god and as founder of Alexandria; [[Ptolemy I Soter]] had a separate cult as founder of [[Ptolemais Hermiou|Ptolemais]], which presumably worshipped his ''daimon'' and then gave him heroic honors, but in [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|his son's reign]], the priests of Alexander also worshipped Ptolemy and [[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice]] as the Savior Gods (''theoi soteres'').&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 31-2. A papyrus survives which has a man swearing by the ''daimones'' of Ptolemy II and his queen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a man might, like Philip II, assume some prerogatives of godhood and not others. The first [[Attalid]] kings of [[Pergamum]], were not gods, and supported a cult of Dionysus Cathegemon, as their ancestor; they put the picture of [[Philetaerus]], the first prince, on the coins, rather than their own. Eventually, like the Seleucids, they acquired an eponymous priest, and put themselves on the coinage; but they still were not called gods before their deaths. Pergamum was usually allied with Rome, and this may have influenced the eventual Roman practice.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Republic==
In the last decades of the Roman Republic, its leaders regularly assumed extra-constitutional powers. The ''mos majorum'' had required that magistrates hold office collectively, and for short periods; there were two [[consul (Roman)|consul]]s; even [[colonies in antiquity|colonies]] were founded by boards of three men;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; but  these new leaders held power by themselves, and often for years.

The same men were often given extraordinary honors. Triumphs grew ever more splendid; [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]], the rival leaders in Rome's first civil war, each founded cities, which they named after themselves; Sulla had annual games in his honor, at Rome itself, bearing his name; the unofficial worship of Marius is above. In the next generation, [[Pompey]] was allowed to wear his triumphal ornaments whenever he went to the [[Circus (building)|Games at the Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.57, citing Cicero, ''To Atticus'', 1.18.6; [[Velleius Paterculus]], 2.40.4. He only exercised the privilege once, and was attacked for it.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such men also claimed a special relationship to the gods: Sulla's patron was Venus Felix, and at the height of his power, he added Felix to his own name; his opponent Marius believed he had a destiny, and that no ordinary man might kill him. Pompey also claimed Venus' personal favour, and built her a [[Theatre of Pompey#Temples|temple]]. But the first Roman to become a god, as part of aiming at monarchy, was [[Julius Caesar]].

===Divus Julius===
Caesar could claim personal ties to the gods, both by descent and by office. He was from the ''[[Julia (gens)|gens Julia]]'', whose members contended to be descended from [[Aeneas]] and his mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. In his eulogy for his aunt [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]], Caesar also indirectly claimed to be descended from [[Ancus Marcius]] and the kings of Rome, and so from [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=-0EtPxT_z4gC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=caesar+Ancus+Marcius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XkXROZ1ny7&amp;sig=sUd3OFsM5rR8izaZJOwLs0_xmAQ&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSlN2bo_LUAhULmrQKHRBeD5IQ6AEIXjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=caesar%20Ancus%20Marcius&amp;f=false|title=The Caesars|last=Suetonius|first=|last2=Hurley|first2=Donna W.|publisher=Hackett Publishing|year=|isbn=1603846131|location=|pages=4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, when he was a teenager, Marius had named him ''[[flamen Dialis]]'', the special priest of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Sulla had cancelled this appointment; however, relatively early in his career, Caesar had become [[pontifex maximus]], the chief priest of Rome, who fulfilled most of the religious duties of the ancient kings.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; He had spent his twenties in the divine monarchies of the eastern Mediterranean, and was intimately familiar with Bithynia.&lt;ref&gt;And [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]] was intimately familiar with Caesar, or so rumor sang about the streets of Rome. [[Suetonius]], ''Divus Julius'' 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar made use of these connections in his rise to power, but not more than his rivals would have, or more than his other advantages. When he [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|spoke at the funeral]] of his aunt [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]] in 69 BC, Julius Caesar spoke of her descent from the Roman kings, and implied his own; but he also reminded his audience she had been Marius' wife, and (by implication) that he was one of the few surviving Marians.

When, however, he defeated his rivals, in 45 BC, and assumed full personal control of the Roman state, he asserted more. During the [[Caesar's Civil War|Roman Civil War]], since 49 BC, he had returned to the Eastern Mediterranean, where he had been called god and savior, and been familiar with the Ptolemaic Egyptian monarchy of [[Cleopatra]], called ''Cleopatra Thea'' because of the weight she placed on her own divinity. Also, he had a new Senate to deal with. Most of the more resolute defenders of the Senate had joined with Pompey, and – one way or another – they were not sitting in the Senate. Caesar had replaced them with his own partisans, few of whom were committed to the old Roman methods; some of them were not even from Italy. It was rumoured that Caesar intended a despotic removal of power and wealth from Rome eastwards, perhaps to Alexandria or [[Troy|Ilium]] (Troy).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;pg=PA447&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=Rajak+roman+charter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZogsuvIw0M&amp;sig=SBaBmScH0lagEGLw4kT19JsZgos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q4wpSpC_OtzKjAfD4rDqCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#PPA304,M1 Books.Google.co.uk], Isaac, 304: limited preview at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War, he had declared Venus his patron goddess: he vowed to erect a temple for ''Venus Victrix'' if she granted him the [[battle of Pharsalia]], but he had built it, in 46 BC, to ''Venus Genetrix'', which epithet combined her aspects as his ancestress, the mother of the Roman people, and the goddess invoked in the philosophical poem ''[[De rerum natura]]''. The new Senate had also put up a statue of Caesar, with an inscription declaring him a demi-god, but he had it effaced, as not the claim he wished to make.&lt;ref&gt;This statue showed him standing on the globe: the  dedication is offered by Cassius Dio in Greek: ''hēmitheos'' ([[demigod]]), Dio 43.14.6 &amp; 21.2. This may be Dio's late, anachronistic and approximate equivalent of ''divus''. Gradel, 61–69 reconstructs the original Latin inscription as ''Senatus populusque Romanus Divo Caesaris'' but Taylor suggests Dio's form as an accurate rendition, with no strict Latin equivalent.&lt;/ref&gt; Granted the same extension of rights to triumphal dress as Pompey had been given, Caesar took to wearing his triumphal head-wreath "wherever and whenever", excusing this as a cover for his baldness. He may also have publicly worn the red boots and the ''[[toga picta]]'' ("painted", purple toga) usually reserved to a triumphing general for the day of his triumph; a costume also associated with the ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' (the priestly "king of the sacred rites" of Rome's monarchic era, later the ''pontifex maximus''), the ''Monte Albano'' kings, and possibly the statue of ''[[Jupiter Capitolinus]]''.

When the news of his final victory, at the [[battle of Munda]], reached Rome, the [[Parilia]], the games commemorating the founding of the city, were to be held the next day; they were rededicated to Caesar, as if he were founder. Statues were set up to "[[Libertas|Caesar's Liberty]]", and to Caesar himself, as "unconquered god."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.65; this was in the temple of [[Quirinus]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was accorded a house at public expense which was built like a temple; his image was paraded with those of the gods;&lt;ref&gt;For instance, at the ''[[pompa circensis]]'', the procession held before games presented at the [[Circus (building)|circus]].&lt;/ref&gt; his portrait was put on the coins (the first time a living man had appeared on Roman coinage). Early in 44 BC, he was called ''parens patriae'' (father of the fatherland);&lt;ref&gt;An honorific also granted Cicero during his consulship and comparable to Romulus' title as ''parens urbis Romanae'' (parent of the Roman city)&lt;/ref&gt; legal oaths were taken by his Genius; his birthday was made a public festival; the month Quinctilis was renamed July, in his honor (as June was named for [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]). At last a special priest, a [[flamen]], was ordained for him; the first was to be [[Marc Antony]], Caesar's adjutant, then consul. To be served by a flamen would rank Caesar not only as divine, but as an equal of Quirinus, Jupiter, and Mars. In [[Cicero]]'s hostile account, the living Caesar's honours in Rome were already and unambiguously those of a full-blown god (''deus'').&lt;ref&gt;Price, in Cannadine and Price, 71, 85: in particular Cicero's speech to the Senate some months after Caesar's death: "...couch, image, pediment, priest" refer to Caesar's divine honours while living. Cicero, ''Philippic'' ii.110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's name as a living divinity – not as yet ratified by senatorial vote – was ''Divus Julius'' (or perhaps ''Jupiter Julius''); ''divus'', at that time, was a slightly archaic form of ''deus'', suitable for poetry, implying some association with the bright heavens. A statue of him was erected next to the statues of Rome's ancient kings: with this, he seemed set to make himself King of Rome, in the Hellenistic style, as soon as he came back from the expedition to [[Parthia]] he was planning; but "friends" in the Senate killed him on [[Ides of March|15 March 44 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio 43.45.3: Brutus and his party saw Caesar's "kingly" statue as confirmation of despotic intent which justified his assassination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Weinstock, ''Divus Julius'', Oxford 1971, 297; Alexander Del Mar, ''The Worship of Augustus Caesar'', 1899, p. 305 sq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, 324 finds the evidence for the living Caesar's aspirations and divine status equivocal in some details, but Fishwick, vol 1, 1, 68–9, argues that acceptance of divine honours while living seems to herald some form of divine monarchy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,0474,057:8:16:1 Perseus.tufts.edu], Cicero, ''Atticus'' 8.16.1: Latin text at [[Tufts University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An angry, grief-stricken crowd gathered in the [[Roman Forum]] to see his corpse and hear [[Mark Antony]]'s funeral oration. Antony appealed to Caesar's divinity and vowed vengeance on his killers. A fervent popular cult to ''divus Julius'' followed. It was forcefully suppressed but the Senate soon succumbed to Caesarian pressure and confirmed Caesar as a ''divus'' of the Roman state. A comet interpreted as Caesar's soul in heaven was named the [[Caesar's Comet|"Julian star"]] (''sidus Iulium'') and in 42 BC, with the "full consent of the Senate and people of Rome", Caesar's young heir, his great-nephew [[Octavian]], held ceremonial apotheosis for his adoptive father.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol. 1, 1, 65, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 40 BC Antony took up his appointment as [[Flamen Divi Iulii|''flamen'' of the ''divus Julius'']]. Provincial cult centres (''caesarea'') to the ''divus'' Julius were founded in Caesarian colonies such as [[Corinth]].&lt;ref name="Fishwick, Vol I, 108"&gt;Fishwick, Vol I, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Antony's loyalty to his late patron did not extend to Caesar's heir: but in the last significant act of the long-drawn civil war, on 1 August 31 BC, Octavian defeated Antony at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]].

==Caesar's heir==
[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as Jove, holding scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)&lt;ref&gt;The imperial cult in Roman Britain-Google docs&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 30/29 BC, the ''koina'' of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Bithynia]] requested permission to worship Octavian as their "deliverer" or "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 3, part 1, 3: citing Cassius Dio, 51, 20, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; This was by no means a novel request but it placed Octavian in a difficult position. He must satisfy popularist and traditionalist expectations and these could be notoriously incompatible. [[Marcus Marius Gratidianus|Marius Gratidianus]]'s popular support and cult had ended in his public and spectacular death in 82 BC, at the hands of his enemies in the Senate; likewise Caesar's murder now marked an [[hubris]]tic connection between living divinity and death.&lt;ref name="Fishwick, Vol I, 108"/&gt; Octavian had to respect the overtures of his Eastern allies, acknowledge the nature and intent of Hellenic honours and formalise his own pre-eminence among any possible rivals: he must also avoid a potentially fatal identification in Rome as a monarchic-deistic aspirant. It was decided that cult honours to him could be jointly offered to ''dea Roma'', at cult centres to be built at [[Pergamum]] and [[Nicomedia]]. Provincials who were also Roman citizens were not to worship the living emperor, but might worship ''dea Roma'' and the ''divus Julius'' at precincts in [[Ephesus]] and [[Nicaea]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives'', Augustus, 52: Tacitus, Annals, 4, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 1, book 1, 77 &amp; 126–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nevertheless, cult offered to ''divus'' Julius implies loyalty to his adopted son and heir. See Friesen, 21. [https://books.google.com/books?id=en-URyPm66gC&amp;dq=imperial+cult&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=in&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IDLLSt2qBMmJ4gav-LHHAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=13#v=onepage&amp;q=imperial%20cult&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 29 BC Octavian dedicated the [[Temple of Caesar|temple]] of the ''divus Julius'' at the site of Caesar's cremation. Not only had he dutifully, legally and officially honoured his adoptive father as a ''divus'' of the Roman state.  He "had come into being" through the Julian star and was therefore the ''divi filius'' (son of the divinity).&lt;ref&gt;That is, through the manifest [[numen]] of his adoptive father the ''divus Julius''.&lt;/ref&gt; But where Caesar had failed, Octavian had succeeded: he had restored the ''pax deorum'' (divinely ordained peace) and re-founded Rome through "August augury".&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein, 57-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 27 BC he was voted – and accepted – the elevated title of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In Florus' epitome, the name ''Augustus'' signaled Octavian's divine status outright. Apparently, "Romulus" had also been considered and turned down: see Florus, 2, 34, 66 at Thayer's website – [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII Penelope.Uchicago.edu] (accessed 27 July 2009). For most of Augustus' contemporaries, however, the name would have been a quite obscure and somewhat modest synonym for ''divinus'' (divine).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and ''Imperium'' under Augustus===
Augustus appeared to claim nothing for himself, and innovate nothing: even the cult to the ''divus'' Julius had a respectable antecedent in the traditional cult to ''[[parentalia|di parentes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol 1, 1, 51: .&lt;/ref&gt; His unique – and still traditional – position within the Senate as ''[[princeps]]'' or ''primus inter pares'' (first among equals) offered a curb to the ambitions and rivalries that had led to the recent civil wars. As censor and ''pontifex maximus'' he was morally obliged to renew the ''mos maiores'' by the will of the gods and the "Senate and People of Rome" (''[[SPQR|senatus populusque romanus]]''). As [[tribune]] he encouraged generous public spending, and as ''princeps'' of the Senate he discouraged [[Ambitus|ambitious extravagance]]. He disbanded the remnants of the civil war armies to form new legions and a personal imperial guard (the [[Praetorian Guard]]): the patricians who still clung to the upper echelons of political, military and priestly power were gradually replaced from a vast, Empire-wide reserve of ambitious and talented equestrians. For the first time, senatorial status became heritable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jJwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Augustus+just+another+senator&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VSFbhGK1xA&amp;sig=4c0S4nSx_O9zI7osnw-o2wfH2RU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dPU_SruXEYzUjAeEgKkT&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Books.Google.co.uk], Weidemann, 131-2: limited preview available at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary citizens could circumvent the complex, hierarchic bureaucracy of the State, and appeal directly to the emperor, as if to a private citizen. The emperor's name and image were ubiquitous – on state coinage and on the streets, within and upon the temples of the gods, and particularly in the courts and offices of the civil and military administration. Oaths were sworn in his name, with his image as witness. His official ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|res gestae]]'' (achievements) included his repair of 82 temples in 28 BC alone, the founding or repair of 14 others in Rome during his lifetime and the overhauling or foundation of civic amenities including a new road, water supplies, Senate house and theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Howgego, in [[Christopher Howgego|Howgego]] ''et al''., 4–6: coinage celebrating state deities conspicuously features the restorer of their temples. ''Ibid'' 53: Imperial themes, including the Imperial family, dominate Roman coin issues from Augustus to Claudius.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, his god-given military pre-eminence had brought an enduring and [[Ara Pacis|sacred peace]], which earned him the permanent title of ''[[imperator]]'' and made the triumph an [[Roman Triumph#Triumph as Imperial privilege|Imperial privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Clifford Ando|Ando]], 46 ff, for discussion of Augustan ideology.&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have managed all this within due process of law through a combination of personal brio, cheerfully veiled threats and [[self-deprecation]] as "just another senator".&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol. 1, 196–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ando, 163, gives 82 temples in the city of Rome: limited preview available at Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXqIG1NIU2IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA209&amp;lpg=RA1-PA209&amp;dq=Imperial+cult+decius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aXAhcwTNLb&amp;sig=AWY6SvWXsGtRFMiXfOPvxJ9Q32s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kZA2SqKsON3TjAeh5735CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PRA1-PA163,M1 Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, it was enough that the office, munificence, ''auctoritas'' and ''[[gens]]'' of Augustus were identified with every possible legal, religious and social institution of the city. Should "foreigners" or private citizens wish to honour him as something more, that was their prerogative, within moderation; his acknowledgment of their loyalty demonstrated his own moral responsibility and generosity; "his" Imperial revenue funded temples, amphitheatres, theatres, baths, festivals and government. This unitary principle laid the foundations for what is now known as "Imperial cult", which would be expressed in many different forms and emphases throughout the multicultural Empire.

===Eastern provinces===
[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|left|Augustus in Egyptian style, on the temple of Kalabsha in Egyptian [[Nubia]].]]
In the Eastern provinces, cultural precedent ensured a rapid and geographically widespread dissemination of cult, extending as far as the Augustan military settlement at modern-day [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran (in what is now south-west Saudi Arabia) was possibly later known as the "Kaaba of Najran": جواد علي, المفصل في تاريخ العرب قبل الإسلام (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-‘Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; "Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam"), Baghdad, 1955–1983&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a whole, these provinces present the Empire's broadest and most complex syntheses of imperial and native cult, funded through private and public initiatives and ranging from the god-like honours due a living patron to what Harland (2003) interprets as privately funded communal mystery rites.&lt;ref&gt;Harland, 2003, 91–103, finds among these examples a privately funded local, traditional Graeco-Asian civil association offering cult to Demeter and the Emperor as a form of mystery cult: ''contra'' Price, 1986, 7–11, who believes that Emperors lacked the requisite fully divine status.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Harland, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek cities of [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman Asia]] competed for the privilege of building high-status Imperial cult centres ([[neocorate]]s). [[Ephesus]] and [[Sardis]], ancient rivals, had two apiece until the early 3rd century AD, when Ephesus was allowed an additional temple, to the reigning emperor [[Caracalla]]. When he died, the city lost its brief, celebrated advantage through a religious technicality.&lt;ref&gt;Llewelyn, S.R. (Editor), ''New documents illustrating early Christianity: Volume 9, A Review of the Greek Inscriptions and Papyri Published in 1986–87,'' Macquarie University, 2002, pp.28 - 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5_skkE21eTsC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Ephesus+Artemis+Imperial+cult&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RJoY_dFI91&amp;sig=FkZ5TLklICCvaMofSNGe1R9rpQk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gyJwTfjEJ8y3hAfX3aUw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ephesus%20Artemis%20Imperial%20cult&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern provinces offer some of the clearest material evidence for the imperial ''domus'' and ''familia'' as official models of divine virtue and moral propriety. Centres including Pergamum, [[Lesbos]] and Cyprus offered cult honours to Augustus and the Empress Livia: the Cypriot Calendar honoured the entire Augustan ''familia'' by dedicating a month each (and presumably cult practise) to imperial family members, their ancestral deities and some of the major gods of the Romano-Greek pantheon. Coin evidence links ''Thea'' Livia with [[Hera]] and [[Demeter]], and [[Julia the Elder]] with Venus Genetrix ([[Aphrodite]]). In Athens, Livia and Julia shared cult honour with [[Hestia]] (equivalent to [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]), and the name of [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] was linked to [[Ares]] (Mars). These Eastern connections were made within Augustus' lifetime – Livia was not officially consecrated in Rome until some time after her death. Eastern Imperial cult had a life of its own.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SBRN6HW8xEIC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=Mellor+Thea+Roma&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Eu_0rjzBLC&amp;sig=7Ku6ux69UApxOIBazRhqhBlYwvo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s5Q_SrLeD4asjAft94EL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 Books.Google.co.uk], Severy, 114-5.

===Western provinces===
The Western provinces were only recently "Latinised" following Caesar's [[Gallic Wars]] and most fell outside the Graeco-Roman cultural ambit. There were exceptions: Polybius mentions a past benefactor of [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] in Republican Iberia "said to have been offered divine honours".&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, The Histories, 10.10.10: written circa 150 BC. The honorand is named as Aletes, who supposedly discovered the silver mines there. One of the hills of the city is named after him. Others are named after Aesculapius, Vulcan and Saturn. English version (Loeb) available from Thayer [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/10*.html Penelope.Uchicago.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; In 74 BC, Roman citizens in Iberia burned incense to [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Metellus Pius]] as "more than mortal" in hope of his victory against [[Sertorius]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 56: See Macrobius 3.13.6–9 – ''"ultra mortalium morem"''.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the West offered no native traditions of monarchic divinity or political parallels to the Greek ''koina'' to absorb the Imperial cult as a romanising agency.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 1, 1, 92–3. In the reign of Tiberius, [[Tarraco]] requested permission for cult to Augustus but this is one of only two known Western provincial initiatives to inaugurate the imperial cult – both were Iberian, and had long-standing ties with Rome. See also Tacitus, Annals, 1.78. [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/tacitus/TacitusAnnals01.html Posc.mu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The Western provincial ''concilia'' emerged as direct creations of the imperial cult, which recruited existing local military, political and religious traditions to a Roman model. This required only the willingness of barbarian elites to "Romanise" themselves and their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol 3, 1, pp7 &amp; 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vienne - Templo romano de Tito y Livia - Fachada.JPG|thumb|right|Temple of [[Augustus]] and [[Livia]], [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] (modern France). Originally dedicated to Augustus and [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]. Augustus was deified on his death in 14 AD: his widow Livia was deified in 42 AD by [[Claudius]].]]
The first known Western regional cults to Augustus were established with his permission around 19 BC in north-western ("Celtic") Spain and named ''arae sestianae'' after their military founder, [[Lucius Sestius Quirinalis Albinianus|L. Sestius Quirinalis Albinianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol 3, 1, 7: see also Pliny the Elder, ''Historia Naturalis'', 4.111; Ptolemy, ''Geographia'', 2.6.3; Pomponeus Mela, 3.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, in either 12 BC or 10 BC, the first provincial imperial cult centre in the West was founded at [[Lugdunum]] by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], as a focus for his new tripartite administrative division of [[Gallia Comata]]. Lugdunum set the type for official Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity, parceled into the establishment of military-administrative centres. These were strategically located within the unstable, "barbarian" Western provinces of the new Principate and inaugurated by military commanders who were – in all but one instance – members of the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol 1,1, 97–149.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first priest of the Ara (altar) at Lugdunum's great [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls|Imperial cult complex]] was [[Caius Julius Vercondaridubnus]], a Gaul of the provincial elite, given [[Roman citizenship]] and entitled by his priestly office to participate in the local government of his provincial ''[[Concilium Plebis|concilium]]''. Though not leading to senatorial status, and almost certainly an annually elected office (unlike the traditional lifetime priesthoods of Roman ''flamines''), priesthood in imperial provinces thus offered a provincial equivalent to the traditional Roman ''[[cursus honorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick vol 1, 1, 101 &amp; vol 3, 1, 12–13: Fishwick determines the lower age limit at 25 years for these priesthoods. With minor exceptions, provincial priesthoods – whether described as ''sacerdos'' or ''flamen'' – appear to have been annual, but an elected priest remained influential within the ''[[Monastic order|ordo]]'' beyond his term of office. Female cult divinities were served by priestesses, who may have been the wives of the cult priests.&lt;/ref&gt; The rejection of cult spurned ''romanitas'', priesthood and citizenship; in 9 AD [[Segimundus]], imperial cult priest of what would later be known as [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]] (sited at modern [[Cologne]] in Germany) cast off or destroyed his priestly regalia to join the rebellion of his kinsman [[Arminius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 1.57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western provinces of Roman Africa===
In the early Principate, an altar inscribed ''Marazgu Aug(usto) Sac(rum)'' ("Dedicated to Marazgu Augustus"), identifies a local [[Ancient Libya]]n ([[Berbers|Berber]]) deity with the supreme power of Augustus. In the senatorial province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]], altars to the ''Dii Magifie Augusti'' attest (according to Potter) a deity who was simultaneously local and universal, rather than one whose local identity was subsumed or absorbed by an Imperial ''divus'' or deity.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 26-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
Two temples are attested to Roma and the divus Augustus – one dedicated under Tiberius at [[Leptis Magna]], and another (Julio-Claudian) at [[Mactar]].&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 1003.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Altar of the Gens Augusta|third]] at [[Carthage]] was dedicated to the ''Gens Augusta'' in the very early empire.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, Le musée du Bardo : Départements antiques, Tunis, Agence nationale du patrimoine, 1993, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Imperial succession==

===Julio-Claudian===
Even as he prepared his adopted son Tiberius for the role of ''[[princeps]]'' and recommended him to the Senate as a worthy successor, Augustus seems to have doubted the propriety of dynastic ''[[imperium]]''; this, however, was probably his only feasible course.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, 31–33, provides the constitutional and personal background to this dilemma.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Augustus died, he was voted a ''divus'' by the Senate, and his body was cremated in a sumptuous funeral; his soul was said to have ascended to the heavens, to join his adoptive father among the Olympians; his ashes were deposited in the Imperial Mausoleum, which tactfully identified him (and later, his descendants) by his Imperial names, rather than as ''divus''.&lt;ref&gt;Price, in Cannadine and Price, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; After Augustus, the only new cults to Roman officials are those connected to the Imperial household.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, 360-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Tacitus, ''Annals'', 1.9–10 for appraisals of Augustus' motives in his rise to power, his opaque complexity of character, evaluation of his success and the exchange of constitutional freedoms for peace and prosperity during and after his reign.&lt;/ref&gt;
On his death, the senate debated and passed a ''lex de imperio'' which voted Tiberius ''princeps'' through his "proven merit in office", and awarded him the honorific "Augustus" as name and title.&lt;ref&gt;Well into the third century AD, the merit of each imperial candidate would be debated as basis for a new ''lex de imperio''. In most cases this simply confirmed his possession of imperial power, acquired through dynastic inheritance or acclamation by the soldiers but its legality was Republican in form, "probably a continuation of the old Republican tradition, of the ''[[Lex curiata de imperio]]'' which conferred ''imperium'' on the higher Roman magistrates." [[Justinian]]'s law later equates ''Lex de imperio'' to ''[[Lex Regia]]''; which seems consistent with Byzantine conceptions of Imperial power as "kingship". The same association is precisely avoided under the early ''[[Lex de imperio Vespasiani]]'' of 69–70 AD.

Tiberius accepted his position and title as emperor with apparent reluctance. Though he proved a capable and efficient administrator, he could not match his predecessor's extraordinary energy and charisma. Roman historians described him as morose and mistrustful. With a self-deprecation that may have been entirely genuine, he encouraged the cult to his father, and discouraged his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]] interprets Tiberius' repeated refusal of provincial cult as a shirking of his moral responsibilities to empire, and therefore a dishonour to his high office and Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; After much wrangling, he allowed a single temple in [[Smyrna]] to himself and the ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Senate in 26 AD; eleven cities had competed – with some vehemence and even violence – for the honour.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 15: the collective ''genius'' of the Senate was usually personified as a bearded, elderly man – this is an exceptional ''genius'' type. Most individual ''genii'' are portrayed as youthful.&lt;/ref&gt; His lack of personal ''[[auctoritas]]'' allowed increasing praetorian influence over the Imperial house, the senate and through it, the state.&lt;ref&gt;Klose, in Howgego ''et al'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 31 AD, his praetorian prefect [[Sejanus]] – by now a virtual co-ruler – was implicated in the death of Tiberius' son and heir apparent [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], and was executed as a public enemy. In Umbria, the Imperial cult priest (''[[Sodales Augustales|sevir Augustalis]]'') memorialised "the providence of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, born for the eternity of the Roman name, upon the removal of that most pernicious enemy of the Roman people". In Crete, thanks were given to "the ''[[numen]]'' and foresight of Tiberius Caesar Augustus and the Senate" in foiling the conspiracy – but at his death, the senate and his heir [[Caligula]] chose not to officially deify him.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, 170-1: see also 170, note 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caligula]]'s rule exposed the legal and moral contradictions of the Augustan "Republic". To legalise his succession, the Senate was compelled to constitutionally define his role, but the rites and sacrifices to the living ''genius'' of the emperor already acknowledged his constitutionally unlimited powers. The ''princeps'' played the role of "[[primus inter pares]]" only through personal self-restraint and decorum. It became evident that Caligula had little of either. He seems to have taken the cult of his own ''genius'' very seriously, and is said to have enjoyed acting the god – or rather, several of them. However, his infamous and oft-cited impersonations of major deities may represent no more than his priesthood of their cults, a desire to shock and a penchant for triumphal dress&lt;ref&gt;cf Caesar's "kingly" regalia, though as ''princeps'' Caligula was also "permanent ''triumphator''".&lt;/ref&gt; or simply mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Life of Caligula''&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever his plans, there is no evidence for his official cult as a living ''divus'' in Rome or his replacement of state gods, and none for major deviations or innovations in his provincial cult.&lt;ref&gt;Neither [[Josephus]] nor [[Philo]] imply Caligula's elevation as a state deity in Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; His reported sexual relations with his sister [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] and her deification after death aroused scorn from later historians; after Caligula's death, her cult was simply allowed to fade. His reported compulsion of priesthood fees from unwilling senators are marks of private cult and personal humiliations among the elite. Caligula's fatal offense was to willfully "insult or offend everyone who mattered", including the senior military officers who assassinated him.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 142–158.&lt;/ref&gt; The histories of his reign highlight his wayward impiety. Perhaps not only his: in 40 AD the Senate decreed that the "emperor should sit on a high platform even in the very senate house".&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, (in [[John Xiphilinus]]' epitome), 59, 26, 3. Both [[Suetonius]] and Philo offer Caligula as a suspiciously perfect example of how not to be emperor. The Senate remains a vague figure of superior values and morality, against which Caligula's offenses are meticulously detailed.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius (his successor and uncle) intervened to limit the damage to the imperial house and those who had conspired against it, and had Caligula's public statues discreetly removed.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html LX.3.5–6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CdM, apoteosi di claudio, sardonice attr. a skylax, roma, 54 dc. circa.JPG|thumb|[[Cameo (carving)|Cameo]] depicting the apotheosis of Claudius (mid-1st century CE)]]
[[Claudius]] was chosen emperor by Caligula's praetorians and consolidated his position with cash payments (''[[donativa]]'') to the military. The senate were forced to ratify the choice and accept the affront. Claudius adopted the cognomen Caesar, deified Augustus' wife, Livia, 13 years after her death and in 42 AD was granted the title ''pater patriae'' (father of the fatherland) but relations between emperor and Senate seem to have been irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;A cult dedication to Livia as ''diva'' Augusta appears in [[Lusitania]], dated to 48 AD.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius showed none of Caligula's excesses. He seems to have entirely refused a cult to his own ''genius'': but the offer of cult simultaneously acknowledged the high status of those empowered to grant it and the extraordinary status of the ''princeps'' – Claudius' repeated refusals may have been interpreted as offensive to Senate, provincials and the imperial office itself. He further offended the traditional hierarchy by promoting his own trusted [[freedmen]] as imperial [[Procurator (Roman)|procurators]]: those closest to the Emperor held high status through their proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel proposes that had Claudius employed those of higher rank within his ''[[domus]]'', it would have imputed their clientage as his servants. He may have underestimated the complexity of the problems inherent in his own status as ''princeps''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been assumed that he allowed a single temple for his cult in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], following his conquest there.&lt;ref&gt;This surmise is based on a combination of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s satirical ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'', Suetonius' sneering "Life" and Tacitus's sharp observations of Julio-Claudian failings.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is certain – it was sited at [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), the main ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' in the province, and was a focus of British wrath during the [[Boudicca]]n revolt of 60 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals, 13, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But cult to the living Claudius there is very unlikely: he had already refused Alexandrine cult honours as "vulgar" and impious and cult to living emperors was associated with ''arae'' (altars), not temples.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol. 3, 1, 75–6: cf the [[Lyons Tablet]] and Claudius' modesty (or fear of seeming arrogant).&lt;/ref&gt; The British worship offered him as a living ''divus'' is probably no more than a cruel literary judgment on his worth as emperor. Despite his evident respect for Republican norms he was not taken seriously by his own class, and in Seneca's fawning Neronian fiction, the Roman gods cannot take him seriously as a ''divus'' – the wild British might be more gullible.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, 81-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, they proved resentful enough to rebel, though probably less against the Claudian ''divus'' than against brutal abuses and the financial burden represented by its temple.

Claudius died in 54 AD and was deified by his adopted son and successor [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol. 3, 1, 54–9.&lt;/ref&gt; After an apparently magnificent funeral, the ''divus'' Claudius was given a temple on Rome's disreputable [[Caelian Hill|Mons Caelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Mons Caelus had "ambiguous Etruscan connections" (Claudius had a historian's interest in Etruscan culture and language). It was also notorious for its brothels and meat-market. Claudius had a reputed liking for "low company", and butchers and prostitutes were classified as ''[[Infamia|infames]]''. Suetonius has Claudius add an extra day to the festival of [[Saturnalia]] – for Seneca he is a [[Lord of Misrule]], at whose demise it can be said: "I told you the Saturnalia could not last forever" (''Apocolocyntosis'' 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Fishwick remarks that "the malicious humour of the site can hardly have been lost by those in the know... the location of Claudius' temple in Britain (the occasion for his "pathetic triumph") may be more of the same".&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol. 3, 1, 88–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in power, [[Nero]] allowed Claudius' cult to lapse, built his [[Domus Aurea]] over the unfinished temple, indulged his sybaritic and artistic inclinations and allowed the cult of his own ''genius'' as ''[[paterfamilias]]'' of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Claudius' Caelian temple was later rebuilt and some of it survives through incorporation in later building. Nero's cult may have been justified as a "revival" of Claudius' entitlement to ''genius'' cult as ''pater patriae''.&lt;/ref&gt; Senatorial attitudes to him appear to have been largely negative. He was overthrown in a military coup, and his institutions of cult to his dead wife Poppaea and infant daughter Claudia Augusta were abandoned. Otherwise, he seems to have been a popular emperor, particularly in the Eastern provinces. Tacitus reports a senatorial proposal to dedicate a temple to Nero as a living ''divus'', taken as ominous because "divine honours are not paid to an emperor till he has ceased to live among men".&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#74|XV.74]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavian===
[[File:Genius Domitian Musei Capitolini MC1130.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Genius'' of Domitian, with [[aegis]] and [[cornucopia]], found near the [[Via Labicana]], [[Esquiline]]]]
Nero's death saw the end of imperial tenure as a privilege of ancient Roman (patrician and senatorial) families. In a single chaotic year, power passed violently from one to another of [[Year of the Four Emperors|four emperors]]. The first three promoted their own ''genius'' cult: the last two of these attempted Nero's restitution and promotion to ''divus''. The fourth, [[Vespasian]] – son of an equestrian from [[Reate]] – secured his [[Flavian dynasty]] through reversion to an Augustan form of [[principate]] and renewed the imperial cult of ''divus Julius''.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Scott, ''The Imperial Cult Under the Flavians'', New York 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Vespasian was respected for his "restoration" of Roman tradition and the Augustan modesty of his reign. He dedicated state cult to ''genio populi Romani'' (the ''genius'' of the Roman people), respected senatorial "Republican" values and repudiated Neronian practice by removing various festivals from the public calendars, which had (in Tacitus' unsparing assessment) become "foully sullied by the flattery of the times".&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Histories, 4.40.2&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have had the head of Nero's Colossus replaced or recut for its dedication (or rededication) to the [[Helios|sun god]] in 75 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Some still thought the head resembled Nero's. Others were reminded of [[Titus]], Vespasian's son: see also Cassius Dio, 65.15.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A dedication of the Colossus to the sun god is consistent with Neronian iconography – any resemblance to Nero would be appropriate to his imperial representation as the "second sun" of the ''[[pax Romana]]'' in [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] cosmology. Subsequent alterations or remodeling of a recognisable figure – assuming they happened at all – and rededication were standard responses to an original subject's ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. On the other hand, the heads of some Imperial statues appear to have been recut or replaced as a matter of economy, rather than of legal or moral insult or effacement.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, E. (2006), "Framing the sun: the Arch of Constantine and the Roman cityscape." ''The Art Bulletin''&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] and the destruction of the [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 70 AD, he imposed the [[Fiscus Judaicus|''didrachmon'']], formerly paid by Jews for their Temple's upkeep but now re-routed to Jupiter Capitolinus as victor over them "and their God". Jews who paid the tax were exempt from the cult to imperial state deities. Those who offered it however were ostracised from their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Vespasian appears to have approached his own impending cult with dry humour – according to [[Suetonius]], his last words were ''puto deus fio'' ("I think I'm turning into a god"). Vespasian's son [[Titus]] reigned for two successful years then died of natural causes. He was deified and replaced by his younger brother, Domitian.

Within two weeks of accession, [[Domitian]] had restored the cult of the ruling emperor's ''genius''.&lt;ref&gt;The practice of a ''genius'' cult towards Domitian is shown in the Arval Acts.&lt;/ref&gt; He remains a controversial figure, described as one of the very few emperors to scandalously style himself a living ''divus'', as evidenced by the use of "master and god" (''dominus et deus'') in imperial documents. However, there are no records of Domitian's personal use of the title, its use in official address or cult to him, its presence on his coinage or in the Arval Acts relating to his state cult. It occurs only in his later reign and was almost certainly initiated and used by his own procurators (who in the Claudian tradition were also his freedmen).&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 159-61: Suetonius' claims for Domitian's personal use of the title – or its use by his procurators at his behest – are unverified. He is clear that Domitian's freedmen were the first to use it.&lt;/ref&gt; Like any other ''paterfamilias'' and [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]], Domitian was "master and god" to his extended ''familia'', including his slaves, freedmen and clients. Pliny's descriptions of sacrifice to Domitian on the Capitol are consistent with the entirely unremarkable "private and informal" rites accorded to living emperors. Domitian was a traditionalist, severe and repressive but respected by the military and the general populace. He admired Augustus and may have sought to emulate him, but made the same tactless error as Caligula in treating the Senate as clients and inferiors, rather than as the fictive equals required by Augustan ideology. His assassination was planned and implemented from within his court, and his name officially but rather unsystematically erased from inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 159-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nervan-Antonine===
The Senate chose the elderly, childless and apparently reluctant [[Nerva]] as emperor. Nerva had long-standing family and consular connections with the Julio-Claudian and Flavian families, but proved a dangerously mild and indecisive ''princeps'': he was persuaded to abdicate in favour of [[Trajan]]. [[Pliny the Younger]]'s [[panegyric]] of 100 AD claims the visible restoration of senatorial authority and dignity throughout the empire under [[Trajan]], but while he praises the emperor's modesty, Pliny does not disguise the precarious nature of this autocratic gift.&lt;ref&gt;Ando, 167: Pliny ''panegyric'' 75.1–3: Pliny refers to the publication of the senatorial voice in proceedings: Trajan's respect for the Senate can only be good for the "dignity" of the state.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Trajan's very capable civil and military leadership, the office of emperor was increasingly interpreted as an earthly viceregency of the divine order. He would prove an enduring model for Roman imperial virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 190-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sage, (in discussion of Tacitean themes) in Haase &amp; Temporini (eds), 950: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3O8fO_5oZGgC&amp;pg=PA950&amp;lpg=PA950&amp;dq=%22Panegyric+of+Pliny%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0oKHmsE_WZ&amp;sig=NWt0jNFdrMP4GMJlV8JfpXosSyg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jzNFSsTHNpaRjAfwm4Fl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor [[Hadrian]]'s Hispano-Roman origins and marked pro-Hellenism changed the focus of imperial cult. His standard coinage still identifies with the ''genius populi Romani'', but other issues stress his identification with ''Hercules Gaditanus'' (Hercules of [[Cádiz|Gades]]), and Rome's imperial protection of Greek civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 194-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorative coinage shows him "raising up" provincial deities (thus elevating and "restoring" the provinces); he promoted [[Sagalassos]] in Greek [[Pisidia]] as the Empire's leading Imperial cult centre and in 131–2 AD he sponsored the exclusively Greek ''[[Panhellenion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Howgego, in Howgego ''et al'', 6, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have "wept like a woman" at the death of his young companion [[Antinous]], and arranged his apotheosis. Dio claims that Hadrian was held to ridicule for this emotional indulgence, particularly as he had delayed the apotheosis of his own sister [[Paulina#Sister of Hadrian|Paulina]] after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Hadrian's "Hellenic" emotionalism finds a culturally sympathetic echo in the Homeric Achilles' mourning for his friend Patroclus: see Vout, 52–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antinous Dionysos Terme.jpg|thumb|upright|Antinous portrayed as Dionysus in a relief from the area between [[Anzio]] et [[Lanuvium]]]]
The cult of [[Antinous]] would prove one of remarkable longevity and devotion, particularly in the Eastern provinces. Bithynia, as his birthplace, featured his image on coinage as late as the reign of [[Caracalla]] (r. 211–217). His popular cult appears to have thrived well into the 4th century, when he became the "whipping boy of pagan worship" in Christian polemic. [[Caroline Vout|Vout]] (2007) remarks his humble origins, untimely death and "resurrection" as ''theos'', and his identification – and sometimes misidentification by later scholarship – with the images and religious functions of Apollo, Dionysius/Bacchus, and later, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Dio – or his [[epitome|epitomist]] – insists that Antinous died not through drowning, as Hadrian claimed, but as the emperor's willing sacrificial victim as part of a bid for immortality – though whose is not clear.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome itself he was also ''theos'' on two of three surviving inscriptions but was more closely associated with hero-cult, which allowed direct appeals for his intercession with "higher gods".&lt;ref&gt;Vout, 118-9, ''contra'' Price, 68, who does not regard Antinous as receiving full cult honours of apotheosis in Rome itself. Both agree that Antinous was unlikely to have had official parity with other imperial ''divi'' in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vout, 52–135, offers discussion on the nature, context and longevity of the Antinous cult, its function in Christian polemic against pagan cult, notably in [[Athanasius]], and its capacity to fascinate – and sometimes mislead – the modern imagination. Limited preview available: [https://books.google.com/books?id=icxZpoRE-RIC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Antinous+Imperial+cult&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cCBCbstFq9&amp;sig=gviv4vygM6weJjz2giEwugP-JNA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sik2SpjxG9yNjAesyfGXCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA121,M1 Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian imposed the imperial cult to himself and Jupiter in Judaea following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. He was predeceased by his wife [[Vibia Sabina]]. Both were deified but Hadrian's case had to be pleaded by his successor [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref&gt;Vout, 111. His piety lay in his unrelenting yet personally modest plea to the Senate for the deification of his predecessor Hadrian: morally comparable with the filial devotion of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Metellus Pius]] during the Republican era.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Aurelius]]' tutor [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] offers the best evidence of imperial portraiture as a near-ubiquitous feature of private and public life.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 200, citing Fronto, ''Epistulae ad M. Caesar'' (letters to M. Aurelius), 4, 12, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Though evidence for private emperor worship is as sparse in this era as in all others, Fronto's letters imply the ''genius'' cult of the living emperor as an official, domestic and personal practice, probably more common than cult to the ''divi'' in this and other periods.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 199: see also [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#The context and precedents for Imperial Cult|The context and precedents for Imperial Cult]]. Relative to the living emperor, the ''divi'' probably have little or no personal power, unless of divine intercession.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus' son [[Commodus]] succumbed to the lures of self-indulgence, easy populism and rule by favourites.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 78-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio's assessment is blunt but not entirely unsympathetic – Commodus was lazy, gullible and stupid. See Potter, 85-6: citing Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html Penelope.Uchicago.edu], epitome of book 73. Marius Maximus thought him fundamentally wicked and cruel.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his reign as a "golden age", and himself as a new Romulus and "re-founder" of Rome, but was deeply antagonistic toward the Senate – he reversed the standard "Republican" imperial formula to ''populus senatusque romanus'' (the people and senate of Rome). He increasingly identified himself with the demigod Hercules in statuary, temples and in the arena, where he liked to entertain as a ''bestiarius'' in the morning and a gladiator in the afternoon. In the last year of his life he was voted the official title ''[[Hercules in ancient Rome|Romanus Hercules]]''; the state cult to Hercules acknowledged him as heroic, a divinity or semi-divinity (but not a ''divus'') who had once been mortal.&lt;ref&gt;On 1 January 193 AD, the legions unwittingly renewed their annual vows of loyalty to a dead Emperor: Potter, 92-6. see also Dio ''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; Commodus may have intended declaring himself as a living god some time before his murder on the last day of 192 AD.&lt;ref&gt;This is based on a statement in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', which claims he planned to have his own ''flamen'' while still living. Cassius Dio, in an otherwise detailed account, makes no mention of this. See Gradel, 160-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nervan-Antonine dynasty ended in chaos. The senate declared ''damnatio memoriae'' on Commodus, whose [[urban prefect]] [[Pertinax]] was declared Emperor by the Praetorian Guard in return for the promise of very large [[Donativum|donative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 93-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinax had risen through equestrian ranks by military talent and administrative efficiency to become senator, consul and finally and briefly Emperor; he was murdered by his Praetorians for attempting to cap their pay.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 75-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinax was replaced by [[Didius Julianus]], who had promised cash to the Praetorians and restoration of power to the Senate. Julianus began his reign with an ill-judged appeal to the memory of Commodus, a much resented attempt to bribe the populace ''en masse'' and the use of Praetorian force against them. In protest, a defiant urban crowd occupied the senatorial seats at the ''[[Circus Maximus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 96–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Against a background of civil war among [[Year of the Five Emperors|competing claimants]] in the provinces, [[Septimius Severus]] emerged as a likely victor. The Senate soon voted for the death of Julianus, the deification of Pertinax and the elevation of Septimius as Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a year had passed since the death of Commodus.

===Severan===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Sit divus dum non sit vivus" (let him be a ''divus'' as long as he is not alive). ''Attributed to Caracalla, before murdering his co-emperor and brother Geta.''&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 265, citing the unreliable ''Historia Augusta'', ''Antoninus Geta Aeli Spartiani'', II, 8: (Latin version online at thelatinlibrary – [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sha/geta.shtml TheLatinLibrary.com] (accessed 18 August 2009). At the very least, the attribution confirms the later devaluation of ''divus'' as a divine category.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.]]

In 193 AD, [[Septimius Severus]] [[Roman triumph|triumphally]] entered Rome and gave apotheosis to [[Pertinax]]. He cancelled the Senate's ''damnatio memoriae'' of [[Commodus]], deified him as a ''frater'' (brother) and thereby adopted Marcus Aurelius as his own ancestor through an act of filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, ''Ibid''. 77.9.4: (Loeb) – "When the emperor was enrolled in the family of Marcus, Auspex said: "I congratulate you, Caesar, upon finding a father," implying that up to that time he had been fatherless by reason of his obscure birth."&lt;/ref&gt; Severan coin images further re-enforced Septimius' association with prestigious Antonine dynasts and the ''genius populi Romani''.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 107-12: for coinage of Antonine dynasts, see 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Septimius' reign represents a watershed in relations between Senate, Emperors, and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Senatorial consent defined divine ''imperium'' as a Republican permission for the benefit of the Roman people, and apotheosis was a statement of senatorial powers. Where Vespasian had secured his position with appeals to the ''genius'' of the Senate and Augustan tradition, Septimius overrode the customary preferment of senators to senior military office. He increased plebeian privilege in Rome, stationed a loyal garrison there and selected his own commanders. He paid personal attention to the provinces, as sources of revenue, military manpower and unrest. Following his defeat of his rival [[Clodius Albinus]] at Lugdunum, he re-founded and reformed its imperial cult centre: ''dea Roma'' was removed from the altar and confined to the temple along with the deified Augusti.&lt;ref&gt;Another name for the Imperial ''divi'', which indicates their elevation to "August" status. "Caesar Augustus" is reserved for living emperors: See Gradel, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Fishwick interprets the obligatory new rites as those due any ''paterfamilias'' from his inferiors.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol. 3, 1, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Septimius' own patron deities, [[Melqart]]/Hercules and [[Liber]]/[[Dionysus|Bacchus]], took pride of place with himself and his two sons at the Saecular Games of 204 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 113-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Septimius died of natural causes in 211 AD at [[Eboracum]] (modern York) while on campaign in Britannia, after leaving the Empire equally to [[Caracalla]] and his older brother [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]], along with advice to "be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, and scorn all other men."&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/77*.html 77.15.2 Penelope.Uchicago.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 212 AD, Caracalla had murdered Geta, pronounced his ''damnatio memoriae'' and issued the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'': this gave full Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 133-5: ''dediticii'' (those who had surrendered to Rome in war) and a specific class of freedmen were excluded.&lt;/ref&gt; and was couched as a generous invitation to celebrate the "victory of the Roman people" in foiling Geta's "conspiracy". In reality, Caracalla was faced by an endemic shortfall of cash and recruits. His "gift" was a far from popular move, as most of its recipients were ''humiliores'' of peasant status and occupation – approximately 90% of the total population. ''Humiliores'' they remained, but now liable to pay taxes, serve in the legions and adopt the name of their "liberator". Where other emperors had employed the ''mos maiorum'' of family obligation at the largely symbolic level of ''genius'' cult, Caracalla literally identified his personal survival with the state and "his" citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 138-9: slaves formally adopted the name of the master who freed them.&lt;/ref&gt; Caracalla inherited the devotion of his father's soldiery but his new citizens were not inclined to celebrate and his attempts to court popularity in Commodan style seem to have misfired.&lt;ref&gt;Like Commodus, he participated in [[Chariot racing|chariot races]] and beast-fights, with minimal risk to himself.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Philostratus#Philostratus II|Philostratus]]' estimation, his embrace of Empire foundered on his grudging, parochial mindset. He was assassinated in 217 AD, with the possible collusion of his praetorian prefect [[Macrinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 142-6: citing Philostratus, V. Soph, 626.&lt;/ref&gt;

The military hailed Macrinus as ''imperator'', and he arranged for the apotheosis of Caracalla. Aware of the impropriety of his unprecedented leap through the traditional ''[[cursus honorum]]'' from equestrian to Emperor, he respectfully sought senatorial approval for his "self-nomination". It was granted – the new emperor had a lawyer's approach to ''imperium''&lt;ref&gt;Days of careful negotiation had preceded his "spontaneous" acclamation as ''imperator'' by the military&lt;/ref&gt; but his foreign policy proved too cautious and placatory for the military.&lt;ref&gt;Dio disapproves of Macrinus' equestrian status, but not his integrity or manner of government.&lt;/ref&gt; After little more than a year, he was murdered in a coup and replaced with an emperor of Syrian background and Severan descent, [[Elagabalus|Varius Avitus Bassianus]], more usually known by the Latinised name of his god and his priesthood, [[Elagabalus]].&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 146-8: Avitus took the Imperial name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14-year-old emperor brought his solar-mountain deity from his native [[Emesa]] to Rome and into official imperial cult.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 148-9:&lt;/ref&gt; In Syria, the cult of Elagabalus was popular and well established. In Rome, it was a foreign and (according to some ancient sources) disgusting Eastern novelty. In 220 AD, the priest Elagabalus replaced Jupiter with the god Elagabalus as ''[[sol invictus]]'' (the unconquered Sun) and thereafter neglected his Imperial role as ''[[pontifex maximus]]''. According to Marius Maximus, he ruled from his degenerate ''domus'' through prefects who included among others a charioteer, a locksmith, a barber, and a cook.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 152-7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, he appears to have been regarded as an unacceptably effete eccentric by the Senate and military alike. He was assassinated by the Praetorians at the age of 18, subjected to the fullest indignities of ''damnatio memoriae'' and replaced with his young cousin [[Alexander Severus]], the last of his dynasty, who reigned for 13 years until killed in a mutiny.

==Imperial crisis and the Dominate==
''This section provides an overview of developments most relevant to cult: for a full listing of Emperors by name and date, see [[List of Roman Emperors]].''

The end of the Severan dynasty marked the [[Crisis of the Third Century|breakdown of central ''imperium'']]. Against a background of economic [[hyperinflation]] and latterly, endemic plague, rival provincial claimants fought for supremacy and failing this, set up their own provincial Empires. Most Emperors seldom even saw Rome, and had only notional relationships with their senates. In the absence of coordinated Imperial military response, foreign peoples seized the opportunity for invasion and plunder.

[[Maximinus Thrax]] (reigned 235–8 AD) sequestered the resources of state temples in Rome to pay his armies. The temples of the ''divi'' were first in line. It was an unwise move for his own posterity, as the grant or withholding of apotheosis remained an official judgment of Imperial worthiness, but the stripping of the temples of state gods caused far greater offense. Maximinus's actions more likely show need in extreme crisis than impiety, as he had his wife deified on her death&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, in ''De Imperatoribus Romanis'', online [http://www.roman-emperors.org/maxthrax.htm Roman-Emperors.org] (accessed 7 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but in a rare display of defiance the senate deified his murdered predecessor, then openly rebelled.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 356-62: citing Herodian for the removal of temple wealth and reactions to it.&lt;/ref&gt; His replacement, [[Claudius Gothicus]], reigned briefly but successfully and was made a ''divus'' on his death. A succession of short-lived soldier-emperors followed. Further development in imperial cult appears to have stalled until [[Philip the Arab]], who dedicated a statue to his father as divine in his home town of [[Shahba|Philippopolis]] and brought the body of his young predecessor [[Gordian III]] to Rome for apotheosis. Coins of Philip show him in the radiate [[solar crown]] (suggestive of solar cult or a hellenised form of imperial monarchy), with Rome's temple to Venus and ''dea Roma'' on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 237-8, citing Zosimus, 1.19.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 249 AD, Philip was succeeded (or murdered and usurped) by his praetorian prefect [[Decius]], a traditionalist ex-consul and governor. After an accession of doubtful validity, Decius justified himself as rightful "restorer and saviour" of Empire and its ''religio'': early in his reign he issued a coin series of imperial ''divi'' in radiate (solar) crowns.&lt;ref&gt;Howgego, in Howgego ''et al''., 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip, the three [[Gordian (disambiguation)|Gordian]]s, Pertinax and Claudius were omitted, presumably because Decius thought them unworthy of the honour.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 244-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ando, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of religious riots in Egypt, he decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to "ancestral gods" or suffer a penalty: sacrifice on Rome's bahalf by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', Vol. 1, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Jews were exempt from this obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 241-3: see 242 for Decian "libellus" (certificate) of oath and sacrifice on papyrus, dated to 250 AD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Decian edict required that refusal of sacrifice be tried and punished at [[proconsul]]ar level. [[Apostasy]] was sought, rather than capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EgCRHxfouQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Diocletian+Imperial+cult&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7_IdIU_pqN&amp;sig=UDSeRqdJLL5vX2gbIktCTtx58Bc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SLN8SqW5EonE-QaVm-1J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocletian%20Imperial%20cult&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Rees, 60.

[[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] (253–60) identified Christianity as the largest, most stubbornly self-interested of non-Roman cults, outlawed Christian assembly and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome's traditional gods.&lt;ref name="Rees, 60"&gt;Rees, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; His son and co-Augustus [[Gallienus]], an initiate of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], identified himself with traditional Roman gods and the virtue of military loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Drinkwater, in Bowman et al. (eds), 46: Under Gallienus, any remaining senatorial rights to military leadership were virtually at an end. The bitterness of the senatorial class towards him on this account almost certainly distorts their histories. See, for example, [[Aurelius Victor]], ''De Caesaribus'' (epitome), 33–34, in Banchich's translation online at [http://www.roman-emperors.org/epitome.htm Roman-emperors.org] (accessed 7 August 2009.) See also Weigel,  at www.roman-emperors.org [http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallval.htm Roman-Emperors.org] (accessed 7 August 2009.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurelian]] (270–75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (''concordia militum''), stabilised the Empire and its borders and established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] ''[[Sol Invictus]]'' in Rome's [[Campus Martius]]. The senate hailed him as ''restitutor orbis'' (restorer of the world) and ''deus et dominus natus'' (god and born ruler); he was murdered by his Praetorians. His immediate successors consolidated his achievements: coinage of  [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] (276–82) shows him in radiate solar crown, and his prolific variety of coin types include issues showing the temple of Venus and ''Dea Roma'' in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, in Bowman et al. (eds), 171: citing .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also (with due caveat) ''Historia Augusta'', ''Vita Taciti'', XIII 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies and preoccupations culminated in [[Diocletian]]'s [[Tetrarchy]]: the empire was divided into Western and Eastern administrative blocs, each with an Augustus (senior emperor), helped by a Caesar (junior emperor) as Augustus-in-waiting. Provinces were divided and subdivided: their imperial bureaucracy became extraordinary in size, scope and attention to detail. Diocletian was a religious conservative. On his accession in AD 284, he held games in honour of the ''divus'' [[Antinous]].&lt;ref&gt;Vout, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Where his predecessors had attempted the persuasion and coercion of recalcitrant sects, Diocletian launched a series of ferocious reactions known in Church history as the [[Great Persecution]]. According to [[Lactantius]], this began with a report of ominous [[haruspicy]] in Diocletian's ''domus'' and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, II.6.10.1–4&lt;/ref&gt; A date of 302 is regarded as likely and [[Eusebius]] also says the persecutions of Christians began in the army.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, II.8.1.8.&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Maximilian of Tebessa|Maximilian]]'s martyrdom (295) came from his refusal of military service, and [[Marcellus of Tangier|Marcellus]]' (298) for renouncing his military oath. Legally, these were military insurrections and Diocletian's edict may have followed these and similar acts of conscience and faith.&lt;ref name="Rees, 60"/&gt; An unknown number of Christians appear to have suffered the extreme and exemplary punishments traditionally reserved for rebels and traitors.

Under Diocletian's expanded imperial ''collegia'', imperial honours distinguished both Augusti from their Caesares, and Diocletian (as senior Augustus) from his colleague [[Maximian]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman et al, 170-3.&lt;/ref&gt; While the division of empire and ''imperium'' seemed to offer the possibility of a peaceful and well-prepared succession, its unity required the highest investiture of power and status in one man. An elaborate choreography of etiquette surrounded the approach to the imperial person and imperial progressions. The senior Augustus in particular was made a separate and unique being, accessible only through those closest to him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 46–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venice – The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb|The near identical official images of the collegial Imperial Tetrarchs conceal Diocletian's seniority and the internal stresses of his empire.]]
Diocletian's avowed conservatism almost certainly precludes a systematic design toward personal elevation as a "divine monarch". Rather, he formally elaborated imperial ceremony as a manifestation of the divine order of empire and elevated emperorship as the supreme instrument of the divine will. The idea was Augustan, or earlier, expressed most clearly in Stoic philosophy and the solar cult, especially under Aurelian. At the very beginning of his reign, before his Tetrarchy, Diocletian had adopted the ''[[Wikt:signum|signum]]'' of ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jovius]]''; his co-Augustus adopted the title ''[[Hercules|Herculius]]''. During the Tetrarchy, such titles were multiplied, but with no clear reflection of implicit divine seniority: in one case, the divine ''signum'' of the Augustus is inferior to that of his Caesar. These divine associations may have followed a military precedent of emperors as ''[[comes]]'' to divinities (or divinities as ''comes'' to emperors). Moreover, the divine ''signum'' appears in the fairly narrow context of court panegyric and civil etiquette. It makes no appearance on the general coinage or stauary of the Tetrarchs, who are presented as impersonal, near-homogenous abstractions of imperial might and unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 51–56 (ideology) &amp; 73-4 (coin image interpretation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack, 722, &amp; note 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and precedents==
The [[Augustus#Octavian becomes Augustus|Augustan settlement]] was promoted by its contemporary apologists as restorative and conservative rather than revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 49–51. See also Augustus, Res Gestae, c.4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Official cult to the ''genius'' of the living [[princeps]] as "first among equals" recognised his exceptional powers, his capacity for self-restraint, and his pious respect for Republican traditions. "Good" emperors rejected offers of official cult as a living deity, and accepted the more modest honour of ''genius'' cult. Claims that later emperors sought and obtained divine honours in Rome reflect their bad relationship with their senates: in Tertullian's day, it was still "a curse to name the emperor a god before his death". On the other hand, to judge from the domestic ubiquity of the emperor's image, private cults to living emperors are as likely in Rome as elsewhere. As Gradel observes, no Roman was ever prosecuted for sacrificing to his emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol. 3, 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 263-8: citing Tertullian.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Divus'', ''deus'' and the ''numen''===
[[File:Bauinschrift, CIL XIV, 04319, Forum der Korporationen.jpg|thumb|Dedicatory inscription (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 14.04319) to the "''numen'' of the House of the Augustus", from [[Ostia Antica]]]]
The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divi]]'' had some form of precedent in the [[parentalia|''di parentes'']], divine ancestors who received ancestral rites as ''[[manes]]'' (gods of the underworld) during the [[Parentalia]] and other important domestic festivals. Their powers were limited; deceased mortals not normally possess the divine power (''[[numen]]'') of the higher gods.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 7: ''numen'' "can also be synonymous with ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus|deus]]''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 3, 1, 42: see also Plutarch (based on Varro, ''Quaestionaes Romanae'', 14).&lt;/ref&gt; Deceased emperors did not automatically become ''divi''; they must be nominated for the privilege. Their case was discussed by the senate, then put to the vote.&lt;ref&gt;The apotheosed ("deified") Julius Caesar was "translated by the senate and people of Rome into the company of the gods ''(dei)''" and became the ''divus Julius'': Price, in Cannadine and Price, 1992, 77–8: the cited, translated inscription is from ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'', ed H, Dessau, 3 vols, Berlin, 1892–1916, 140. 7–24 (Pisa).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, in Cannadine and Price, 82–102, for the changing roles of senate and emperors in the granting of apotheosis.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the correct rituals and sacrifice were offered, the ''divus'' would be received by the heavenly gods  as a ''coelicola'' (a dweller in heaven), a lesser being than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Arce, in Theuws and Nelson, pp.116 - 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief held that the ''divus'' Augustus would be personally welcomed by Jupiter. In Seneca's ''Apocolocyntosis'', on the other hand, the unexpected arrival of the divinised Claudius creates a problem for the Olympians, who have no idea who or what he is; and when they find out, they cannot think what to do with him. Seneca's sarcastic wit, an unacceptable impiety towards a ''deus'', freely portrays the ''divus'' Claudius as just a dead, ridiculous and possibly quite bad emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Though their images were sacrosanct and their rites definitively divine&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0iXiIenuU4C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Julian+Imperial+cult&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8wfZ9Wt-g1&amp;sig=xd7p7RaZF3eJlZcvh1l_jtjl-U4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WmmFSt2CEtPLjAfPsLWiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Julian%20Imperial%20cult&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Price, 175–202, 209: later Roman ''divi'' range from "dead but not guilty emperor" to "emperor of fond memory".&lt;/ref&gt; ''divi'' could be created, unmade, reinstated or simply forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Holland's 1606 English language version of Suetonius' ''Lives of the Caesars (Claudius)'' translates Claudius as "canonised... a saint in heaven". Holland's interpretation is consistent with the later use of ''divus'' under Christian emperors: saints function as intercessors but some have also been demoted or quietly lapsed from their religious calendars. See Suetonius, ''History of the twelve Caesars'', trans. Philemon Holland, 1606, for Holland's English rendition of ''divus Claudius'', [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftwelvec02suetuoft/historyoftwelvec02suetuoft_djvu.txt Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus and Trajan appear to have remained the ideals for longer than any, and cult to "good" ''divi'' appears to have lasted well into the late Imperial dominate.

The immense power of living emperors, on the other hand, was mediated through the encompassing agency of the state. Once acknowledged as ''paterfamilias'' to an Empire, a princeps was naturally entitled to ''genius'' cult from Imperial subjects of all classes. Cult to a living emperor's ''numen'' was quite another matter and might be interpreted as no less than a statement of divine monarchy. Imperial responses to the first overtures of cult to the August ''numen'' were therefore extremely cautious.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', 207: see above for Augustus' permission for cult to his own ''numen'' only very late in his reign. Whether it was official cult is uncertain, but it would have been offered and permitted, not claimed. Fishwick (2007) asserts that inscriptional references to ''numen'', connected to the living Augustus and his cult, as at [[Narbo]] in 12 BC, imply it as a property of the emperor, a "divinised abstraction", not identical with his person.&lt;/ref&gt; Only much later, probably in consequence of the hyperinflation of honours to living Emperors, could a living emperor be openly, formally addressed as ''numen praesens'' (the numinous presence).&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol.3, 1, 198, referring to the Severan emperor Caracalla.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obscure relationship between [[deus]], [[divus]] and [[numen]] in Imperial cult might simply reflect its origins as a pragmatic, respectful and somewhat evasive Imperial solution using broad terminology whose meanings varied according to context. For Beard ''et al.'', a practicable and universal Roman cult of deified emperors and others of the Imperial house must have hinged on the paradox that a mortal might, like the semi-divine "heroic" figures of Hercules, Aeneas and Romulus, possess or acquire sufficient measure of ''numen'' to rise above their mortal condition and be in the company of the gods, yet remain mortal in the eyes of Roman traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', vol 1, 140–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sacrificium''===
:''For general context, see [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|Religion in ancient Rome]]''
[[File:Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice - Arch of Marcus Aurelius - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marcus Aurelius]] as pontifex offers sacrifice to Jupiter Capitolinus in gratitude for victory. Once part of the Arch of Marcus Aurelius. [[Capitoline Museum]], Rome.]]
"Sacred offerings" (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacrificium|sacrificium]]'') formed the contract of public and private ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio, religiones|religio]]'', from oaths of office, treaty and loyalty to business contracts and marriage. Participation in ''sacrificium'' acknowledged personal commitment to the broader community and its values, which under Decius became a compulsory observance.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 3, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Livy believed that military and civil disasters were the consequence of error (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium, vitii|vitium]]'') in augury, neglect of due and proper sacrifice and the impious proliferation of "foreign" cults and ''[[superstitio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy,  25.16.1–4 &amp; 6.1.12: Livy wrote at a time of extreme civil strife, during the era of Rome's transformation from Republic to Principate. See also Rosenstein, 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Religious law focused on the sacrificial requirements of particular deities on specific occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', Vol 1, 32–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Julio-Claudian Rome, the [[Arval Brethren|Arval]] priesthood sacrificed to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. On 3 January they consecrated the annual vows: sacrifice promised in the previous year was paid, as long as the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time. If not, it could be withheld, as it was in the annual vow following the death of Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pompeii, the ''genius'' of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practice in Imperial cult at this time, though lesser offerings of wine, cakes and incense were also given, especially in the later Imperial era. The ''divi'' and ''genii'' were offered the same kind of sacrifice as the state gods, but cult officials seem to have offered Christians the possibility of sacrifice to emperors as the lesser act.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 78, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, 209, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augury, ''ira deorum'' and ''pax deorum''===
{{Main|Augur}}
By ancient tradition, presiding magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed actions through an augur, who read the divine will through the observation of natural signs in the sacred space (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|templum]]'') of sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol 1, 12–20: [[Haruspex|haruspicy]] was also used. The Haruspex read the divine will in the sacrificial entrails. This was regarded as an ethnically Etruscan "outsider" practise, whose priesthood was separate from Rome's internal priestly hierarchy. The augur's interpretation of all these signs informed the magistrate's course of action. The magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, abandon the project or seek further consultation with colleagues of his augural college.&lt;/ref&gt; Magistrates could use their right of augury (''ius augurum'') to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 17–20: citing Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', Vol 1, 17–21: most magistracies ran for only a year. Priesthoods were for life, which offered evident advantages in maintaining a high public and political profile.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Republic, augury came under the supervision of the college of ''[[pontifices]]'', a priestly-magistral office whose powers were increasingly woven into the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. The office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' eventually became a ''de facto'' consular office.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 21–25.&lt;/ref&gt; When the consul [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] died, his office as ''pontifex maximus'' passed to Augustus, who took priestly control over the State oracles (including the [[Sibylline books]]), and used his powers as [[Roman censor|censor]] to suppress unapproved oracles.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 59: citing Suetonius, ''Augustus'' 31.1–2. cf official reactions to "foreign cult" during the Punic crises, above.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian's honorific title of Augustus indicated his achievements as expressions of divine will: where the impiety of the Late Republic had provoked heavenly disorder and wrath ''(ira deorum)'', his obedience to divine ordinance brought divine peace ''(pax deorum)''.

===''Genius'' and household cults===
The ''mos maiorum'' established the near-monarchic familial authority of the ordinary ''paterfamilias'' ("the father of the family" or the "owner of the family estate"), his obligations to family and community and his priestly duties to his ''[[lares]]'' and domestic ''[[penates]]''. His position was hereditary and dynastic, unlike the elected, time-limited offices of Republican magistrates. His family – and especially his slaves and freedmen – owed a reciprocal duty of cult to his ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 36-8: the ''paterfamilias'' held – in theory at least, and through ancient right – powers of life and death over every member of his extended ''familia'', including children, slaves and freedmen. In practice, the extreme form of this right was seldom exercised, and was eventually limited by law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Severy, 9–10 for interpretation of the social, economic and religious role of the ''paterfamilias'' within the immediate and extended family and the broader community.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antonius Pius Column Base.JPG|thumb|left|A winged genius raises [[Antoninus Pius]] and his Empress [[Faustina the Elder|Faustina]] in apotheosis, escorted by two [[eagle]]s. From the column-base of Antoninus Pius, Vatican.]]
''Genius'' (pl. ''genii'') was the essential spirit and generative power – depicted as a serpent or as a perennial youth, often winged – within an individual and their clan (''[[gens]]'', pl. ''gentes''), such as  the ''Julli'' (Julians) of Julius Caesar. A ''paterfamilias'' could confer his name, a measure of his ''genius'' and a role in his  household rites, obligations and honours upon those he adopted. As Caesar's adopted heir, Octavian stood to inherit the ''genius'', heritable property and honours of his adoptive father in addition to those obtained through his own birth gens and efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', vol 1, 67–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exceptionally potent ''genius'' of living emperors expressed the will of the gods through Imperial actions.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 5, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 30 BC, libation-offerings to the ''genius'' of Octavian (later Augustus) became a duty at public and private banquets, and from 12 BC, state oaths were sworn by the ''genius'' of the living emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 61: Dio Cassius, 51.19.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman ''paterfamilias'' offered daily cult to his ''lares'' and ''penates'', and to his ''di parentes''/''divi parentes'', in domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; As goddess of all hearths, including the ritual hearth of the State, Vesta connected the "public" and "private" duties of citizens. Her official cults were supervised by the ''pontifex maximus'' from a state-owned house near the temple of Vesta. When Augustus became ''pontifex maximus'' in 12 BC he gave the Vestals his own house on the Palatine. His ''penates'' remained there as its domestic deities, and were soon joined by his ''lares''. His gift therefore tied his domestic cult to the sanctified Vestals and Rome's sacred hearth and symbolically extended his ''domus'' to the state and its inhabitants. He also co-opted and promoted the traditional and predominantly plebeian [[Compitalia]] shrines and extended their festivals, whose Lares were known thereafter as Augusti.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol. 1, 193–4: under Augustus' programme of "renewal" the Vestals had high status seating at games and theatres, and became priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia (wife of Augustus).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Severy, 99–100, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBRN6HW8xEIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=Augustus+Vestals+ Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lott, 14–15, 115 &amp; 230 (note 127).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the military===
[[File:Musei Vaticani - Mithra - Sol invictus 01136.JPG|thumb|right|The cult of [[Mithras]] was gradually absorbed within Imperial solar monism: sol Invictus is to the left of picture. The plaque was commissioned by an evidently wealthy Imperial slave. [[Vatican Museum]].]]
Rome's citizen legionaries appear to have maintained their Marian traditions. They gave cult to Jupiter for the emperor's well-being and regular cult to State, local and personal divinities. Cult to the Imperial person and ''familia'' was generally offered on Imperial accessions, anniversaries and renewal of annual vows: a bust of the ruling emperor was kept in the legionary insignia shrine for the purpose, attended by a designated military ''[[imaginifer]]''. By the time of the early Severans, the legions offered cult to the state gods, the Imperial ''divi'', the current emperor's ''numen'', ''genius'' and ''domus'' (or ''familia''), and special cult to the Empress as "mother of the camp." At around this time, [[Mithras|Mithraic]] cults became very popular with the military, and provided a basis for syncretic Imperial cult which absorbed Mithras into [[Sol Invictus|Solar]] and Stoic [[Monism]] as a focus of military [[Concordia (mythology)|''concordia'']] and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 268-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r2hBqYtZWNEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA249&amp;lpg=RA1-PA249&amp;dq=Hadrian+dominus+noster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iGyQvK9dmg&amp;sig=vaZeVEzQcQBaBNI50TAs25R5b1M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-5B8Sp-3HpzLjAedq6SIBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Le Bohec, 249: limited preview available via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VqM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22mother+of+the+camp%22+severus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhNo0AFEQu&amp;sig=0MDpTCprN9nfkIIDa8eFLwUCbhM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gah8Sp_IO9SG-QbovLVb&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mother%20of%20the%20camp%22%20severus&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Dixon, 78: limited preview available from Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altars, temples and priesthoods===
[[File:Ercolano fresque sacellum 2.JPG|thumb|Interior of the College of the Augustales at [[Herculaneum]]]]
An Imperial cult temple was known as a ''[[Roman temple#Caesareum|caesareum]]'' (Latin) or  ''sebasteion'' (Greek). In Fishwick's analysis, cult to Roman state ''divi'' was associated with temples, and the ''genius'' cult to the living emperor with his altar. The emperor's image, and its siting within the temple complex, focused attention on his person and attributes, and his position in the divine and human hierarchies. Expenditure on the physical expression of Imperial cult was vast, and was only curbed by the Imperial crisis of the 3rd century. As far as is known, no new temples to state ''divi'' were built after the reign of Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial ''divi'' and living ''genii'' appear to have been served by separate ceremonies and priesthoods.  Emperors themselves could be priests of state gods, the ''divi'' and their own ''genius'' cult images. The latter practice illustrates the Imperial ''genius'' as innate to its holder but separable from him as a focus of respect and cult, formally consistent with cult to the personification of ideas and ideals such as Fortune (''[[Fortuna]]''), peace (''[[Pax (mythology)|Pax]]'') or victory (''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]'') ''et al.'' in conjunction with the ''genius'' of the Emperor, Senate or Roman people; Julius Caesar had showed his affinity with the virtue of clemency (''[[Clementia]]''), a personal quality associated with his divine ancestor and patron goddess Venus. Priests typically and respectfully identified their function by manifesting the appearance and other properties of their ''deus''. The duties of Imperial priests were both religious and magistral: they included the provision of approved Imperial portraits, statues and sacrifice, the institution of regular calendrical cult and the inauguration of public works, Imperial games (state ''[[ludi]]'') and [[Gladiator|munera]] to authorised models. In effect, priests throughout the empire were responsible for re-creating, expounding and celebrating the extraordinary gifts, powers and charisma of emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 78–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his religious reforms, Augustus revived, subsidised and expanded the [[Compitalia]] games and priesthoods, dedicated to the [[Lares]] of the ''[[Vicus|vici]]'' (neighbourhoods), to include cult to his own Lares (or to his ''genius'' as a popular benefactor). Thereafter, the Lares Compitales were known as Lares Augusti. Tiberius created a specialised priesthood, the [[Sodales Augustales]], dedicated to the cult of the deceased, deified Augustus. This priestly office, and the connections between the Compitalia cults and the Imperial household, appear to have lasted for as long as the Imperial cult itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, 81 - 106; for discussion of Lares Augusti see 107 – 117. Lott rejects the replacement of neighbourhood Lares with Augustus' own as politically indelicate. The ''Lares Augusti'' can be understood as August Lares – a joint honorific with unmistakable and flattering connections to the princeps himself, rather than the direct claim of princeps as patron: ''contra'' Lilly Ross Taylor, ''The Divinity of the Roman Emperor'', American Philological Association, 1931. Taylor understand the institution of Lares Augusti as the extension of Augustus' domus and its deities to  Rome's neighbourhood cults. Lott acknowledges Taylor's view as generally accepted.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saviours and monotheists===
[[File:Altes Museum - Statue der vergöttlichten Kaiserin Livia.jpg|thumb|upright|Livia in the guise of a goddess with [[cornucopia]]]]
Greek philosophies had significant influence in the development of Imperial cult. Stoic cosmologists saw history as an endless cycle of destruction and renewal, driven by ''[[fortuna]]'' (luck or fortune), ''fatum'' (fate) and ''[[logos]]'' (the universal divine principle). The same forces inevitably produced a ''[[Soter|sōtēr]]'' (saviour) who would transform the destructive and "unnatural disorder" of chaos and strife to ''pax'', ''fortuna'' and ''salus'' (peace, good fortune and well-being) and is thus identified with solar cults such as [[Apollo]] and [[Sol Invictus]]. Livy (in the early to mid 1st century BC), and Lucan (in the 1st century AD) interpreted the crisis of the late Republic as a destructive phase which led to religious and constitutional renewal by Augustus and his restoration of peace, good fortune and well-being to the Roman people. Augustus was a messianic figure who personally and rationally instigated a "golden age" – the ''pax Augusta'' – and was patron, priest and protege to a range of solar deities. The Imperial order was therefore not merely justified by appeals to the divine; it was an innately natural, benevolent and divine institution.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak &amp; Younger, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 17–18, 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial cult tolerated and later included specific forms of pluralistic [[monism]]. For Imperial cult apologists, monotheists had no rational grounds for refusal, but imposition of cult was counter-productive. Jews presented a special case. Long before the civil war, Judaism had been tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Graeco-Judaean rulers. It was brought to prominence and scrutiny after Judaea's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, 2–3, 4–6: the presence of practicing Jews in Rome is attested at least a century before this. The more overt and "characteristically Jewish" beliefs, rites and customs were butts of misinformed scorn and mockery. Legislation by Caesar recognised the synagogues in Rome as legitimate ''collegia''. Augustus maintained their status. Smallwood describes the preamble to events of 63 BC as the Hellenising of ruling Jewish dynasties, their claims to kingly messianism and their popular, traditionalist rejection in the Maccabaean revolt. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSYbpitEjggC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Jews+smallwood+actium+Parthia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWsQGlsrv8&amp;sig=1P-nIzMEdJTf6R0WrQTaT9aMrKo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VfooSsKeIZSDjAfBwpn3Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Books.Google.co.uk] ''Ibid'', 120–143 for a very detailed account of Roman responses to Judaistic practice in Rome under Caesar and the early Principate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood's application of ''religio licita'' (licensed religion) to Judaism in this and possibly any period is disputed by Rajack in: Tessa Rajack, "Was there a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies,'' 74, (1984) 107–23. Rajack finds no evidence for an early "charter": Josephus seems to have inferred a charter from local, ''ad hoc'' attempts to deal with anti-Jewish acts. ''Religio licita'' is first found in Tertullian. Cicero, ''pro Flacco, 66'',  refers to Judaism as ''superstitio'', not ''religio'' but a later change in Roman policy is possible.&lt;/ref&gt; The following Jewish diaspora helped disperse early "Judaic" Christianity. Early Christians appear to have been regarded as a sub-sect of Judaism and as such were sporadically tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish sources on Emperors, polytheistic cult and the meaning of Empire are fraught with interpretive difficulties. In Caligula's reign, Jews resisted the placing of Caligula's statue in their Temple, and pleaded that their offerings and prayers to Yahweh on his behalf amounted to compliance with his request  for worship.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, vol. 1, 1, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Philo]], Caligula was unimpressed because the offering was not made directly to him (whether to his ''genius'' or his ''numen'' is never made clear) but the statue was never installed. Philo does not challenge the Imperial cult itself: he commends the god-like honours given Augustus as "the first and the greatest and the common benefactor" but Caligula shames the Imperial tradition by acting "like an Egyptian".&lt;ref&gt;Niehoff, 45–137: in particular, 75–81 and footnote 25. Limited preview available at Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=cOjCkfLCt3sC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=Philo+Gaius+Jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98cMQBPhKh&amp;sig=tNu1YqVtNWKbyODrrfmBYAjvtJA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8pmESsXHGYSNjAevipmHCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Philo%20Gaius%20Jews&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk] (accessed 14 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Philo is clearly pro-Roman: a major feature of the First Jewish Revolt (AD 66) was the ending of Jewish sacrifices to Rome and the Emperor and the defacement of imperial images.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem (and most of the city) in the first Jewish revolt, Hadrian rebuilt both in Greek style, dedicated the rebuilt Temple (in Dio's account) to Jupiter, renamed Jerusalem [[Aelia Capitolina]] and sought a ban on circumcision as impious disfigurement. The ensuing [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|Bar Kokhba]] revolt overwhelmed the Roman military occupation and destabilised much of the Empire. For almost three years, Judea was an independent state, led by the messianic commander Simon Bar Kokhba. Then it was obliterated by the Imperial armies and erased from the Roman map – Hadrian renamed it as [[Syria Palaestina]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History 69.12.1–14.3 (trans. Cary): available online at Thayer's website: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html#12 Penelope.Uchicago.edu] (accessed 31 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Christians described their persecution under Bar Kokhba. Jews described theirs in its aftermath. Jewish messianism retreated into abstraction, and a Jewish nation-state became an ideal. Christians were less inclined to identify with the Judaic roots of their religion: some actively repudiated them. Hadrian's restrictions on Judaism were later relaxed and Jewish exemption from the full obligations of Imperial cult proved a source of suspicion and resentment for Hellenists and Christians alike.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, 142–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Imperial cult and Christianity==
To pagan Romans a simple act of sacrifice, whether to ancestral gods under Decius or state gods under Diocletian, represented adherence to Roman tradition and loyalty to the pluralistic unity of Empire. Refusal was treason. Christians, however, identified "Hellenistic honours" as parodies of true worship.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the reign of Nero or Domitian, according to [[Arnaldo Momigliano|Momigliano]], the author of the [[Book of Revelation]] represented Rome as the "Beast from the sea", Judaeo-Roman elites as the "Beast from the land" and the ''charagma'' (official Roman stamp) as a sign of the Beast.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 125: citing Revelation, 13, 7–8 &amp; 16–17; 14, 9–11; 16, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian thinkers perceived divine providence in the timing of Christ's birth, at the very beginning of the Empire that brought peace and laid paths for the spread of the Gospels; Rome's destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple was interpreted as divine punishment of the Jews for their refusal of the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, 142–158: [https://books.google.com/books?id=UbJfEvZX2wUC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Momigliano+military+history+religious&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w93Swot8Cl&amp;sig=LgzXodcViar3m3DhW0nKvbb3PME&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JBw2SrTLEJXLjAfDq7WNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#PPA142,M1 Books.Google.co.uk] See particularly p146, (commentary on Dio, 52).&lt;/ref&gt; With the abatement of persecution Jerome could acknowledge Empire as a bulwark against evil but insist that "imperial honours" were contrary to Christian teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome's interpretations of Imperial ceremonial are heavily reliant on Eusebius' polemical ecclesiastical-Imperial history. Price, 203 : limited preview available at Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=h0iXiIenuU4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Julian&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''pontifex maximus'' [[Constantine I]] favoured the "Catholic Church of the Christians" against the [[Donatists]] because:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is contrary to the divine law... that we should overlook such quarrels and contentions, whereby the Highest Divinity may perhaps be roused not only against the human race but also against myself, to whose care he has by his celestial will committed the government of all earthly things. ''Official letter from Constantine, dated AD 314.''&lt;ref&gt;cited in Beard ''et al'', Vol 1, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this change of Imperial formula Constantine acknowledged his responsibility to an earthly realm whose discord and conflict might arouse the ''ira deorum''; he also recognised the power of the new Christian priestly hierarchy in determining what was auspicious or orthodox. Though unbaptised, Constantine had triumphed under the ''signum'' of the Christ (probably some form of [[Labarum]] as an adapted or re-interpreted legionary standard). He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the ''genius'' of living emperors but his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial elevated him to superhuman status. Constantine's permission for a new cult temple to himself and his family in Umbria is extant: the cult "should not be polluted by the deception of any contagious superstition".&lt;ref name="Momigliano, 104"&gt;Momigliano, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[First Council of Nicaea]] Constantine united and re-founded the empire under an absolute head of state by divine dispensation and was honoured as the first Christian Imperial ''divus''. On his death he was venerated and was held to have ascended to heaven. [[Philostorgius]] later criticised Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the ''divus'' Constantine.&lt;ref name="Momigliano, 104"/&gt; His three sons re-divided their Imperial inheritance: [[Constantius II]] was an [[Arianism|Arian]] – his brothers were Nicene.

Constantine's nephew [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], Rome's last non-Christian emperor, rejected the "Galilean madness" of his upbringing for a synthesis of [[neo-Platonism]], Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult and actively fostered religious and cultural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of relevant legislation – [http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/imperial-laws-chart FourthCentury.com] (accessed 30 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His restored Augustan form of principate, with himself as ''primus inter pares'', ended with his death in 363, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned. The Western emperor [[Gratian]] refused the office of ''pontifex maximus'' and, against the protests of the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;Internet Medieval Sourcebook: Letter of St. Ambrose, trans. H. De Romestin, 1896., [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/ambrose-sym.html Fordham.edu] (accessed 29 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; removed the altar of ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]'' (Victory) from the Senate House and began the disestablishment of the Vestals. [[Theodosius I]] briefly re-united the Western and Eastern halves of the Empire, officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He refused to restore ''Victoria'' to the Senate House, extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple. Even so, he accepted address as a living divinity, comparable to Hercules and Jupiter, by his overwhelmingly pagan Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JNIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=pacatus+theodosius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cS8Cv0vBOb&amp;sig=z2ML87tEYOAa8iZPAJ5iWLX-LQI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nyaYSunGKKCQjAfHmbWzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=pacatus%20theodosius&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Williams &amp; Friell, 65–67.

Imperial ceremonial – notably the Imperial ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' or ceremony of arrival, which derived in greater part from the Triumph – was embedded within Roman culture, Church ceremony and the Gospels themselves.&lt;ref&gt;MacCormack, 721-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Western ''divus'' was probably [[Libius Severus]], who died in 465 AD.&lt;ref&gt;His status as ''divus'' is surmised from ''cons.'' = consecratio: ''his. cons. defunctus est Imp. Severus Romae XVIII kal. Septembris'' (Mommsen) in: Scharf, R., Zu einigen daten der Kaiser Libius Severus und Maiorian, Heidelberg University (pdf), p182. [http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/139/Scharf.pdf] (accessed 1 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known about him. His Imperium was not recognised by his Eastern counterpart and he may have been a puppet-emperor of the Germanic general [[Ricimer]]. In the west, imperial authority was partly replaced by the spiritual supremacy and political influence of the Roman Catholic Church.

In the Eastern Empire, sworn adherence to Christian orthodoxy became a prerequisite of Imperial accession – [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] signed a document attesting his obedience to orthodox doctrine and practice. He is the last emperor known to be consecrated as ''divus'' on his death (AD 518). The title appears to have been abandoned on grounds of its spiritual impropriety but the consecration of Eastern emperors continued: they held power through divine ordinance and their rule was the manifestation of sacred power on earth. The ''adventus'' and the veneration of the Imperial image continued to provide analogies for devotional representations ([[Icon]]s) of the heavenly hierarchy and the rituals of the Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 204-5, and footnote 171, citing Basil, ''Homily'' 24: "on seeing an image of the king in the square, one does not allege that there are two kings" (therefore veneration of the image venerates the original: the analogy is implicit in Imperial cult but is not found in the Gospels. See also articles on [[Iconodules]] and [[Iconoclasm]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical evaluations==

The Roman Imperial cult is sometimes considered a deviation from Rome's traditional Republican values, a religiously insincere [[cult of personality]] which served Imperial propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 13–17, includes historians of opposing political views among those who interpret the Imperial cult as the domination of "a servile world" through politically driven "charade". Eduard Meyer, "Alexander der Grosse und die Absolute Monarchie", (1905) in ''Kleine Schriften'', 1, 1924, 265, and Ronald Syme, ''The Roman Revolution'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939. 256, reach essentially the same conclusions about the nature and purpose of the Imperial cult, despite their opposing political alignments. Price, 13, note 31, refers to Demandt's analysis of Meyer's position, in A. Demandt, "Politische Aspekte im Alexander-bild der Neuzeit," ''Archiv für Kulturgeschichte'' 54, 1972, 325ff at p.355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Harland, P. A., "Honours and Worship: Emperors, Imperial Cults and Associations at Ephesus (First to Third Centuries C.E.)", ''Studies in Religion/Sciences religieuses'' 25 (1996) 319–334.&lt;/ref&gt; It drew its power and effect, however, from both religious traditions deeply engrained in Roman culture, such as the veneration of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of each individual and of the ancestral dead, and on forms of the Hellenistic ruler cult developed in the eastern provinces of the Empire.

The nature and function of Imperial cult remain contentious, not least because its Roman historians employed it equally as a topos for Imperial worth and Imperial hubris. It has been interpreted as an essentially foreign, Graeco-Eastern institution, imposed cautiously and with some difficulty upon a Latin-Western Roman culture in which the deification of rulers was constitutionally alien, if not obnoxious.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus' reference to the ''graeca adulatio'' (greek adulation or flattery) of benefactor-cult was set within the Graeco-Eastern context of the Roman civil war and referred to [[Theophanes of Mytilene]], whose god-like honours were occasioned by no merit other than his friendship and influence with Pompey: Tacitus, Annals, 6.8: cited and explicated in Gradel, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In this viewpoint, the essentially servile and "un-Roman" Imperial cult was established at the expense of the traditional Roman ethics which had sustained the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Roman (and Greek) justifications of Rome's hegemony insisted on Rome's moral superiority over its allies and subject peoples. The same commentators deplored Empire for the demoralising effects of its "foreign" influences. See Sallust, ''Catalina'', 11.5: Livy, 1.11: Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 7.130&lt;/ref&gt; For Christians and secularists alike, the identification of mortal emperors with godhead represented the spiritual and [[moral bankruptcy]] of paganism which led to the triumph of Christianity as Rome's state religion.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 10–20: citing evaluations of the Imperial cult as insincere or "mechanical" in Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Bury edn, 1,75-7; Ferguson, CAH, VII (1928), 17; Eduard Meyer, "Alexander der Grosse und die Absolute Monarchie", (1905) in ''Kleine Schriften'', 1, 1924, 265; Ronald Syme, ''The Roman Revolution'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harland, 85, cites among others M. P. Nilsson, Greek Piety (Oxford 1948) 177–178, and early work by D. Fishwick, ''The Development of Provincial Ruler Worship in the Western Roman Empire'', ANRW II.16.2 (1978) 1201–1253, for similar evaluations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few modern historians would now support this point of view. Some – among them Beard ''et al.'' – find no distinct category of Imperial cult within the religio-political life of Empire: the Romans themselves used no such enveloping term. Cult to living or dead emperors was inseparable from Imperial state religion, which was inextricably interwoven with Roman identity and whose beliefs and practices were founded within the ancient commonality of Rome's social and domestic ''mos maiorum''. Descriptions of cult to emperors as a tool of "Imperial propaganda" or the less pejorative "civil religion" emerge from modern political thought and are of doubtful value: in Republican Rome, cult could be given to state gods, personal gods, triumphal generals, magnates, benefactors, patrons and the ordinary ''paterfamilias'' – living or dead. Cult to mortals was not an alien practise: it acknowledged their power, status and their bestowal of benefits. The Augustan settlement appealed directly to the Republican ''mos maiorum'' and under the principate, cult to emperors defined them as emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

With rare exceptions, the earliest institution of cult to emperors succeeded in providing a common focus of identity for Empire. It celebrated the charisma of Roman Imperial power and the meaning of Empire according to local interpretations of ''romanitas'',&lt;ref&gt;Beard, North, Price,  (1998), 318: see also 208-10, 252–3, 359–61.&lt;/ref&gt; firstly an agency of transformation, then of stability. Cult to Imperial deities was associated with commonplace public ceremonies, celebrations of extraordinary splendour and unnumbered acts of private and personal devotion. The political usefulness of such an institution implies neither mechanical insincerity nor lack of questioning about its meaning and propriety: an Empire-wide, unifying cult would necessarily be open to a multitude of personal interpretations but its significance to ordinary Romans is almost entirely lost in the critical interpretations of a small number of philosophically literate, skeptical or antagonistic Romans and Greeks, whether Christian or Hellene.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 6–20, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of prosperity, security and unity of Empire was clearly accompanied by loss of faith in Rome's traditional gods and – at least in the West – in Roman emperors. For some Romans, this was caused by the neglect of traditional religious practices. For others – equally Roman – breakdown of empire was God's judgment on faithless or heretical Christians and hardened pagans alike.

As Roman society evolved, so did cult to emperors: both proved remarkably resilient and adaptable. Until its confrontation by fully developed Christian orthodoxy, "Imperial cult" needed no systematic or coherent theology. Its part in Rome's continued success was probably sufficient to justify, sanctify and "explain" it to most Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted with crisis in Empire, Constantine matched the Augustan achievement by absorbing Christian monotheism into the Imperial hierarchy. Cult to emperors was not so much abolished or abandoned as transformed out of recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Price, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauritius became independent in 1968 and no official religion is defined in the constitution nor does any religion dominate. [[Christianity in Mauritius|Christians]] make up about a third of the population; [[Hinduism in Mauritius|Hindus]] about half and [[Muslims]] most of the rest.  Several religious groups including Muslim ones are recognized by parliamentary decree and receive state subsidies according to their percentage of the population.

The largest group of Muslims are the [[Sunni Muslims|Sunnis]], comprising around 80 per cent of the Muslims with sub-groups of Salafis, the Sufis, the Tawhidis and the Tabligh jamaat. [[Shia Islam|Shias]] form a small community with the subgroups of Cocknies, who are believed to have arrived as boat builders from Cochin in India and Creole Lascars, who have intermarried with Cocknies or other communities.

==History==
[[File:Port Louis, Jummah Masjeed.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Jummah Mosque (Mauritius)|Jumma Masjid]]in Port Louis]]
Some scholars believed that Muslims arrived in Mauritius with Dutch from Arabia as slaves, but the view has been disproved as the fellows with Dutch were most Arabian traders. Muslims arrived to Mauritius during the [[British Colonial Empire|British]] regime starting from 1810. Large scale indentured slaves from [[India]] mostly from [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Bengal]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolkota]]. There were a total of 450,000 immigrants during the period of 1835 to 1907 and after 1909, the immigration was stopped. They were sent from India for a period of five years after which they were returned. Till 1922, only 160,000 returned to India, while other settled down in Mauritius. There were a few families of wealthy Muslim traders from [[Gujarat]] who also settled along with majority poor working classes. The population of Muslims is rumoured to have been 33% (no reference) of the total population during 1835, 64% during 1861 (no reference), but allegedly reduced to less than 25% by 1909. Traditionally [[Sunnis]] remained a majority, while other groups like Sunni Shafia, Shia and Bohra formed around 20 per cent of the total Muslims in the country.&lt;ref name=mus&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA849|page=849|editor1-first=Clifford Edmund |editor1-last=Bosworth|publisher=BRILL|year=1989|isbn=9789004092396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocknies, Kodjas, Bohras and Aga-khanities are believed to have arrived in Maurtius during 1910 from East Africa. Tawheed ideology, which was commonly followed in Mauritius was replaced by Islamic Circle Religious Group which culled out religious practices from India. The trend was changed after the evolution of oil-rich Arab countries in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Bal"/&gt;{{rp|142}}

The largest group of Muslims are the [[Sunni Muslims|Sunnis]], comprising around 80 per cent of the population. Sunnis are divided among various factions such as the Salafis, the Sufis, the Tawhidis and the Tabligh jamaat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam in Mauritius|url=https://www.academia.edu/4016478/ISLAM_IN_MAURITIUS|publisher=Academia|year=2011|accessdate=24 October 2016}}{{Circular reference|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority adheres to the Hanafi school of thoughts, there are other factions that follow the Shafe'i school of thought. There are also Muslims who follow Shi'ism. Meimons are a small aristocratic group, who control the Jummah Mosque in Port Louis. [[Shia Islam|Shiaties]] form a small community of around 3 per cent of the total population. One of the subgroups are called Cocknies, who are believed to have arrived as boat builders from [[Cochin]] in India. Creole Lascars are a new subgroup, who have intermarried with Cocknies or other communities.&lt;ref name=R38&gt;[[#Richards|Richards 2011]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Muslim community, there are three distinct ethnic groups that exist, notably the Memons and the Surtees (who are rich merchants who came from [[Kutch]] and [[Surat]] province of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]]), then the "Hindi Calcattias" who came to Mauritius as indentured labourer from [[Bihar]]. Creole is the most used language among Muslims other than [[Arabic]] and [[Urdu]], while other languages spoken include [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].&lt;ref name=R37&gt;[[#Richards|Richards 2011]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
[[File:Trou d'Eau Douce, Roshan Jameer Musjid.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Roshan Jameer Masjid in Trou d'Eau Douce]]
Mauritius got independence during 1968 and there was no state religion in Mauritius defined in the constitution. The nation had no indigenous population nor any indigenous tribes or religion. The religious organizations present at the time of independence, namely, [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Church of England]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Hindu religion|Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] are recognized by parliamentary decree.&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA762|page=762|editor1-first=Mark|editor1-last= Juergensmeyer|editor2-first= Wade Clark |editor2-last=Roof|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781452266565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution and other laws protect freedom of religion. The groups recognized by the government before independence receive an annual sum for paying their adherents. The government allows overseas missionary groups to operate on a case-by-case basis, although there are no rules that prohibit proselytizing activities. The missionaries should obtain both residence permit and work permit to operate, which is provided for a maximum of three years, without any extension. There are lot of government holidays, most of which are religious indicating the heterogeneity of religions.&lt;ref name=US/&gt; As per the International Religious Freedom report of 2012 published by the United States Department of States, there were no incidence of religious abuses. The report also indicates other religions claim that Hindus have a majority in the government, while Hindus have sought a policy for anti-conversion.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

==Mosques and administration==
As of 1965, there were 65 mosques in the country.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; The first purpose-built mosque in Mauritius is the Camp des Lascars Mosque in around 1805. It is now officially known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The [[Jummah Masjid (Mauritius)|Jummah Mosque]] in [[Port Louis]] was built in the 1850s and is described in the Ministry of Tourism's guide as one of the most beautiful religious buildings in Mauritius. All mosques are controlled by a board called ''waqf'', also a form of charitable organization. The Waqf Board in Mauritius was created in 1941 and it supervises the finances and administration of all the mosques. Each mosque has a manager named ''muttanwalli'', elected by a congregation. The board helps executing funerals, imparting education in ''madraasas'' and all Islamic ceremonies. Major holidays like [[Bakrid]], [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]], [[Mawlid]] and, for the Shia only, [[Muharram]]  are celebrated with floats in the major mosques in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the World Muslims: Tribes, Castes and Communities, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzfs_G7QHoAC&amp;pg=PA596|editor1-first=Nagendra Kr |editor1-last=Singh|editor2-first= Abdul Mabud|editor2-last= Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bikaner]] Vibhuti (distinguished; ''विभूति''), '''Karam Chand Bachhawat''' (1542-1607) served as [[Dewan]] (1571–91), Prime Minister of [[Bikaner state]] in the former state of [[Rajputana]] (now [[Rajasthan]]). Karam Chand, the descendant of Bachhraj, was a brilliant administrator and a suave strategist in [[Bikaner]] and had a very good rapport with [[Emperor Akbar]]. In 1591, fearing danger to his life, he politely recuse himself from Raja Rai Singh and resigned. Later, on being invited by [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]], he joined him as an important adviser at Lahore court.&lt;ref&gt;Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

If you look at history, it has always celebrated the lives of the kings or emperors of an era but carries very little information about the those supportive of them, who stood serving a purpose. Behind every king are unsung nobles, who acted as pillars of support. Karam Chand Bachhawat is one such person.

== Ancestors ==
Karam Chand Bachhawat belonged to Bachhawat gotra (sect) of [[Oswal]] community. The Bachhawats belong to the feudal aristocratic order of former states of [[Rajputana]] ([[Rajasthan]]), who faced many ups and downs of life. They were brave, and many sacrificed their lives fighting for the state against [[Muslim]] invaders. They were visionary administrators par excellence but at times suspected to be anti-state but pro-Mughal and pro-British regime. The members of this clan were associated with the administration of the state for generations. Among them many were independent rulers in Delwara state (former small kingdom near [[Udaipur State|Udaipur]]). There were as many as five Prime Ministers of [[Jodhpur]] and [[Bikaner]] states from amongst the direct ancestors of Karam Chand. Later, in Mewar state, six of his descendants served as Prime Ministers, nine members were appointed as Kiledars (Governors of Forts; किलेदार) and more than 25 members of this clan served as Hakims (Administrators; हाकिम) in various districts of Mewar.&lt;ref&gt;Rai BahadurGaurishankar H Ojha (1939).

Published at the behest of Gokul Lal Mehta, Retd, IAS / Editors: Dr PD Pathak&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bachhawats, trace their origin from the Chauhan dynasty of Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan. The ancestors were Deora (देवड़ा) Chauhans, who ruled Delwara (a small kingdom near Udaipur) state, in 13th-14th century. The ruler of Delwara, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendent of Rao Kirtipal of Jalore, was the progenitor of Bachhawats. Later, in 14th century, this clan embraced Jainism. Thus, the Bachhawat gotra in Oswal community was born. Since, for generations many of them were in the service of rulers (Maharajas &amp; Maharanas), the Bachhawats also followed Vaishnavism being state religion, alongside Jainism.

During mid-15th century, Bachhraj, a descendant of Raja Sagar, was invited by the Rao Jodha, the Chief of Mandore (मंडोर; later named Jodhpur) and was appointed Dewan (Prime Minister; दिवान). He was a brave warrior, an able administrator and a strategist. Rao Jodha, then, for the first time, allowed Bachhraj and other Oswals to take part in commanding armies. In 1465, Rao Bika, elder son of Rao Jodha, chose Bachhraj as his main follower, along with his uncle Rawal Kandhal and others, while proceeding to establish a new territory, later named Bikaner. Bachhraj was appointed as Dewan of the newly founded state of Bikaner. The descendants of Bachhraj came to be known as Bachhawat, which later became a distinctive clan (gotra) and an ethnic group. With the passage of time the influence of Bachhawats grew by leaps and bounds. Each descendant of this clan was appointed as Dewan of Bikaner. Although ancestors of Bachhawats were Kshatriyas (Deora Chauhans), they now belonged to Vaishya (Bania) caste; hence they understood military strategy better than any Kshatriya adviser as royal blood runs in them. They used their pen and sword with equal skill and impact.

==  Loyal to state, brilliant administrator &amp; suave strategist  ==
Karam Chand Bachhawatwas born in 1542 AD (VikramSamvat 1599, Paush vid 11; Indian lunar calendar). In 1571, Rao Kalyanmal, on demise of Karam Chand's father, Dewan Sangram Singh, a descendant of Bachhraj, was appointed Dewan of Bikaner. He was popular in Bikaner and had built a good rapport with Emperor Akbar Jalal-u-din (1556-1605). The royal family of Bikaner had marital relations with the Mughals. Daughter of Kalyanmal was married to Emperor Akbar in 1570 and later his son Rai Singh's daughter was married to prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir). Thus, the ruling family of Bikaner was one among the chosen families from Rajputana, being part of marriage alliance arranged by Karam Chand. Neither event is alluded to in the ‘Kiyant’ but the facts are recorded by Ferishta (pages 234 and 260, Brigg's Translation). Thus, Kalyan's son Rai Singh, who succeeded him in 1573, was one of Akbar's most distinguished generals.&lt;ref&gt;Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

In 1571, while travelling with Prince Rai Singh from Bikaner to the court of Emperor Akbar at Lahore, the much-indebted Dewan Karam Chand, before his departure asked Rao Kalyanmal, "''My Lord, order me as you please''".

Rao Kalyanmal said that he has everything but want to fulfil the wishes of his ancestors. He said, &lt;blockquote&gt;''“I want to perform Kamal Puja (prayers for departed souls of ancestors) sitting in the ‘gavaksh’ (balcony) of Jodhpur palace to fulfil the wishes of late Rao Bika”''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Karam Chand along with Rajkumar Rai Singh paid their obeisance to Emperor Akbar. Since Karam Chand enjoyed good equation with Akbar, he asked him for a favour for Rao Kalyanmal to perform puja at the Jodhpur palace. Since Jodhpur was under Akbar, the wishes were granted instantly. Thus, Rao Kalyanmal could fulfil the wishes of his ancestors and asked Karam Chand as to what he would like in return. Karam Chand politely said, &lt;blockquote&gt;''“I have everything given by you. However, you may like to grant that during the four months of chaturmaas (monsoon) – teli (oilman), kumbhar (potter), kandoi (confectioner), etc to stop violence related work. Do not collect tax on ‘maal’ (goods), goats, sheep, etc”.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rao Kalyanmal accepted his wishes and granted four villages on stamped paper to Karam Chand. Since Karam Chand enjoyed good equation with Emperor Akbar, the rulers of Bikaner were among the most loyal adherents of the empire and held high ranks as Mansabdars of special order in the imperial court, like Raja Man Singh I of Amber (Jaipur). They served as military commanders in various Mughal campaigns all over the Indian sub-continent. Karam Chand fought alongside Raja Rai Singh to defeat Sultan of Gujarat. Emperor Akbar was mighty pleased with the strategist Dewan Karam Chand and asked him as to what he wished for. He replied, &lt;blockquote&gt;''“I do not want anything for myself but want a grant of 52 parganas for my king”''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Kind hearted and saviour of Jainism in medieval period ==
In 1573, Rao Kalyanmal was succeeded by Rao Rai Singh. With the help of strategist Karam Chand, Rao Rai Singh expanded his kingdom and brought in lots of prosperity for Bikaner state. The kingdom of Rao Rai Singh extended up to Harappa in Sindh (Sindhu Desh) by defeating the forces of Balochis. At the behest of Karam Chand, the captured Baluchi prisoners of war were properly clothed, fed and returned to their homes, with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;BhanwarlalNahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

The valiant and brave king Rao Rai Singh of Bikaner was granted the title of Raja by Emperor Akbar. Karam Chand, who had deep concern for the environment and Jain traditions, had orders issued for stopping of fishing activities in Sutlej, Dek and Raavi rivers. He stopped felling of trees in the desert region. Raja Rai Singh also passed orders banning killing of animals during Paryushan (holy festival of Jains during monsoon).&lt;ref&gt;Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Karam Chand had three wives – Ajaib Devi, Jeeva Devi and Kapur Devi (Ajaibde, Jibade and Kapurde). He along with his family often travelled to Jain pilgrim centres – Shatrunjay, Girnar, Abu, etc. and gave away plenty of alms in charity. He was an able disciple of Acharya Jinachandra Suri.

The beginning years of the reign of Akbar proved to be of religious bigotry. It was at the behest of Akbar that the Jain temples of Sirohi were demolished. Karam Chand and the Jain followers, who patiently bore the brutality of Mughals, finally prevailed over Akbar for changing his policy.

The rare 1050 Jina images (Jain paintings) and sculptures (gold &amp; brass) looted by Sultan Tursam Khan in 1576, from the shrines of Sirohi were kept with Emperor Akbar at Fatehpur Sikri. It was intended to melt the statues and extract the gold, but Akbar denied the permission and ordered them to be kept safely. It was at the behest of Karam Chand that Raja Rai Singh approached the Emperor and the statues were respectfully released in 1582. [[File:Chintamani Mandir Bikaner.jpg|alt=Chintamani Mandir Bikaner - inscription|thumb|Chintamani Mandir Bikaner - ''inscription - that Bachhawats has renovated it.''|280x280px]]When the statues arrived at Bikaner, Karam Chand along with the Jain Acharyas and disciples organised a grand function to welcome these statues and installed them in the basement of Chintamani Mandir. From time to time on special occasions the basement is opened, and the statues worshipped as per Jain traditions in public. Such auspicious occasions in 20th century were in the year 1943, when Acharya Mani Sagar Suri Maharaj arrived in Bikaner, then in 1962, 1978, 2009 and now in November 2017. Perhaps, due to non-availability of regular puja and worship facilities for so many divine statues, they are stored in the basement even today.
In the Chintamani temple, the main ‘Chaturvinshti’ (24 statues) idol was badly damaged during the invasion by Kamaran, ruler of Lahore and brother of Emperor Humayun. The stone-plaque at the temple mentions that the renovation work was carried out by the Bachhawat descendants of Mantri Bachhraj, namely Mantri Var Singh.&lt;ref&gt;BhanwarlalNahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat.

In 1586, Karam Chand heard that Jain temples at Shatrunjay(Palitana) and other places in Saurashtra were being destroyed by Navarang Khan. Fearing destruction of Jain temples in the area, he immediately petitioned Akbar for the protection of Jain temples. Akbar at once issued a farmaan (stamped order) to Azam Khan of Gujarat to put Shatrunjay and other Jain temples in Saurashtra under the control of Karam Chand for their protection.  Later, a Jain temple was constructed by Karam Chand at Palitana and his maternal home (nanihal) in Merata city in memory of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Rai BahadurGaurishankar H Ojha (1939). The History of the Bikaner State. Printed at the Vedic Yantralaya, Ajmer. Pages 93-94 and 211-212&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bachhawats granted title of Mehta &amp;honour to wear gold in legs ==
In 1586, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), son of Akbar and son-in-law of Rai Singh was blessed with a daughter under inauspicious planetary conditions. The advice of Shaikh Abul Fazal and other learned people was sought. In the end, Karam Chand and astrologers were consulted and special puja as per Jain philosophy was performed by Pontiff Bhanu Chandra &lt;ref&gt;Siddhi Chandra Upadhyaya (1941). Bhanu Chandra GaniCharitra. ed Shri Mohanlal Dalichand Desai, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;  to successfully ward off evil effects. Karam Chand presented Prince Salim with a precious pearl necklace worth 1300 gold mohars (coins). Emperor Akbar was mighty pleased with Karam Chand and he granted the honour to the ladies of Bachhawat family to wear gold in the foot. Till then this honour was reserved for only Sarang family of Oswal clan. The title of ''Mehta'' (a person engaged in important assignment; महत्त्वपूर्ण कार्यकर्ता) was also granted to him. All his direct descendants settled in Mewar use the title of Mehta. Karam Chand Bachhawat, a close friend and strategist of Emperor Akbar became a historical person and came to be known as the saviour of Jainism during medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Seth RajmalLalwani, Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

== Against bounty to bards ==
Both Jain sources as well as Khayat of Dayaldas portray Raja Rai Singh as a very benevolent but extravagant personality. Judging from the marvellous liberality to bards (Charans and Bharats) with which the ‘Kiyant’ credits Rai Singh, he would appear to have had a great appreciation of poetry and every important circumstance of his life is attested by a ballad.&lt;ref&gt;JK Jain et al ed (1932). SindhayachDayaldaskiKhyat (Hindi/Marwari). Part II; Page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

As Dewan of the state, Karam Chand had a guarded attitude in the interest of the state treasury and did not like this extravaganza on bards. Hence Karam Chand often protested to the king over the rewards. There can be no doubt, that the poets for the sake of the precedent and example have greatly exaggerated Rai Singh's liberality to him and others. Thus, it is stated that during his lifetime, Rai Singh gave away to Charans, Bharats and Brahmins 25 villages, 2000 elephants, 50000 horses and three and quarter crore of rupees in money.

Raja Rai Singh was extremely angry person and believed in every gossip. He always took decisions in hurry and did not care about its consequences.  He would brag and talk loud to conceal his mistakes. The bohemian between Raja Rai Singh and Dewan Karam Chand could not last long and very soon tensions surfaced in their relationship.

== Bachhawat do not worship Dyadi Mata ==
Traditionally, on completion of Navratri festival, Dyadi Mata (Ashapura Mata; ''Kuldevi'' of Chauhans as Bachhawats are their descendants) is commonly worshipped by all castes in Rajasthan. Once, during later part of 16th century, when Karam Chand was engaged in the worshipping of Dyadi Mata, a disciple of Jain Muni, the ''Maharajsaab'' came to Bachhawat's Haveli for ''gochari'' (food and alms). Karam Chand felt disturbed, and told the disciple to convey to ''Maharajsaab'' to come later for ''gochari''. The ''Maharajsaab'' was displeased and through his spiritual powers, let Dyadi Mata's idol speak to Karam Chand'',''  &lt;ref&gt;Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"You shall not worship me from now onwards. I shall not find any fault for doing so. I may be immersed in water. If your descendants remake a similar statue and purify (bathe) it in sawa mound of oil, the puja can recommence."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is believed, that ''Maharajsaab'' then had the gold statue, weighing sawa (1&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt; ) mound (approx. 1500&amp;nbsp;kg) thrown into the well just outside the haveli in Maneck Chowk. Hence the ''Bachhawats'' and the members of this ethnic group do not worship Dyadi Mata (Kuldevi), from that day.

== Foundation of Junagarh Fort at Bikaner ==
[[File:Junagarh Fort of Bikaner.jpg|alt=Junagarh Fort of Bikaner. Formerly Chintamani Fort built under supervision of Karam Chand 1588-93|thumb|410x410px|Junagarh Fort of Bikaner. Formerly Chintamani Fort built (1588-93) under supervision of Dewan Karam Chand Bachhawat.]]From 1585 to 1594 Raja Rai Singh of Bikaner was employed in the Deccan by Emperor Akbar, where he was Mansabdar of Burhanpur. While Rai Singh is said to have kept the petty chiefs under control and to have governed his province well, the administration of Bikaner was totally with Karam Chand.

The royal family of Bikaner lived in the original small fortress built by Rao Bika, until Raja Rai Singh built a new fort called ‘Chintamani’. The ruins of the old fort can still be seen around the walled city, on Raati Ghati near Lakshmi Nathji temple. Whilst at Burhanpur he planned and ordered his minister, Karam Chand to begin the construction of present fine fort of Bikaner in 1588 &lt;ref&gt;Captain PW Rowlett (1874). Gazetteer of the Bikaner State. Bikaner, Reprinted at Government Press (1832). Pages 24 to 34&lt;/ref&gt; on the site indicated by the good omens in Rao Bika's time. As Rai Singh was away, Karam Chand laid the foundation stone of Bikaner Fort in 1588 and supervised its construction up to 1591.

Raja Rai Singh returned from his ''subah'' after nine years in 1594. In 1593, Emperor Akbar being mighty pleased with the military services and successful campaigns in Deccan and Gujarat by Raja Rai Singh, granted him with the jagirs of Junagarh (Saurashtra) and Burhanpur. To commemorate the glorious victories the new fort was renamed as Junagarh Fort. However, there is another version of story for renaming the fort. The fort was renamed as Junagarh, or ‘Old Fort’ in the early 20th century (1926) when the ruling family moved to newly built Lalgarh Palace outside the fort limits.

Completed in 1593, it is an impressive fort of Northern India famous for its magnificent architecture, design and decoration. This Fort, also known as Bikaner Fort, has withstood the ravages of time and has remained unconquered.

== Suspicion between Rai Singh and Karam Chand ==
Capt PW Powlett writes in ‘''Gazetteer of Bikaner State''’,&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Karam Chand established control over the polity of Bikaner and influenced some princes as well. The frequent absence of Raja Rai Singh of Bikaner to discharge his duties as Mansabdar was used by Karam Chand to establish his contacts at the Mughal court. This increasing proximity to Emperor Akbar was distancing Karam Chand from his King. Karam Chand had a dominating personality and whose proactive attitude overshadowed Rai Singh. The honours conferred on Karam Chand by Emperor Akbar made Raja Rai Singh jealous”.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;One of the causes given by the historians is the breach of protocol. Karam Chand was a good chess player and the Emperor Akbar would often ask him to play chess, seated opposite him in the Mughal court, while his master and other Rajas stood by in humble attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Captain PW Rowlett (1874). Gazetteer of the Bikaner State. Bikaner, Reprinted at Government Press (1832). Pages 24 to 34&lt;/ref&gt;  This was naturally most galling to Rai Singh, who conceived hatred towards his servant and sought to eliminate him after his return home from Burhanpur.

By 1591 tension started building up between the Rai Singh and Karam Chand. Rai Singh discovered a conspiracy against his life. The differences between Raja Rai Singh and his son Prince Dalpat Singh, rompted later to reach Emperor's court. A conspiracy was hatched to dislodge Rai Singh from the ''gaddi'' (throne) of Bikaner. The prime mover behind the conspiracy was allegedly Karam Chand. It is also strange to say, notwithstanding the Raja's magnificent treatments of Brahmins and minstrel class, a Purohit (priest), a Bharat and a Charan also figure amongst the conspirators.  The objective was to place Raja's eldest son Dalpat Singh or his brother Ram Singh on the throne'','' thus Karam Chand monopolizing the power of the state. But the motive of the traitors failed. Karam Chand and his family, having received timely warning, escaped to Delhi, where they were well received at the court of Akbar.

It is further stated by Capt Powlet in Gazetteer of Bikaner State, &lt;blockquote&gt;''“They were made the supreme authority of Emperor Akbar and acquainted him with Bikaner secrets, an offence still held in native states to be one of the most heinous possible''. ''But in other respects, Karam Chand was now able to be a thorn in the side of the Raja Rai Singh”''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Capt Powlett further clarifies, ''“It must be understood that these expressions are those of the writers of Kiyants”''. The Kiyants are written by Charans and Bharats, a clan of bards who compose poems and stories with the greatest of ease and keep alive the oral tradition. The stories are passed down from father to son. In a sense they are the early historians, and most were paid to do so.

However, another version of this story from ''‘Karamchand Vansh-kavyam’'' by Jaysom states,&lt;ref&gt;Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980). Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh (Sanskrit / Hindi). Singh Granthmala, Bhartiya Vidhya Bhawan, Mumbai&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“''Raja Rai Singh turned against Karam Chand and wanted to take revenge. Sensing development of ill will of Raja Rai Singh towards himself, Dewan Karam Chand politely took permission to settle in Merta city along with his family members, to spend his time in the service of Parshvanath Swami and Shri Jindutt Surij at a nearby village of Phalodi. He was invited by Raja Man Singh of Amber (Jaipur), one of the famous 'Navaratnas' (the nine gems at the royal court of Akbar) and other kings but he refused as he had his singular loyalty towards Raja Rai Singh of Bikaner''”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Invited to Lahore court by Akbar ==
Around 1591, Emperor Akbar being aware of the talent and loyalty of Dewan Karam Chand sent a letter to invite him to his court at Lahore through Raja Rai Singh. On the orders of his king, Karam Chand left Merta for Lahore along with his aides. He visited Ajmer en route to seek blessings at the memorial (stupa) of his guru Dada sahib Shri Jindutt Suri. When at Lahore he was immediately called in by the Emperor Akbar for an audience, whereas, people would wait for days to have audience. The Emperor knew everything about him and reassured Karam Chand that his lost glory would be restored shortly.

BhanwarlalNahata writes in his book ‘Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat’,&lt;ref&gt;Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Emperor Akbar appointed Dewan Karam Chand as Gajjadhikari (Head of State Council, Treasury &amp;Stores). Emperor presented him with a hunting horse loaded with gold. He was also appointed as the Samrajyadhipati (Governor;'' स्म्राज्यधिपति'') of Toshampur (now in Haryana) with appropriate number of elephants, horses and foot soldiers”.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;It meant that all Kings and Mansabdars under Mughal Empire would have to first meet Dewan Karam Chand before calling on Emperor.

== Acharya Jinchandra Suri invited to Lahore court ==
[[File:Acharya Jinchand Suri.jpg|alt=Acharya Jinchand Suri with Akbar and Karam Chand at Lahore court|thumb|Acharya Jinchand Suri with Akbar and Karam Chand at Lahore court|440x440px]]
During one of the meetings with the learned religious people, Akbar asked the pundits, "''Who was the most learned Jain philosopher?''" The pundits replied, "''Acharya Jinchandra Suri was one such person''". Emperor asked, "''Who is his disciple?''" The pundits replied, "''Dewan Karam Chand''".&lt;ref&gt;English Translation by S.M. Pahedia (1982). jainism in mdiaeval india(1300-1800). Chapter XIV. https://www.scribd.com/document/59431751/Jainism-in-Medieval-India&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhanwarlal Nahata of Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur writes in his book ‘''Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat''’ that Karam Chand was summoned and ordered to invite his guru maharaj as soon as possible. Accordingly, Acharya, who was then at Shatrunjay (Palitana, Saurashtra) reached Lahore after six months journey on foot, on 14 February 1592 along with 31 disciples on Eid day.

The Emperor, who was sitting in the balcony of the palace, came down to receive Acharya Jinchandra Suri and after exchanging pleasantries, he said, &lt;blockquote&gt;''“I have asked you to come here all the way from Gujarat to benefit from your thoughts at the religious meetings''. ''I strongly believe in non-violence (ahimsa); therefore, you must visit my court to give audience, at least once every day so that there is spiritual awakening among my children''”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Having received the patronage of the Emperor, Acharya soon became popular and was well received by one and all at Lahore. He stayed there for over a year till next monsoon.

Akbar was greatly impressed by the scholastic qualities and character of the Acharya. He held several debates and discussions on religion and philosophy in his courts. Arguing with Jains, Akbar remained skeptical of their atheistic views on god and creation. Yet he became convinced by their philosophy of non-violence, vegetarianism and ended up deploring to eat all types of flesh. At the behest of Karam Chand, the Emperor also issued many imperial orders that were favorable for Jain interests, such as banning animal slaughter and stoppage of fishing. Jain authors also wrote about their experience at the Mughal court in Sanskrit texts that are still largely unknown to Mughal historians.

== Akbar proceeds to Kashmir by boat through river Jhelum ==
[[File:Jhelum river map.jpg|alt=Jhelum river map - Akbar proceeds to Kashmir by boat|thumb|Jhelum river map - Akbar proceeds to Kashmir by boat|302x302px]]
Jaysom notes in Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh,&lt;ref&gt;Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980). Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh (Sanskrit / Hindi). Singhi Granthmala, Bhartiya Vidhya Bhawan, Mumbai&lt;/ref&gt; that Emperor Akbar, while in Lahore dealing with the Uzbeks had sought to subjugate the upper Indus valley to secure the frontier provinces. He sent an army to conquer Kashmir in the upper Indus basin. In 1585, Ali Shah surrendered immediately to the Mughals, but another of his sons, Yaqub, crowned himself as king, and led a stubborn resistance to Mughal armies.Finally, in June 1589, Akbar himself travelled from Lahore to Srinagar to receive the surrender of Yaqub and his rebel forces.&lt;ref&gt;BhanwarlalNahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

On another occasion in 1592, once again sensing trouble from rebels, Emperor Akbar then desired to go to Kashmir by boat through river Jhelum. He summoned Karam Chand and asked him to make necessary preparations for the journey. Later, Emperor called for Acharya Jinchandra Suri for his darshan (audience) before proceeding to Kashmir. He told Karam Chand to ensure that Acharya stays put comfortably in Lahore during his absence so that inter-religious spiritual discourses, kindness, mercy to all living beings (ahimsa) and protection of cows to continue in his empire. Accordingly, Emperor issued farmaans (orders) to his eleven subas to follow the instructions on ahimsa. Many kings and sultans, to please the Emperor, also issued orders to protect living beings on certain days in their kingdom.

Akbar asked Karam Chand and Vachak Mahimraj Man Singh, the senior Jain preacher &amp; story teller, to accompany him to Kashmir. Karam Chand made elaborate arrangements, such as tents, logistics, also vegetarian food cooked by Brahmin, a mahatma and tantric to accompany the entourage for warding off any evil en route, etc.

Akbar, stopped en-route at Rohtaspur with his entourage. During this second visit he reached Kashmir on 7 October 1592 by boat. The great Moghul enjoyed the saffron blossom at Pampore and celebrated the festival of Diwali. On this occasion the boats on the banks of river Jhelum and the roofs of the houses in Srinagar were illuminated at the Emperor's command.

However, sensing trouble from the rebels, Karam Chand, the most trustworthy and gallant official was dispatched for the protection of imperial Anantnag at the behest of Emperor. Karam Chand faced stiff resistance but successfully captured the rebels without any bloodshed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“On the accession of Jahangir as Emperor of India, Raja Rai Singh went to Delhi. He also called on ailing Karam Chand to wish him good health and apologise for the past. He also expressed his condolences on demise of Akbar and wept profusely in front of Karam Chand''”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;After Raja Rai Singh went away, Karam Chand called his sons, Bhag Chand and Lakshmi Chand. He praised Raja Rai Singh but at the same time cautioned them that these were crocodile tears and not of love and affection. He said,&lt;blockquote&gt;“''Raja Rai Singh is happy that I shall shortly pass away and regretted that he was unable to take revenge of the past. My dear children! Don’t you make a mistake of ever returning to Bikaner''”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He passed away at Delhi after Emperor Akbar's death between 1605 and 1607.

Capt PW Powlett writes in ‘''Gazetteer of Bikaner State’'',&lt;ref&gt;Captain PW Rowlett (1874). Gazetteer of the Bikaner State. Bikaner, Reprinted at Government Press (1832). Pages 24 to 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“''It is interesting to note, whether Karam Chand’s presence at Mughal court was only due to his personal rapport with the Emperor Akbar or due to his linkages with the Jain religious circles close to Akbar. It is yet to be established whether he was kept at the court as a bulwark against the house of Bikaner to maintain a system of checks and balances. Thus, revenge was inevitable from Rai Singh and despite showing sympathy for the Bachhawat family he could not pursue Karam Chand or his sons to return to Bikaner. Thus, the hero of Jain tradition became the villain of the royal house of Bikaner and the Rajput traditions''”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Bachhawat Karam Chand'' was a very cultured person and was indeed loyal to the king like his fore fathers. Later, Dewan Karam Chand Bachhawat, a close friend and strategist of Emperor Akbar became a historical person.

== Dying wish of Raja Rai Singh for Bachhawats ==
Captain Powlett writes in ''‘Gazetteer of Bikaner State’'', that immediately after the death of Karam Chand, Raja Rai Singh was again reappointed as the Mansabdar of Burhanpur. After a visit to Bikaner, he set off for Deccan with his son Sur Singh and governed there successfully for seven years. In 1612 he fell ill and Sur Singh seeing that his father's end was approaching, with folded hands asked for his last injunctions. Dying Raja Rai Singh said, &lt;blockquote&gt;“''Bachhawats, the family of Karam Chand should be enticed to Bikaner that on them should be visited the sins of their father. The Purohit Man Mahesh and Bharat Chotji and the other conspirators such as Bharta Jat, associated with Karam Chand should receive the reward of their misdeeds''”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Having exacted a promise that his wishes should be attended to, the Raja Rai Singh expired in 1612.

Dalpat ascended the throne of Bikaner in 1612. He earned the displeasure of Emperor at Delhi and that of his younger brother Sur Singh. Due to Dalpat's unpopularity that his nobles fell away from him and openly or secretly united with Sur Singh. Later, Sur Singh revolted against his elder brother Dalpat Singh and killed him along with his guards with the consent of Emperor Jahangir. Dalpat's wives at Bikaner were slaughtered and those at Bhatner became sati with Dalpat's turban in their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Rai BahadurGaurishankar H Ojha (1939). The History of the Bikaner State.

== Bravery &amp; heroism of Bachhawats at Bikaner ==
Sur Singh ascended the throne of Bikaner in 1613. Around 1619, Raja Sur Singh went to Delhi to pay his obeisance to Emperor Jahangir, where he was restored 11 mansabs by the Emperor. He also called on Bhag Chand &amp; Lakshmi Chand, sons of late Dewan Karam Chand. He took them in absolute confidence and invited them to Bikaner. He went so far as to dismiss his minister, to give the office to Lakshmi Chand and Bhag Chand. Both sons of Karam Chand did not remember their father's advice and started in good faith for Bikaner. They were appointed as Mantris very respectfully. Raja Sur Singh remained extra benevolent towards these brothers in the following months. He also accepted the invitation to visit the Bachhawat haveli, wherein the Bachhawat brothers gave a nazrana (offerings to king) of one lakh rupee and other gifts for the felicitation of the King. Jinsaar Suri Raas, written in 1623 mentions that around 1619 Acharya Jinsagar Suri was hosted at Bikaner by Mantri Dewan Bhag Chand and his nephew Manohar Das.&lt;ref&gt;BhanwarlalNahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JK Jain et al ed (1932).SindhayachaDayaldaskiKhyat (Hindi/Marwari).Part II; Page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bachhawats thereupon were resettled in Bikaner but one fine morning at daybreak by treachery their quarters were surrounded by 4000 royal troops of Bikaner and they soon perceived that their destruction was intended. Though they belonged to one ''bania'' (trader) caste, they had, like many of their class who lived amongst and held office under Rajputs, imbibed much of the Rajput spirit and they resolved to die hard. At that time Bhag Chand was resting and his brother Lakshmi Chand and his son Manohar Das were at the Durbar. Lakshmi Chand's wife announced with both pride and anger, 
[[File:Bada Upasara buit by Dewan Sangram Singh Bachhawat at Rangdi ka Chowk, Bikaner.jpg|alt=Bada Upasara built by Dewan Sangram Singh Bachhawat at Rangdi ka Chowk, Bikaner|thumb|320x320px|Bada Upasara built by Dewan Sangram Singh Bachhawat at Rangdi ka Chowk, Bikaner]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The royal forces have surrounded our haveli. If I have your permission I shall adorn men’s uniform and show them my power”''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Upon which Bhag Chand refused permission and himself, after destroying their valuable jewels and sword in hand, fell upon the Rajputs of Rai Singh. The brave Bachhawats retaliated by their well-trained 500 guards. But the guards of Bachhawats could not withstand the mighty power of royal soldiers for a long. The wives of Karam Chand, Bhag Chand, Lakshmi Chand, Manohar Das and the other women of Bachhawat household killed themselves by jumping into the haveli well, whilst their men died fighting royal soldiers. Lakshmi Chand and Manohar Das who were in Durbar were killed there.

In Rangdi-ka-Chowk (formerly Maneck Chowk), opposite Bada Upasara there used to be a well owned by Bachhawats, which was later closed, and a platform built. Today, a ‘Hanuman Mandir stands tall on its side. This was the well, in which Bachhawat women jumped to protect their honour when troops of Sur Singh invaded their quarters.

However, the Raja Sur Singh failed in totally exterminating the Bachhawats, since one pregnant lady, Mewariji, wife of Bhag Chand, was not allowed to sacrifice herself. She, with the assistance of a trusted servant Raghunath escaped to Karni Mata temple. As per convention the pregnant lady was granted safe passage to return to her father’s home at Udaipur. Mewariji was the daughter of Bhamashah, then Pradhan of Mewar state during Maharana Pratap’s time. Thus, Karam Chand and Bhamashah were related through marriage alliance between their son and daughter respectively.

Capt PW Powlett writes in ‘''Gazetteer of Bikaner State’'', &lt;blockquote&gt;''“In the same year that the slaughter of the Bachhawats occurred, Sur Singh further carried out the dying behest of his father by confiscating the jagirs of the descendants of conspirators, Purohit Man Mahesh and Bharat Chotaji. Thereafter, these people came to Junagarh Fort and protested outside Karanpol and were intentionally not stopped from self-immolation during the protest. Another of those denounced by the late Raja Rai Singh, a Bharta Jat was also killed mercilessly”''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Mohammed Iqbal in his book ‘''Bikaner Rajya ka Itihas – Kuch Anchue Pahelu''’ notes that these events were heart breaking and were considered inauspicious for the state. In the act of showing regret and repentance for all the killings, Raja Sur Singh built a lake on the spot where self-immolation by Brahmins was carried out. The lake later came to be known as Sur Sagar. It is said that due to bad omen, the water of the lake from time to time gets mysteriously polluted by some underground water source and needs to be cleaned periodically.

'''''Kristeligt Dagblad''''' is a Danish newspaper published in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

==History and profile==
''Kristeligt Dagblad'' was established in 1896.&lt;ref name=bbc5/&gt;&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{cite web|title=Kristeligt Dagblad|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=491|work=Euro Topics|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an initiative of the Lutheran [[The Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark|Inner Mission]] created to oppose [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] and [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=dsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Massemedier/Medier_og_dagblade,_Danmark/Kristeligt_Dagblad?highlight=Kristeligt%20Dagblad|title=Kristeligt Dagblad|work=Den Store Danske|accessdate=24 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is owned by Kristeligt Dagblad A/S and is based in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=bbc5/&gt;&lt;ref name=top/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thomsen | first = Niels | title = The Danish political press | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = A3 | pages = 144–164 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1968.tb00461.x | date = January 1968 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1968.tb00461.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/viewFile/12402/23637 Full text.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is published six times per week from Monday to Saturday.&lt;ref name=top/&gt;&lt;ref name=fact/&gt;

Initially ''Kristeligt Dagblad'' was an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] newspaper.&lt;ref name=hhen/&gt; The paper was [[apolitical]], publishing articles on religious and moral topics as well as on cultural topics.&lt;ref name=hhen/&gt; In 1909 it published [[anti-evolution]]ary articles, strongly opposing to the views of [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name=hhen/&gt; From 1914 the paper took a wider approach and in 1935 broke away from the Inner Mission, presenting general news but without any political association. It gained popularity under the leadership of Gunnar Helweg-Larsen, but lost ground in the 1950s. From 1950 it adopted a new approach, adopting a more lively style with more emphasis on foreign news. The paper does not have any sports section and covers sports-related news occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Horky|author2=Jörg-Uwe Nieland|title=International Sports Press Survey 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVpBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=17 December 2014|date=8 October 2013|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7322-7886-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of ''Kristeligt Dagblad'' is Erik Bjerager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/erik-bjerager-skriver|title=Erik Bjerager skriver|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|accessdate=24 August 2014|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kushwaha''' (sometimes, '''Kushvaha''')&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p91&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=91 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a community of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which has traditionally been involved in agriculture (including [[beekeeping]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harper|first=Malcolm|title=Inclusive Value Chains: A Pathway Out of Poverty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VODZCM5qblYC&amp;pg=PA182|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4293-89-1|pages=182, 297|accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used to represent at least four subcastes, being those of the [[Kachhi (caste)|Kachhis]], [[Kachwaha]]s, [[Koeri]]s and [[Murao]]s. They claim descent from the mythological [[Suryavansh]] (Solar) dynasty via [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], who was one of the twin sons of [[Rama]] and [[Sita]]. Previously, they had worshipped [[Shiva]] and [[Shakta]].

== Demographics ==
William Pinch notes their presence in [[Uttar Pradesh]] , [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name=Pinch1996pp91-92 /&gt;

== Myths of origin ==
Today, the Kushwaha generally claim descent from Kusha, a son of the mythological Rama, himself an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]. This enables their claim to be of the Suryavansh dynasty but it is a myth of origin developed in the twentieth century. Prior to that time, the various branches that form the Kushwaha community -&amp;nbsp;the Kachhis, Kachwahas, Koeris, and Muraos&amp;nbsp;- favoured a connection with Shiva and Shakta.&lt;ref name=Pinch1996pp91-92&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |pages=12, 91–92 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganga Prasad Gupta claimed in the 1920s that Kushwaha families worshiped [[Hanuman]]&amp;nbsp;- described by Pinch as "the embodiment of true devotion to Ram and Sita"&amp;nbsp;- during [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], a month in the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunar calendar]].&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p98&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=98 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

===Shudra varna===
The Kushwaha were traditionally a peasant community and considered to be of the stigmatised [[Shudra]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=81 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinch describes them as "skilled agriculturalists".&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p92&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=92 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional perception of Shudra status was increasingly challenged during the later decades of [[British Raj]] rule, although various castes had made claims of a higher status well before the British administration instituted its first census.{{efn|William Pinch records that, "...&amp;nbsp;a popular concern with status predated the rise of an imperial census apparatus and the colonial obsession with caste.&amp;nbsp;... [C]laims to personal and community dignity appeared to be part of a longer discourse that did not require European political and administrative structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=88 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Pinch describes that "The concern with personal dignity, community identity, and caste status reached a peak among Kurmi, Yadav, and Kushvaha peasants in the first four decades of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p83&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |pages=83–84 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification as Kushwaha Kshatriya===
From around 1910, the Kachhis and the Koeris, both of whom for much of the preceding century had close links with the British as a consequence of their favoured role in the cultivation of the [[opium poppy]], began to identify themselves as Kushwaha [[Kshatriya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=90 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organisation claiming to represent those two groups and the Muraos petitioned for official recognition as being of the Kshatriya varna in 1928.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot199" /&gt;

This action by the All India Kushwaha Kshatriya Mahasabha (AIKKM) reflected the general trend for social upliftment by communities that had traditionally been classified as being Shudra. The process, which [[M. N. Srinivas]] called [[sanskritisation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charsley |first=S. |year=1998 |title=Sanskritization: The Career of an Anthropological Theory |journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology |volume=32 |issue=2 |page=527 |doi=10.1177/006996679803200216}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a feature of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century caste politics.&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot199"&gt;{{cite book |title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India |first=Christophe |last=Jaffrelot |edition=Reprinted |publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-85065-670-8 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OAkW94DtUMAC |page=199 |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of anthropological thought |first1=Vijay S. |last1=Upadhyay |first2=Gaya |last2=Pandey |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1993 |isbn=978-81-7022-492-1 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SNw5zVN1V0oC |page=436 |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the AIKKM was based on the concept of [[Vaishnavism]], which promoted the worship and claims of descent from Rama or Krishna as a means to assume the trappings of Kshatriya symbolism and thus permit the wearing of the [[sacred thread]] even though the physical labour inherent in their cultivator occupations intrinsically defined them as Shudra. The movement caused them to abandon their claims to be descended from Shiva in favour of the alternate myth that claimed descent from Rama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Daughters of the earth: women and land in Uttar Pradesh |first=Smita Tewari |last=Jassal |publisher=Technical Publications |year=2001 |isbn=978-81-7304-375-8 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T6gnJmoLRZQC |pages=51–53 |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Ganga Prasad Gupta, a proponent of Kushwaha reform, had published a book offering a proof of the Kshatriya status of the Koeri, Kachhi, Murao and Kachwaha.&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p92 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fascinating Hindutva: saffron politics and Dalit mobilisation |first=Badri |last=Narayan |publisher=SAGE |year=2009 |isbn=978-81-7829-906-8 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bJ_rhfu6yUC |page=25 |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reconstructed history argued that the Kushwaha were Hindu descendants of Kush and that in the twelfth century they had served Raja Jaichand in a military capacity during the period of Muslim consolidation of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Subsequent persecution by the victorious Muslims caused the Kushwaha kshatryia to disperse and disguise their identity, foregoing the sacred thread and thereby becoming degraded and taking on various localised community names.&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p92 /&gt; Gupta's attempt to prove Kshatriya status, in common with similar attempts by others to establish histories of various castes, was spread via the caste associations, which Dipankar Gupta describes as providing a link between the "urban, politically literate elite" and the "less literate villagers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Caste in question: identity or hierarchy? |first=Dipankar |last=Gupta |publisher=SAGE |year=2004 |page=199 |isbn=978-0-7619-3324-3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bgpEIb4tNjgC |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities also constructed temples in support of these claims as, for example, did the Muraos in [[Ayodhya]].&lt;ref name=Pinch1996p98 /&gt;

===Classification as Backward Caste===
{{See also|Other Backward Class}}

Some Kushwaha reformers also argued, in a similar vein to the [[Kurmi]] reformer Devi Prasad Sinha Chaudhari, that since [[Rajput]]s and [[Bhumihar]]s and [[Brahmins]] worked the fields in some areas, there was no rational basis for assertions that such labour marked a community as being of the Shudra varna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uEP-ceGYsnYC |page=110 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kushwahas are classified as a Most Backward Caste (MBC) in some Indian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/lok-sabha-elections-2014/news/Upper-castes-rule-Cabinet-backwards-MoS/articleshow/35624877.cms |title=Upper castes rule Cabinet, backwards MoS |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Haryana government added the Kushwaha, Koeri and Maurya castes to the list of backward classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-castes-included-in-backward-classes-list/article1-1147408.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |title=Three castes included in backward classes list |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Lady Well.jpg|thumb|right|The Lady Well]]
The '''Lady Well''' is a [[holy well]] in [[Glasgow]] in [[Scotland]].

Also known as 'Our Lady's Well', Glasgow's Ladywell is an artesian spring noted on early [[city map]]s and can be reliably assumed to predate the city. It lay just outside the city wall and Drygate Port in medieval times and will have refreshed Romans travelling the old [[Carntyne]] Highway east-west between forts along the [[Antonine Wall]]. Today it is erroneously believed to have been sunk for use of commoners denied access to a nearby Priest's Well, and/or to have been capped in the early 19th century out of fears of pollution or plague. 

In fact, its wellhead was jointly rebuilt by the Merchants House and City Council in 1835-6 for enclosure in a new wall when the Fir Park behind it was turned into a gardened burial ground. The Ladywell was still in public use while most wells in Glasgow were closed, after fresh water piped from [[Loch Katrine]] transformed the city's health and sanitation in the 1860s. An old article says the Ladywell was the last public well to be closed but gives no date. The classical wellhead installed by the 1836 restoration bears no resemblance to the original - an open round one - and remains there today. The current lintel stone (its second) notes the 1836 rebuild and another by the Merchant's House in 1874. A plaque commemorates its most recent refurbishment by [[Tennent Caledonian Breweries]] in 1983. The Ladywell remains capped.

'''''Letter to a Christian Nation''''' is a book by [[Sam Harris]], written in response to feedback he received following the publication of his first book ''[[The End of Faith]]''. The book is written in the form of an [[open letter]] to a [[Christian]] in the United States. Harris states that his aim is "to demolish the intellectual and moral pretensions of Christianity in its most committed forms." The book was released in September 2006. In October it entered the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] at number seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Best Sellers &amp;ndash; Hardcover Nonfiction | publisher = New York Times | date = October 8, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/bestseller/1008besthardnonfiction.html | accessdate = 2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The underlying premise Harris takes is one of [[utilitarianism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He states: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Questions about Morality are questions about happiness and suffering."&lt;ref&gt;page 8; Letter to a Christian Nation&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Harris addresses his arguments to members of the conservative [[Christian Right]] in America. In answer to their appeal to the Bible on questions of morality, he points to selected items from the [[Old Testament]] [[Mosaic law]], (death for adultery, homosexuality, disobedience to parents etc.), and contrasts this with, for example, the complete non-violence of [[Jainism]]. Harris argues that the reliance on religious dogma can create a false morality, which is divorced from the reality of human suffering and the efforts to alleviate it; thus religious objections stand in the way of [[condom]] use in [[Africa]] to prevent the spread of [[HIV/AIDS|HIV and AIDS]], [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic stem cell]] research, [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sex education]], [[abortion]], and the use of the new [[HPV vaccines|HPV vaccine]].

{{cquote|We read the [[Golden Rule]] and judge it to be a brilliant distillation of many of our ethical impulses. And then we come across another of God’s teachings on morality: if a man discovers on his wedding night that his bride is not a virgin, he must stone her to death on her father’s doorstep ([[Deuteronomy]] 22:13-21).&lt;ref name = "Quotes" &gt;{{cite web | title = Letter To A Christian Nation: Quotes | publisher = [[Random House Inc.]] | url = http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/harris/ltcn_quotes.php | accessdate = 2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Harris also addresses the [[problem of evil]]&amp;mdash;the difficulty in believing in a good God who allows disasters like [[Hurricane Katrina]]&amp;mdash;and the conflict between religion and science. A 2005 [[Gallup poll]] suggested that 53% of Americans are sympathetic to [[creationism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Foust | title = Gallup poll latest to show Americans reject secular evolution | publisher = Baptist Press | date = October 19, 2005 | url = http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=21891 | accessdate = 2007-02-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184745/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=21891 | archivedate = September 30, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; so Harris spends some time arguing for [[evolution]] and against the notion of [[Intelligent Design]]:

{{cquote|Despite a full century of scientific insights attesting to the antiquity of the earth, more than half of our neighbors believe that the entire cosmos was created six thousand years ago. This is, incidentally, about a thousand years after the [[Sumer]]ians invented glue.&lt;ref name = "Quotes" /&gt;}}

Harris considers the variety of religions in the world, citing a religious basis for many ethnic and inter-communal conflicts. Contrary to those who advocate religious tolerance, mutual respect, and interfaith dialogue, Harris contends that such values only make it more difficult to criticize faith-based [[extremism]].  While holding that spiritual experiences can be valuable and life-affirming—he expends considerable space in ''The End of Faith'' in arguing that they are necessary—Harris rejects their link to religious beliefs. He argues that religion may have served some useful purpose for humanity in the past, but that it is now the greatest impediment to building a "global civilization."

==Promotion==
The book was released with laudatory [[blurb|endorsements]] from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Leonard Susskind]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Matt Ridley]], [[Desmond Morris]], [[Janna Levin]], and [[Michael Gazzaniga]].&lt;ref name=web/&gt; There was also an unsigned blurb attributed by the publisher to a "''New York Times'' best selling author", who wrote: "I can't sign my name to this blurb. As a ''New York Times'' best selling author of books about business, my career will evaporate if I endorse a book that challenges the deeply held superstitions and bigotry of the masses. That's exactly why you should (no, you must) read this angry and honest book right away. As long as science and rational thought are under attack by the misguided yet pious majority, our nation is in jeopardy. I'm scared. You should be too. Please buy two, one for you and one for a friend you care about."&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/letter-to-a-christian-nation|title=Letter to a Christian Nation at Sam Harris' website|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Commenting in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential campaign]], [[Steven Pinker]] chose ''Letter to a Christian Nation'' as the one book that he would want [[Barack Obama]] to read, saying: "Some have criticized the uncompromising tone of this atheist best seller, but it's mild stuff compared with the acid you guys have been flinging around. The book will put you in touch with the fastest-growing religious minority in this country, help you understand why our European allies consider us so backward and encourage you to keep your distance from kooks who call themselves spiritual leaders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/books/review/Survey-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Survey: Truth to Power|publisher=New York Times|date=June 1, 2008|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in ''[[The New York Observer]]'', Emily Bobrow said: "His new book may be smug in spots, but Mr. Harris makes a good case for a new and intellectually honest conversation about morality and human suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/religion/harriss2.htm|title=Letter to a Christian Nation|first=Emily|last=Bobrow|date=October 16, 2006|publisher=The New York Observer, quoted at The Complete Review|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Jean E. Barker wrote: "This combination of ruthless argument with polemic designed to provoke... will further delight Harris' supporters and infuriate his critics. His glee in his own intelligence aside, Harris is stricken by the amount of preventable suffering in the world and has identified ending religion as the cure... This small book adds little new to Harris' argument in "The End of Faith"—indeed, he repeats a number of his examples. Its strengths are the clarity of Harris' writing, his critique of religion's current entanglement in public policy and his continuing willingness to speak up about some very controversial ideas, even if they're difficult for others to hear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/chronicle-review|title=Taking on Christians' gospel truth|first=Jean E.|last=Barker|date=October 1, 2006|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle, reprinted at SamHarris.org|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported in 2006 that ''Letter'' stimulated both strong positive and strong negative reactions, attracting both a large audience and strong counter-reactions from religious scholars. The ''Post'' said the book "doesn't drill many new theological wells," but that Harris "might be the first man to be anointed 'Hot Atheist' in Rolling Stone magazine."&lt;ref&gt;David Segal, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/25/AR2006102501998_pf.html "Atheist Evangelist In His Bully Pulpit, Sam Harris Devoutly Believes That Religion Is the Root of All Evil,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 26, 2006; C01&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie Doward of ''[[The Observer]]'' said Harris "wastes no time taking on his enemy - Christian fundamentalism of the sort that influences President [[George W. Bush]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Doward [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/29/books.religion "Atheists top book charts by deconstructing God,"] ''[[The Observer]]'', October 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in an editorial in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', [[Intelligent Design]] proponent [[David Klinghoffer]] said that ''Letter to a Christian Nation'' and [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' were the top two bestselling religious books. However, he went on to say that "... Dawkins and Harris seem unfamiliar with religious tradition as biblical monotheists know it from personal experience and deep study. Frankly, the success of the new atheist faith would be hard to imagine without today's soaring levels of societal religious illiteracy."&lt;ref&gt;David Klinghoffer [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003653502_klinghoffer06.html "Prophets of the new atheism,"] ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', April 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''The Observer'', Stephanie Merritt described Harris as providing "concise anti-religious apologetics," but said that "[h]e does not seem to comprehend the mindset of those he addresses."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Merritt, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/06/society "Better God-fearing than sneering,"] ''[[The Observer]]'', May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', Peter Steinfels wrote that Harris's ''Letter'' and Dawkins's ''The God Delusion'' were receiving criticism "not primarily, it should be pointed out, from the pious, which would hardly be noteworthy, but from avowed atheists as well as scientists and philosophers writing in publications like The New Republic and The New York Review of Books, not known as cells in the vast God-fearing conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Steinfels, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/books/03beliefs.html?ei=5087%0A&amp;em=&amp;en=f49f4e9d6fc540b4&amp;ex=1173070800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1172932384-YOYjG2MS7tceZ476iJyLNg "Books on Atheism Are Raising Hackles in Unlikely Places,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Novak]], a Catholic philosopher,  wrote in the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' that "[t]he letter that Harris claims is intended for a Christian nation is in fact wholly uninterested in Christianity on any level, is hugely ignorant, and essentially represents his own love letter to himself, on account of his being superior to the stupid citizens among whom he lives."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Novak, [http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/national-review-lonely-atheists-of-the-global-village/ "National Review: 'Lonely Atheists of the Global Village',"] BOOK REVIEWS, ''[[National Review]]'', March 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Criterion]]'' described ''Letter'' as condescending, saying "Harris is too choked on bile, or at best incredulity ('we stand dumbstruck by ''you'',' he says, italics and all) to admit that his addressees are worth speaking with. This is in part because his chosen antagonist is 'Christianity at its most divisive, injurious, and retrograde' even though it's questionable whether anything was ever accomplished by attacking a system at its most 'retrograde.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hal Johnson, [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/the-bland-inquisitor-2550 "The bland inquisitor: On Sam Harris's Letter to a Christian Nation,"] ''[[The New Criterion]]'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' characterized ''Letter'' as "sometimes simplistic and misguided." The review elaborates that "Harris overstates his case by misunderstanding religious faith, as when he makes the audaciously naïve statement that 'mysticism is a rational enterprise; religion is not.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20060710/8658-new-in-religion-anti-religion-.html|title=New in Religion: Anti-Religion|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Covenant-breaker'' is a term used by [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] to refer to a person who has been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Bahá'í community for the act of ''covenant-breaking,'' roughly defined as active opposition to the Bahá'í Faith from a current member. Among the descendants of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], most were expelled for their opposition to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and later [[Shoghi Effendi]]. The extended family were later almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society in Haifa, Israel, with no common religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bahai and Babi Schisms |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |publisher= |location= |id= |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahaism-iii |first=Denis |last=MacEoin |authorlink=Denis MacEoin |quote=In Palestine, the followers of Moḥammad-ʿAlī continued as a small group of families opposed to the Bahai leadership in Haifa; they have now been almost wholly re-assimilated into Muslim society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maheswarnath Mandir''' (locally known as "grand shivala Triolet") is a [[Hindu]] temple located in the village of [[Triolet]], [[Mauritius]]. The presiding [[deity]] of the temple is Lord [[Shiva]] (another name is Maheshwarnath, meaning the ''great Lord''). The temple was founded in 1888 by Pandit Shri Sajeebunlall Ramsoondur, who came from [[Calcutta]]. The temple is famous for its association with the first pilgrimage to [[Ganga Talao]], the sacred lake found in the center of [[Mauritius]]. The temple is the biggest and one of the oldest of its kind on the island.

== History ==
The temple is more than 120 years old. Its founder; Pandit Shri Sanjibunlall Ramsoondur,originally of Bihar India better known as Pandit Sanjibon, came to [[Mauritius]] on April 4, 1866,travelling from [[Calcutta]]. He came as a peddler but acquired wealth during the great [[partition (law)|partition]], which began in 1878. Due to his economic independence, intelligence and stature, he was respected by all.
Pandit Sanjibon was a major landowner - He had 53.70 acres at Terminus, [[Triolet]], of which he donated 10.13 acres to a Hindu society in 1895.

He had acquired the land of Jules Langlois, due to the failure of the sugar factory of [[Triolet]]. He then demolished the chimney of the factory, without knowing he was bypassing the laws concerning the historic monuments of Mauritius. Thereafter, he decided to build Hindu temples at its own expenses and the principal temple would be of the same height as the destroyed chimney.

At that time, the ruins of the sugar factories were often used to make places of worship. The Church of Notre Dame de La Salette is a case in [[Grand Baie]]. The other one is the temple of Triolet which was built on the ruins. The building was the work of Tamil artisans under the supervision of Mr Goinsamy Maestry. Those artisans had even built the [[Jummah Masjid (Mauritius)|Jummah Masjid]] in [[Port Louis]] and the Sockalingum Meenatchee Ammen kovil at Nicolay road, Port Louis (commonly known as "Kaylasson temple").

Sajibon Pandit, who was very energetic, himself helped in constructing the temple; which lasted from 1888 to 1891.

Images of the deities and priests arrived from [[India]] and Sajibon went there to pick them up. When he brought the second "[[lingam]]" from [[Varanasi|Kashi]], he organized a "Shobha Yatra"(a religious procession) from Port Louis to Triolet.

After the inauguration of the temple, Pandit Sajibon donated money to the Hindu society for the management of the temple. He gave 10.13 acres of land along with, according to the deed of Mr Baissac, notary.

== The Maheswarnath Temple legend ==
According to a legend, during the temple's construction, a huge pot of gold and silver coins were found buried on the very spot where the temple was being made.It is believed by many that this gold must have belonged to Indian Ocean pirates from the previous century, who used to attack east Indian company ships for their gold and other precious goods.The money found was then used for the construction of the temple.

== The first Maha Shivratree Pilgrimage ==
[[File:01 Mahashivratree festival.JPG|thumb|A kanwar in the temple compound on the eve of the Maha shivratree festival]]
[[File:02 Mahashivratree festival.JPG|thumb|A kanwar in the temple compound on the eve of the Maha shivratree festival]]
A major event associated with Pandit Sajibon and the Maheswarnath temple is the beginning of the annual pilgrimage to Grand Bassin. In fact, in 1897 Pandit Shri Jhummon Giri Gossagne Napal, a priest of Bois Pignolet together with Pandit Shri Mohanparsad, a priest of Goodlands saw in a dream the water of the lake of Grand Bassin springing from the ‘Jahnvi’, thus forming part of [[Ganga]]. The news of the dream spread rapidly and created quite a stir in the Hindu community and also reassured the Hindus about the sacred nature of the island and the futility of returning India to die. The following year, Pandit Giri Gossagne and Pandit Sajibon along with nine people from Triolet trekked to [[Ganga Talao|Grand Bassin]] to collect its water to offer to Lord Shiva on the occasion of [[Maha Shivaratri]]. The lake was then known as ‘Pari Talao’ and became the equivalent of the holy [[Ganges]] in [[India]].
Thereafter, people from all around the island started to follow this tradition of making a pilgrimage with a "kanwar"(A bamboo structure covered with fabrics and decorated with ornaments-it also enshrines images of Hindu deities) to [[Ganga Talao]] to collect its holy water. The holy water is then offered to lord [[Shiva]] in the local temples of their respective villages. This pilgrimage remains an integral part of the Maha Shivratree festival and this tradition is unique to [[Mauritius]].

== Architecture ==
The temples reflect the [[Bengal architecture]]. For instance, the main temple is a variation of the "ratna" style of West Bengal. It is a variation of the pancha-ratna or a five-towered temple built on a platform. The veranda attached to the main temple resembles the thakur-dalan, which is common in the old houses of [[Calcutta]]. The thakur-dalan is a veranda where the deity of Durga is invoked during the Durga Puja in West Bengal. This is also seems to be the case for the Vishnu temple on the right. The main temple is decorated with images of various [[Hindu deities]] and floral designs. Since its construction, the temple is always painted white while the sculptures and the floral designs are colorful, in contrast to the white background. The main temple houses lord Shiva in the form of the shiv ling. There is also the image of his wife, goddess [[Parvati]], their sons; lord [[Ganesha]] and lord [[Kartikeya]] and another form of Shiva; lord [[Bhairava]]. Facing the shiv ling is [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], the gate-keeper.
Next to the principal temple are two smaller ones dedicated to goddess [[Lakshmi]] and lord [[Nataraja]]. Another temple is dedicated to [[Lakshmi Narayan]] and their various incarnations. There is also a [[Hanuman]] temple in addition to a temple housing lord [[Jagannath]], goddess [[Kali]], goddess [[Saraswati]], goddess [[Durga]] and her nine forms. In the center of the temple complex is a smaller temple enshrining the smaller [[lingam]] that Pandit Sajibon brought from [[Varanasi|Kashi]] and hence the temple is named [[Kashi Vishwanath]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7398">[[File:Nanahuatzin.jpg|thumb|Nanahuatzin]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], the god '''Nanahuatzin''' or '''Nanahuatl''' (or '''Nanauatzin''', the suffix '''-tzin''' implies respect or familiarity; {{lang-nci-IPA|Nanāhuātzin|nanaːˈwaːtsin}}), the most humble of the gods, sacrificed himself in fire so that he would continue to shine on Earth as the sun, thus becoming the [[solar deity|sun god]]. Nanahuatzin means "full of sores." According to a translation of the ''[[Histoyre du Mechique]]'', Nanahuatzin is the son of [[Itzpapalotl]] and Cuzcamiahu or Tonan, but was adopted by [[Piltzintecuhtli]] and [[Xōchiquetzal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garibay Kintana|first=Ángel María |authorlink=Ángel María Garibay K.|title=Teogonía e historia de los mexicanos: tres opúsculos del siglo XVI|year=1973|publisher=Porrúa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Codex Borgia]], Nanahuatzin is represented as a man emerging from a fire. This was originally interpreted as an illustration of cannibalism. He is probably an [[:aspect (religion)|aspect]] of [[Xolotl]].

== Aztec tradition ==
The Aztecs had various myths about the creation, and Nanahuatzin participates in several. In the legend of Quetzalcoatl, Nanahuatzin helps [[Quetzalcoatl]] to obtain the first grains which will be the food of humankind. In Aztec mythology, the universe is not permanent or everlasting, but subject to death like any living creature. However, even as it dies, the universe is reborn again into a new age, or "Sun." Nanahuatzin is best known from the "Legend of the Fifth Sun" as related by [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].

In this legend, which is the basis for most Nanahuatl myths, there had been four creations. In each one, one god has taken on the task of serving as the sun: [[Tezcatlipoca]], [[Quetzalcoatl]], [[Tlaloc]], and [[Chalchiuhtlicue]]. Each age ended because the gods were not satisfied with the human beings that they had created. Finally, Quetzalcoatl with the aid of [[Xolotl]] retrieves the sacred bones of their ancestors, mixes them with corn and his own blood, and manages to make acceptable human beings. However, no other god wants the task of being the sun.

*The gods decide that the fifth, and possibly last, sun must offer up his life as a sacrifice in fire. Two gods are chosen: [[Tecciztecatl]] and Nanahuatzin. The former is chosen to serve as the sun because he is wealthy and strong, while the latter will serve as the moon because he is poor and ill. Tecciztecatl, who is proud, sees his impending sacrifice and transformation as an opportunity to gain immortality. The humble Nanahuatzin accepts because he sees it as his duty. During the days before the sacrifice, both gods undergo purification. Tecciztecatl makes offerings of rich gifts and coral. Nanahuatzin offers his blood and performs acts of penance.
*The gods prepare a large bonfire that burns for four days, and construct a platform high above it from which the two chosen gods must leap into the flames. On the appointed day, Tecciztecatl and Nanahuatzin seat themselves upon the platform, awaiting the moment of sacrifice. The gods call upon Tecciztecatl to immolate himself first. After four attempts to throw himself onto the pyre, which is giving off extremely strong heat by this time, his courage fails him and he desists. Disgusted at Tecciztecatl's cowardice, the gods call upon Nanahuatzin, who rises from his seat and steps calmly to the edge of the platform. Closing his eyes, he leaps from the edge, landing in the very center of the fire. His pride wounded upon seeing that Nanahuatzin had the courage that he lacked, Tecciztecatl jumps upon the burning pyre after him.

Nothing happens at first, but eventually two suns appear in the sky. One of the gods, angry over Tecciztecatl's lack of courage, takes a rabbit and throws it in Tecciztecatl's face, causing him to lose his brilliance. Tecciztecatl thus becomes the moon, which bears the impression of a rabbit to this very day. Yet the sun remains unmoving in the sky, parching and burning all the ground beneath. Finally the gods realize that they, too, must allow themselves to be sacrificed so that human beings may live. They present themselves to the god [[Ehecatl]], who offers them up one by one. Then, with the powerful wind that arises as a result of their sacrifice, [[Ehecatl]] makes the sun move through the sky, nourishing the earth rather than scorching it.

== Nanahuatzin and Xolotl ==
[[File:Codex Borgia page 43.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Borgia]] page 43 depicts a Sun god with the bumpy skin of ''Nanahuatzin'' and the canine snout of [[Xolotl]].

== Pipil tradition ==
The fifth sun is identified with [[Tonatiuh]], Nanahuatzin was the youngest of three boys and a girl named "[[Xochit Sihuat]]" who had emerged from the fruit of the gourd-tree (''[[Crescentia cujete]]''), which in turn had grown from the head of a woman that had flown into the night while her body slept. (The head attached itself to a startled deer, and the deer leapt into a canyon, there planting the head in the ground.) Nanahuatzin and his siblings were raised by Tantepus Lamat ("Iron-Toothed Old Woman") until she gave to her lover some food they had obtained. The siblings proceeded to butcher that lover and, calling it venison, fed his body to the old woman, then killed her. The siblings found the world's supply of maize was concealed within a mountain, known only to a bird feeding on that stock. Where his siblings had failed, Nanahuatzin succeeded in opening the mountain, but in doing so, was himself trapped within.&lt;ref&gt;''ANCIENT AMERICA'', 9 = Ruud van Akkeren : ''Tzuywa : Place of the Gourd''.

}}The '''Nyishi''' are the  largest ethnic group in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in [[Northeast India|north-eastern]] [[India]]. In [[Nishi language|Nishi]], their traditional language, ''Nyi'' refers to "a man" and the word ''shi'' denotes "a being", which combined together refers to a human being. They are spread across seven districts of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]: [[Kra Daadi district|Kra Daadi]], [[Kurung Kumey district|Kurung Kumey]], [[East Kameng district|East Kameng]], [[West Kameng district|West Kameng]], [[Papum Pare district|Papum Pare]], parts of [[Lower Subansiri district|Lower Subansiri]] and Kamle district. They also live in the [[Sonitpur district|Sonitpur]] and [[North Lakhimpur]] districts of [[Assam]].

Their population of around 300,000 makes them the most populous tribe of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], closely followed by the combined tribes of the [[Adi people|Adi]] and [[Galo tribe|Galo]], who were the most populous in the 2001 census. The [[Nishi language|Nyishi language]] belongs to the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] family, however, the origin is disputed.

[[Polygyny]] is prevalent among the Nyishi. It signifies one's social status and economical stability and also proves handy during hard times like clan wars or social huntings and various other social activities. This practice, however is  diminishing especially with the modernization and also with the spread of Christianity. They trace their descent [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]] and are divided into several clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arunachal Pradesh|author=India Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Published by Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India|year=1979|pages=15–6|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
The Nyishi are agriculturalists who practice [[Slash-and-burn|''jhum'']], known as ''rag'' in [[Nishi language|Nishi]], which is a form of shifting cultivation. The principal crops raised include paddy (unmilled rice), ''tapio'' ([[maize]]), ''mekung'' ([[cucumber]]), ''takie'' ([[ginger]]), ''aange'' ([[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s) and ''temi'' ([[millet]]). Rice is the staple food of the people, supplemented by fish, meat of various animals, edible tubers and leafy vegetables. Before a Western market economic system arrived, they used a barter system. They greatly valued the generalized reciprocity and also balance reciprocity in their economic system. A locally-made drink known as ''apong'' (the two types of ''apong'': ''pone'', made of rice, and ''poling'' which is made of millet) is served at every social gatherings and important events. The Nyishis are typically fond of it.  Traditional ways of preparing them include steaming, roasting and smoking.  Recently they have been forced to move towards a market based exchange economy.

== Attire ==
Traditionally, Nyishi [[braid|plaited]] their hair and tie it neatly at the forehead with Tibetan thread. A brass skewer passes horizontally through the tied hair. Cane rings were worn around the waist, arms and legs. Men wore a cane helmet surmounted with the beak of the [[Great hornbill|great Indian hornbill]]. The usage of actual hornbill beaks is discouraged these days due to tough wildlife protection laws since the great Indian hornbill is a protected species and generally due to growing awareness among the people as well. Nowadays It is being supplemented by beaks made of cane or other materials and the entire headgear/cane helmet itself is readily available in the market for purchase. Additional decorations varied depending upon the status of the person and were symbols of manly valor.

The clothing of the men consists of sleeveless shirts made from thick cotton cloth, striped gaily with blue and red together with a mantle of cotton or wool fastened around the throat and shoulders. Strings made of beads in varying sizes and colours were also worn, mainly for decoration purposes and to show the wearer's status. They also carry a Machete called [[dao (sword)|dao]] (''uriuk, chiighee'' in Nyishi) ([[short sword]]) and a knife (''Ryukchak'') in a [[bamboo]] sheath that are mostly covered with animal furs. Their armament consists of spear with iron-head, a large [[Dao (sword)|sword]] (dao), and a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrows which are tipped with poison (''umiyu''). During war both the chest and back are covered with shields made from [[gayal|sabbe]] buffalo hide, and over it they wear a black cloak made of indigenous fibre.

The Nyishi women generally wear a sleeveless mantle of striped or plain cloth, its upper part tucked tightly over the breast and enveloping the body from the armpits to the centre of the calves. A ribbon is tied at the waist. A [[girdle]] consisting of metal disks and cane [[garter (stockings)|garter]]s is worn at the waist. Their hair is parted in the middle, plaited and tied into a [[Chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] just above the nape. Their ornaments include multicolored bead necklaces, brass chains, metal bells, huge brass or silver earrings and heavy bracelets of various metals.

== Religion ==
[[File:Nyokum festival Nyishi.JPG|thumb|A festival of the Nyishi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, India.]]''Nyokum'' is the festival celebrated by the Nyishi people, which commemorates their ancestors.

Most Nyishis have been converted to Christianity by Christian missionaries in the 1970s, particularly in the Papum Pare region and  Christianity is the major religion among the Nyishis. Small groups of Hindus also exist among the Nyishi.

== The hornbill issue ==
The Nyishis, who traditionally wear cane helmets surmounted by the crest of a [[Great Indian hornbill|hornbill]] beak (known as pudum, padam), have considerably affected the population of this bird.

Several organizations, such as the Arunachal Wildlife and Nature Foundation and the [[Wildlife Trust of India]], have been trying to stop the Nyishi hunting these birds in order to protect them from extinction. Nature reserves, such as the Pakke Sanctuary, are being set up to protect the birds, while artificial materials, such as [[fiberglass]], have been introduced as an alternative to the hornbill beak in Nyishi dress.

'''Pagan Pride''' is a movement among [[Neopaganism in the United States|American]] [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagans]] to build a positive public image of Paganism. Local Pagan Pride groups sponsor "Pagan Pride Day" festivals, usually in public locations such as city parks or university campuses. The first recorded reference to "Pagan Pride" can be traced to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Pagan Pride Project|url=http://www.paganpride.org/what/history|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pagan Pride Project==
The Pagan Pride Project is an organization whose aims are to promote understanding of Paganism, support various charities, and bring Pagan communities closer together. The project's logo shows various Pagan symbols encircling the Earth—the [[Yin and yang|yin/yang]] symbol, [[Celtic cross]], [[Mjöllnir]], a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] symbol, an [[Eye of Horus]], [[Venus of Willendorf]], [[ankh]], [[pentagram]], [[triskelion]], Stone [[Megalith]], [[Green Man]], [[Enneagram (geometry)|Enneagram]], and the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Tree of life]].

==Pagan Pride Day==
Pagan Pride Day is an annual event held in a variety of locations across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pagan Pride Project Events |url=http://www.paganpride.org/where#TOC-Complete-List-of-Events |accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities are as varied as the communities who organize them. Some events are simple open [[picnic]]s or [[Barbecue|cook-out]]s held in a local park; others are full-fledged festivals with rented venues, performance stages, and food facilities. There are, however, several common elements.

First and foremost is the goal of educating the public about the beliefs and practices of various [[List of Modern pagan movements|Neopagan traditions]]. The general public is invited and there are usually tables of reading materials, staffed by members of a range of Neopagan denominations. Speakers or [[workshop]]s may focus on dispelling common misconceptions about Neopaganism, or may seek to educate outsiders about the details of their particular beliefs and practices.

The second most common aspect is charitable work. Many Pagan Pride coordinating committees choose a local [[Charitable organization|charity]] to support with fundraising and/or donations raised by the event. These charities might be organizations related to [[environmental conservation]], [[Animal rescue group|animal rescues]], [[Food bank|food pantries]], shelters for victims of [[domestic violence]], or related causes.

Pagan Pride Day events are open to the public and generally welcoming to families and children. Hosting a PPD event requires adherence to a range of policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pagan Pride Project Event Policies|url=http://www.paganpride.org/do/policies

In the [[New Testament]], a '''presbyter''' (Greek πρεσβύτερος: "elder")  is a leader of a local Christian congregation. The word derives from the Greek ''presbyteros,'' which means elder or senior. The Greek word ''episkopos'' literally means overseer; it refers exclusively to the office of [[bishop]]. Many understand ''presbyteros'' to refer to the bishop functioning as overseer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In predominant [[Protestant]] usage, ''presbyter'' does not refer to a member of a distinctive priesthood called ''priests,'' but rather to a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[pastor]], or [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]].

==Etymology==
The word ''presbyter'' [[etymology|etymologically]] derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πρεσβύτερος'' (''presbyteros''), the comparative form of ''πρέσβυς'' (''presbys''), "old man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2386306|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, πρέσβυ^ς|work=tufts.edu|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the English word priest has presbyter as the etymological origin,&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', College Edition, The World Publishing Company, Cleveland OH, s.v. "priest"&lt;/ref&gt;  the distinctive Greek word  (Greek ἱερεύς ''hiereus'')  for  "priest" is never used for presbyteros/episkopos in the New Testament, except as being part of the general priesthood of all believers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buchanan|first1=Colin|title=Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism|date=Oct 22, 2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1442250154|page=483|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first Christians making a distinction between sacerdotal Jewish and pagan priests and New Testament pastors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=Ronald A.|title=The hidden stream|date=2003|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0898708639|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest organization of the [[Christian Church|Church]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] was according to most scholars similar to that of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, but it had a council or college of ordained presbyters ({{lang-el|πρεσβύτεροι}} ''elders''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|title=presbuteros|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/4245.htm|website=Bible Hub|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:30&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|11:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{bibleref|Acts|15:22}}, we see a collegiate system of government in Jerusalem though headed by [[James the Just|James]], according to tradition the first bishop of the city. In {{bibleref|Acts|14:23}}, the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] ordains presbyters in the churches he founded.

The term presbyter was often not yet clearly distinguished from the term overseer (ἐπίσκοποι ''episkopoi'', later exclusively used as meaning bishop), as in {{bibleref|Acts|20:17}}, [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 1:5–7&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Titus|1:5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1 Peter]] 5:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1Peter|5:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1997 edition revised 2005, page 211: "It seems that at first the terms 'episcopos' and 'presbyter' were used interchangeably ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Christianity, volume 1, 2006, "The general consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the first and second centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable."&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest writings of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], the [[Didache]] and the [[First Epistle of Clement]] for example, show the church used two terms for local church offices—presbyters (seen by many as an interchangeable term with episcopos or overseer) and [[deacon]].

In [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] and [[Titus (Biblical)|Titus]] in the New Testament a more clearly defined episcopate can be seen. We are told that Paul had left Timothy in [[Early centers of Christianity#Western Anatolia|Ephesus]] and Titus in [[Crete]] to oversee the local church ({{bibleref|1Tim|1:3}} and {{bibleref|Titus|1:5}}). Paul commands them to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight, telling Titus to "rebuke with all authority" ({{bibleref|Titus|2:15}}).

Early sources are not clear, but various groups of Christian communities would have had a group of college or presbyter-overseers functioning as leaders of the local churches.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 140"&gt;{{cite book |first=John|last=O'Grady|title=The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the head or "monarchic" bishop came to rule more clearly,&lt;ref name="Cath Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite CE1913 |last=Van Hove|first= A.|wstitle=Bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all local churches would eventually follow the example of the other churches and structure themselves after the model of the others with the one bishop in clearer charge,&lt;ref name="O'Grady 140"/&gt; though the role of the body of priests remained important.&lt;ref name="Cath Encyclopedia"/&gt;

From the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], it is certain that the offices of bishop and presbyter were clearly distinguished, the bishop was understood as the president of the council of presbyters, and so the bishop was distinguished both in honor and in prerogative from the presbyters, who were seen as deriving their authority by means of delegation from the bishop.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Each [[Episcopal see]] had its own bishop and his presence was necessary to consecrate any gathering of the church.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Eventually, as [[Christendom]] grew, individual congregations were no longer directly served by a bishop. The bishop in a large city (the [[Metropolitan bishop]]) would appoint a priest to pastor the flock in each congregation, acting as his delegate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The fourth century scholar [[Jerome]] (347–420) stated:

:"Therefore a presbyter is the same as a bishop is, and before that by the instigation of the devil emulations in respect to religion arose, and people began to say: I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, the churches were governed by the common counsel of the presbyters. But, after that each one was accustomed to regard those whom he had baptized as his own disciples and not of Christ, it was decreed in the whole world that one chosen from among the presbyters should be placed over the others...Therefore, as presbyters may know that by the custom of the church they are subject to the one who has been placed over them; so also bishops may understand that they are greater than presbyters more by custom than by the veritable ordinance of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catholic World, Volume 32|year=1881|publisher=Paulist Fathers|pages=73, 74}}Cf. Jerome, Letter 146 - to Evangelus&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly different other versions (quoting [[John Calvin]]) express the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Edwin|title=The Puritans and Their Principles|date=1846|publisher=Baker and Scribner|location=New York|pages=345, 346|url=https://archive.org/stream/puritanstheirpri00hallrich/puritanstheirpri00hallrich_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey Adger|first1=John|title=My life and times|date=1899|publisher=The Presbyterian Committee of Publication|isbn=978-1344733878|url=https://archive.org/stream/mylifetimes00adge/mylifetimes00adge_djvu.txt|page=247|pages=|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=John|title=Whose are the Fathers?: Or, the Teaching of Certain Anglo-Catholics|date=1867|publisher=Longmans, Green,|isbn=9785878932493|page=488|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] explanation suggests that the delegates were bishops in the actual sense of the term but that they neither possessed fixed sees nor had a special title. Since they were essentially itinerant, they confided the fixed necessary functions relating to the daily life of the community to the care of some of the better-educated and highly respected converts.&lt;ref name="Cath Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Along with this was the title "priest" being distinctively ascribed to presbyters/bishops.  Catholic writer Greg Dues, author of ''Catholic Customs &amp; Traditions'', explains that "Priesthood as we know it in the Catholic church was unheard of during the first generation of Christianity, because at that time priesthood was still associated with animal sacrifices in both the Jewish and pagan religions." "When the Eucharist came to be regarded as a sacrifice [after Rome's theology], the role of the bishop took on a priestly dimension. By the third century bishops were considered priests. Presbyters or elders sometimes substituted for the bishop at the Eucharist. By the end of the third century people all over were using the title 'priest' (hierus in Greek and sacerdos in Latin) for whoever presided at the Eucharist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dues|first1=Greg|title=Catholic customs &amp; traditions : a popular guide|date=1992|publisher=Twenty-Third Publications|location=Mystic, Conn.|isbn=978-0896225152|page=166|edition=Rev. and expanded.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
{{See also|Holy orders}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|non-Chalcedonian churches]], and similar groups typically refer to presbyters in English as [[priest]]s (''priest'' is etymologically derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''presbyteros'' via the [[Latin]] ''presbyter''). Collectively, however, their "college" is referred to as the "[[presbyterium]]", "presbytery", or "presbyterate".

This usage is seen by most Protestant Christians as stripping the [[laity]] of its [[priesthood of all believers|priestly status]], while those who use the term defend its usage by saying that, while they do believe in the ''priesthood'' (Greek ἱερεύς ''hiereus'' – a different word altogether, used in Rev 1:6, 1 Pet 2:9) of all believers, they do not believe in the ''eldership'' of all believers. This is generally true of [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]], who ordain elders as [[clergy]] ([[pastors]]) while affirming the priesthood of all believers. The evangelical (or ultra low-church) [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]] has abolished the use of the word "priest" for those ordained as such. They are now referred to as "presbyters". Presbyterians sometimes refer to their ruling elders and teaching elders (ministers) as presbyters.

The website of the [[International Standard Version]] of the Bible, a Protestant translation, responds to a criticism of its use of "elder" over "priest " by stating the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isvbible.com/catacombs/elders.htm|title=Elders|accessdate=January 6, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105095216/http://isv.org/catacombs/elders.htm|archivedate=November 5, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|
No Greek lexicons or other scholarly sources suggest that "presbyteros" means "priest" instead of "elder". The Greek word is equivalent to the Hebrew zaqen, which means "elder", and not priest. You can see the zaqenim described in Exodus 18:21–22 using some of the same equivalent Hebrew terms as Paul uses in the GK of 1&amp;2 Timothy and Titus. Note that the zaqenim are ''not'' priests (i.e., from the tribe of Levi) but are rather men of distinctive maturity that qualifies them for ministerial roles among the people.

Therefore, the NT equivalent of the zaqenim cannot be the Levitical priests. The Greek ''presbyteros'' (literally, the comparative of the Greek word for "old" and therefore translated as "one who is older") thus describes the character qualities of the ''episkopos''. The term "elder" would therefore appear to describe the character, while the term "overseer" (for that is the literal rendering of ''episkopos'') connotes the job description.

[[Christianity]] is the largest '''religion in Brazil''', with [[Roman Catholic]]s having the most adherents. [[Brazil]] possesses a richly spiritual society formed from the meeting of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the religious traditions of African slaves and indigenous people. This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of [[syncretistic]] practices within the overarching umbrella of [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Brazilian Roman Catholicism]], characterized by traditional [[Culture of Portugal#Festivities and holidays|Portuguese festivities]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/brazil |title=Brazil |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently Catholicism was overwhelmingly dominant. Rapid change in the 21st century has led to  a growth in secularism (no religious affiliation), and [[Evangelical]] [[Protestantism]] to over 22% of the population. The 2010 census indicates that under 65% of Brazilians consider themselves Catholic, down from 90% in 1970, leading Cardinal Cláudio Hummes to comment, "We wonder with anxiety: how long will Brazil remain a Catholic country?"&lt;ref&gt;Simon Romero, "A Laboratory for Revitalizing Catholicism,"  [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/world/americas/in-brazil-growing-threats-to-catholicisms-sway.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ''New York Times'' Feb 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/07/18/brazils-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=Brazil’s Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, when the first [[Brazilian Constitution|Brazilian Republican Constitution]] was set forth, Brazil ceased to have an official religion and has remained secular ever since, though the Catholic Church remained politically influential into the 1970s. The Constitution of Brazil guarantees [[Freedom of religion in Brazil|freedom of religion]] and strongly prohibits the [[State religion|establishment]] of any religion by banning government support or hindrance of religion at all levels.&lt;ref name="georgetown1"/&gt; In the 2010 census&lt;ref name="census2010"/&gt; 64.63% of the population declared themselves as Roman Catholic, 22.2% as [[Protestantism|Protestant]], 8% as [[irreligion|non religious]], and 5.2% as followers of other religions (mostly [[Spiritist]]s or Kardecists who follow the doctrines of [[Allan Kardec]], [[Umbanda|Umbandists]], [[Candomblé|Candomblers]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], and minorities of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s, and other groups).

Brazilian religions are very diversified and inclined to [[syncretism]].

===Roman Catholicism===
{{Main|Roman Catholicism in Brazil}}
[[File:Igreja roca.JPG|thumb|right|Catholic Church in [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]

Brazil has the largest number of Catholics in the world.&lt;ref name="Census2000"&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/populacao/religiao_Censo2000.pdf IBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics). ''2000 Census'']. Accessed 2007-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholicism]] has been Brazil's main religion since the beginning of the 16th century. It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.

During colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Roman Catholic faith and forced to pay taxes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but Roman Catholicism was kept as the official religion. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priests and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in "''freguesias''" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the Catholic Church. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.

The Catholicism practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the "''Círio de Nazaré''" in [[Belém]] and the "''Festa do Divino''" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.

The largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piauí]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%). Among the state capitals, [[Teresina]] has the largest proportion of Catholics in the country (86.010%), followed by [[Aracaju]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Florianópolis]] and [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]].&lt;ref name="Folha"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u83030.shtml Folha Online - Mundo.

=== Protestantism ===
{{Main|Protestantism in Brazil|Evangelicalism#Brazil}}
[[File:IURDSP2010.JPG|thumb|right|Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in [[São Paulo, São Paulo|São Paulo]].]]

Protestantism in Brazil largely originated with American missionaries in the second half of the 19th century, following up on efforts that began in the 1830s. [[Evangelical]] [[Protestantism]] and [[Pentecostalism]] has grown very rapidly in Brazil since the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Patrícia Birman, and Márcia Pereira Leite. "Whatever Happened to What Used to Be the Largest Catholic Country in the World?," ''Daedalus'' (2000) 129#2 pp. 271-290 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027637 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Census reported that 22.2% of the Brazilian population is Protestant, about 44 million people.  Brazil has many versions of Protestantism. These include neo-[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], old Pentecostals and Traditional Protestants (most of them [[Baptists]], [[Presbyterians]] and [[Methodists]]) predominantly from [[Minas Gerais]] to the South. In the same region, mainly Minas Gerais and [[São Paulo State|São Paulo]], large sections of the middle class, about 1-2% of the total population, is [[Kardecist Spiritism|Kardecist]], sometimes pure, sometimes in [[syncretism]] with Roman Catholicism. The [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], part of the [[Anglican Communion]], has some 120,000 members. Centers of neo-Pentecostalism are [[Londrina]] in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] state, as well the cities of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Belo Horizonte]] (capital of Minas Gerais), especially the suburban and nearby areas of these cities. [[Lutherans]] are concentrated mostly in the states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and in countryside regions of the states of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Espírito Santo]].

As of the year 2000, the largest proportion of Protestants is found in [[Northern Brazil|North]] (19.8%), [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]] (18.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeast]] (17.5%) regions. Among the state capitals, [[Rio de Janeiro]] has the largest proportion of non-Pentecostal Protestants in the country (10.07%), followed by [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], [[Porto Velho]], [[Cuiabá]] and [[Manaus]]. But [[Goiânia]] is the state capital with the largest proportion of Pentecostal Protestants in the country (20.41%), followed by [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]], [[Porto Velho]], [[Belém]] and [[Belo Horizonte]].&lt;ref name="Folha1"&gt;[http://datafolha.folha.uol.com.br/po/ver_po.php?session=447 Folha de S.Paulo.

=== Orthodox Christianity ===
[[File:Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa de São Paulo (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa|Metropolitan Orthodox Cathedral]], [[Vila Mariana (district)|Vila Mariana]], São Paulo.]]

The [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church is also present in Brazil. The [[Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa|Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral]], localized in [[São Paulo]], is the See of the Archdiocese of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]]  in São Paulo. It is an example of [[Byzantine architecture]] that can be appreciated in [[South America]]. Its construction, which begun in the 1940s, was inspired in the [[Hagia Sophia|Basilica of Hagia Sophia]] of [[Istanbul]] and was inaugurated in January 1954. According to IBGE, there were 131,571 Orthodox Christians in Brazil.&lt;ref name="census2010"/&gt;

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
In 2014 according to the denomination, Brazil had 767,449 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] with 11,562 congregations and a ratio of 1 Witness to 256 residents.&lt;ref&gt;2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/ref&gt;  However the 2010 census reported nearly 1.4 million people listed themselves as members.&lt;ref name="census2010"/&gt;

=== Latter-day Saints ===
{{main|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Brazil}}
The 2010 national census reported 226,509 people identifying as members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf|publisher= [[Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]] |title=  População residente, por situação do domicílio e sexo, segundo os grupos de religião - Brasil - 2010 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very different from the church's reported membership, in 2012, of 1,173,533&lt;ref name="lds"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsroom.lds.org/country/brazil |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |title= Brazil - LDS Statistics and Church Facts |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing some  to question the membership numbers reported by the LDS church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stack|first1=Peggy Fletcher|title=Brazil mystery: Case of the missing Mormons (913,045 of them, to be exact)|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/54497395-180/church-census-lds-reported.html.csp|accessdate=3 March 2015|work=Salt Lake City Tribune|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church also reports 1,940 congregations and 315 family history centers.&lt;ref name="lds"/&gt; The LDS Church now also has 6 temples spread out across the nation, in Campinas, Curitiba, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife, and São Paulo, with additional temples under construction or announced in Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, Belém, Brasília, and Salvador.

=== Spiritism ===
[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]
The word Spiritism refers to the Spiritist Doctrine, which can be found in Allan Kardec's 5 main books. Spiritism does follow Jesus's principal and his moral teachings. With almost 4 million adherents in 2010, is the second largest Religion of Brazil. Many confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candomblé]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. 
One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[União do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura Cósmica.

This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dicatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]'s principles of [[positivism]], based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.

== Non-Christian Religions ==
There are small populations of people professing [[Buddhism]] (215,000), Judaism (107,000), [[Islam in Brazil|Islam]] (35,000), [[Shinto]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] and a few other religions. They comprise 20th century [[Immigration|immigrants]] from [[East Asia]], the Middle East, or of recent immigrant descent.

=== African and indigenous religions ===
[[File:Orixa Yemanja Orossi.JPG|thumb|right|People during a celebration of Orisha, in [[Candomblé]] of ''Ile Ase Ijino Ilu Orossi''.]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1518 Figure of a Devotee of Shango Holding an Oshe Shango.jpg|180px|thumbnail|Figure of a Devotee of Shango Holding an Oshe Shango, Brooklyn Museum]]
[[Afro-Brazilian religions]] are syncretic religions, such as [[Candomblé]], that have many followers, mainly [[Afro-Brazilian]]s. They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Recife]], or [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the Southeast. The cities of [[São Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florianópolis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 "terreiros" (temples) in Florianópolis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candomblé which is the survival of [[West Africa]]n religion, there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]], indigenous and African beliefs. There is prejudice about "African cults" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.

Candomblé, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.

In current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candomblé terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.

From [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spirtitualists and folk religion.

Though these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.&lt;ref name="Mana2007"&gt;[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&amp;script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

=== Buddhism ===
[[File:Tibetan Buddhist Temple RS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple in [[Três Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]
{{Main|Buddhism in Brazil}}
Buddhism is probably the largest of all minority religions, with about 215,000 followers. This is mostly because of the large [[Japanese Brazilian]] community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (most notably the [[Soka Gakkai]]), and [[Zen]] are the most popular. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Três Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]
[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, São Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[São Paulo]].]]
{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}
The first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''cristãos-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly. According to the [[Inquisition]] reports, many New Christians living in Brazil during colonial times were condemned for secretly observing [[Judaism|Jewish customs]].&lt;ref name=jvt&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html Oreck, Alden. The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Brazil]. [[Jewish Virtual Library]]. Accessed 2008-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1630, the Dutch conquered portions of northeast Brazil and permitted the open practice of any religion. Many Jews came from the Netherlands to live in Brazil in the area dominated by the Dutch. Most of them were descendants of the Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Portugal in 1497. In 1636, the [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], the first [[synagogue]] in the Americas was built in [[Recife]], the capital of [[Dutch Brazil]].&lt;ref name=jvt/&gt; The original building remains to this day,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922773.html  Synagogue in Brazilian town Recife considered oldest in the Americas]. Haaretz 2007-11-12. Accessed 2008-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; but the Jews were forced to leave Brazil when the Portuguese-Brazilians retook the land in 1654.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul. Jews and the American Slave Trade, p. 60. Transaction Publishers, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7658-0660-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Jews that stayed in Brazil and openly practiced their religion came when the first Brazilian constitution granted freedom of religion in 1824, just after the independence. They were mainly [[Moroccan Jews]], descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497.

The first wave of [[Sephardic Jews]] was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. A final significant group came, fleeing [[Nazism]] or the destruction that followed World War II.

Brazil has the 9th largest [[Jewish population by country|Jewish community in the world]], about 107,329 by 2010, according to the [[IBGE]] Census.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf 2010 Brazilian census] Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.

[[Islam in Brazil]] may be presumed to have first been practiced by African slaves brought from West Africa. Scholars note that Brazil received more enslaved Muslims than anywhere else in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, Paul E., ''Muslim Encounters With Slavery in Brazil'', Markus Wiener Pub., 2007. {{ISBN|1-55876-378-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Ramadan]], in January 1835, a small group of black slaves and freedmen from [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador da Bahia]], inspired by [[Muslim]] teachers, rose up against the government in the [[Malê Revolt]], the largest [[slave rebellion]] in Brazil. (Muslims were called ''malê'' in [[Bahia]] at this time, from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''imale'' that designated a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Muslim.)  Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the ''malês'' very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made to force conversions to Catholicism and erase the popular memory of and affection towards [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Joao Jose Reis, ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia'', Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Barboza, ''American Jihad'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend has been the increase in [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]]s to Islam among non-Arab citizens.&lt;ref name=religiousfreedom2006&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127381.htm "Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor International Religious Freedom Report 2009"] October 26, 2009, US Department of State report on Brazil&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
Most of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East [[India]]ns. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]].

There are 1,500 PIOs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|People of Indian origin]]) and about 400 NRIs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian]]) in Brazil.

;First wave of Immigration
A small number of Sindhis had arrived here from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of [[Manaus]].

;Second wave of Immigration 
Consisted of university professors who arrived in the 190s and also in the 1970s.

Other PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially [[Mozambique]]), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.

There are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in São Paulo.

Beside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Brazil}}
The Bahá'í Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] first visiting the country that year,&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Bahá'í [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928. There followed a period of growth with the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] from the United States finding national Brazilian converts and in 1961 an independent national Bahá'í community was formed. During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bahá'í community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bahá'í community in the country have continued to multiply. The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'') estimated some 42211 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reliquary''' (also referred to as a ''[[shrine]]'' or by the French term ''châsse'') is a container for [[relic]]s. These may be the purported or actual physical remains of [[saint]]s, such as bones, pieces of clothing, or some object associated with saints or other religious figures. The authenticity of any given relic is often a matter of debate; for that reason, some churches require documentation of the relic's provenance.

Relics have long been important to [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and many other religions.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Gandhāran Reliquaries" K. Walton Dobbins. ''East and West'', 18 (1968), pp. 151–162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Stūpa and Vihāra of Kanishka I''. K. Walton Dobbins. (1971) The Asiatic Society of Bengal Monograph Series, Vol. XVIII. Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Is the Kaniṣka Reliquary a work from Mathurā?" Mirella Levi d’Ancona. ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 31, No. 4 (Dec., 1949), pp. 321–323.&lt;/ref&gt; In these cultures, reliquaries are often presented in shrines, churches, or temples to which the faithful make [[pilgrimage]]s in order to gain blessings. 

The term is sometimes used loosely of containers for the body parts of non-religious figures; in particular the [[Kings of France]] often specified that their hearts and sometimes other organs be buried in a different location from their main burial.

The use of reliquaries became an important part of [[Christian]] practices from at least the 4th century, initially in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]], which adopted the practice of moving and dividing the bodies of saints much earlier than the West, probably in part because the new capital of [[Constantinople]], unlike Rome, lacked buried saints.  Relics are venerated in the [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]] and some [[Anglican]] Churches.  Reliquaries provide a means of protecting and displaying relics.  While frequently taking the form of caskets,&lt;ref name=boehm/&gt; they range in size from simple pendants or rings to very elaborate [[ossuary|ossuaries]].

Since the relics themselves were considered "more valuable than precious stones and more to be esteemed than gold," &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0102.htm Quote from the 'Martyrdom of St Polycarp' (2nd Century AD )]&lt;/ref&gt; it was only appropriate that they be enshrined in containers crafted of or covered with gold, silver, gems, and enamel.&lt;ref name=boehm&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/relc/hd_relc.htm Boehm, Barbara Drake. "Relics and Reliquaries in Medieval Christianity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art,(October 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory was widely used in the Middle Ages for reliquaries; its pure white color an indication of the holy status of its contents.&lt;ref name=speakman&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Reliquary.php Speakman, Naomi C., "Treasures of Heaven", The British Museum, London, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; These objects constituted a major form of artistic production across Europe and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages.

Many were designed with portability in mind, often being exhibited in public or carried in [[procession]] on the saint's [[feast day]] or on other [[Liturgical year|holy days]]. [[Pilgrimage]]s often centered on the [[veneration]] of relics. The faithful often venerate relics by bowing before the reliquary or kissing it. Those churches which observe the veneration of relics make a clear distinction between the honor given to the saints and the worship that is due to God alone (see [[Second Council of Nicea]]). The ''feretrum'' was a medieval form of reliquary or [[shrine]] containing the sacred [[effigies]] and relics of a saint. 

Perhaps the most magnificent example is that known as the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] in [[Cologne Cathedral]]. After the storming of Milan in 1162 the supposed relics of the Magi were carried off and brought to Cologne, where a magnificent silver casket, nearly 6 feet long, and 4.5 feet high was constructed for them. This superb piece of silversmith's work resembles in outward form a church with a nave and two aisles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12762a.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Reliquaries." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 14 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late Middle Ages the craze for relics, many now fraudulent, became extreme, and was criticized by many otherwise conventional churchmen.

16th-century reformers such as [[Martin Luther]] opposed the use of relics since many had no proof of historic authenticity, and they objected to the cult of saints. Many reliquaries, particularly in northern Europe, were destroyed by [[Calvinist]]s or Calvinist sympathizers  during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], being melted down or pulled apart to recover precious metals and gems. Nonetheless, the use and manufacture of reliquaries continues to this day, especially in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] countries. Post-Reformation reliquaries have tended to take the form of glass-sided caskets to display relics such as the bodies of saints.

===Forms===
The earliest reliquaries were essentially boxes, either simply box-shaped or based on an architectural design, taking the form of a model of a church with a pitched roof.  These latter are known by the French term [[Chasse (casket)|chasse]], and typical examples from the 12th to 14th century have wooden frameworks with [[gilding|gilt-copper]] plaques nailed on, decorated in [[champlevé enamel]].  [[Limoges]] was the largest centre of production; NB the English usage differs from that of the French ''châsse'', which denotes large size rather than shape.

[[File:French - Reliquary for a Finger Bone - Walters 57690.jpg|thumb|upright|Franco-Flemish Gothic philatory for a finger bone, late 15th century ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
Relics of the [[True Cross]] became very popular from the 9th century onwards and were housed in magnificent gold and silver cross-shaped reliquaries, decorated with enamels and precious stones. From about the end of the 10th century, reliquaries in the shape of the relics they housed also became popular; hence, for instance, the skull of [[Pope Alexander I]] was housed in a head-shaped reliquary. Similarly, the bones of saints were often housed in reliquaries that recalled the shape of the original body part, such as an arm or a foot.

Many [[Eastern Orthodox]] reliquaries housing tiny pieces of relics have circular or cylindrical slots in which small disks of [[wax-mastic]] in which the actual relic is embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomov |first1=Nikola |last2=Dzhangozov |first2=Januarius (Yanko) |title=Wax Embedding as a Method for Preservation of Body Relics Used by the Orthodox Church |journal=Acta Morphologica et Anthropologica |volume=25 |issue=1-2 |page=122-125 |url=http://www.iempam.bas.bg/journals/acta/acta25a/122-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''philatory''' is a transparent reliquary designed to contain and exhibit the [[bone]]s and relics of saints.  This style of reliquary has a viewing portal by which to view the relic contained inside.

During the later [[Middle Ages]], the [[monstrance]] form, mostly used for consecrated hosts, was sometimes used for reliquaries. These housed the relic in a rock crystal or glass capsule mounted on a column above a base, enabling the relic to be displayed to the faithful. Reliquaries in the form of large pieces of metalwork jewellery also appeared around this time, housing tiny relics such as pieces of the [[Crown of thorns|Holy Thorn]], notably the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] now in the [[British Museum]].

==In Buddhism==

In Buddhism, [[stupa]] are an important form of reliquary, and may be included in a larger complex known as a [[chaitya]]. Particularly in China and throughout East and Southeast Asia, these take the form of a [[pagoda]]; in Japan this is known as a ''[[tō]]''.

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, relics are known as [[cetiya]]; one of the most significant in the [[relic of the tooth of the Buddha]] in [[Sri Lanka]].

In Japan, Buddhist relics are known as {{Nihongo||舎利|shari}}, and are often stored in a {{Nihongo||舎利殿|shariden|relic hall, reliquary}} – see [[Japanese Buddhist architecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1687">'''Samuel Jesi''' (1789 – January 17, 1853) was an Italian engraver.

He was born in [[Milan]] in 1789, he was a pupil of [[Giuseppe Longhi]] at the [[Brera Academy]] of Milan. His first work (1821) was "The Abandonment of Hagar", engraved after a painting by [[Guercino]] in the Palazzo di Brera at Milan; this was followed (1834) by "The Madonna with St. John and St. Stephen", from a painting by [[Fra Bartolomeo]] in the [[Cathedral of Lucca]]. He then devoted himself to the works of [[Raphael]], whom he ably interpreted. His masterpiece is the group representing [[Pope Leo X]] with Cardinals Rossi and [[Giulio dei Medici]] (1834). While in Paris for the purpose of having it printed he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], and received the ribbon of the [[Legion of Honor]]. In 1846 he began to work on his engraving of the "Cœna Domini", discovered in the Church of S. Onofrio, Florence, and attributed to Raphael. Meanwhile, he engraved the "Madonna della Vite." In 1849 he completed the drawing of the "Cœna Domini", but died in [[Florence]] before finishing the engraving.

[[File:The Tree Saxon.gif|thumb|right|200px|''The Tree'' (1974) was the founding text of the Seax tradition.]]
'''Seax-Wica''' is a tradition, or denomination, of the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] which is largely inspired by the iconography of the historical [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], though, unlike [[Theodism]], it is not a reconstruction of the early mediaeval religion itself.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland's Book of Saxon Witchcraft, {{ISBN|1-57863-328-1}}, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was founded in 1973 by [[Raymond Buckland]], an English-born high priest of [[Gardnerian Wicca]] who moved to the [[United States]] in the 1970s. His book, ''[[The Tree (Seax-Wica)|The Tree]]'', was written with the intent for it to be a definitive guide to Seax-Wica, and was published in 1974 by Samuel Weiser, and subsequently republished in 2005 as ''Buckland's Book of Saxon Witchcraft''.

The tradition primarily honours four principal deities: [[Woden]], [[Thunor]], [[Frig (Anglo-Saxon goddess)|Frig]] or [[Freya]] and [[Týr|Tiw]]. These are seen as representations of the Wiccan deities of the [[Horned God]] and the [[Mother Goddess]]. The tradition uses a minimal set of ceremonial tools, including a spear. Runes are also significant.
== Openness ==
Seax-Wica does not employ any secrecy oath.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland's Book of Saxon Witchcraft, {{ISBN|1-57863-328-1}}, page xi.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buckland's Book of Saxon Witchcraft'' was written in mind that the reader would already be well versed in the various techniques of Witchcraft and Wiccan ritual. However, Buckland has pointed out that his ''Complete Book of Witchcraft'' gives instructions on how to proceed when no tools are available. These instructions are enough to allow one to begin, self-initiate, and consecrate one's first tools.
== Organisation ==
Seax-Wica allows self-dedication as entry into its tradition. In the Seax tradition, covens work by a form of democracy, electing, un-electing, and re-electing coven officers, the high priest and priestess. Within ritual settings, there are the '''thegn''', a type of sergeant-at-arms/guard/watchman, who can also be responsible for the covenstead (the meeting place of the coven), or guarding a ceremony being performed; there is also a scribe/secretary, who keeps most, if not all, of the coven's records. The word "''[[Thegn]]''", or "''Thane''" is an Anglo-Saxon title (''[[Anglo-Saxon]]'': þeg(e)n meaning "a servant, one who does service for another."&lt;ref name="BTDictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title='þegen' - Bosworth–Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/031613|website=bosworth.ff.cuni.cz|accessdate=12 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Buckland was not the head of the tradition, but is respected as its founder, and continued to practice and contribute to it, until his death on September 27, 2017.

The first elected steward of Seax Wica is Wulfeage (Sean Percival) on 2006,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} who was elected by covens worldwide and is still steward to this day.

'''Sepa''' was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, who lived during Third dynasty.

Sepa was a [[priest]] and noble. His titles were "Responsible for Royal Matters", "Greatest of the ten of [[Upper Egypt]]", "Priest of the god Kherty" and "Herdsman of the White [[Bull]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225196&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225196&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500806&amp;baseIndex=3&amp;bmLocale=en Statues of Sepa and Nesa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615182824/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225196&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225196&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500806&amp;baseIndex=3&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sepa's wife was Nesa, and she was buried with him at [[Saqqara]] in a [[mastaba]]. Two statues of him and one of his wife were found in their grave and are now in the [[musée du Louvre]] in Paris. These statues are amongst the masterpieces of the art of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]].

'''"Should The Bible Be Banned"''' was the sixth [[Single (music)|single]] by [[McCarthy (band)|McCarthy]]. Like many of the band's singles it did not appear on any of the band's [[studio albums]]. 

The [[b-sides]] were "St. Francis Amongst The Mortals" and "We Are All Bourgeois Now". The latter was covered by [[Manic Street Preachers]] on their album ''[[Know Your Enemy (Manic Street Preachers album)|Know Your Enemy]]''.

The title track recounts how someone is inspired to kill his brother by reading the story of [[Cain and Abel]] in the Bible. The song's aim is to [[reductio ad absurdum|reduce to absurdity]] calls to [[Book censorship|ban books]] and [[film censorship|films]] following [[Tabloid journalism|well-publicised acts of violence]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/readersrecommend/story/0,,2230348,00.html |title=Readers recommend ...

[[Image:Tarot 1JJ - Jupiter.png|right|thumb|Jupiter, the fifth trump]]
The '''Swiss 1JJ Tarot''' deck is a 78-card deck used for the [[tarot card games]] [[Troccas]] and [[Troggu]] and also for divination.

The deck is derived from the Tarot de Besançon which itself comes from the [[Tarot of Marseilles]].&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=166–168, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-7.html Swiss Tarot] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 24 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Italian playing cards|Italian suited pack]] which substitutes the figures of Juno and Jupiter in place of the Popess and Pope of the Tarot of Marseilles. The first decks were made around 1860 by Johannes Müller in [[Diessenhofen]]. The [[face card]]s are not double-headed and both the [[trump (card games)|trump]]s and pip cards use [[Roman numerals#Alternative forms|additive Roman numeral]] indexing. The lack of modern features like vertically symmetrical face cards, corner indices, and Arabic numerals has made this deck unpopular for tarot players outside of their native communities. For example, the [[Romandy|French-speaking Swiss (Romands)]] prefer using the [[Tarot Nouveau]] to play [[French Tarot]]. It is still the official deck for Troccas tournaments.

Troccas players use the French language version but refer to their cards with their [[Romansh language|Romansh]] (Rhæto-Romanic) nicknames.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/tarot/troccas.html#terminology Troccas] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 13 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Troggu players use the German version. The English version uses [[cartomancy|cartomantic]] terminology. The names of the trump cards are as follows:

The '''Sze Yup Temple''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] 四邑關帝廟&lt;ref name="Epoch Times - 2 February 2008 - 悉尼新年活動不受四邑關帝廟部分焚燬影響"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/8/2/2/n1999744.htm|title=悉尼新年活動不受四邑關帝廟部分焚燬影響|date=2 February 2008|work=[[Epoch Times]]|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a heritage-listed  [[Chinese temple|Chinese joss house]] and [[Taoist]] temple located at Victoria Road in the [[Inner West|inner western]] [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] in the [[City of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was built from 1898 to 1904. It is also known as '''Sze Yup Temple &amp; Joss House''', '''Sze Yup Kwan Ti Temple''', '''Joss House and Chinese Temple'''. The property is owned by Trustees of the Sze Yup Temple. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045668|Sze Yup Temple &amp; Joss House|hr=00267|fn=S90/05779 &amp; HC 32539|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only four pre-[[World War I]] Chinese temples that remain active in Australia.&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet - Sydney - Sze Yup Temple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/sydney/sights/religious/sze-yup-temple|title=Sydney - Sze Yup Temple|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its form, and those of the grounds, reflect the architectural style of Sze Yup County ([[Siyi]]) in [[Guangdong]], [[China]]. The central hall (1898) holds the Kwan Ti shrine, with the later eastern and western halls (1903) serving as an ancestral hall and hall dedicated to [[Caishen]] (''Choi Buk Sing'', 財神), the god of wealth.

== History ==
=== History of the area ===
[[File:(1)Sze Yup Temple-10.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kwan Ti]] shrine]]
The [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] area was originally inhabited by the [[Wangal]] clan of Aborigines.  After 1788 diseases such as smallpox and the loss of their hunting grounds caused huge reductions in their numbers and they moved further inland.  Since European settlement the foreshores of [[Blackwattle Bay]] and [[Rozelle Bay]] have developed a unique maritime, industrial and residential character - a character which continues to evolve as areas which were originally residential estates, then industrial areas, are redeveloped for residential units and parklands.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The fist formal [[land grant|grant]] in the Glebe area was a {{convert|400|acre|ha|0|adj=on|order=flip}} grant to Rev. [[Richard Johnson (chaplain)|Richard Johnson]], the colony's first chaplain, in 1789.  The Glebe (land allocated for the maintenance of a church minister) comprised rolling shale hills covering sandstone, with several sandstone cliff faces.  The ridges were drained by several creeks including Blackwattle Creek, [[Orphan School Creek]] and Johnston Creek.  Extensive swampland surrounded the creeks.  On the shale ridges, heavily timbered woodlands contained several varieties of eucalypts while the swamplands and tidal mudflats had mangroves, swamp oaks (''[[Casuarina glauca]]'') and blackwattles (''[[Callicoma]] serratifolia'') after which the bay is named.  Blackwattle Swamp was first mentioned by surveyors in the 1790s and Blackwattle Swamp Bay in 1807.  By 1840 it was called Blackwattle Bay.  Boat parties collected wattles and reeds for the building of huts, and kangaroos and emus were hunted by the early settlers who called the area the Kangaroo Ground.  Rozelle Bay is thought to have been named after a schooner which once moored in its waters.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Johnson's land remained largely undeveloped until 1828, when the Church and School Corporation subdivided it into 28 lots, three of which they retained for church use.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-1&gt;City Plan Heritage, 2005, quoting [[Max Solling]] &amp; Peter Reynolds "Leichhardt: On the Margins of the City", 1997, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; The Church sold 27 allotments in 1828 - north on the point and south around [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]]. The Church kept the middle section where the Glebe Estate is now. Up until the 1970s the Glebe Estate was in the possession of the Church.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; On the point the sea breezes attracted the wealthy who built villas.  The Broadway end attracted slaughterhouses and boiling down works that used the creek draining to Blackwattle Swamp. Smaller working-class houses were built around these industries. Abbattoirs were built there from the 1860s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; When Glebe was made a municipality in 1859 there were pro and anti-municipal clashes in the streets.  From 1850 Glebe was dominated by wealthier interests.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Reclaiming the swamp, [[Wentworth Park]] opened in 1882 as a cricket ground and lawn bowls club. Rugby union football was played there in the late 19th century. The dog racing started in 1932. In the early 20th century modest villas were broken up into boarding houses as they were elsewhere in the inner city areas. The wealthier moved into the suburbs which were opening up through the railways.  Up until the 1950s Sydney was the location for working class employment - it was a port and industrial city. By the 1960s central Sydney was becoming a corporate city with service-based industries - capital intensive not labour intensive. A shift in demographics occurred, with younger professionals and technical and administrative people servicing the corporate city wanting to live close by. Housing was coming under threat and the heritage conservation movement was starting. The Fish Markets moved in in the 1970s. A  influx of students came to Glebe in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-2&gt;Murray, Dr Lisa, ''Central Sydney'', 5 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

=== Allen family and the Toxteth Park Estate ===
Much of Glebe, including the temple site, was acquired by lawyer [[George Allen (Australian politician)|George Allen]] (1800-77) in 1827. Allen named his estate [[Toxteth Park, Glebe|Toxteth Park]] Estate and had a house designed by eminent colonial architect [[John Verge]] (1772-1861). The house was completed in 1834, named after the home of the family's friend Sir Robert Wigram.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-3&gt;Pollen &amp; Healy, 1988, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Toxteth Park was a rectangular two-storey block with single-storey wings, a stone-flagged verandah on two sides, with the kitchen and servants' quarters behind. During extensions in 1878-81 the ground floor was renovated, but the present-day long drawing-room and bay window retain many original features.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The son of a London physician who died in financial straits, Allen was brought to Australia by his widowed mother and became the first solicitor to be trained in this country. An active Wesleyan, he established what became a successful legal firm. He married Jane Bowden in 1823 and she produced five boys and five girls who survived infancy, the most noteworthy, historically, being [[George Wigram Allen]] in 1824. By 1831 he had acquired {{convert|96|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of Glebe land and commissioned John Verge to build Toxteth Park, the foundation stone for which was laid on 21 March 1829.  Allen also led an active public life, serving as [[Mayor of Sydney]] (1844-45), President of the [[Bank of New South Wales]] (1860-66), MLC (1845-73) and Fellow of the Senate at the [[University of Sydney]] (1859-77). Today the legal firm of [[Allens (law firm)|Allen, Allen &amp; Hemsley]] still maintains a high profile in Sydney and their corporate contemporary art collection, exceeding 1,000 paintings, embraces the theme of "art in the workplace".&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Son of Jane and the previously-named George Allen, who was articled to his father, George Wigram Allen entered the law practice in 1847, which continued to expand as a thriving enterprise. He also inherited his father's enthusiasm for religion (helping to create the YMCA), public affairs,&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-4&gt;Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] 1860-61&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Sydney Senate (1878-85) and business.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; G. W. Allen (1824-85) was involved in the incorporation of Glebe as a municipality, becoming its first Mayor in 1859, a post he held for 18 years. From 1869-82 he represented Glebe in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], was [[Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Speaker]] from 1875-82 and for these many services was knighted in 1884.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

During that time he sponsored the reclamation of Wentworth Park and, together with [[Edmund Blacket]] and Glebe Council members, was responsible for Glebe's water supply and gas lighting as well as the construction of new streets. The Allens, both father and son, were keen cricketers and built a private ground in what is now bounded by [[Glebe Point]] and Toxteth Roads and Mansfield and Boyce Streets. It was here that [[Frederick Spofforth]], a great bowler who lived in Derwent Street, frequently played. Upon his father's death in 1877 G. W. Allen made extensive additions to Toxteth Park, when a third storey, tower and ballroom were added. However Sir George did not live so long after his father (he lived at Toxteth Park Estate until 1885) and subsequently this stalwart Wesleyan's house, in 1901, was sold to the Sisters of the Good Samaritan, a Benedictine Order, which is today [[St Scholastica's College]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-3/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; He had amassed a fortune of {{Australian pound|300,000||}} by the time of his death. Two nearby street names recall the first owners of the home - Wigram and Allen.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; The Toxteth Park Estate included Harold Park to the west and downhill from Toxteth Park Lodge. Harold Park was part of Allen's Toxteth Park Estate (now reduced and renamed St Scholastica's). Allen leased Harold Park to Joynton Smith who ran a small proprietary race track. It went to the Harness Racing Association in 1912.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Lady Allen's charitable interests helped to establish the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children]], which until quite recently focused on the health of Sydney's children - the hospital is now closed and the large site is developing into a new housing area to be known as the City Quarter.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-5&gt;The Glebe Society, accessed 22/9/9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

===Sze Yup Temple===
When Chinese settlers in Sydney decided to build a temple dedicated to the Chinese folk hero and god, [[Kwan Ti]] (sometimes Kwun Ti, or Kwung Ti), they prayed for a sign showing where the temple should be built. This led them to a market garden in Francis Street (now Edward Street) in Glebe which they purchased from the owner for {{Australian pound|325||}}. The temple was funded by immigrants from the area known as Sze Yup / Si Yi (Sze Yup), ('Four Districts') county of Guangdong /Kwongtung province, China.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The impetus to establish the Temple came from the Sze Yup community in NSW in the early 1890s, during a period of widespread hardship throughout the Australian community and a time of higher levels of racial tension.  People from the Sze Yup County were regarded as being particularly religious.  The proposal was supported by local Chinese organizations including the Chinese Masonic Society and well-known local figures including Johnny Moi Sing, Grandmaster of the Society.  Advice was received from the [[Melbourne]] Sze Yup Temple Trustees.  Funds were obtained from the Sze Yup Society levies, fundraising and donations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-7&gt;Singer, Mark; Chinese Australian Heritage Society, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The renowned Sze Yup Temple is dedicated to Kwan Ti, a warrior and patriot in the era of the Three Kingdoms 220 - 265 AD. Kwan Ti is famous for his loyalty, physical prowess and masculinity. In Australia, immigrant Chinese worshipped him as a wise judge, a guide and a protector. Many important business decisions, for example, were not made until Kwan Ti had been consulted for his guidance and blessing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The central temple in the Sze Yup complex was built in 1898. The simple red brick cottage was designed with the principles of Feng Shui in mind; it was located on land that sloped from the temple to the waters of Rozelle Bay. Inside the central temple is an altar with embroidered images of Kwan Ti and his guards, racks which hold Kwan Ti's Red Hair Horse and weapons, engraved couplets, prayers, a huge drum and gong and two beautiful carved columns which date from 1898.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-8&gt;Zhao, Karl. December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Lots 1 and 2 of the subdivision of Lot 23 of the Eglington Estate, the original Temple site, were purchased from Elizabeth Downes in 1897 for {{Australian pound|125||}}, close to a "Chinamens garden" (market gardens) that extended from the site northwest to Blackwattle Bay.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-9&gt;The Map of the Glebe Municipality 1888 CRS495&lt;/ref&gt;  The land formed part of the Toxteth Park (Allen) Estate, which remained substantially intact till the 1890s.  The Estate created a pleasure ground setting with cricket ground, orchards and gardens.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Covenants on the title explicitly required that any building to be erected on the land had to be "in keeping with the condition of the surrounding properties already erected or being erected on the Toxteth Estate", and "would not depreciate the value of any...surrounding properties".&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

It was clear that both vendor and purchasers understood that a Chinese temple was to be built on the land.  The covenant stated that it "should in no way be deemed to...refer to the erection of any house for the purpose of religion or Chinese joss house and caretakers residence which shall be properly and substantially built."&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

A local builder (a Mr Stewart or Mr Stuart) built the central hall in 1898, and appears to have built the adjoining halls in 1903.  A memorandum of agreement signed between the Trustees and an insurance manager for a mortgage refers to plans and specifications, which have not been located.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

A delegation from the Melbourne Sze Yup Temple attended the dedication of the Temple to Guan Di.  The dedication of the 1903 halls and subsequent celebrations over three days was reported in ''The Sydney Mail'' of 3 February 1904, reporting great excitement amongst Chinese and European onlookers.  Representatives of all major Chinese communities in Sydney attended.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The organiser of the celebrations, James Ah Chuey (Wong Chuey), was a well-known grazier and wool broker from the [[Riverina]], grandmaster of the Chinese Masonic Society and Trustee from 1923 to 1948.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

In 1904 the temple was flanked by two chapels, the Chapel of Departed Friends and the Chapel of Good Fortune.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

For the Chinese community in Sydney the Sze Yup Temple was a cultural centre as well as a place for worship. It was here that they could find social contact and companionship, material assistance or accommodation for travellers, new migrants and the sick. Celebrations and festivals such as the colourful and lively Chinese New Year took place at the temple. It was also used to house the bones of the deceased, before they were taken to China in urns for permanent burial, as tradition demanded.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

On 19 July 1985 a Permanent Conservation Order was made over the site. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. After 100 years, the Sze Yup Temple remains a sacred place to the Chinese community. Worshippers now include new arrivals from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, China and, in particular, Indo-China.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-8/&gt;

Subsequent purchases of adjoining lots were made as funds permitted to open the vista from the Temple to Blackwattle Bay for Guan Di. A third block (Lot 3) was purchased from Myles Augustus Downes in 1898, and the final block in front of the temple building (Lot 22) was purchased from Anne Pattison in 1918.  Three cottages were erected and rented to provide for the temple upkeep.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Temple Trustees represented the four Districts of Sze Yup. The responsibility for managing the Temple in the early years was rotated among the leading Sze Yup general stores in Sydney. The Temple Trustees were recorded as having modest occupations but appeared to be well-connected to the Chinese Masonic Society and the Yee Hing Society, the Chinese nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Temple acted as a cultural centre for the Chinese community, providing opportunities for mutual assistance, social contact, religious observances, celebration of festivities, settlement of disputes, funeral arrangements and temporary accommodation for travellers.  Bones of deceased settlers were stored in urns awaiting their return to China for permanent burial.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

As the local Chinese population aged and dwindled during the years of the [[White Australia Policy]], upkeep of the Temple became more difficult for the Trustees. Council rates were demanded until 1967. In 1951 Sydney City Council began to resume a part of the grounds (Lot 22) as a pre-school kindergarten, but after Trustee objections and involvement of the Chinese Consul-General, Council transferred the land back to the Trustees in 1955.  The [[Sydney County Council]] resumed the eastern corner of the property for an electrical sub-station built in 1951. A fire in the central hall in 1952 damaged the roof structure, and the fabric of the building deteriorated before and after repairs in 1953-1954.  The need for ongoing funding attracted developers and proposals were made during the 1960s to redevelop the lower end of the site.  However these proposals did not proceed, and the uniqueness of the place was retained.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Following refugee intakes from China and Vietnam and the repeal of the White Australia Policy in the 1970s, attendance at the Temple increased, and donations began to flow in.  Fundraising by the Trustees in 1977 was successful, and by 1979 work was carried out to address fabric damage and meet the needs of the recently-arrived worshippers of Guan Di and Cai Bai Xing.  Festivals grew in size and incense smoke in the temple became a health issue, so exhaust fans, new electrical wiring and lighting were installed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Debate had begun again in the 1970s about the future of the Temple buildings.  Some recent worshippers believed that the Temple should be demolished and rebuilt as a larger modern structure to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors.  Others wanted to modernise the existing structure with green glazed roof tiles imported from Taiwan.  There was much criticism of the original corrugated tin roofs of the 1898-1903 buildings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The newly-formed Heritage Council of NSW acting under the 1977 Heritage Act, believing that the original Glebe temple was a unique historical record and contributed to Australian society and culture, commenced negotiations with the Trustees to place a Permanent Conservation Order over the Temple and grounds, to ensure that this valuable legacy was retained for the whole community.  The negotiations concluded in 1984 with a gazetted Permanent Conservation Order and an agreed Masterplan for future community development on the land in 1985 that respected the importance and values of the original temple buildings and grounds.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The continuing growth of worshippers following the 1979 upgrading attracted attention, and Taiwan representatives in Sydney offered a large donation to help build a large gateway and perimeter wall around the block (much to the disapproval of the local Peoples Republic of China representatives).  The gateway and associated walling was completed and formally opened in 1983.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Throughout the 1990s, debate continued over the roles of the Temple and a number of proposals for community uses were made.  In 2003 Council refused a development application for a two storey community hall and office complex to the east of the Temple building, on the basis of over-development of the site, loss of heritage significance, anticipated traffic generation, and loss of significant curtilage and mature trees around the temple building.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; In 2008, a fire described as "[[Arson|deliberately lit]]" destroyed one of its buildings.&lt;ref name="Australian Brodcasting Corporation - 31 January 2008 - 'Sacrilegious' temple fire rocks Chinese New Year celebrations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2151612.htm|title='Sacrilegious' temple fire rocks Chinese New Year celebrations|date=31 January 2008|work=[[PM (Australian radio program)]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph (Australia) - 1 February 2008 - Sze Yup Buddhist temple set alight in Glebe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/buddhist-temple-set-alight/story-e6freuzi-1111115444644|title=Sze Yup Buddhist temple set alight in Glebe|last=Christie|first=Joel|date=1 February 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The site of the Sze Yup Temple is bounded on four sides by street frontage being Victoria Road, Edward Street, Eglington Lane and Edward Lane.  The total site area is approximately {{convert|3774|m2}}.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

A masonry fence bounds the site and the main entrance gateway front Edward Street. A secondary pedestrian entry and vehicular access is from Eglington Lane.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The central temple in the Sze Yup complex is constructed of red-brick reminiscent of village temples in the southern provinces of China. Mounted above the entrance is a sign that reads "The Temple of Kwan Ti", dated the 29th year of [[Guangxu Emperor]] Kuang Shu. Planning of the three halls separated by external side passages and roofed with small scaled pitched roofs to open lightwells is a typical temple type.  The front [[Veranda|verandah]] has bullnosed roofing and cast iron [[columns]].  The [[brickwork]] detailing has been happily adapted from the Edwardian to echo traditional construction.   Inside the temple is an altar with embroided images of Kwan Ti and his guards.  Racks hold Kwan Ti's Red Hair Horse and weapons.  Engraved couplets and prayers hang on the walls in front of a huge drum and gong.  Two beautiful carved columns date from 1898 and were originally intended for one of the nearby chapels but was too tall. On the wall are four sets of couplets which praise the virtues of Kwan Ti and express wishes for peace and tranquillity.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The building as originally sited to a water aspect (Blackwattle Bay) and subsequent land purchased in front of the temple and the buildings demolished, provided an auspiciious setting for the temple.  The importance attached to the concepts of "Feng Shui" in the temple and surroundings has prevented building to the front of the temple, and has a strong influence on the management of the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The central chapel is flanked by two chapels, the Chapel of Departed Friends (to the north) and the Chapel of Good Fortune (to the south). The site also contains toilet facilities in a separate structure adjacent to the temple (to the north-east) and a storage [[shed]] at the rear (south) of the temple.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 29 August 1997, the condition of the Template was excellent.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt; The Temple fabric is in excellent condition and most of the elements that retain the place's significance have not been compromised.  The original building curtilage remains, and many plantings exist from the early to mid-20th Century.  The curtilage remains little disturbed.  Late 20th Century changes to the place, such as the introduction of ventilation systems, replacement of a skylight and the construction of a new entrance gate, perimeter wall and small service buildings (eg. a new toilet block and storeroom), have enhanced the cultural values of the place with minor impact on historical values.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 31 January 2008, the Sze Yup Temple is an item of State heritage significance as a rare and intact example of a Chinese temple in Australia.  It is one of only two remaining places of worship for ethnic Chinese in New South Wales that predates the 1960s. It is one of four early (pre-Word War 1) Chinese temples that remain active in Australia, the other being located at [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]], (Sydney), in South Melbourne and at [[Breakfast Creek (Blacktown, New South Wales)|Breakfast Creek]], [[Brisbane]]. The Sze Yup Temple has been continuously used by the Chinese community since it was built, and is a focus for the identity of the Sze Yup community in NSW and for those involved with traditional Chinese culture and belief.  This tradition, intact temple is considered to be of both local and international significance.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Chinese community in Australia was instrumental, but unacknowledged, in the development of 19th Century Australian mining, agricultural, pastoral and furniture-making industries, and later in the growth of Australian import-export industries. In many parts of Australia in the 19th Century, Chinese at times exceeded numbers of European residents, leading to unique friendships and hostilities, particularly as economic-based competition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Temple and its extensive grounds reflect the architectural forms and landscaping of the Sze Yup County in Guangdong Province, China. The building form reflects that of many "village" temples of this area. The Glebe Temple successfully adapted local materials and construction techniques, and its fabric is in excellent condition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Temple and grounds demonstrate elements of the belief system of "feng shui" in the location, forms and orientation of built and landscape elements, and in the extended visual curtilage of the site to Rozelle Bay and [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] in the north-west.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Temple is dedicated to Guan Di (Kwan Ti), a virtuous and revered military figure of the Three Kingdoms Period (AD220-AD280). Guan Di is worshipped widely throughout the Chinese diaspora. The Temple is well-known for its accumulated "good luck".&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The 1898 central hall accommodated the Guan Di shrine, and the 1903 eastern and western halls respectively accommodate an ancestral hall, and a hall dedicated to Cai Bai Xing (Choi Buk Sing), the popular god of wealth. Families with memorial plaques in the Ancestral Hall, or those donating funds or images to the place retain a close connection with the Temple.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The Temple and grounds provide a venue for large community celebrations through the year, as well as serving the needs of individual worshippers. Over time a number of Chinese organizations maintaining traditional Chinese cultural activities such as martial arts and lion dances, use the place for practice and performance, supporting the Temple's ongoing role as a community focus for the local Chinese community.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267-267-16&gt;Singer, Mark. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Sze Yup Temple was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

The site has evidence of continuous Chinese occupation at least since the 1880s when a Chinese market garden was shown at this location. The place and setting and its contents informs us of the largely undocumented life of the Chinese community in Australia from the late 19th Century.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The 1898-1904 Glebe Sze Yup Kwan Ti temple is the only actively-used pre World War One Chinese temple in Australia to retain its original setting and visual curtilage. (Other active pre World War one temples in urban areas have lost their original rural outlook, such as the Alexandria Yiu Ming temple, the Melbourne Sze Yup temple, or the San Sheng Guan temple in Breakfast Creek, Brisbane).&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

The Temple has special associations with the Sze Yup Chinese community in NSW and other states, the Sze Yup counties in Guangdong Province providing one of the largest sources of immigrants to Australia in the 19th Century.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The temple building is a rare example of a traditional 3 hall temple layout with Edwardian-influenced building elements and detailing demonstrating local cultural adaption, such as corrugated iron roofs, and a bull-nosed corrugated iron porch roof supported by cast iron columns.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The interior fittings and objects sourced from China represent excellent examples of late 19th Century Chinese decorative arts. As many similar pieces have been damaged or destroyed over the past century in China and elsewhere, the aesthetic significance of this material is very high.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The temple siting amongst mature culturally-significant trees and its prospect to the waters of Blackwattle Bay, provides a rare and intact demonstration of 'feng shui'- traditional geomantic practices in planning.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The Sze Yup temple has remained a cultural, religious and social centre for the Sze Yup community and others since 1898. The role of the Trustees in assisting community members extended to temporary accommodation, financial support and help in maintaining contact with families in China. The Trustees arranged for the storage and transport of the bones of Sze Yup-born "sojourners" to China for permanent burial.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The temple strongly communicates a sense of community identity and continuity. Painted and carved panels inside the halls list original donors to the Temple, and some in the community are able to identify forebears and relatives.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

Following the repeal of restrictive immigration legislation in the early 1970s, the temple now provides a cultural and religious centre for many ethnic Chinese settlers displaced from Vietnam and nearby countries. The temple has become well-known for its accumulated "good luck" attributed to its favourable setting for its "gods" and ancestral tablets.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The temple building demonstrates technical adaption to local conditions and materials, and the building's layout, landscape, built elements, fixtures, fittings and decorations, are areas for future research into the cultural and spiritual significance of Chinese beliefs.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

There is potential archaeological material in the immediate surroundings of the temple and grounds that may provide information on Chinese occupation of this area prior to 1898, and of Chinese occupation from 1900 to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The layout and siting of the temple building retains evidence of the application of the traditional Chinese belief system of feng shui. Elements of feng shui include the retention of visual cartilages particularly the temple's north-western outlook to the skyline and to water the placement and spatial relationship of structures and planting, and the building's orientation and scale. This aspect has lead to the place's increasing cultural significance over time, as the accumulated "good" feng shui of the place becomes wider-known.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Glebe Sze Yup temple is the only extant 19th Century Chinese temple in NSW, and one of five intact 19th Century temple structures known in Australia. The others are at Atherton, Breakfast Creek, South Melbourne and Bendigo. The Glebe Sze Yup temple is the only active, early Chinese temple in Australia to retain its original setting and visual curtilage. The temple has been continuously-used by the Chinese community since 1898.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

The building demonstrates the three hall layout common to many southern Chinese village or small town temples. The one hall and three hall layouts were in evidence in all the Chinese temples that were built to serve 19th Century Chinese communities in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

The temple's built form reflects the scale and simple decorative characteristics of temples in the Sze Yup ('4 counties') area of Guangdong Province, and south of the Provincial capital, Guangzhou. The Yiu Ming temple at Alexandria, by comparison, demonstrates distinctly different applied forms and decorations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-267/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">[[Image:Siyah-Chal.jpg|thumb|Original corridor to the entrance of the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran.]]
'''Síyáh-Chál''' ({{lang-fa|سیاه چال}} literally "black pit") is the common word in Persian language for "[[dungeon]]".

Historically, siyah-chals were used as a harsher form of incarceration. Typically, such dungeons had no windows or outlets, other than the entrance, consisting of a short stairway into the ground.

In [[Bahá'í history]] the "Síyáh-Chál" refers to the dungeon south east of the [[Golestan Palace|palace of the Sháh]] and near the [[Sabzih-Maydán]] in [[Tehran]] where [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], was in captivity in 1852,&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Momen |first= Mojan |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= Tehran (Tihrán), Iran |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=38%3Ahistory&amp;id=72%3Atehran&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with about 30 other [[Bábism|Bábí's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Bahá'í International Community |authorlink = Bahá'í International Community |year = 1992 |title = Bahá’u’lláh |publisher = Bahá'í World Centre |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/bic/SB/sb-3.html.utf8#gr5 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; if not more.&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt; He claimed that here he had a vision of a [[Maid of Heaven]], through whom he received his mission as a [[Manifestation of God]] and as the One whose coming the [[Báb]] had prophesied.&lt;ref name="Smith-siyah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Síyáh-Chál |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 323–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his experiences in the ''[[Epistle to the Son of the Wolf]]'' and ''[[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#S.C3.BAriy-i-Haykal .28Tablet of the Temple.29|Súriy-i-Haykal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |origyear=1892 |year=1988 |title=Epistle to the Son of the Wolf |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-182-5 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/ESW/ |pages = 20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/ESW/esw-1.html Bahá’u’lláh, Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the place where he composed his first known [[Tablet (religious)|tablet]], the [[Rashh-i-'Amá]].&lt;ref name="ColeMomen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juan Ricardo Cole|editor=Moojan Momen|title=From Iran East and West| chapter =Bahá'u'lláh and the Naqhbandí Sufis in Iraq, 1854–1856| chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=7xbzoJ5wFG4C&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=7QqZ82AZeK&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xbzoJ5wFG4C|year=1984|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-0-933770-40-9|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2771">The '''temporale''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|t|ɛ|m|p|ɒ|ˈ|r|eɪ|l|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|t|ɛ|m|p|ɒ|ˈ|r|ɑː|l|eɪ}}) is one of the two main cycles that, running concurrently, comprise the [[Liturgical year]] in [[Roman Catholicism]], defined by the [[General Roman Calendar]]. (The other cycle is the ''[[sanctorale]]''.) The term comes into English from medieval Latin ''temporāle'' (from ''tempus'' 'time').&lt;ref&gt;"sanctorale, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2015. Web. 9 January 2016. Sense B2.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''temporale'' consists of the [[movable feast|movable feasts]], most of them keyed to [[Easter]] (which falls on a different Sunday every year), including [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]], [[Pentecost]] (Whitsun), and so on. The ''sanctorale'' consists of the fixed feasts, celebrated on the very same date each year (no matter what the day of the week), including Christmas and all the saints' days.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lapidge, 'The Saintly Life in Anglo-Saxon England', in ''The Cambridge Companion to Old English Literature'', ed. by Malcolm Godden and Michael Lapidge, 2nd edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 251-72 (p. 264).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''temporale'' is also known as the '''proper of time''', with ''proper'' a noun in the sense 'that part of the [[Eucharist]] or liturgical offices which is varied according to the calendar or the particular occasion; an office or part of an office, as a psalm, lesson, etc., or portion of the Eucharist, appointed for a particular occasion or season'.&lt;ref&gt;"proper, adj., n., and adv." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2015. Web. 9 January 2016. Sense 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the events of ''sanctorale'' and the ''temporale'' do not occur in the same order every year, the two cycles are often written separately in [[Liturgical book|liturgical books]], specifically that section of the [[Missal]] known as the [[Breviary]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lapidge, 'The Saintly Life in Anglo-Saxon England', in ''The Cambridge Companion to Old English Literature'', ed. by Malcolm Godden and Michael Lapidge, 2nd edn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 251-72 (p. 264).&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent events in the ''temporale'' are: ''[[Lent]]'' (including [[Ash Wednesday]], [[Palm Sunday|Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord]], and [[Holy Week]]); the [[Paschal Triduum]] (including [[Good Friday]], [[Holy Saturday]], the [[Easter Vigil]] and [[Easter Sunday]]); and ''[[Eastertide|Easter Time]]'' (the fifty days from Easter Sunday to [[Pentecost Sunday]]).

'''''The Book of Ceremonial Magic''''' by [[Arthur Edward Waite]] was originally called '''''The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts'''''.  It was first published in a limited run in 1898, and distributed more widely under the title ''The Book of Ceremonial Magic'' in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Owen|title=Grimoires: A History of Magic Books|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199590049|page=182|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an attempt to document various famous [[grimoire]]s, explain the history behind them (refuting many of the legends surrounding them), discuss the theology contained therein (e.g. raising the question why good angels would be summoned to kill an enemy), and to synthesize many famous grimoires into one system.

[[File:Well of Souls, Dome of Rock (Jerusalem 2018).jpg|thumb|right|Inside the Well of Souls, 2018]]

The '''Well of Souls''' ({{lang-ar|بئر الأرواح}} ''Bir al-Arwah''; sometimes translated '''Pit of Souls''', '''Cave of Spirits''', or '''Well of Spirits''' in Islam), also known in Christianity and Judaism as the '''Holy of Holies''',&lt;ref name="Ritmeyer2006"/&gt; is a partly natural, partly man-made [[cave]] located inside the [[Foundation Stone]] under the [[Dome of the Rock]] shrine in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leen Ritmeyer|Ritmeyer, Leen]] (1998), "The Ark of the Covenant: Where It Stood in Solomon's Temple"; In: Ritmeyer, Leen and Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount'', [[Washington, DC]]: [[Biblical Archaeology Society]], pp 91-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Well of Souls derives from a medieval Islamic legend that at this place the spirits of the dead can be heard awaiting [[Islamic eschatology|Judgment Day]].&lt;ref name=Prag&gt;Prag, Kay (2002), ''Israel &amp; the Palestinian Territories'' (Series: [[Blue Guides]]); London: [[A&amp;C Black]], pg 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Well of Souls" has also been applied more narrowly to a depression in the floor of this cave and to a hypothetical chamber that may exist beneath the floor.

For Christians, the site is known as the [[Holy of Holies]] (alluding to the former inner sanctuary within the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]) and is venerated as a possible site of the annunciation of [[John the Baptist]], since [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] says it happened in the Temple.&lt;ref name="Ritmeyer2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritmeyer|first=Kathleen|title=Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount|date=1 January 2006|publisher=[[Biblical Archaeology Society]]|language=English|isbn=9781880317860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has never been subject to an archeological investigation and political and diplomatic sensitivities currently preclude this.

==History and context==
The Dome of the Rock — called ''Qubbat as-Sakhrah'' in Arabic and ''Kipat Hasela''  in Hebrew — is an early medieval Muslim shrine on [[Temple Mount]], known as ''Har haBáyith'' ("temple mount") in Hebrew and as the ''Haram Ash-Sharif'' ("noble sanctuary") in Arabic. The exposed bedrock directly under the dome — known as the Foundation Stone — is the spot upon which Jewish tradition says [[Abraham]] prepared to sacrifice his son [[Isaac]] and from which Islamic tradition also indicates [[Muhammad]] ascended to heaven. (According to a medieval Islamic tradition, the Stone tried to follow Muhammad as he ascended, leaving his footprint here while pulling up and hollowing out the cave below. The impression of the hand of the [[Archangel Gabriel]], made as he restrained the Stone from rising, is nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Prag, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;) The Stone — known as ''Even haShetiya'' in Hebrew and ''es-Sakhrah'' in Arabic — is considered the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam.

Both Jewish and Muslim traditions relate to what may lie beneath the Foundation Stone, the earliest of them found in the [[Talmud]] in the former and understood to date to the 12th and 13th centuries in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Prag, ''Op. cit.'', pg 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud indicates that the Stone marks the center of the world and serves as a cover for the Abyss (''[[Abzu]]'') containing the raging waters of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. The cave was venerated as early as 902 according to [[Ibn al-Faqih]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Goldhill|Goldhill, Simon]] (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rGbyr5h4OsQC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22Bir+el-+Arweh%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O5GNDE1tEY&amp;sig=UCu4BrBMITVryy9AQfE5V0_Ow7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KM7RUN3rBOPI0QGQ0IHwCQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bir%20el-%20Arweh%22&amp;f=false ''Jerusalem: City of Longing''],  [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]: [[Harvard University Press]], pg 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim tradition likewise places it at the center of the world and over a bottomless pit with the flowing waters of Paradise underneath. A palm tree is said to grow out of the [[River of Paradise]] here to support the Stone. [[Noah]] is said to have landed here after the Flood. The souls of the dead are said to be audible here as they await the Last Judgment,&lt;ref name=Prag /&gt; although this is not a mainstream view in Sunni Islam.

The Foundation Stone and its cave entered fully into the Christian tradition after the [[Crusaders]] recaptured Jerusalem in 1099. These Europeans converted the Dome of the Rock into a church, calling it the [[Templum Domini]] ([[Latin]], "Temple of the Lord"). They made many radical physical changes to the site at this time, including cutting away much of the rock to make staircases and paving the Stone over with marble slabs. They certainly enlarged the main entrance of the cave and probably are also responsible for creating the shaft ascending from the center of the chamber. The Crusaders called the cave the "Holy of Holies" and venerated it as the site of the [[Luke 1#John the Baptist.27s parents|announcement]] of [[John the Baptist]]'s birth.&lt;ref name="Ritmeyer2006"/&gt; (Modern scholarship indicates that the Temple [[Holy of Holies]] was probably on top of the Foundation Stone, not inside it.&lt;ref&gt;Ritmeyer, ''Op. cit.'', pp 101-103.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1871, Jerusalem was visited by the explorer and Arabist [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]]. [[Lady Burton]] later described their exploration of the Well of Souls as tourists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A flight of fifteen steps takes us into the cave under this Rock. This feature has been immensely written about. I shall content myself with saying that Captain Burton holds it to be the [[Araunah#The threshing floor|original granary of the corn threshed]], or rather trodden out, upon the plain on either side, and winnowed from the Rock. If the latter prove to be the great [[Altar (Bible)#Altar of Burnt Offering|Altar of Sacrifice]], the cave will be the cistern for the blood which ran off by the Bir el Arwáh (Well of Souls) into the [[Valley of Hinnom]]. My husband did his best to procure the opening of the hollow-sounding slab in the centre, but the time has not yet come. The more ignorant Moslems believe that the [[Foundation Stone|Sakhrah]] is suspended in the air, and its only support is a palm tree, held by the mothers of the two greatest prophets, Mohammed and Abraham. The most projecting point is called "the Tongue," because, when [[Umar|Omar]] thought he had discovered the stone which was [[Jacob's pillar]] in his vision at [[Bethel]], he exclaimed, "Es Salámo Alaykúm" ("Peace be unto thee"), and the stone replied, "Alaykúm us Salám, wa Rahmat-Ullahi" ("Peace be to thee, and the mercy of God"). The Shaykhs of the Mosque explained everything to us, even the minutest trifle, and showed us the places where Solomon prayed, and also David, and where Abraham and Elijah and Mohammed met on the occasion of his [[Isra and Mi'raj|night flight]] upon [[El Borák]]. They also made an echo for us, and told us that there was a hollow place beneath the Bir el Arwáh before mentioned, where every Friday the departed souls come to adore [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Lady Isabel (1884, 3rd edition), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DzxbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22Bir+el-+Arwah%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qofSHBme5M&amp;sig=20ATm-lP3iVN9F-eGn--XR_JWIE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_SzTUKuPO8uF0QGOv4HADw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bir%20el-%20Arwah%22&amp;f=false ''The Inner Life of Syria, Palestine, and the Holy Land: From My Private Journal'']; [[London]]: [[Kegan Paul, Trench and Company]], pp 376-377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description and circumstances==
[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|The [[Foundation Stone]] in the floor of the [[Dome of the Rock]] shrine in [[Jerusalem]]. The round hole at upper left penetrates to a small cave, known as the "Well of Souls", below. The cage-like structure just beyond the hole covers the stairway entrance to the cave.]]

===The entrance===
The entrance to the cave is at the southeast angle of the Foundation Stone, beside the southeast pier of the Dome of the Rock shrine. Here a set of 16 new marble steps descend through a cut passage thought to date to [[Crusades|Crusader]] times. On the way down, bedrock masses project in towards the stair; the one to the right is called "the tongue". (According to legend, the Stone answered [[Umar|Caliph 'Umar I]] when he addressed it.) To the left (south) as one descends is a prayer niche dedicated to [[David]] with a [[trefoil arch]] supported by miniature marble twisted-rope columns. To the right is a shallower, but ornately decorated, prayer niche dedicated to [[Solomon]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Prag, ''Op. cit.'', pg 124.&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[mihrab]]'' is certainly one of the oldest in the world, considered to date at least back to the late 9th century. (Some even suggest that it dates back to the 7th century and to the time of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], builder of the Dome of the Rock — making it the oldest in the world — but this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, ''Op. cit. '', pg 118&lt;/ref&gt;)

===The chamber===
The cave chamber is roughly square, about 6 meters on a side, and ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 meters (about 4.9 to ~8.2 feet) high. To the north is a small shrine dedicated to [[Abraham]] and to the northwest another dedicated to [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The chamber is supplied with electric lighting and fans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fosco Maraini|Maraini, Fosco]] (1969), ''Jerusalem: Rock of Ages''; Photography by Alfred Bernheim and Ricarda Schwerin; Translated by Judith Landry; [[New York City]]: [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace and World, Inc]], pg 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The shaft===
At the center of the ceiling is a shaft, 0.46 meter in diameter, which penetrates 1.7 meters up to the surface of the Stone above. (It has been proposed that this is the 4,000-year-old remnant of a [[shaft tomb]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Another theory is that it represents a Crusader "chimney" cut for ventilation to accommodate lighted shrine candles.&lt;ref&gt;Ritmeyer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others have tried to make a case that it was part of a drainage system for the blood of sacrifices from the Temple altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911| wstitle = Altar |volume=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no rope marks within the shaft, so it has been concluded that it was never used as a well, with the cave as cistern.) The ceiling of the cave appears natural, while the floor has been long ago paved with marble and carpeted over.

==Literature==
*The earliest reference to a "pierced rock" (the shaft in the cave's roof) may be that in the ''[[Itinerarium Burdigalense]]'' by the anonymous "Pilgrim of Bordeaux" who visited Jerusalem in 333 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor|Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome]] (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cSuErBFmykQC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=%22Bir+el-+Arwah%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sY9laZKihO&amp;sig=rgQur2wEe8I2ouxOP93ALGIdi2w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hIvUUJ2FGMXH0QGnloGoDw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=snippet&amp;q=Bordeaux&amp;f=false ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700''], (5th edition), [[Oxford University Press]], pg 97.&lt;/ref&gt;
*References to the "Well of Souls" under the Foundation Stone date back at least to the 10th-century [[Persian language|Persian]] writer [[Ibn al-Faqih]] who mentions it as an Islamic sacred site.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill, ''Op. cit.'', pg 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The 11th-century Persian writer and traveler [[Nasir-i Khusraw]] related the traditional story of the origin of the cave in his classic travelogue ''[[Safarnama]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;They say that on the night of his Ascension into heaven, the Prophet, peace and blessing be upon him, prayed first at the Dome of the Rock, laying his hand upon the Rock. As he went out, the Rock, to do him honour, rose up, but he laid his hand on it to keep it in its place and firmly fixed it there. But by reason of this rising up, it is even to this present day partly detached from the ground beneath.&lt;ref&gt;Nasir-I Khusraw (11th century), ''Diary of a Journey through Syria and Palestine'', pp 49-50; translated (1888) by Guy le Strange.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The 16th-century rabbi [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] attested to the existence of a cave found under the [[Dome of the Rock]] and known as the "Well of Souls".&lt;ref&gt;Radbaz, ''Sheeloth Ve-Teshuboth'' cited in Zev Vilnay, ''Legends of Jerusalem'' (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1973), 26f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The definitive modern review of the Well of Souls, along with other underground openings beneath the Temple Mount, is in [[Shimon Gibson]] and David Jacobson's ''Below the Temple Mount in Jerusalem: A Sourcebook on the Cisterns, Subterranean Chambers and Conduits of the Haram Al-Sharif''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Shimon and David Jacobson (1996), ''Below the Temple Mount in Jerusalem: A Sourcebook on the Cisterns, Subterranean Chambers and Conduits of the Haram Al-Sharif''; British Archaeological Reports, 301 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
