      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">''''Abd al-Razzaq al-Hasani''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرزاق الحسني}}) (1903–1997) was an [[People of Iraq|Iraqi]] [[historian]] and [[politician]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Orit Bashkin.

''The Shi'is of Iraq''. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 1994. Pp. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early warning==
Al-Hasani in a 1924 article titled "Shi'i Majority in Iraq" warned of the dangers of discrimination by the Sunni-dominated government against the Shi'a majority of Iraq's citizens as having the potential to harm attempts to forge national unity in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Nakash. ''The Shi'is of Iraq''. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 1994, 2003. Pp. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hasani was a strong opponent of the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and British influence in Iraq, claiming the British believed that power in the mandate belonged to them alone and not to Iraqis at all.&lt;ref&gt;Orit Bashkin. The other Iraq: pluralism and culture in Hashemite Iraq. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2009. Pp. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurdistan==
Al-Hassani is noted for having written a book titled ''The Political History of Iraq'' (in the [[Arabic]] language), in which he considered the [[Hamrin Mountain]] Range as a natural border of [[Kurdistan]]. His approach towards this sensitive issue concerning the border created controversy about the ethnicity of [[Kirkuk]] city. Kirkuk is a multiethnic city in [[Iraq]].  The ethnic identity of the city has been disputed among [[Kurds]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]], [[Arabs]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. This controversial approach was also supported in the past by many foreign researchers, including [[Cecil J. Edmonds]] in his book, "Kurds, Turks and Arabs. Politics, Travel and Research in North-eastern Iraq, 1919-1925", published by London: Oxford Press, 1957.

Al-Hassani has other famous books as "Tarikh Al-Ahwarat Al-Iraqi" ( "History of Iraqi Marshes") and "Ancient and Modern Iraq" published by Al-Irfan press, Saida, Lebanon, 1956.

'''Adrian Kashchenko''' ({{lang-uk|Адріан Феофанович Кащенко}}) (19 September 1858 - 16 March 1921) was a well-known [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] writer, historian of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://esu.com.ua/search_articles.php?id=11502 Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine]{{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Adrian Kashchenko was born in the family of small landowner claiming its roots to the Zaporozhian Cossacks in [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] (modern [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]). Sharing the amongst nine siblings one of whom Mykola Kashchenko - would become a Ukrainian academician and the founder of [[A.V. Fomin Botanical Garden|Kiev Botanical Gardens]]. Adrian studied several years in gymnasium and military college, served as a small rank officer. Not finding himself in military career, A. Kashchenko became a clerk in the [[railway]] department, married and settled in [[Yekaterinoslav]] for some time. During his railway service Kashchenko was transferred to [[Perm]], [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Tuapse]] and back to Yekaterinoslav. Although he was married, his wife later left, though she remained financially dependent on him.
 	
Kashchenko wrote both documentary and fiction stories about life of Zaporozhians and their environment. Among them short stories "Zaporozhska slava" ("Zaporizhian fame"), "Na ruinakh Sichi" ("On the ruins of Sich"), "Mandrivka na porohy" ("Trip to the sills"). At stories "Z Dnipra na Dunai" ("From [[Dnieper]] to [[Danube|Dunai]]"), "Zruinovane gnizdo" ("Ruined nest") where he attempted to show the negative aspects following the break-up of the [[Zaporozhian Host]]. Several documentary portraits of Cossack leaders were created: "Nad Kodatskim porohom" ("Under the Kodak sill") about [[Hetman]] Ivan Sulima, "Hetman [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny|Sahaidachny]]", "[[Kost Hordienko]]-Holovko - last knight of [[Zaporizhia]]".

Most of Adrian Kashchenko works were published in 1917 - 1919, during the epoch of [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (previous attempts did not gain wide publication due to the censorship in the Russian Empire). At that time Kashchenko took part in the Ukrainian ''[[Prosvita]]'' ("Enlightenment") society activities and even founded his own publishing house. Sudden illness and subsequent death in 1921 put an end to his scientific and public career.

Printing of Kashchenko stories was only renewed after Ukraine became independent.

'''Antoni Czubiński''' (22 November 1928 in [[Konin]], [[Poland]] – 10 February 2003 in [[Poznań]], [[Poland]]) was a Polish historian and director of the [[Western Institute]] (Instytut Zachodni) in [[Poznań]] from 1978 to 1990.

He represented leftist views, and in his works consequently defended the role of the left in preserving Polish statehood in face of both Hitler and Stalin during 20th century. After 1989 he was a moderate defender of the previous system, underlining its achievements in regards to reducing poverty and increasing Polish independence from Soviet Union. He was convinced that in time People's Republic of Poland will be seen in more neutral, and even positive light and up until his death he continued to hope that more historians will share his view.&lt;ref&gt;Stanisław Sierpowski, Szkic do portretu Antoniego Czubińskiego (1928-2003), "Przegląd Zachodni", nr 2 (307), 2003, s. 260&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 2003 he was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] for his contribution to Polish history.

==Biography==
Bayyinah Bello was born in Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNO9Y_2_nzM "Earthquake in Haiti - Bayyinah Bello Interview - Part 1 - Tremblement de Terre"] (interview by Nana Kimati Dinizulu, 2 February 2010). YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing her primary education in Haiti,&lt;ref name=PYD /&gt; she went at the age of 12 to join her father in [[Liberia]]. She subsequently studied in France and in the US, returning to the African continent to study in [[Nigeria]], where she earned a master's degree in linguistics, among other qualifications.&lt;ref name=PYD /&gt; In 1969 she went back to the US, where she worked as a publicist and in the evenings taught French, and after the birth of her first child in 1970 she wrote her first story for children. She went on to have three other children, her sons being  Hashim, Siddiq, Akil &lt;ref&gt;[http://akilbello.com/?page_id=29 About] Akil Bello.&lt;/ref&gt; and her daughter Ameerah Bello.&lt;ref name=PYD /&gt; &lt;!--Her third child, [http://akilbello.com/?page_id=29 Akil], is her favorite and the most accomplished in adult toy retail.--&gt; Returning to Haiti, she taught at the university and also founded a bilingual school, Citadel International School.&lt;ref name=PYD /&gt; She subsequently taught English and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in [[Togo]].

In 1999 she decided to start an organization dedicated to humanitarian, social and educational work to aid the people of Haiti. It was named Fondation [[Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité|Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité Bonheur Dessalines]], usually shortened to Fondation Félicité (FF), in honour of the wife of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who was a slave first, learned to read and write, then began to teach, working for the liberation of the country, and ultimately lived to be 110 years.&lt;ref name=FF1 /&gt; Soon after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the Friends of Fondation Félicité was set up, an associated not-for-profit organization that is helping Haitian people to rebuild their own country, and raises funds for grassroots projects on the island.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In April 2014, Professor Bello was one of 10 honorees at the Gala des Femmes en Flammes that celebrated Haitian women "whose lives and professional work have paved the way for a better Haiti".&lt;ref&gt;[http://revedortour.com/BIOGRAPHY.html "Gala des Femmes en Flammes (1st Edition) at Karibe, April 12, 2014..."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529065908/http://revedortour.com/BIOGRAPHY.html |date=2015-05-29 }}.

The '''Biblical Archaeology Society''' is a non-denominational organization that supports and promotes [[biblical archaeology]]. It publishes ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. Its past publications included ''[[Bible Review]]'' (1985–2005) and ''Archaeology Odyssey'' (1998–2006). The Biblical Archaeology Society also publishes books about biblical archaeology aimed at a general readership. The Society has, for more than 30 years, run seminars and tours offering an opportunity to learn directly from world-renowned archaeologists and scholars. It also produces videos (DVD) and CDs on archaeology and biblical archaeology.

The society was founded by [[Hershel Shanks]] in 1975 and he served as editor for 42 years, retiring at the end of 2017. Robert R. Cargill was selected to replace Shanks as editor of the Society and associated publications.

The Biblical Archaeology Society has been at the center of several controversies. 

In 1991, the Biblical Archaeology Society published ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', making the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] available to scholars around the world. Previously, access to the scrolls was limited to a small team of specialists who had been invited to translate them.

At a 2002 press conference co-hosted with the [[Discovery Channel]], the Biblical Archaeology Society announced the existence of the [[James Ossuary]]. Some critics have alleged that the ossuary, which may have once held the remains of [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], the brother of [[Jesus]], is a forgery. During the forgery trial, which lasted for several years, Shanks remained a staunch defender of the ossuary. On March 14, 2012, the defendants were acquitted of all charges of forgery because the ossuary's authenticity could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|filename=U.S. Army Band - Coventry Carol.ogg|title=Coventry Carol|description=The ''[[Coventry Carol]]'', describes the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. Performed by the U.S. Army Band Chorus.}}
The '''Coventry Mystery Plays''', or '''Coventry Corpus Christi Pageants''', are a cycle of medieval [[mystery play]]s from [[Coventry]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]], and are perhaps best known as the source of the "[[Coventry Carol]]". Two plays from the original cycle are extant having been copied from the now lost original manuscript in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Upton ''Midlands archive: No mystery ...'' ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' 9 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; A separate ''[[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ed. K. S. Block (1922) ''Ludus Coventriae or The Plaie called Corpus Christi'' : COTTON MS. VESPASIAN D. VIII. London: Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society.&lt;/ref&gt; once thought to belong to the Coventry cycle of Mystery Plays is now believed to have originated in East Anglia.&lt;ref&gt;"Culture: Poetic justice for Coventry history". 2002. ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', pp. 14-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performances of the Coventry Plays are first recorded in a document of 1392&amp;ndash;3, and continued for nearly two centuries; the young [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] may have witnessed them before they were finally suppressed in 1579.  Latterly the plays were performed in a version revised by one Robert Croo in 1534.  In its fullest form the cycle comprised about ten plays, all on New Testament themes, though only two have survived to the present day.  Of these two, the Shearmen and Tailors' Pageant was a [[nativity play]] portraying events from the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], and the Weavers' Pageant dealt with the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Purification]] and the [[Finding in the Temple|Doctors in the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Wilson ''The Lost Literature of Medieval England'', 2nd edition (London: Methuen, [1970] 1972) pp. 226-7; Beatrice Groves ''Texts and Traditions: Religion in Shakespeare, 1592-1604'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2007) pp. 36-41; Lawrence M. Clopper "English Drama: From Ungodly ''Ludi'' to Sacred Play", David Wallace (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp. 750-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only ancient manuscript of the Shearmen and Tailors' Pageant was destroyed by fire in 1879; but it had previously been transcribed and published by [[Thomas Sharp (antiquary)|Thomas Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Cawley (ed.) ''Everyman and Medieval Miracle Plays'' (London: J. M. Dent / New York: E. P. Dutton, [1956] 1979) p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to CERT-UK '''cyber threat intelligence''' (CTI) is an "elusive"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cert.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/An-introduction-to-threat-intelligence.pdf CERT-UK, An Introduction to Threat Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; concept. While cybersecurity comprises the recruitment of IT security experts, and the deployment of technical means, to protect an organization's critical infrastructure or intellectual property, CTI is based on the collection of intelligence using [[Open-source intelligence|open source intelligence (OSINT)]], [[Social media intelligence|social media intelligence (SOCMINT)]], [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human Intelligence (HUMINT)]], technical intelligence or intelligence from the [[Deep web (search)|deep]] and [[Dark Web|dark]] web. CTI's key mission is to research and analyze trends and technical developments in three areas:

* [[Cybercrime]]
* [[Hactivism]]
* Cyberespionage ([[advanced persistent threat]], APT or [[Cyber spying]])

Those accumulated data based on research and analysis enable states to come up with preventive measures in advance. Considering the severe impacts of cyber threats, CTI has been raised as an efficient solution to maintain [[international security]].

==Types ==

The UK's [[National Cyber Security Centre]] (NCSC) distinguishes four types of threat intelligence:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/content/files/protected_files/guidance_files/MWR_Threat_Intelligence_whitepaper-2015.pdf NCSC, Threat Intelligence: Collecting, Analysing, Evaluating]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tactical: attacker methodologies, tools, and tactics - relies on enough resources and involves certain actions to go against potentially dangerous actors trying to do infiltration
* Technical: indicators of specific malware
* Operational: details of the specific incoming attack, assess an organisation's ability in determining future cyber-threats 
* Strategic: high-level information on changing risk (strategic shifts) - senior [[leadership]] is required{{by whom?|date=September 2017}} for thorough determination to critically assess threats

In the [[financial sector]], the CBEST&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/fsc/Documents/anintroductiontocbest.pdf CBEST, An Introduction to Cyber Threat Modelling]&lt;/ref&gt; framework of the [[Bank of England]] assumes that [[penetration testing]] is no longer adequate to protect sensitive [[commerce | business]] sectors, such as the banking sector. In response, the [[UK Financial Authorities]] (Bank of England, [[Her Majesty's Treasury]], and the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]) recommend several steps to guard financial institutions from cyber threats, including receiving "advice from the cyber threat intelligence providers operating within the UK Government".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability/financial-sector-continuity/cbest-implementation-guide.pdf CBEST, Implementation Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of tactical cyber intelligence===
* provides context and relevance to a tremendous amount of data
* empowers organisations to develop a proactive cybersecurity posture and to bolster overall risk management policies{{cn|date=September 2017}}
* informs better decision-making during and following the detection of a cyber intrusion
* drives momentum toward a cybersecurity posture that is predictive, not just reactive&lt;ref&gt;
Intelligence and national security alliance, cyber intelligence task force December 2015{{vague|date=January 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=September 2017}}
* enables improved detection of advanced threats

=== '''Challenges and Controversies on the value of cyber threat intelligence''' ===
there are also challenges that cyber threat intelligence research is facing, including some controversies on the value of threat intelligence and whether it really works.  Different experts have voiced their concerns on whether TI is really effective in its current state

== Attribution==
Behind any cyber threat, there are people using computers, software and networks. During or after a cyber attack technical information about the network and computers between the attacker and the victim can be collected. However, identifying the person(s) behind an attack, their motivations, or the ultimate sponsor of the attack, is difficult. Recent efforts in threat intelligence emphasize understanding adversary [[Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures|TTPs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/white-papers/identifying-ttps.pdf Levi Gundert, How to Identify Threat Actor TTPs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CTI and political risk==

Influential geopolitical countries, such as the US, Russia, China and Iran, use cyberspace as an extension of their foreign and intelligence collection policies. To achieve these objectives, they have formed APT units that primarily specialise in the following fields:

* Collection of sensitive data from business or government computer systems
* Electronic penetration or sabotage of critical infrastructure computer systems (for example, read about [[Stuxnet]])

A combination of CTI with [[political risk]] analysis, which includes a deep understanding of current geopolitical disputes and leadership ulterior political motives, can help analysts understand future cyberwarfare patterns.

'''Franciszek Bujak'''  (16 August 1875, [[Maszkienice]] near [[Brzesko]] &amp;ndash; 21 March 1953, [[Kraków]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] academic and historian of economic, political and social [[history of Poland]]. He served as professor of the [[Jagiellonian University]] twice, in 1909&amp;ndash;1918 (before the re-emergence of [[Second Polish Republic|the sovereign Poland]]) and after World War II in 1946&amp;ndash;1952. In the interwar Poland, Bujak was a professor of the [[Warsaw University]] in 1919&amp;ndash;1921, and the [[John Casimir University]] in [[Lwów]] in 1921&amp;ndash;1941 (until the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa]]). He was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] since 1952, and president of the [[Polish Historical Society]] twice in 1932&amp;ndash;1933 and 1936&amp;ndash;1937. He was active politically in [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|PSL "Piast"]] and [[Stronnictwo Ludowe]], briefly serving as minister of agriculture under [[Władysław Grabski]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080628224434/http://www3.uj.edu.pl/acta/9805/20.html Franciszek Bujak – życie i dzieło] (web.archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugeniusz Romer, ''Pamiętnik Paryski 1918-1919.''

She is the founder and chairperson of the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF), a non-profit organization.

==Early years==
Abdi was born in [[Mogadishu]], situated in south-central [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. Hawa Abdi: Somalia is my Golden Jubilee |url=http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2012/03/22/feature-01 |accessdate=8 March 2013 |newspaper=Sabahi |date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died when she was 12 years old. Abdi thereafter took on family chores, including raising her four sisters,&lt;ref name="Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |title= Dr. Hawa Abdi |url= http://www.dhaf.org/about-us/dr-hawa/ |accessdate=4 April 2018 |date= 4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the eldest child in the family. Her father was an educated professional.&lt;ref name="Holpoty"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hassan (Xiis) |first=Salad Idow |title=Dr. Hawa Abdi – 2007 HOL Person of the Year |url= http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2008/jan/dr_hawa_abdi_2007_hol_person_of_the_year.aspx |accessdate= 8 March 2013 |newspaper=Hiiraan Online |date= 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her early schooling, Abdi attended local elementary, intermediate and secondary academies.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

In 1964, she received a scholarship from the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union. Abdi subsequently studied medicine at a [[Kiev]] institution, graduating in 1971. The following year, she began law studies at Mogadishu's [[Somali National University]].&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

In 1973, Abdi got married and gave birth to her first child two years later. She would practice medicine during the morning and work toward her law degree in her spare time, eventually earning it in 1979.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

==Career==

===Rural Health Development Organisation===
In 1983, Abdi opened the Rural Health Development Organisation (RHDO) on family-owned land in the southern [[Lower Shebelle]] region. It began as a one-room clinic offering free obstetrician services to around 24 rural women per day, and later evolved into a 400-bed hospital.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

When the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] broke out in Somalia during the early 1990s, Abdi stayed behind at the behest of her grandmother, who had advised her to use her qualifications to assist the vulnerable. She subsequently established a new clinic and school for the displaced and orphans.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

The RHDO was renamed the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF) in 2007.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt; It gradually expanded to include a relief camp, which during the [[2011 East Africa drought|2011 drought]] housed 90,000 people on the 1,300 acres surrounding Abdi's hospital.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nhfm"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristof |first=Nicholas D. |title=Heroic, Female and Muslim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/opinion/16kristof.html?_r=2&amp; |accessdate=8 March 2013 |newspaper=New York Times |date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years prior, at the height of the [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Islamist insurgency]] in southern Somalia, militants had laid siege to the compound and attempted to force Abdi to shut it down. She stood her ground and the rebels left within a week, following pressure from local residents, the UN and other advocacy groups.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gdhahdtss"&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Eliza |title=Dr. Hawa Abdi &amp; Her Daughters: The Saints of Somalia |url=http://www.glamour.com/inspired/women-of-the-year/2010/dr-hawa-abdi-and-her-daughters |publisher=Glamour |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militants again stormed the area in February 2012, leading Abdi to temporarily suspend services until their eventual departure.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

===Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation===
[[File:2013 09 25 Hawa Abdi Center C.jpg (10439358724).jpg|thumb|Hawa Abdi Center C]]
The Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation (DHAF) is run by Abdi and her two physician daughters, CEO Deqo Adan (also known as Deqo Mohamed) and assistant Adan (also known as Amina Mohamed),&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt; who followed in their mother's footsteps as ob/gyn specialists.&lt;ref name="Holpoty" /&gt; As of 2012, the organization has a multinational staff of 102 workers, augmented by a 150-member team comprising volunteers, fishermen and farmers.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

DHAF is a non-political organization that is not affiliated with any government, political movement, religion or clan. DHAF decides what projects to undertake and what relief to provide based on the ground needs of the village.DHAF is also a financially independent organization. All of the funding is provided through donations from the people around the world and other charitable endowments. Government funding is prohibited.
Since 1991, DHAF has provided services to Somalis who are independent of their clan. Services are provided to the people of Somalia at no cost.&lt;ref name="Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation" /&gt;

The DHAF compound includes a hospital, school and nutritional center,&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt; and provides shelter, water and medical care to mostly women and children.&lt;ref name="Gdhahdtss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gtdusi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ali |first=Laila |title=The doctor undaunted by Somalia's insurgents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/23/somali-doctor-puts-aid-agencies-shade |accessdate=8 March 2013 |newspaper=Guardian |date=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its establishment in the early 1980s, the complex has served an estimated 2 million people.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;

Although services are offered at no charge, Abdi operates several fishing and agricultural projects within the compound to inculcate self-sustenance. The hospital also contains a small plot of land, where vegetables and maize are grown and later in part sold to cover some of the facility's maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="Gtdusi" /&gt;

Funding for the compound's equipment and medical supplies is mainly secured through remittances from Somali expatriates as well as general contributions to the DHAF.&lt;ref name="Sdhasimgj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gtdusi" /&gt; Since 2011, the organization has also received support from the [[Women in the World Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Wdharwoiafwf"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robbins |first=Sarah J. |title=Dr. Hawa Abdi Receives Women of Impact Award From WITW Foundation |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/12/dr-hawa-abdi-receives-women-of-impact-award-from-witw-foundation.html |publisher=Women in the World |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">'''Heinrich Friedrich Otto Abel''' (22 January 1824 &amp;ndash; 28 October 1854) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Reichenbach Priory (Baden-Württemberg)|Reichenbach Priory]] in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], a [[Protestant]] religious house, where his father was a clergyman. Beginning in 1824, Abel visited the universities of [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], studying history. Among his teachers was [[Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann]].

Abel also showed political interest in the [[revolutions of 1848]], and published a tract ''Das neue deutsche Reich und sein Kaiser'' in which he enthused about the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. As a result, the Prussian minister of external affairs, [[Heinrich von Arnim]], offered him a place in the Prussian embassy in [[Frankfurt]]. However, his high expectations were disappointed many times over. He quit the diplomatic service in 1850 and in the ensuing period devoted his energies to the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.

In 1851, Abel inaugurated his formal academic career with his appointment as a lecturer (''"Privatdozent"'') at the University of Bonn. The best known of his scholars was [[Heinrich von Treitschke]]. While travelling in 1853, Abel was affected by pulmonary [[Tuberculosis|phthisis]] and died in 1854 in the care of his uncle in [[Leonberg]].

'''''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter''''' is a 2011 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]]. The book covers topics in [[biosemiotics]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[Abiogenesis|the origins of life]]. Broadly, the book seeks to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explain "[[aboutness]]", that is, concepts like [[intentionality]], meaning, [[normative|normativity]], purpose, and [[function (biology)|function]]; which Deacon groups together and labels as [[ententional]] phenomena.

==Core Ideas==
Deacon's first book, ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' focused on the [[Origin of language|evolution of human language]]. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion on the nature of [[semiotic]] processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of ''Incomplete Nature'' shifts from [[Human evolution|human origins]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[semiosis]]. ''Incomplete Nature'' can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of [[consciousness]] and the problem of the [[origin of life]] are inexorably linked.&lt;ref&gt;Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of [[work (physics)|work]] and [[information]]  in order to give an account of [[entention]]ality that is consistent with [[eliminative materialism]] and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenominal]] the non-physical properties of [[life]].

==Constraints==
A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of [[zero]] revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other [[ententional]] phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the [[mind body problem]]. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges.  Constraints which produce [[emergence|emergent]] phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.

==Orthograde and contragrade==
Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of [[causality]] exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with [[teleology|teleological]] explanations, Deacon returns to [[Aristotle's]] [[four causes]] and attempts to modernize them with [[thermodynamic]] concepts.

[[File:Orthograde and contragrade.jpg|450px|A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained ("ordered") state to a less constrained ("disordered") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right).]]

'''Orthograde''' changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[formal cause]]. More loosely, [[Aristotle's]] [[final cause]] can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contragrade''' changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do [[work (physics)|work]]. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics==
Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical [[thermodynamics]], with an extended discussion about how consistently [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium systems]] can interact and combine to produce novel [[emergence|emergent]] properties. 
[[File:Homomorphoteleo.jpg|thumb|400px]]

Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: '''Homeodynamic''' systems combine to produce '''morphodynamic''' systems which combine to produce '''teleodynamic''' systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of [[self organization]].

===Homeodynamics===
Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical [[thermodynamic systems]] like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of [[thermodynamics|classic thermodynamics]]. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp.561 "Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience."&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum [[entropy]] state (disorderliness) is achieved.

===Morphodynamics===
A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]]. Other common examples are [[Snowflake#formation|snowflake formation]], [[whirlpools]] and the [[stimulated emission]] of [[laser]] light.

[[File:Benard cell.jpg|thumb|500px|Benard Cell]]
'''Maximum entropy production:''' The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, [[density]] effects come into play. Simple [[diffusion]] can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more [[buoyant]] than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing [[convection]] currents.

'''Two systems:''' The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact.

'''Self organization:''' The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell.

'''Synergy and constraint:''' What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining.

===Teleodynamics===
A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when [[ententional]] qualities like [[Function (biology)|function]], [[purpose]] and [[normative|normativity]] emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autogenesis====
Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896328 The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.] Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autogenesis.jpg|thumb|500px|Autogen pg 339]]

'''Reciprocal catalysis:''' An autogen consists of two self [[Catalysts|catalyzing]] cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a [[chemoton]]. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a [[lipid]] that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a [[microtubule]] or some other closed [[capsid]] like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits [[diffusion]]; it keeps all of the necessary [[catalysts]] in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment.

'''The first self:''' Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and [[death]]. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a [[biological function]]. The internal reaction network functions to create the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be [[abiotic]] but together they create a system with a [[normative]] status dependent on the functioning of its component parts.

&lt;!--
======Autogenesis and Autopoesis======
Deacon's model of an autogen bears a striking resemblance to the [[autopoesis|autopoetic]] theory proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Fransisco Varela]] in 1973. However, Deacon takes pains to differentiate teleodynamics from autopoesis.

Deacon notes that autopoiesis is an update on the [[Kantian]] reciprocal production of parts conception of organisms. The problem with this approach is that is assumes the two most critical features necessary for life (and teleodynamics): (1) how the network of co-producing components is maintained as a "unity" in such a way that its coherent organization can be reconstituted or reproduced in a new system, and (2) how this unit "self" maintains itself far-from-equilibrium. [[Autopoiesis]] is an abstract description of what must be true of an organism, without outlining how these defining properties are accomplished. Indeed, as stated, [[autopoiesis]] describes morphodynamic processes, though without an account of the thermodyanamics involved. But morphodynamic processes don't spontaneously hold together, indeed, they are organized in a way that maximally destroys the conditions that produce them because they are entirely driven by extrinsic dynamics. Essentially, [[autopoesis]] is a description of the processes defining life, while autogenesis describes how they are dynamically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life. Frontiers in Bioscience (in press, pg 4-5). Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Work==
As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of [[work (physics)|work]] Deacon seeks to generalize the [[Newtonian mechanics#Work and energy|Newtonian]] conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe "that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.365&lt;/ref&gt;  Work is generally described as "activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be "the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamic work===

A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top [[fluid]] at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both [[macroscopic]] and [[microscopic]] levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required.

===Morphodynamic work===

By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by [[classical thermodynamics]]. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Benard cell]] or the [[resonant frequency]] of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.

'''Resonance example:''' A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced [[resonance]] that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a [[resonant frequency]] that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.

'''Contragrade change:''' When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state.

'''Structure and form:''' Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the [[amplitude]] of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its [[frequency]]. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work.

===Teleodynamic work===

Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to [[Healing|heal]], to [[Reproduction|reproduce]] and to pursue resources towards these ends.  Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. 
[[File:Reading 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1682–1754).]]

'''Evolution as work:''' [[Natural selection]], or perhaps more accurately, [[adaptation]], can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist.

For example, in a population of New Zealand [[wrybill]] who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the [[wrybill]]s in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work.

'''Thought as work:''' Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. "The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to ''be'' evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg 550&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergent causal powers====

By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims "we can begin to discern ''a basis for a form of causal openness'' in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg.379&lt;/ref&gt; While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying [[quantum mechanics]] but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common.

==Information==
One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological [[information]]. The first formal [[Information Theory|theory of information]] was articulated by [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1948 in his work [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the [[information age]], but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[reference]], i.e., what the information is ''about.'' As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like [[computers]], it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions.

===Shannon information===
Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[information]]. [[Entropy]] is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. 
[[File:Information Shannon Boltzmann Darwin.jpg|thumb|500px|Three nested conceptions of information]]

===Boltzmann entropy===
Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic [[thermodynamic]] conception of entropy developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend.

===Significant information===
Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. "The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indo-Pakistani War of 1971''' was a military confrontation between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] that occurred during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war]] in [[East Pakistan]] from 3 December 1971 to the [[Pakistani Instrument of Surrender|fall of Dacca]] ([[Dhaka]]) on 16 December 1971.  The war began with [[Operation Chengiz Khan|preemptive aerial strikes]] on 11 [[List of Indian Air Force stations|Indian air stations]], which led to the commencement of hostilities with Pakistan and Indian entry into the [[Bangladesh War of Liberation|war of independence]] in East Pakistan on the side of [[Bangladesh Forces|Bengali nationalist forces]]. Lasting just 13 days, it is one of the shortest wars in history.&lt;ref name="time27Dec1971"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=India: Easy Victory, Uneasy Peace |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905593,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=27 December 1971 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 March 2007 |title=World's shortest war lasted for only 45 minutes |url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/98112-world_shortest_war-0 |newspaper=[[Pravda]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the East, [[List of Pakistan Air Force squadrons|No. 14 Squadron Tail Choppers]] under [[Squadron Leader]] [[Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi|PQ Mehdi]], who was taken as [[Prisoner of War|POW]], was destroyed, putting the Dhaka air defence out of commission and resulting in Indian [[air superiority]] in the East.&lt;ref name="GlobalSecurity" /&gt;

===Indian attacks on Pakistan===

As Indian Army tightened its grip in the East Pakistan, the Indian Air Force continued with its attacks against Pakistan as the campaign developed into a series of daylight anti-airfield, anti-radar, and close-support attacks by fighter jets, with night attacks against airfields and strategic targets by [[English Electric Canberra|Canberras]] and [[Antonov An-12|An-12s]], while Pakistan responded with similar night attacks with its [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57s]] and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Martin|title=Cold War Jet Combat: Air-to-Air Jet Fighter Operations 1950–1972|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781473874633|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QleqCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;q=While%20India's%20grip%20on%20what%20had%20been%20East%20Pakistan%20tightened%2C%20the%20IAF%20continued%20to%20press%20home%20attacks%20against%20Pakistan|accessdate=24 December 2016|language=en|date=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107–108}}

The PAF deployed its primary [[air superiority]] aircraft, the [[Shenyang J-6|F-6s]], mainly on defensive [[combat air patrol]] missions over their own bases, leaving the PAF unable to conduct effective offensive operations.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107–108}} The IAF's raids damaged one [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and one [[United Nations|UN]] aircraft in Dacca, while a [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribou]] was destroyed in [[Islamabad]], along with the USAF's [[Beechcraft L-23 Seminole|Beech U-8]] owned by the [[United States military|US military]]'s liaison chief [[Brigadier-General]] [[Chuck Yeager]].&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="Russia &amp; India Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simha|first1=Rakesh Krishnan|title=How India brought down the US' supersonic man|url=http://in.rbth.com/articles/2012/01/17/how_india_brought_down_the_us_supersonic_man_14208|website=Russia &amp; India Report|publisher=Russia &amp; India Report|accessdate=24 December 2016|language=en-IN|date=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sporadic raids by the IAF continued against PAF forward air bases in Pakistan until the end of the war, and interdiction and close-support operations were maintained.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

One of the most successful air raids by India into West Pakistan happened on 8 December 1971, when Indian Hunter aircraft from the [[Pathankot Air Force Station|Pathankot]]-based 20 Squadron, attacked the Pakistani base in [[PAF Base Murid|Murid]] and destroyed 5 [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]] aircraft on the ground. This was confirmed by Pakistan's military historian, Air Commodore [[Kaiser Tufail|M Kaiser Tufail]], in his book 'In The Ring and On Its Feet - Pakistan Air Force in the 1971 Indo-Pak War'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Vishnu Som|title=Exclusive Details Of How Air Force Raided A Pak Air Base|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-details-of-how-air-force-raided-a-pak-air-base-destroyed-jets-1803601|website=NDTV|accessdate=25 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125034821/https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-details-of-how-air-force-raided-a-pak-air-base-destroyed-jets-1803601|archivedate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAF played a more limited role in the operations and were reinforced by [[F-104]]s from [[Jordan]], [[Mirage III|Mirages]] from an unidentified [[Middle East]]ern ally (whose identity remains unknown), and by F-86s from [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107}} Their arrival helped camouflage the extent of PAF losses, and some [[Libya]]n [[Northrop F-5|F-5s]] were reportedly deployed to [[Sargodha Airbase|Sargodha AFB]], perhaps as a potential training unit to prepare Pakistani pilots for an influx of more F-5s from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|112}} The IAF was able to conduct a wide range of missions – troop support; air combat; deep penetration strikes; para-dropping behind enemy lines; feints to draw enemy fighters away from the actual target; bombing and reconnaissance.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107}} The PAF, which was solely focused on air combat, was blown out of the subcontinent's skies within the first week of the war.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107}} Those PAF aircraft that survived took refuge at [[Iran]]ian air bases or in concrete bunkers, refusing to offer a fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rbth.com/blogs/2015/06/04/why_the_indian_air_force_has_a_high_crash_rate_43501 Why the Indian Air Force has a high crash rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

India flew 1,978 sorties in the East and about 4,000 in Pakistan, while the PAF flew about 30 and 2,840 at the respective fronts.&lt;ref name="Pen and Sword, Bowman"/&gt;{{rp|107}}  More than 80 percent of IAF sorties were close-support and interdiction and about 45 IAF aircraft were lost.&lt;ref name="Leonard2006p806" /&gt;

Pakistan lost 75 aircraft,&lt;ref name="Leonard2006p806" /&gt; not including any F-6s, Mirage IIIs, or the six Jordanian F-104s which failed to return to their donors.&lt;ref name="Leonard2006p806" /&gt; The imbalance in air losses was explained by the IAF's considerably higher sortie rate and its emphasis on ground-attack missions.&lt;ref name="Leonard2006p806" /&gt;

== Foreign reaction and involvement ==

=== United States and Soviet Union ===
[[File:Blood telegram.png|The [[Blood Telegram]]|thumb]]

The [[Soviet Union]] sympathised with the [[East Pakistanis]], and supported the Indian Army and [[Mukti Bahini]]'s incursion against Pakistan during the war, in a broader view of recognising that the [[Independence of Bangladesh|succession]] of East Pakistan as [[People's Republic of Bangladesh|Independent Bangladesh]] would weaken the position of its rivals— the [[United states and china|United States and China]]. The Soviet Union gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]] signed in August 1971.&lt;ref name="theworldreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2011/10/1971-india-pakistan-war-role-of-russia.html|title=1971 India Pakistan War: Role of Russia, China, America and Britain|website=The World Reporter|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Indo-Soviet treaty did not mean a total commitment to every Indian position, even though the Soviet Union had accepted the Indian position during the conflict, according to author Robert Jackson.&lt;ref name="Springer, Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Robert|title=South Asian Crisis: India — Pakistan — Bangla Desh|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349041633|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tb6vCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;q=rodionov%20pakistan%20yahya|accessdate=22 December 2016|language=en|date=1978-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72–73}} The Soviet Union continued its sympathetic gesture to Pakistan until mid-October 1971, when it stressed Pakistan to come up with a political settlement and affirmed its continuation of industrial aid to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Springer, Jackson"/&gt;{{rp|73}} By November 1971, the [[Ambassador of the Soviet Union to Pakistan|Soviet ambassador]] to Pakistan [[Aleksei A.

As the war progressed, it became apparent to the United States that India was going to invade and disintegrate Pakistan in a matter of weeks, therefore President Nixon spoke with the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|USSR Secretary General]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] on a [[Moscow–Washington hotline|hotline]] on 10 December, where Nixon reportedly urged Brezhnev to restrain India as he quoted: "in the strongest possible terms to restrain India with which … you [Brezhnev] have great influence and for whose actions you must share responsibility."&lt;ref name="George Washington University press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixon/Kissinger Saw India as "Soviet Stooge" in 1971 South Asia Crisis|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/20050629/|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|publisher=George Washington University press|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
The war stripped Pakistan of more than half of its population, and with nearly one-third of its army in captivity, clearly established India's military and political dominance of the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="time27Dec1971" /&gt; India successfully led a diplomatic campaign to isolate Pakistan and skillfully manipulate Pakistan's supporting countries to limit the extent of support to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO, Heo and Jr."/&gt;{{rp|596}} In addition, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's state visit to [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] further helped break ice with the United States, and blocked any pro-Pakistan resolution in the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO, Heo and Jr."/&gt;{{rp|596}} There was also a meeting between Prime Minister Gandhi and President Nixon in November 1971,{{clarify|date=February 2017|reason=Aftermath section should cover events after December 1971, is this a typo or in wrong section?}} where she rejected the US advice against intervening in the conflict.&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO, Heo and Jr."/&gt;{{rp|596}}

In spite of the magnitude of the victory, India was surprisingly restrained in its reaction.&lt;ref name="time27Dec1971" /&gt;  Mostly, Indian leaders seemed pleased by the relative ease with which they had accomplished their goals—the establishment of Bangladesh and the prospect of an early return to their homeland of the 10 million Bengali refugees who were the cause of the war.&lt;ref name="time27Dec1971" /&gt; In announcing the Pakistani surrender, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared in the Indian Parliament:

In his book ''The 1971 Indo-Pak War: A Soldier's Narrative'', Pakistan Army's [[Major general|Major General]] Hakeem Arshad Qureshi, a veteran of this conflict, noted:

The Indian Army Chief in 1971, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, had the highest respect for the fighting capability of the Pakistan Army, and he did not accept the theory that they did not fight the war with enough vigour and zeal.&lt;ref name="Lala2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lala|first=R.

After the war, the Pakistan Army's generals in the East held each other responsible for the atrocities committed, but most of the burden was laid on Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan, who earned notoriety from his actions as governor of the East; he was called the "Butcher of Bengal" because of the widespread atrocities committed within the areas of his responsibility.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/30/local/me-passings30.1|title=Gen.

Confessing at the hearings of the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission|War Enquiry Commission]], Lieutenant-General A.A.K.

In the aftermath of the war, the Pakistani Government constituted the [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission|War Enquiry Commission]], to be headed by [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Hamoodur Rahman]], who was an ethnic [[Bengali people|Bengali]],&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and composed of the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bose|first=Sarmila|date=22 September 2007|title=Losing the Victims: Problems of Using Women as Weapons in Recounting the Bangladesh War|url=http://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/profile_materials/sbose-losing_the_victims-epw_v_42_no_38_2007.pdf|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|page=3865|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Enquiry Commission was mandated with carrying out thorough investigations into the intelligence, strategic, political and military failures that causes the defeat in the war.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse, Baig"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baig|first1=Muhammad Anwar; Ebad|title=Pakistan: Time for Change|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477250310|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H_A5-RABah4C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;q=war%20enquiry%20commission%20pakistan|accessdate=26 December 2016|language=en|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}{{Self published inline|certain=y|date=July 2018}}

The War Report exposed many military failures, from the strategic to the tactical–intelligence levels, while it confirmed the looting, rapes and the unnecessary killings by the Pakistan military and their local agents.&lt;ref name="Genocide"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Halarnkar |first=Sameer |date=21 August 2000 |title=The Genesis of Defeat&amp;nbsp;– How many Hindus have you killed? |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1971-war-how-many-hindus-have-you-killed/1/246925.html |magazine=India Today |accessdate=17 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid the blame squarely on Pakistan Army generals, accusing them of debauchery, smuggling, war crimes and neglect of duty.&lt;ref name="Immorality"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Halarnkar |first=Sameer |date=21 August 2000 |title=The Loss of Character&amp;nbsp;– "Lust for wine, greed for houses" |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1971-war-lust-for-wine-greed-for-houses/1/246931.html |magazine=India Today |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Commission had recommended [[public trial]] of Pakistan Army generals on the charges that they had been responsible for the situation in the first place and that they had succumbed without a fight,&lt;ref name="Cowardice"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Halarnkar |first=Sameer |date=21 August 2000 |title=Bravado And Capitulation&amp;nbsp;– "Further resistance is not humanly possible" |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1971-war-further-resistance-is-not-humanly-possible/1/246934.html |magazine=India Today |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no actions were ever taken against those responsible, except the dismissal of chiefs of [[Gul Hassan Khan|the Pakistan Army]], [[Abdul Rahim Khan|Pakistan Air Force]], [[Muzaffar Hassan|Pakistan Navy]], and decommissioning of the Pakistan Marines.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowardice"/&gt;

The War Commission, however, rejected the charge that 200,000 Bengali girls were raped by the Pakistan Army, remarking, “It is clear that the figures mentioned by the Dacca authorities are altogether fantastic and fanciful," and cited the evidence of a British abortion team that had carried out the termination of "only a hundred or more pregnancies".&lt;ref name="D'Costa2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamoodur Rehman Commission (HRC) Report of Inquiry into the 1971 War (Vanguard Books Lahore, 513)&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also claimed that "approximately 26,000 persons (were) killed during the action by the Pakistan military"&lt;ref name="D'Costa2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deathcount-pakistani"&gt;[http://www.bangla2000.com/Bangladesh/Independence-War/Report-Hamoodur-Rahman/default.shtm Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report], [http://www.bangla2000.com/Bangladesh/Independence-War/Report-Hamoodur-Rahman/chapter2.shtm chapter 2], paragraph 33&lt;/ref&gt;
Bina D'Costa states that the War Commission was aware of the military's brutality in East Pakistan, but "chose to downplay the scale of the atrocities committed."&lt;ref name="D'Costa2011"&gt;{{citation|last=D'Costa|first=Bina|title=Nationbuilding, Gender and War Crimes in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ivzKjY5LncIC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56566-0|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second commission was known as [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 Prisoners of War Investigation]], conducted solely by the Pakistani government, that was to determine the numbers of Pakistani military personnel who surrendered, including the number of civilian POWs.&lt;ref name="BBC News, India Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1971.stm |title=India Pakistan &amp;#124; Timeline |publisher=BBC News, India Pakistan|date=1971-12-06 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official number of the surrendered military personnel was soon released by the Government of Pakistan after the war was over.&lt;ref name="BBC News, India Pakistan"/&gt;

===India: Indo-Pakistani Summits===
{{Main|Simla Agreement|l1=Agreement Between the Government of India and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on Bilateral Relations|Delhi Agreement|l2=Transfer of Population Under the Terms of the Delhi Agreement}}
On 2 July 1972, the [[Indo-Pakistani relation|Indo-Pakistani summit]] was held in [[Simla]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India where the [[Simla Agreement]] was reached and signed between [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=MEA_site&gt;{{cite web|title=Simla Agreement|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/5541/Simla+Agreement|website=Bilateral/Multilateral Documents|publisher=Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty provided insurance to Bangladesh that Pakistan recognised Bangladesh's sovereignty, in exchange for the return of the Pakistani POWs.&lt;ref name="time20Dec71" /&gt; In mere five months, India systematically released more than 90,000 war prisoners, with Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niazi being the last war prisoner to be handed over to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="time20Dec71" /&gt;

The treaty also gave back more than 13,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land that the Indian Army had seized in Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few strategic areas, including [[Turtuk]], Dhothang, Tyakshi (earlier called Tiaqsi) and [[Chalunka]] of [[Chorbat Valley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/123835/turtuk-story-of-a-promise-land/|title=Turtuk, a Promised Land Between Two Hostile Neighbours}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/815863/an-encounter-with-the-king-of-turtuk-a-border-village-near-gilgit-baltistan|title=An encounter with the 'king' of Turtuk, a border village near Gilgit-Baltistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was more than 804&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/nkoE1dc52oYwoWRNmhEeYK/A-portrait-of-a-village-on-the-border.html|title=A portrait of a village on the border}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 December 2011 |title=Have you heard about this Indian Hero? |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-the-hero-of-nubra/20111222.htm#5 |newspaper=Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A109&amp;Pg=6 |title=The Simla Agreement 1972 |website=Story of Pakistan |accessdate=20 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614014904/http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A109&amp;Pg=6 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian hardliners, however, felt that the treaty had been too lenient to President Bhutto, who had pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile stability in Pakistan would crumble if the accord was perceived as being overly harsh by Pakistanis and that he would be accused of losing Kashmir in addition to the loss of East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="mosq-mill" /&gt; As a result, Prime Minister Gandhi was criticised by a section in India for believing Bhutto's "sweet talk and false vows", while the other section claimed the agreement to be successful, for not letting it to fall into "[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Syndrome]]” trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 June 2014 |title=The collapse of the Shimla Accord |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-collapse-of-the-shimla-accord/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, India and Pakistan reached another compromise when both countries signed a trilateral agreement with Bangladesh that actually brought the war prisoners, non-Bengali and Pakistan-loyal Bengali bureaucrats and civilian servants to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="UNCHR"&gt;{{cite web|last=UN|title=Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|url=http://www.unhcr.org/print/3ae68c6f0.html|website=UNCHR|publisher=UNCHR|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Delhi Agreement]] witnessed the largest mass [[population transfer]] since the [[Partition of India]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zulfi Bhutto of Pakistan:his life and times |author=Stanley Walpert |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=9780195076615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh: International Crimes Tribunal===

In 2009, the issue of establishing the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]] began to take public support. The tribunal was formally established in 2010 to investigate and prosecute suspects for the genocide committed in 1971 by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators, ''Razakars'', ''Al-Badr'' and ''Al-Shams'' during the Bangladesh Liberation War.&lt;ref&gt;Wierda, Marieke; Anthony Triolo (31 May 2012).

== Long-term consequences ==
* [[Steve Coll]], in his book ''[[Ghost Wars]]'', argues that the Pakistan military's experience with India, including [[Pervez Musharraf]]'s experience in 1971, influenced the Pakistani government to support [[jihadist]] groups in [[Afghanistan]] even after [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|the Soviets left]], because the jihadists were a tool to use against India, including bogging down the Indian Army in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coll|first=Steve|title=Ghost Wars|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ToYxFL5wmBIC|year=2005|publisher=The Penguin Press|isbn=978-1-59420-007-6}} pg 221, 475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people5/Coll/coll-con0.html Kreisler interview with Coll "Conversations with history", 25 March 2005], UC Berkeley Institute of International Studies&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the war, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto authorised the highly secretive and clandestine [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb programme]], as part of its new [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|deterrence policy]], to defend itself and never to allow another armed invasion from [[India]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Many Pakistani scientists, working abroad at the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] and [[Netherlands and weapons of mass destruction|European]] and [[United States and weapons of mass destruction|American]] nuclear programmes, immediately returned to what remained of Pakistan and participated in making Pakistan a [[Pakistan's nuclear weapons|nuclear power]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* Writing about the war in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stated "There is no parallel in contemporary history to the cataclysm which engulfed Pakistan in 1971. A tragic civil war, which rent asunder the people of the two parts of Pakistan, was seized by India as an opportunity for armed intervention. The country was dismembered, its economy shattered and the nation's self-confidence totally undermined."&lt;ref name="FA197304"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bhutto |first=Zulfiqar Ali |date=April 1973 |title=Pakistan Builds Anew |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/24423/zulfikar-ali-bhutto/pakistan-builds-anew |magazine=[[Foreign Affairs]] |access-date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement of Bhutto has given rise to the myth of betrayal prevalent in modern Pakistan. This view was contradicted by the post-War Hamoodur Rahman Commission, ordered by Bhutto himself, which in its 1974 report indicted generals of the Pakistan Army for creating conditions which led to the eventual loss of East Pakistan and for inept handling of military operations in the East.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday2000" /&gt;

The '''International Students of History Association''' ('''ISHA''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] of students of history. Based and active mainly in [[Europe]], ISHA's goals are to facilitate communication and provide a platform of exchange for students of history and related sciences on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isha-international.org/About&lt;/ref&gt;

ISHA was founded in [[Budapest]] in 1990 thanks to the initiative of Hungarian history students who, after [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], wanted to forge links with their colleagues in [[Western Europe]]. At present, ISHA's members include more than 25 sections in fifteen European countries, and a number of observers and associate members, while ISHA is itself an associate member of the [[European Students' Union]] (ESU). Moreover, ISHA closely cooperates with a number of other academic networks, among them the [[European History Network]] and [[EUROCLIO]], the European Association of History Educators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliohworld.net/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php/partners/organisations-browse-our-partners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708171107/http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php/partners/organisations-browse-our-partners |archivedate=2014-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

Throughout the academic year, the various member sections take turns organizing several seminars and an Annual Conference. These events usually last five to seven days and take place with thirty to fifty (in case of the Annual Conference, up to a hundred) student participants from around Europe. They comprise workshops, discussions, lectures and presentations on varying topics, but also offer a cultural programme with visits and excursions. Additional leisure and evening activities are meant to provide more informal opportunities for participants to meet one another and thereby broaden their intercultural understandings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isha-international.org/About&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, ISHA publishes its own journal, ''Carnival'', in which students can publish articles of their own. ''Carnival'' is a yearly publication and is open to contributions from all students of history and related sciences (not only ISHA members).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isha-international.org/Files/Carnival&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The organs of ISHA are:
* The ''General Assembly'' (GA in short), who acts like the parliament of the association. It is made by member and observer sections, but only the former have the right to vote. It decides on the association's policies and the modification of statutes and standing orders and elects the Officials.
* The ''International Board'' (IB in short) is ISHA's executive body. It is composed by four members: President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer, who apply the guidelines decreed by the General Assembly.  
* The ''Council'' represents the main aid of the Board in accomplishing the tasks necessary for the functioning of ISHA.
* The ''Treasury Committee'' is made by two members and has the main task of checking the outgoing treasurer's work at the end of his term.
* The ''Editor-in-Chief'' is responsible for the yearly issue of ''Carnival''.
* The ''Webmaster'' has the task of keeping the ISHA website up-to-date.

{{History of Japan |image=Shoso-in.jpg |caption=[[Shōsōin]]}}

{{nihongo|'''Kansei'''|寛政}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} after ''[[Tenmei]]'' and before ''[[Kyōwa]]''. This period spanned the years from January 1789 through February 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kansei''" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 478|page=478}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Kokaku of Japan|Kōkaku]]''-tennō''|光格天皇}}.

==Change of era==
* '''1789''' {{nihongo|''Kansei gannen''|寛政元年}}: The new era name of '' Kansei'' (meaning "Tolerant Government" or "Broad-minded Government") was created to mark a number of calamities including a devastating fire at the Imperial Palace. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Tenmei'' 9, on the 25th day of the 1st month.

==Events of the Kansei era==
The broad panoply of changes and new initiatives of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] during this era became known as the [[Kansei Reforms]].

[[Matsudaira Sadanobu]] (1759–1829) was named the shōgun's chief councilor (''rōjū'') in the summer of 1787; and early in the next year, he became the regent for the 11th shōgun, [[Tokugawa Ienari]].&lt;ref&gt;Totman, Conrad. ''Politics in the Tokugawa Bakufu''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; As the chief administrative decision-maker in the ''bakufu'' hierarchy, he was in a position to effect radical change; and his initial actions represented an aggressive break with the recent past. Sadanobu's efforts were focused on strengthening the government by reversing many of the policies and practices which had become commonplace under the regime of the previous shōgun, [[Tokugawa Ieharu]]. These reform policies could be interpreted as a reactionary response to the excesses of his ''rōjū'' predecessor, [[Tanuma Okitsugu]] (1719–1788);&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. (1955). ''Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan, 1719–1788''. pp. 131–142.&lt;/ref&gt; and the result was that the Tanuma-initiated, liberalizing reforms within the ''bakufu'' and the relaxation of ''[[sakoku]]'' (Japan's "closed-door" policy of strict control of foreign merchants) were  reversed or blocked.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822'', pp. 148–151, 163–170, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1790''' (''Kansei 2''): Sadanobu and the shogunate promulgate an edict addressed to [[Hayashi Kinpō]], the rector of the Edo Confucian Academy -- "[[Kansei Edict|The Kansei Prohibition of Heterodox Studies]]" (''kansei igaku no kin'').&lt;ref&gt;Nosco, Peter. (1997). ''Confucianism and Tokugawa Culture'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The decree banned certain publications and enjoined strict observance of Neo-Confucian doctrine, especially with regard to the curriculum of the official Hayashi school.&lt;ref&gt;Bodart-Bailey, Beatrice. (2002). "Confucianism in Japan", in {{Google books|osxPipnXeN0C|''Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy,'' p. 668|page=668}}; excerpt, "Scholars vary in their opinion on how far this heterodoxy was enforced and whether this first official insistence on heterodoxy constituted the high point of Confucianism in government affairs or signalled its decline."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lecale''' ({{etymology|ga|Leath Cathail|Cathal's half}}&lt;ref name="DownCouncilArea"/&gt;), is the name of a peninsula and several different historical territorial divisions all located in the east of modern-day [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]].

It is an area of historical and geographic significance, bounded by the [[Quoile Marshes]] (now drained, but formerly extensive), the [[Blackstaff River]], the [[Irish Sea]] and [[Strangford Lough]]. It has an oddly isolated position, virtually cut off from its hinterland, but open to invasion and influence from the east and south.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donnelly, JP  |author2=Donnelly, MM | year=1980 |title=Downpatrick and Lecale. A Short Historical Guide | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anciently it was the name of the Irish [[tuatha|district]] of ''Leath Cathail''. As '''Ladcathel''' it was a county of the [[Earldom of Ulster]], and later the name of the former [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of Lecale, which was then split into [[Lecale Lower]] and [[Lecale Upper]] by 1851.&lt;ref name="ESDS"/&gt;

===Leath Cathail===
Leath Cathail is said to consist of the present-day baronies of Lecale Lower and Lecale Upper,&lt;ref name="Roots"/&gt; and was a subdivision of the ancient kingdom of [[Ulaid]]. It gets its name from Cathal, a prince of Ulaid about 700 A.D. who was a descendant of Fiachna, a son of Deaman, a king of Ulaid.&lt;ref name="Roots"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lecale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vikings"/&gt; Hence Leath Cathail literally means "Cathal's half of [[Dál Fiatach]]".&lt;ref name="Roots"/&gt;

More anciently Leath Cathail was known as Magh Inis, meaning the "island plain", with the name "Isle Lecale" still used in the area.&lt;ref name="Roots"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lecale"/&gt; These names reflect that until the first sea barriers and drainage systems where constructed about 200 years ago, that Lecale was almost entirely encircled by [[Dundrum Bay]], [[Strangford Lough]], and the [[Irish Sea]].&lt;ref name="Lecale"/&gt;

The Cenél nÓengusa are noted as being kings of Leath Cathail, with the ''Ua Flathraoi'' cited as lords by the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Roots"/&gt; According to the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], on the day of the Festival of Paul and Peter (29 June), 1147, the Ulaid gave battle to the [[Cenél nEógain]] of [[Kings of Tír Eógain|Tír Eoghain]] who had pursued them to the shores of ''Dún Droma'' (Dundrum Bay), Leath Cathail.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt; The Ulaid suffered a heavy defeat, including the death of Archu Ua Flathraoi, "lord of Leath-Chathail", with the victorious ''Cenél nEógain'' plundering Lecale and taken off with Ulidian hostages.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt;

===Dundrum===
This ''Dún Droma'' ("fort of the ridge"), is now known as [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum]],&lt;ref name="DownCouncilArea"/&gt;  and is called ''Dún Droma [[Dáirine|Dairinne]]'', the "fort of Dairinne's ridge", in a poem by Gilbride MacNamee, a bard of the Cenél nEóġain.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt; This poem, written to lament the death of Bryan O'Neill, and the defeat of the Irish at the [[Battle of Druim Dearg|battle of Downpatrick]] in 1260, boasts of their victories over their enemies and makes mentions the victory over the Ulidians, however in reference to the battle of Downpatrick, the bard would lament "Alas! We have paid for it".&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt;

[[Dundrum Castle]], which now occupies the original ''dún'' or earthen fort, is said to have been built for the [[Knights Templar]] by [[John de Courcy]], and they are said to have held it until 1313 when their order was suppressed. It was afterward granted to the prior of Down.&lt;ref name="Laverty"/&gt;

===St. Patrick, St. Brigid and St. Colmcille===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
[[St. Patrick]] landed at the Slaney estuary on his return to Ireland. A large granite statue of him looking into the rest of Ireland at Raholp today overlooks the site. He died at the Abbey of Saul where he began his mission and was administered his dying communion by Bishop Tassach of Raholp. His remains were carried to [[Downpatrick]], then known as Dun Dhá Leath Glais, which lies within Lecale Upper.

[[Brigid of Kildare]]'s relics were brought to Downpatrick for safekeeping from Danish plunderers in 835 and Saint [[Columba]] was brought here from Iona in 877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyirelanda00tragoog|title=The history of Ireland, ancient and modern|first1=[James] 1802-1763 [from old catalog|last1=MacGeoghegan|first2=Patrick|last2=O'Kelly|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Dublin, J. Duffy|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent burning of Downpatrick caused them to be buried in the abbey yard and the site was forgotten about until 1185.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/anhistoricalacc05olagoog|title=An Historical Account of the Diocese of Down and Connor, Ancient and Modern|first=|last=James O'Laverty|date=19 April 1878|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon rediscovery [[John de Courcy]] had them reinstated in a tomb within the abbey on 9 June 1186 by Cardinal Vivian.

The abbey was desecrated by Lord [[Leonard Grey]] in 1538 and he was executed three years later for his callous actions. It appears that the relics of the saints remained intact until 1790 when the building was being remodelled as [[Down Cathedral]]. Accounts given record that the tomb was vandalised and the relics were scattered over the abbey yard prompting the Downpatrick people to hurriedly bury them at their present site.

It is said that the town cross was placed on the grave but it was carried off and vandalised. The [[Belfast Naturalists' Field Club]] erected the large granite slab over the grave in 1900 to protect the grave as it had become customary for those leaving Ireland to take soil from the grave with them.

===Medieval and modern Lecale===
The Earls of [[Kildare]] formerly held control of the customs of Stangford and [[Ardglass]], both in Lecale Lower, of which it is noted that:&lt;ref name="DownCouncilArea"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The port offered excellent sea communications and the fertile area of Lecale was prosperous, so de Courcey incorporated the whole as part of the Pale and rewarded his followers with grants of land. Later, Henry VIII granted the revenue of the port, amounting to £5,000, to Gerald Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare. The association of the Kildare family with Ardglass continued for three centuries"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lecale is also recorded under the name of "Ladcathel" as one of the seven counties of the [[Earldom of Ulster]] in 1333.&lt;ref name="Bardon"/&gt; It was also the name of a former barony in Ireland, which by 1851 had been split into [[Lecale Lower]] and [[Lecale Upper]].&lt;ref name="ESDS"/&gt;

The Russells of Downpatrick have been established in Lecale since the 12th century having been recorded in the area since Osberto Russell accompanied John de Courcy in 1177 into Ulster.&lt;ref name="Surnames"/&gt; Thomas Russell, one of the leaders of the [[United Irishmen]] who led the rising of 1803, was imprisoned in Downpatrick [[gaol]] and on 21 October 1803 was hanged at the gate of the gaol. 'The Man From God Knows Where' is a ballad written by Florence Wilson in commemoration of him.&lt;ref name="DownCouncilArea"/&gt;

==Geography==
Until 1745, when the first sea barriers were constructed by Edward Southwell, the sea encircled almost the whole of the area. This action saw the creation of the [[River Quoile]] and 500 acres of land around Downpatrick. [[Strangford Lough]] bounds the northern edge and the [[Irish Sea]] the east and [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum]] inner bay forms the western edge.

The soils are mostly light-medium [[loam]]s, well suited for the production of grain, and it forms one of the most extensively cultivated areas of Northern Ireland. This was also the case historically. [[Ordnance Survey]] memoirs of 1833 to 1837 state that in some parishes, such as Dunsfort and Ballee, the land was almost exclusively used for cultivation, rather than grazing. The low livestock density meant that [[marl]] and [[Agricultural lime|lime]] was often used instead of manure. [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] observed that the area was almost completely under grain cultivation (largely [[barley]]) during the late 18th century and that south Lecale was more fertile than the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Proudfoot, L (ed)| year=1997 |title= Down.History and Society (Farming and Food in Medieval Lecale by F McCormick)| publisher=Geography Publications | location=Dublin |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, a 3108ha area of the Lecale Peninsula, lying between the [[Mourne Mountains]] and Strangford Lough, was designated as the [[Lecale Coast AONB|Lecale Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/landscape/designated-areas/aonb/aonb_lecale.htm|title=Lecale Coast AONB|author=|date=|website=ehsni.gov.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John D. Rockefeller.jpg|thumb|right|[[John D. Rockefeller]] is often considered the wealthiest person in modern history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlodonnell/2014/07/11/the-rockefellers-the-legacy-of-historys-richest-man/#6b5586da60e7 The Rockefellers: The Legacy Of History's Richest Man], Forbes 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness World Records]] claims John D. Rockefeller was the richest person.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''list of the wealthiest historical figures''' gathers published estimates as to the ([[Real versus nominal value (economics)|inflation-adjusted]]) net-worth and fortunes of the wealthiest [[historical figure]]s in comparison. Due to problems arising from different definitions of wealth, ways of measuring it, various economic models throughout history, as well as multiple other reasons—this article discusses the wealthiest people in the following separate historical periods: [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Middle Ages]] and [[modern period]]. Accordingly—because of the previously mentioned difficulties—it is not possible to determine the single richest person in all of history.

For the [[modern period]], wealth can be measured more or less objectively via [[inflation adjustment]], e.g. comparing the [[Economy of the United States|nominal GDP of the United States]] of the respective periods, and then converting it into contemporary United States dollars. For the medieval and ancient history, comparison of wealth becomes more problematic, on one hand due to the inaccuracy or unreliability of records, on the other due to the difficulty of comparing a pre-industrial economy to a modern one, and especially in the presence of [[absolute monarchy]], where an entire kingdom or empire is considered the ruler's personal property.  The latter factor is also an issue in the early modern to modern period, e.g. Davidson (2015) lists [[Joseph Stalin]] among ''The 10 Richest People of All Time'' for his "complete control of a nation with 9.6% of global GDP".&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

Excluding [[monarch]]s and [[autocracy|autocrats]], the wealthiest private individual in the [[history of capitalism]] is variously identified as [[Jakob Fugger]] (died 1525), of the early modern [[Fugger]] family of merchants and bankers,&lt;ref name=Fugger&gt;Daniel Eckert,[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article155974825/So-wurde-Fugger-zum-reichsten-Menschen-der-Geschichte.html So wurde Jakob Fugger zum reichsten Menschen der Historie] ("This is how Jakob Fugger became the wealthiest person in history"), ''[[Die Welt]]'', 6 June 2016 {{de-icon}}. "Auf heutige Verhältnisse hochgerechnet läge das Vermögen des Bauernenkels bei unglaublichen 400 Milliarden Dollar (354 Milliarden Euro). In die Nähe dieses Wertes kamen nur die Rothschilds, die in ihrer Glanzzeit im 19. Jahrhundert die mächtigste Bankiersfamilie der Welt waren" ("Adjusted to current-day conditions, the net worth of the farmer's grandson would be close to astonishing 400 billion dollars (354 billion Euro). Only the Rothschild family, at their peak in the 19th century the most powerful family of bankers, came close to such a figure."&lt;/ref&gt; and early 20th-century American entrepreneurs [[Andrew Carnegie]] (died 1919)&lt;ref name=Carnegie&gt;listed at 372 billion US$2014 by Jacob Davidson, [http://time.com/money/3977798/the-10-richest-people-of-all-time time.com The 10 Richest People of All Time], 30 July 2015: "Rockefeller gets all the press, but Andrew Carnegie may be the richest American of all time. The Scottish immigrant sold his company, U.S. Steel, to J.P. Morgan for $480 million in 1901. That sum equates to about slightly over 2.1% of U.S. GDP at the time, giving Carnegie economic power equivalent to $372 billion in 2014."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John D. Rockefeller]] (died 1937). Frequently, one of these few people is considered to be the richest person of all time, depending on source.

While the [[Rothschild family]] rose to the status of the [[List of wealthiest families|wealthiest family]] of bankers in the 19th century, their wealth was distributed among a number of family members, preventing them from appearing among the wealthiest individuals. The richest among the Rothschilds was the head of its English branch—[[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]]—the richest person of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t7pKCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=nathan+meyer+rothschild+richest#v=onepage&amp;q=nathan%20meyer%20rothschild%20richest&amp;f=false GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History] p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein and Swan in ''All the Money in the World'' (2008) mention the top three [[List of richest Americans in history|richest Americans ever]]—all [[tycoons]] of the [[Gilded Age]]—respectively: John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]; [[Henry Ford]] was ranked only 12th.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ4KnsyVQh8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pl&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=rockefeller&amp;f=false ''All the Money in the World''] (2008) by Bernstein and Swan, p. 17 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Close (2016), the [[List of female billionaires|wealthiest woman]] in the history of capitalism, excluding monarchs, was ''L'Oréal'' heiress [[Liliane Bettencourt]], whose net worth was at $40.7 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name="Close"&gt;Kerry Close, [http://time.com/money/4153560/10-richest-women-all-time/ The 10 Richest Women of All Time], time.com, 1 February 2016. Bettencourt ranks at #6 in this list, after five ancient rulers and monarchs of the Middle Ages and early modern period.&lt;/ref&gt; Including monarchs, he mentions [[Empress Wu]] for Antiquity, [[Isabella of Castile]] for Middle Ages, and [[Catherine the Great]] for modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Close, [http://time.com/money/4153560/10-richest-women-all-time/ The 10 Richest Women of All Time], time.com. Empress Wu ranks at #1 in this list, Catherine the Great at #3, and Isabella of Castile at #5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern to modern period==
Listed individuals are thought to have had a net worth of at least the equivalent of 100 billion [[United States dollars]]. Therefore, it excludes figures such as [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[Richard B. Mellon]], [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]], [[A.T. Stewart]], [[Heshen]], [[J.P. Morgan]], and others.

As emperor, and an autocrat, the resources under Nicholas II's command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was officially owned by the State as Crown property. From this, supplemented by an annuity from the Treasury, he derived an annual income of 24 million [[rouble]]s, from which he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings.&lt;ref name="Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64"&gt;Massie, Robert K.

|Henry Ford was an American automotive engineer, entrepreneur, and founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Through his designing of the [[Model T Ford]] and employing the assembly line means of rapid production, he was able to lower the base price of his product in order to reach a wider market. As production increased, Ford further reduced prices and increased salaries to reduce worker turnover. This resulted in a rapid increase in output, with Ford production rising from roughly 18,000 cars in 1909 to over 1 million cars in 1920. Despite Ford stating that his focus was increasing Ford Motor Company's benefit to society and to its employees, even at one point [[Dodge v. Ford Motor Company|being sued by the Dodge brothers]] based on this premise, his company was massively profitable. His highest earnings were recorded at age 57 and he died at the age of 83 in 1947 at a net worth of US$188.1 billion (inflation-adjusted value in 2008 dollars).

|[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]

After several years of exile, Crassus was able to rebuild his family fortune by seizing the property of executed convicts for himself.&lt;ref name="TrivLibCrassus"&gt;[[Wallechinsky, David]] &amp; [[Irving Wallace]].

Web. 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus also expanded his wealth by trading in slaves and by purchasing whole neighborhoods of Rome as they burned, for drastically less than market value. Crassus was known in Rome as ''Dives'', meaning "The Rich". It is believed that Crassus expanded his personal fortune to 170 million sesterces, while [[Pliny the Elder]] surmised his fortune to be valued even higher, at 200 million sesterces. This would place Crassus's net worth equal to the total annual budget of the Roman treasury.
Crassus has often been listed among the "wealthiest individuals in history", although depending on the estimate of the "adjusted value" of a Roman [[sesterce]], his net worth may also be placed in the range of US$200 million to US$20 billion.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;
"Often named as the richest man ever, a more accurate conversion of sesterce would put his modern figure between $200 million and $20 billion." [[Peter L. Bernstein]].

The '''''longue durée''''' ({{IPA-fr|lɔ̃ɡ dyʁe}}; {{lang-en|the '''long term'''}}) is an expression used by the French [[Annales School]] of historical writing to designate their approach to the study of history. It gives priority to long-term historical structures over what [[François Simiand]] called ''histoire événementielle'' ("evental history", the short-term time-scale that is the domain of the [[chronicle]]r and the [[journalist]]), concentrating instead on all-but-permanent or slowly evolving structures, and substitutes for élite biographies the broader syntheses of [[prosopography]].

The longue durée is part of a tripartite system that includes short-term événements and medium-term conjunctures (periods of decades or centuries when more profound cultural changes such as the industrial revolution can take place).

The approach, which incorporates social scientific methods such as the recently evolved field of [[economic history]]&lt;ref&gt;A "first key", according to Braudel 1958:731, who asserted (p. 734)  "All the human sciences, history included, are contaminated by one another. They speak the same language, or can do so." ("''Tous les sciences de l'homme, y compris l'histoire, sont contaminées les unes par les autres. Elles parlent le même langage ou peuvent le parler.''")&lt;/ref&gt; into general history, was pioneered by [[Marc Bloch]]&lt;ref&gt;In this context Fernand Braudel (1958:734) remarked on the great distance between Bloch and the history writing of the mediaevalist and palaeographer [[Charles-Victor Langlois]] and Charles Seignobos, summed up in their joint ''Introduction aux Études Historiques'' (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lucien Febvre]] in the [[Interwar period]]. The approach was carried on by [[Fernand Braudel]] in the second part of the century: Braudel took stock of the current status of social studies in crisis, foundering under the weight of their own successes, in an article in 1958, "Histoire et sciences sociales: La longue durée".&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' '''13'''.4 (October - December 1958), pp. 725–753; he returned in 1987 to examine with A. Coll the alliance between the new history and the social sciences, in "Histoire et sciences sociales: La longue durée" ''Réseaux'', '''5:27''' 1987:7-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works which Braudel remarked on as examples of the ''longue durée'' was Alphonse Dupront's study&lt;ref&gt;Dupront, ''Le Mythe de Croisade: essai de sociologie religieuse'', 1959, reprinted without the subtitle 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; of the long-standing idea in Western Europe of a [[crusade]], which extended across diverse European societies far beyond the last days of the actual crusades, and among spheres of thought with a long life he noted [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian science]].&lt;ref&gt;Braudel 1958:732.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''longue durée'' of economic history, beyond, or beneath, the cycles and structural crises, lie "old attitudes of thought and action, resistant frameworks dying hard, at times against all logic."&lt;ref&gt;"''de vieilles attitudes de penser et d'agir, de cadres résistants, durs à mourir, parfois contre toute logique''" (p. 733).&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the history of the ''longue durée'' that informs Braudel's two masterworks&lt;ref&gt;The effects of geography on human affairs sketched in the opening of ''The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip II'' and the first volume especially of ''Civilization and Capitalism: 15th-18th Century'', with its evocative title ''The structures of everyday life: the limits of the possible''.&lt;/ref&gt; offers a contrast to the archives-directed history that arose at the end of the 19th century and a return to the broader views of the earlier generation of [[Jules Michelet]], [[Leopold von Ranke]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]] or [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]].&lt;ref&gt;At least Braudel thought so, remarking the contrast and explicitly mentioning these particular 19th-century historians (Braudel 1958:729).&lt;/ref&gt;

Averil Cameron, in examining the Mediterranean world in [[late antiquity]] concluded that "consideration of the ''longue durée'' is more helpful than the appeal to immediate causal factors."&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, "Conclusion", ''The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity AD 396-600'', 1993:197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergio Villalobos]] also expressly took the long view in his ''Historia del pueblo chileno.''

[[File:Luz Jimenez.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Luz Jimenez and her daughter Conchita taken in 1926 by photographer [[Tina Modotti]].]]
'''Luz Jiménez''' or '''Luciana''' (born '''Julia Jiménez González'''; 1897–1965) was an [[indigenous Mexican]] [[model (art)|model]] and [[Nahuatl]]-language [[storytelling|storyteller]] and [[Informant (linguistics)|linguistic informant]] from [[Milpa Alta]], [[Mexican Federal District|D.F.]]

As a young woman she witnessed the [[Mexican Revolution]], and was present when [[Emiliano Zapata]] and his revolutionary army entered Milpa Alta in 1911. Her eyewitness account is one of the only testimonies of Emiliano Zapata speaking [[Nahuatl]]. In 1916 most of her male relatives were killed in a massacre by the [[Venustiano Carranza|Carrancistas]].

In the 1930s she served as a linguistic informant to linguists working to document the Nahuatl language. Among others she worked with [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] who credits her in his description of Milpa Alta Nahuatl. She also worked as a model for artist [[Diego Rivera]] and her portrait can be seen in at least three of his murals, one of them the famous [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]] market scene.

In 1942 she started work as a model at the [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]] (National School of Painting, Sculpture and Printmaking) in [[Frida Kahlo]]'s classes.&lt;ref name=uni&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/2109.html "Aspectos de la carrera de Luz Jiménez como modelo", ''El Universal'', 1999-11-23]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her old age she told her life's story to anthropologist [[Fernando Horcasitas]] who published it with the title "Life and Death in Milpa Alta".

As the [[godparent]]s of her daughter Concha, [[Jean Charlot]] and [[Anita Brenner]] were her ''[[compadre]]s''. Luz died in 1965 after being hit by a car in [[Mexico City]].

'''Maurits van Rooijen''' [[FRSA]] ([[Breda]], 1956) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[social history|socio]]-[[economic historian]] and geographer. His research has concentrated on green urbanisation and re-interpreting [[Garden city movement|garden city]] principles. In recent publications he has promoted the concept of the "Global Knowledge City" arguing that in "the 21st century besides the need to blend urbanisation with agriculture and manufacturing (the original garden city mission), global knowledge innovation should be at the core of sustainable urbanisation."&lt;ref name="bav.ibavi"&gt;[http://bav.ibavi.org/index.php/beliefs-and-values/article/view/174 The Global Knowledge Cities Concept: Local-Global Solutions to Social, Economic, and Ecological Crises]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], several nations took on [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) in [[Afghanistan]]. OEF was the initial combat operations starting on 7 October 2001, in the wake of the [[11 September attacks]] on the United States, and during 2002 and 2003.

This list covers US and coalition forces and other forms of support for OEF from October 2001. Some nations' operations in Afghanistan continued as part of NATO's [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF). For example, United States troops are deployed both in the OEF and ISAF.

French special forces operators have served in Afghanistan since the formation of ISAF, in 2003 150 [[Special Operations Command (France)|COS]] operators were deployed to replace the Italian ISAF contingent, the COS primarily conducted reconnaissance and close-protection tasks.&lt;ref name=Neville&gt;Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 and beginning again in the summer of 2003, 200 soldiers from various units of the [[Army Special Forces Brigade]] (BFST), along with marine and air commandos, have conducted operations against the Taliban, under command and in co-operation with U.S. special operations forces present in the area. French forces have since supported the ISAF mission.

Between 2003 and 2007, a 200-man COS unit operated under direct ISAF SOF command of OEF-A, their tasks were restricted to what author Stephen Saideman said was "short-term counter terrorism and counterinsurgency raids" rather than londer Special Reconnaissance missions, nor were they allowed to conduct partnered operations. Despite the restrictions, French SOF operators were carried out a large number of successful Direct Action operations, often in joint operations with American and sometimes British special forces. The French special forces contribution to OEF-A ended in 2007 after disputes over its role.&lt;ref name=Neville&gt;Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly 150 aircraft were initially deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom, including some two dozen [[Boeing B-52]] bombers and support aircraft.

In 2007, 23,000 American troops were in Afghanistan, in the OEF-A. Other US troops are in [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]].

==Uzbekistan==
[[Uzbekistan]] had allowed the U.S. to place troops on the ground as well as use the Uzbek airbase, K2, for support activities and for deployment and command and control of Special Forces into all of Afghanistan except for the Khandahar region. K2 is no longer in use by the U.S.

In the [[United States]], '''Patriot Day''' occurs on September 11 of each year in memory of the [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|people killed]] in the [[September 11 attacks]] of the year 2001.

==History==
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]],  proclaimed Friday September 14, 2001, as a '''National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of the Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010913-7.html National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims Of the Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001] A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill to make September 11 a [[national day of mourning]] was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] on October 25, 2001, by Rep. [[Vito Fossella]] (R-NY) with 22 co-sponsors, among them 11 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 11 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref name="thomas.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:HJ00071:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;#cosponsors |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 107th Congress (2001–2002) H.J.RES.71 All Information – Office of the Clerk |accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill requested that the President designate September 11 of each year as '''Patriot Day'''.  Joint Resolution 71 passed the House by a vote of 407–0, with 25 members not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll407.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 407 |publisher=[[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|Office of the Clerk]] |accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the Senate unanimously on November 30.

The [[flag of the United States]] is flown at [[half-staff]] at the White House and on all [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] buildings and establishments throughout the world; flags are also encouraged to be displayed on individual American homes.  Additionally, a [[moment of silence]] is observed to correspond with the attacks, beginning at 8:46&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Daylight Time]]), the time the first plane, [[American Airlines Flight 11]], struck the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001.

Patriot Day is not a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]]; schools and businesses remain open in observance of the occasion, although memorial ceremonies for the victims are often held. Volunteer and service opportunities are coordinated by the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3749">[[Image:PJBlok.jpg|150px|thumb|Petrus Johannes Blok &lt;br&gt;Painting by [[Thérèse Schwartze]] ]]

'''Petrus Johannes Blok''' ([[Den Helder]], 10 January 1855 – [[Leiden]], 24 October 1929) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[history|historian]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Den Helder]], Blok studied at the [[Latin school|Latin School]] of [[Alkmaar]] and read [[classics]] at [[Leiden University]], receiving his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] for a study of [[Sextus Pompeius]]. After this, he got a position at the [[Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden|Leiden Latin School]], and published two books on the city's [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] history.

In 1884, he was made [[professor]] of [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch History]] at the [[University of Groningen]], where he supervised the publication of a series of historical documents from the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Drenthe]]. He was in the habit of traveling much to search for written documents, which brought him as far as [[Rome]]: a very long trip back then. Among his students was [[Pieter Jelles Troelstra]].

In 1892, Blok was elected a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002815 |title=Petrus Johannes Blok (1855 - 1929) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, he succeeded [[Robert Fruin]] as professor of Dutch History in Leiden.

==Ideas==
Blok believed that it was the task of a historian to stress a country's ''national'' past and contribute to a sense of unity. It does not come as a surprise that he was one of the editors of the ''[[Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek]]'' ("New Dutch Biographical Dictionary"). His books are biographical in nature and are about Dutch heroes: ''[[William the Silent|Oranje]]'' (1919–1920), ''[[Frederik Hendrik]]'' (1924), and ''[[Michiel de Ruyter|De Ruyter]]'' (1928).

His work, the ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche volk'', consists of eight volumes, published between 1892 and 1907. It is really a history of a nation – with its arts, economy, religions, laws, and daily life – and not the story of a state. It is a book about people, but not a real social history; Blok's magnum opus has unfavorably been compared to [[Henri Pirenne|Pirenne]]'s famous ''[[Histoire de Belgique (book)|Histoire de Belgique]]'' (1909–1932). (The English translation, by [[Ruth Putnam (author)|Ruth Putnam]] and Oscar A. Bierstadt, of Blok's book, ''History of the people of the Netherlands'', is abridged and has five volumes.)

==Legacy==
His ideas about history as an instrument of [[nation building]] have for a long time been out of fashion among academicians, but returned very much to the center of the Dutch public debate in 2006, when politician [[Jan Marijnissen]] argued for the creation of a Museum of National History. His proposal was accepted in 2008, but ultimately the museum didn't materialize.

Blok is the spiritual father of the Dutch Institute in the [[Villa Borghese gardens]], which he founded in 1904.

Rytz studied history at the [[University of Bern]] and graduated (''Lizentiat'') in history, sociology and constitutional law in 1997. Her coop-programs included projects for the educational department (''Erziehungsdirektion'') of the canton of Bern from 1990 to 1992, and assistance work for Professor Richard Bäumlin at the constitutional law seminary (''Staatsrechtliches Seminar'') in 1992 and 1993. From 1998 to 2000 she researched on the field of ''Gewalt im Alltag und organisierte Kriminalität'' (literally: violence in dailylife and organized crime) within the scope of a research program of the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] (''Nationalfonds'') at her alma mater.&lt;ref name="regularytz-persönlich"/&gt;

== Political career ==
[[File:Schweizer Grüne.jpg|thumb|Regula Rytz, second from the left, with other politicians of the green party]]
Originally a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz|SP political party]] and a primary school teacher, Rytz came from Thun to Bern to study history and sociology. Rytz was member of the ''Student/innenrat'', the student council of the University of Bern from 1988 to 1994.&lt;ref name="regularytz-persönlich"/&gt; At the university she organized counter-events to the conventional lectures, reanimated the [[feminist science]] (''Feministische Wissenschaft'') association, and was member of the action group ''Kritische Uni'' (literally: Critical University) where she spent a "very self-determined and motion-oriented time. I had the chance to organize substantive discussions, without being clamped in a fixed political party hierarchy", she recalled in an interview in 2011. When she joined the Green Alliance (''Grünes Bündnis Bern'') in 1987, Rytz initially was a base member. Between 1993 and 1998 she was also engaged as political secretary of ''Grünes Bündnis Bern'', a regional fraction of the [[Green Party of Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="woz-20111110"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woz.ch/1145/regula-rytz/die-pragmatische-brueckenbauerin|title=Die pragmatische Brückenbauerin|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 45/2011|author=Noëmi Landolt|language=German|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this function, she was also responsible for the organizational and strategic management, and provided technical and policy advice of [[Therese Frösch]], the finance director of Bern. In 1994 she was elected to the parliament of the Canton of Bern where Rytz also was engaged in commissions focussing on education policy, fiscal policy, economic policy and state policy by 2005. Then she was elected as executive member (''Gemeinderätin'') of the city of Bern where she directed the department ''Tiefbau, Verkehr und Stadtgrün'' that provided the municipal civil engineering, transport and the urban green areas. In 2008 she was re-elected, getting the most votes of all governmental members. By 2012, she was responsible for the implementation of large projects such as the reconstruction of the ''Bahnhofplatz'' plaza and the construction of [[Tram Bern West]].&lt;ref name="regularytz-persönlich"/&gt;

At the end of her tenure as member of the municipal executive in Bern, Rytz was elected to the [[National Council (Switzerland)|National Council]] in the [[Swiss federal election, 2011|Swiss federal election]] in October 2011, and re-elected in October 2015. From May 2012 to April 2016 Rytz was co-president, in co-operation with [[Adèle Thorens Goumaz|Adèle Thorens]], of the Green Party of Switzerland (''Die Grünen'').&lt;ref name="regularytz-persönlich"/&gt; On 16 April 2016 she was elected as the party's exclusive president by further two years.&lt;ref name="grüneCH-regularytz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruene.ch/gruene/de/die_gruenen/partei/praesidium.html|title=Präsidium|publisher=[[Grüne Partei der Schweiz]]|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mandatory work ==
From 2001 to 2004 Rytz was general secretary of the [[Schweizerischer Gewerkschaftsbund|Swiss Federation of Trade Unions]], focussing on labor law, health and [[free movement of persons]]. Regula Rytz is engaged as president of the [[Canton of Bern|cantonal]] commission for [[gender mainstreaming]] (''Fachkommission für die Gleichstellung''), as board member of the national [[Alpen-Initiative]] (''Iniziativa da las Alps'') and Lötschberg initiative committees,&lt;ref name="alpen-initiative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpeninitiative.ch/alpeninitiative/ueber_uns.html|title=Über uns|publisher=[[Alpen-Initiative]]|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the board of directors (''Verwaltungsrätin'') of the municipal transport services in Biel/Bienne ([[Verkehrsbetriebe Biel]]),&lt;ref name="grünebern-regularytz"/&gt; and board member of the cantonal section of the [[VCS Verkehrs-Club der Schweiz]]. The VCS is committed to sustainable mobility, endorses an optimum interaction between the different modes of transport. Regardless if automobile, tram or bike, whether on foot or by train and bus, the association relies on the combined mobility.&lt;ref name="vcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verkehrsclub.ch/unsere-themen/|title=Leitbild + Statuten|publisher=[[VCS Verkehrs-Club der Schweiz]]|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As member (''Nationalrätin'') of the Swiss National Council, Rytz is engaged in the commission for transport and telecommunication (''Kommission für Verkehr und Fernmeldewesen'').&lt;ref name="regularytz-persönlich"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grünebern-regularytz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruenebern.ch/personen/nationalrat/|title=Nationalrat|publisher=gruenebern.ch|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tagesschau-20160416"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/tagesschau|title=SRF Tagesschau vom 16.4.2016|publisher=[[SRF Tagesschau]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-04-16|accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rytz is also committed to the ongoing political ''[[Atomausstiegsinitiative]]'' campaign for a nuclear phase-out in Switzerland, stating that Switzerland is the only country in the world to issue iodine tablets to its population as a precautionary measure to a possible atomar [[design basis accident]].&lt;ref name="10vor10-20161116"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/10vor10/machtuebergabe-in-den-usa-atomaustiegsinitiative-hahnenwasser|title=GFS-Umfrage: Es wird knapp bei der Atomausstiegsinitiative |publisher=[[10vor10]]|author=|language=German|date=2016-11-16|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38293">'''Rhetoric of science''' is a body of [[academic publishing|scholarly literature]] exploring the notion that the practice of [[science]] is a [[rhetoric]]al activity. It emerged following a number of similarly-oriented disciplines during the late 20th century, including the disciplines of [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], [[history of science]], and [[philosophy of science]], but it is practiced most fully by rhetoricians in departments of English, speech, and communication.

==Overview==
[[Rhetoric]] is best known as a discipline that studies the means and ends of [[persuasion]]. Science, meanwhile, is typically seen as the discovery and recording of [[knowledge]] about the natural world. A key contention of rhetoric of science is that the practice of science is, to varying degrees, persuasive. The study of science from this viewpoint variously examines modes of inquiry, logic, [[argumentation]], the [[ethos]] of scientific practitioners, the structures of scientific publications, and the character of scientific discourse and debates.

For instance, scientists must convince their community of scientists that their research is based on sound scientific method. From a rhetorical point of view, [[scientific method]] involves problem-solution ''[[Rhetoric topos|topoi]]'' (the materials of discourse) that demonstrate observational and experimental competence (arrangement or order of discourse or method), and as a means of persuasion, offer explanatory and [[predictive power]].&lt;ref name=Prelli&gt;[[Lawrence J. Prelli]] (1989) ''A Rhetoric of Science: Inventing Scientific Discourse'', [[University of South Carolina Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 185-193}} Experimental competence is itself a persuasive ''topos''.&lt;ref name=Prelli/&gt;{{rp|186}} Rhetoric of science is a practice of suasion that is an outgrowth of some of the [[Rhetoric#Canons|canons of rhetoric]].

==History==
Since 1970, rhetoric of science, as a field involving rhetoricians, flourished. This flourishing of scholarly activity contributed to a shift in the image of science that was taking place.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xv}} A conservative approach to rhetoric of science involves treating texts as communications designed to persuade members of scientific communities. This approach concerns scientific claims that are already considered true as a result of the scientific process rather than the rhetorical process. A more radical approach, on the other hand, would treat these same texts as if the science held within them is also an object of rhetorical scrutiny.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622,3}} Among those in the conservative camp, who view science texts as vehicles of communication, are [[Charles Bazerman]], [[John Angus Campbell]], Greg Myers, Jean Dietz Moss, [[Lawrence J. Prelli]], Carolyn Miller and Jeanne Fahnestock. Bazerman's close readings of works by Newton and Compton as well as his analysis of the reading habits of physicists and others led to a greater understanding of the successes and failures of communication.&lt;ref name=GrE&gt;[[Alan G. Gross]] (1996) "Rhetoric of Science", ''Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age''. New York: [[Garland Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|623,4}} For a depiction of the views of the more radical camp, see the section titled "Critique of Rhetoric of Science".

The history of the rhetoric of science effectively begins with [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s seminal work, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). He examines first normal science, that is, a practice which he saw as routine, patterned and accessible with a specific method of problem-solving. Building on past knowledge, normal science advances by accretions in a [[knowledge base]].&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xiii}} Kuhn then contrasts normal science with revolutionary science (ground-breaking science marked by a paradigm-shift in thought). When Kuhn began to teach Harvard undergraduates historical texts such as Aristotle's writings on motion, he looked to case studies, and sought first to understand Aristotle in his own time, and then to locate his problems and solutions within a wider context of contemporary thought and actions.
&lt;ref name=Nick&gt;Nickles, Thomas (2003) "Normal Science: From Logic to Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning", in ''Thomas Kuhn'', edited by Thomas Nickles, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-79648-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}} That is to say, Kuhn sought first to understand the traditions and established practices of science.&lt;ref name=Nick/&gt;{{rp|162}} In this instance, [[Michael Polanyi]]'s influence on Kuhn becomes apparent; that is, his acknowledgement of the importance of inherited practices and rejection of absolute objectivity. Observing the changes in scientific thought and practices, Kuhn concluded that revolutionary changes happen through the defining notion of rhetoric: [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=HIL&gt;Harris, Randy Allen (1997) "Introduction", ''Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science: Case Studies'', editor Randy Allen Harris, Mahwah: Hermagoras Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiv}} The critical work of Herbert W. Simons – "Are Scientists Rhetors in Disguise?" in ''Rhetoric in Transition'' (1980) – and subsequent works show that Kuhn's ''Structure'' is fully rhetorical.

The work of Thomas Kuhn was extended by [[Richard Rorty]] (1979, 1989), and this work was to prove fruitful in defining the means and ends of rhetoric in scientific discourse (Jasinski "Intro" xvi). Rorty, who coined the phrase "rhetorical turn", was also interested in assessing periods of scientific stability and instability.

Another component of the shift in science that took place in the past centres on the claim that there is no single scientific method, but rather a plurality of methods, approaches or styles.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} [[Paul Feyerabend]] in ''[[Against Method]]'' (1975) contends that science has found no "method that turns ideologically contaminated ideas into true and useful theories", in other words; no special method exists that can guarantee the success of science (302).

As evidenced in the early theory papers after Kuhn's seminal work, the idea that rhetoric is crucial to science came to the fore. Quarterly journals in speech and rhetoric saw a flourishing of discussion on topics such as inquiry, [[logic]], argument fields, [[ethos]] of scientific practitioners, argumentation, scientific text, and the character of scientific [[discourse]] and debates. Philip Wander (1976) observed, for instance, the phenomenal penetration of science (public science) in modern life. He labelled the obligation of rhetoricians to investigate science's discourse "The Rhetoric of Science" (Harris "Knowing" 164).

As rhetoric of science began to flourish, discussion arose in a number of areas, including:
* Epistemic rhetoric and the discourses on the nature of semantics, knowledge, and truth: One example is the Robert L. Scott's work on viewing rhetoric as epistemic (1967). By the 1990s, [[epistemic]] rhetoric was a point of contention in the writing of Dilip Gaonkar (see "Critique" below).
* The early 1970s Speech Communication Conference ("Wingspread conference") gave recognition to the fact that rhetoric, in its globalization (multidisciplinary nature), has become a universal [[hermeneutic]] (Gross ''Rhetorical'' 2-5). Much scholastic output evolved around the theory of interpretation (hermeneutics), the knowledge-making and truth-seeking (epistemic) potential of rhetoric of science.
* Argument Fields (part of the Speech Communication Association and American forensic Association program): In this domain the work of [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] on argument appeals is exemplary. In addition, Michael Mulkay, Barry Barnes and David Bloor, as pioneers of the "[[Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]]" (SSK) movement, fostered a growing sociobiology debate. Others as Greg Myers expressed the benefits of a collaboration between rhetoricians and sociologists. Contributors to discussion pertaining to audience – the way arguments change as they move from the scientific community to the public – include John Lyne and Henry Howe.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxi-xxxii}}
* Scientific Giants: The important works that investigate the suasive powers of exemplars in science include those of Alan Gross&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Alan G. (1990) ''The Rhetoric of Science'', [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], argument fields in optics), John Angus Campbell&lt;ref&gt;[[John Angus Campbell]] (1989) [http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~raha/309CWeb/Campbell%281989%29.pdf The Invisible Rhetorician: Charles Darwin’s Third Party Strategy], ''The Rhetorician'' 7(1): 55–85, via [[University of Waterloo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Darwin), and Michael Halloran (Watson and Crick). [[J. C. Maxwell]] introduced [[differentiable function|differentiable]] [[vector field]]s ''E'' and ''B'' to express [[Michael Faraday]]'s findings about an [[electric field]] ''E'' and a [[magnetic field]] ''B''. Thomas K. Simpson has described his rhetorical methods, first with a guided study,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Simpson (1997) ''Maxwell on the Electromagnetic Field: a guided study'', [[Rutgers University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8135-2362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a literary appreciation&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Simpson (2005) ''Figures of Thought, a literary appreciation of Maxwell’s Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Green Lion Press&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' (1873), and with a book attending to the mathematical rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Simpson (2010) ''Maxwell’s Mathematical Rhetoric: rethinking the Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Green Lion Press, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-36-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major themes in rhetoric of science include the investigation of the accomplishments and suasive abilities of individuals (ethos) who have left a mark in their respective sciences as well as an age old concern of rhetoric of science – public science policy. Science policy involves deliberative issues, and the first rhetorical study of science policy was made in 1953 by [[Richard M. Weaver]]. Among others, [[Helen Longino]]'s work on public policy implications of low-level radiation continues this tradition.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622}}

The reconstitution of rhetorical theory around the lines of invention ([[inventio]]), [[argumentation]] and stylistic adaptation is going on today (Simons 6). The key question today is whether training in rhetoric can in fact help scholars and investigators make intelligent choices between rival theories, methods or data collection, and incommensurate values (Simons 14).

==Developments and trends==

===Epistemic rhetoric===
Seeing science from the point of texts exhibiting [[epistemology]] based on prediction and control offers new comprehensive ways to see the function of rhetoric of science (Gross "The Origin" 91-92). Epistemic rhetoric of science, in a broader context, confronts issues pertaining to [[truth]], [[relativism]], and knowledge.

Rhetoric of science, as a branch of inquiry, does not look at scientific (natural science) texts as a transparent means of conveying knowledge, but rather it looks at these texts as exhibiting persuasive structures. Although the natural sciences and humanities differ in a fundamental way, the enterprise of science can be viewed hermeneutically as a stream of texts which exhibit an epistemology based on understanding (Gross "On the Shoulders 21). Its task then is the rhetorical reconstruction of the means by which scientists convince themselves and others that their knowledge claims and assertions are an integral part of privileged activity of the community of thinkers with which they are allied (Gross "The Origin" 91).

In an article titled "On Viewing Rhetoric as Epistemic" (1967), Robert L. Scott offers "that truth can arise only from cooperative critical inquiry" (Harris "Knowing" 164). Scott's probe of the issues of belief, knowledge and argumentation substantiates that rhetoric is epistemic. This [[train of thought]] goes back to Gorgias who noted that truth is a product of discourse, not a substance added to it (Harris "Knowing" 164).

Scientific discourse is built on accountability of empirical fact which is presented to a scientific community. Each form of communication is a type of genre that fosters human interaction and relations. An example is the emerging form of the experimental report ([[Charles Bazerman|Bazerman]] "Reporting" 171-176). The suite of [[genres]] to which the rhetoric of science comes to bear on health care and scientific communities is legion.

Aristotle could never accept the unavailability of certain knowledge, although most now believe the contrary (Gross "On Shoulders" 20). That is to say, Aristotle would have rejected the central concern of rhetoric of science: knowledge.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622}} Knowing itself generates the explanation of knowing, and this is the domain of the [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. The knowledge of knowledge compels an attitude of vigilance against the temptation of certainty ([[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]] 239-245).

The claim of the epistemic problematic of rhetoric of science concerns:
* truth - property of statements with respect to other statements
* knowledge - configuration of mutually supporting true statements
* arguments - are situational (first principle of rhetoric)
(Harris "Knowing" 180-181).

===Argument fields===
By the 1980s, [[Stephen Toulmin|Stephen Toulmin's]] work on argument fields published in his book titled ''[[The Uses of Argument]]'' (1958) came to prominence through rhetorical societies such as the Speech Communication Association which adopted a sociological view of science. Toulmin's main contribution is his notion of argument fields that saw a reinvention of the rhetorical concept [[rhetoric topos|topoi]] (topics).&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Toulmin discusses at length the pattern of an [[argument]] – data and warrants to support a claim – and how they tend to vary across argument fields (Toulmin 1417-1422). He delineated two concepts of argumentation, one which relied on universal (field-invariant) appeals and strategies, and one which was field dependent, particular to disciplines, movements, and the like. For Toulmin, audience is important because one speaks to a particular audience at a particular point in time, and thus an argument must be relevant to that audience. In this instance, Toulmin echoes [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], who in his preoccupation with suasive processes, makes clear the adaptive nature of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}

Toulmin's ideas pertaining to argument were a radical import to [[argumentation theory]] because, in part, he contributes a model, and because he contributes greatly to rhetoric and its subfield, rhetoric of science, by providing a model of analysis (data, warrants) to show that what is argued on a subject is in effect a structured ''arrangement'' of values that are purposive and lead to a certain line of thought.

Toulmin showed in ''Human Understanding'' that the arguments that would support claims as different as the Copernican revolution and the Ptolemaic revolution would not require mediation. On the strength of argument, men of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries converted to Copernican astronomy (Gross "The Rhetoric" 214).

===Incommensurability===
The rhetorical challenge today is to find discourse that crosses disciplines without sacrificing the specifics of each discipline. The aim is to render description of these disciplines intact – that is to say, the goal of finding language that would make various scientific fields "commensurable" (Baake 29). In contrast, incommensurability is a situation where two scientific programs are fundamentally at odds. Two important voices who applied incommensurability to historical and philosophical notions of science in the 1960s are [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Various strands grew out of this idea that bear on issues of communication and invention. These strands are explicated in Randy Allen Harris's four-part [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] that in turn foregrounds his viewpoint that "incommensurability is best understood not as a relation between systems, but as a matter of rhetorical invention and hermeneutics" (Harris "Incommensurability" 1).

[[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|Incommensurability]] of theory at times of radical theory change is at the heart of Thomas Samuel Kuhn's theory of [[paradigms]] ([[Bazerman]] 1). Kuhn's ''Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' offers a vision of scientific change that involves persuasion, and thus he brought rhetoric to the heart of scientific studies.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Kuhn's ''Structure'' provides important accounts related to the concept representation, and the key conceptual changes that occur during a [[scientific revolution]]. Kuhn sought to determine ways of representing [[concept]]s and taxonomies by frames.&lt;ref name=BXA&gt;Barker, Peter, Xiang Chen and Hanne Andersen (2003) "Kuhn on Concepts and Categorization" in ''Thomas Kuhn'', edited by Thomas Nickles, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224-230}} Kuhn's work attempts to show that incommensurable paradigms can be rationally compared by revealing the compatibility of attribute lists of say a species outlined in a pre-Darwinian and a post-Darwinian milieu accounted for in two incommensurable taxonomies, and that this compatibility is the platform for rational comparison between rival taxonomies.&lt;ref name=BXA/&gt;{{rp|230,1}} With a view to comparing normal science to revolutionary science, Kuhn illustrates his theory of paradigms and theory of concepts within the history of electricity, chemistry and other disciplines. He gives attention to the revolutionary changes that came about as a result of the work of [[Copernicus]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Einstein]], [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Roentgen]], and [[Lavoisier]].

Some scholars, like Thomas C. Walker, feel that Kuhn's theory on paradigms leads to knowledge that is "gained in small, incremental, and almost unremarkable installments." Walker states that while "normal science is narrow, rigid, esoteric, uncritical, and conservative, Kuhn considers it to be the most efficient way to ensure a cumulation of knowledge." According to Walker, while "ignorance and intolerance toward other theoretical frameworks are regrettable features of Kuhn's normal science...meaningful conversations can only occur within a single paradigm."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Walker, Thomas C. (2010) "The perils of paradigm mentalities: Revisiting Kuhn, Lakatos, and Popper", [[Perspectives on Politics]] 8.02: 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;	

Kuhn's work was influential for rhetoricians, sociologists, and historians (and, in a more muted way, philosophers) for the development of a rhetorical perspective. His view on perception, concept acquisition and language suggest, according to Paul Hoyningen-Huene's analysis of Kuhn's philosophy, a cognitive perspective.&lt;ref name=Nick/&gt;{{rp|183}}

===Ethos===
Scientists are not just persuaded by [[logos]] or argument. Innovative initiatives in science test scientific authority by invoking the authority of past results (initial section of a scientific paper) and the authority of procedure, which establish the scientist's credibility as an investigator (Gross ''Starring'' 26-27).

Examinations of the [[ethos]] of scientists (individually and collectively) spawned significant contributions in the field of rhetoric of science. Michael Halloran notes in "The Birth of Molecular Biology" (''Rhetoric Review'' 3, 1984) – an essay that is a rhetorical analysis of [[James D. Watson]] and Francis H. Crick's "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid" – that a large part of what constitutes a scientific paradigm is the ethos of its practitioners. This ethos is about an attitude and a way of attacking problems and propagating claims.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxxi}}

In "The Rhetorical Construction of Scientific Ethos," Lawrence Prelli provides a systematic analysis of ethos as a tool of scientific legitimation. Prelli's work examines the exchange of information in the court of public opinion. His work provides insight into the ways in which scientific argumentation is legitimized, and thus insight into public science policy. One of the domains of rhetoric is civic life. Rhetorical criticism of science offers much in the investigation of scientific matters that impinge directly upon public opinion and policy-making decisions.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxxiii}}

===Rhetoric and language-games===
Rhetoric can also be defined as ''the strategic use of language'': each scientist tries to make those statements that - given the statements made by their colleagues, and the ones the former expects they will do in the future (e.g., accepting or rejecting the claims made by the former) - maximise the chances of the former's attaining the goals he or she has. So, [[game theory]] can be applied to study the choice of the claims one scientist makes. Zamora Bonilla (2006) argues that, when rhetoric is understood this way, it can be discussed whether the way scientists interact - e.g., through certain scientific institutions like peer review - leads them to make their claims in an efficient or an inefficient way, i.e., whether the 'rhetorical games' are more analogous to '[[invisible hand]]' processes, or to '[[prisoner's dilemma]]' games. If the former is the case, then we can assert that scientific 'conversation' is organised in such a way that the strategic use of language by scientists leads them to reach cognitive progress, and if the opposite is the case, then this would be an argument to reform scientific institutions.

===Rhetorical figures in science===
Corresponding to distinct lines of reasoning, figures of speech are evident in scientific arguments. The same cognitive and verbal skills that are of service to one line of inquiry – political, economic or popular – are of service to science (Fahnestock 43). This implies that there is less of a division between science and the humanities than initially anticipated. Argumentatively useful figures of speech are found everywhere in scientific writing.

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' offers a means of reconciliation between Mendelian mutation and Darwinian [[natural selection]]. By remaining sensitive to the interests of naturalists and geneticists, Dobzhansky – through a subtle strategy of [[polysemy]] – allowed a peaceful solution to a battle between two scientific territories. His expressed aim was to review the genetic information bearing on the problem of organic diversity.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite book |last= Ceccarelli |first= Leah |title= Shaping Science with Rhetoric: The Cases of Dobzhansky, Schrödinger, and Wilson |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 0226099067 |oclc= 45276826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41, 53}} The building blocks of Dobzhansky's interdisciplinary influence that saw much development in two scientific camps were the result of the compositional choices he made. He uses, for instance, prolepsis to make arguments that introduced his research findings, and he provided a metaphoric map as a means to guide his audience.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;{{rp|57,8}} One illustration of metaphor is his use of the term "adaptive landscapes." Seen metaphorically, this term is a way of representing how theorists in two different fields can unite.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;{{rp|57}}

Another figure that is important as an aid to understanding and knowledge is [[antimetabole]] (refutation by reversal). [[Antithesis]] also works toward a similar end.

An example of antimetabole:
* Antimetabole often appears in writing or visuals where the line of inquiry and experiment has been characterized by mirror-image objects, or of complementarity, reversible or equilibrium processes. Louis Pasteur's revelation that many organic compounds come in left-and right-handed versions or isomers as articulated at an 1883 lecture illustrates the use of this figure. He argues in lecture that "life is the germ and the germ is life" because all life contains unsymmetrical/asymmetrical processes (Fahnestock 137-140).

===New Materialist Rhetoric of Science===
A more recent trend in rhetorical studies involves participation in the broader [[Speculative realism|new materialist]] movement in philosophy and [[Science, technology and society|science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herndl|first1=Carl|title=Rhetoric of Science as Non-Modern Practice|date=2000|publisher=Professing Rhetoric: Selected Papers from the 2000 Rhetoric Society of America Conference|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging area of inquiry investigates the role of rhetoric and discourse as an integral part of the [[Materiality (science)| Materialism]] of scientific practice. This approach considers how the methods of natural sciences came into being, and the particular role interaction among scientists and scientific institutions has to play. New materialist rhetoric of science of a feminist variety include those proponents see the progress of the natural sciences as having been purchased at a high cost, a cost that limits the scope and vision of science. Work in this area often draws on scholarship by [[Bruno Latour]], [[Steve Woolgar]], [[Annemarie Mol]], and other new materialist scholars from science and technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch and Rivers, Eds.|title=Thinking with Bruno Latour in Rhetoric and Composition|date=2015|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work in new materialist rhetoric of science tends to be very critical of a perceived over-reliance on language in more conservative variants of rhetoric of science and has significantly criticized long-standing areas of inquiry such as incommensurability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham &amp; Herndl|title=Multiple Ontologies in Pain Management: Towards a Postplural Rhetoric of Science|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=22|pages=103–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of rhetoric of science===

====Globalization of rhetoric====
Renewed interest today in rhetoric of science is its positioning as a [[hermeneutic]] meta-discourse rather than a substantive discourse practice.&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|25}} [[Exegesis]] and hermeneutics are the tools around which the idea of scientific production has been forged.

Criticism of rhetoric of science is mainly limited to discussions around the concept of hermeneutics, which can be seen as follows:
* Rhetorical hermeneutics is about a way of reading texts as rhetoric. Rhetoric is both a discipline and a perspective from which disciplines can be viewed. As a discipline, it has a hermeneutic task and generates knowledge; as a perspective, it has the task of generating new points of view (Gross ''Rhetorical'' 111). Whether rhetorical theory can function as a general hermeneutic, a key to all texts, including scientific texts, is still today a point of interest to rhetoricians. Although [[natural sciences]] and [[humanities]] differ in fundamental ways, science as enterprise can be viewed hermeneutically as a suite of texts exhibiting a study of knowledge (epistemology) based on understanding (Gross "On Shoulders" 21).

A recent critique about the rhetoric of science literature asks not if science is understood properly, but rather if rhetoric is understood properly. This dissension centres around the reading of scientific texts rhetorically; it is a quarrel about how rhetorical theory is seen as a global hermeneutic (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 1-13).

[[Dilip Gaonkar]] in "The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science" looks at how critics argue about rhetoric, and he unfolds the global ambitions of rhetorical theory as a general hermeneutic (a master key to all texts), with the rhetoric of science as a perfect site of analysis - a hard and fast case.&lt;ref name=Gaon&gt;[[Dilip Gaonkar]] (1997) "The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science." In ''Rhetorical Hermeneutics: Invention and Interpretation in the Age of Science''. Eds. Alan G. Gross and William M. Keith, [[State University of New York Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of this 'case', Gaonkar looks at rhetoric's essential character first in traditional sense (Aristotilean and Ciceronian). Then he looked at the practice of rhetoric and the model of persuasive speech from the point of agency (productive orientation) or who controls the speech (means of communication). The rhetorical tradition is one of practice, while the theory evinces practice and teaching (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 6-11). Gaonkar asserts that rhetoric seen as a tradition (Aristotilean and Ciceronia), and from the point of view of interpretation (not production or agency), rhetorical theory is "thin." He argues that rhetoric appears as a thinly veiled language of criticism in such a way that it is applicable to almost any discourse.&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|33, 69}}

Gaonkar believes that this type of globalization of rhetoric undermines rhetoric's self-representation as a situated practical art, and in so doing, it runs counter to a humanist tradition. It runs counter to the interpretative function of a critical metadiscourse. If there is no more substance, no anchor, no reference to which rhetoric is attached, rhetoric itself is the substance, or the supplement, and thus becomes substantial, giving rise to the question how well rhetoric functions as interpretative [[discourse]].&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|77}}

Dilip Gaonkar's provocations have successfully opened the way to a broad reaching discussion that led to the defense of rhetoric analyses of scientific discourse. Responses to Gaonkar's provocations are many, of which two examples follow.
* When Gaonkar asks if a theory grounded in practice can be translated into a theory of interpretation, Michael Leff in "The Idea of Rhetoric as Interpretative Practice: A Humanist's Response to Gaonkar" see his views as too extreme, treating as opposites two positions that are in dialectic tension (rhetoric as production and rhetoric as interpretation), and separating interpretation from practice in order to establish a causal, rather than accidental, relationship between rhetoric and the globalalization of rhetoric (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 11).
* [[John Angus Campbell]] in "Strategic Readings: Rhetoric, Intention, and Interpretation" also found in ''Rhetorical Hermeneutics'' is a verification of Leff's analysis (113). He argues, however, against Gaonkar's notion of invention and the mediation between producer or writer and the audience of a text(114). The differences between Campbell and Gaonkar is one of theory, and not whether agency figures in criticism (115).

====New Materialist Rhetoric of Science====
The new materialist approach to rhetoric of science has endorsed Goankar's criticisms of rhetoric of science more generally and seeks to overcome them through interdisciplinary engagement with science and technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=S. Scott|title=The Politics of Pain Medicine: A Rhetorical-Ontological Inquiry|date=2015|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new materialist approach, itself, has been subjected to significant criticism within the field, and identified as a radical variant. The question as to the adequacy of rhetoric in its encounter with scientific texts (natural sciences) is problematic on two fronts. The first concerns traditional rhetoric and its capacity as a tool to analyze scientific texts. Secondly, the answer to the question relies on an attack of the epistomological presuppositions of a classical rhetoric of science. For this reason, the radical critique is a call for the renewal of rhetorical theory.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|626,7}}

'''Richard Hofstadter''' (August 6, 1916 – October 24, 1970) was an American [[historian]] and [[intellectual|public intellectual]] of the mid-20th century. Hofstadter was the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History at [[Columbia University]]. Rejecting his earlier approach to history from the far left, in the 1950s he embraced [[consensus history]], becoming the "iconic historian of postwar liberal consensus," largely because of his emphasis on ideas and political culture rather than the day-to-day doings of politicians. His influence is ongoing, as modern critics profess admiration for the grace of his writing, and the depth of his insight.&lt;ref&gt;Geary (2007), pp. 430, 425&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important works are ''Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860–1915'' (1944); ''[[The American Political Tradition]]'' (1948); ''[[The Age of Reform]]'' (1955); ''[[Anti-intellectualism in American Life]]'' (1963), and the essays collected in ''[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]'' (1964).  He was twice awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]]: in 1956 for ''The Age of Reform'', an unsentimental analysis of the [[Populist Party (United States)|populism movement in the 1890s]] and the [[Progressive Era|progressive movement of the early 20th century]]; and in 1964 for the cultural history ''Anti-intellectualism in American Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Benét | title = Reader's Encyclopedia | edition = 4th | year = 1996 | page = 478}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Richard Hofstadter was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], in 1916 to a Jewish father, Emil A. Hofstadter, and a [[German Americans|German American]] Lutheran mother, Katherine (née Hill), who died when Richard was ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PBj5-zHEMvoC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Richard+Hofstadter+Emil,+Katherine | title = Books | publisher = Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Fosdick-Masten Park High School]] in Buffalo. Hofstadter then studied philosophy and history at the [[University at Buffalo]], from 1933, under the [[Political history|diplomatic historian]] [[Julius W. Pratt]].  Despite opposition from both families, he married Felice Swados in 1936 after he and Felice spent several summers at Hunter Colony, New York, run by [[Margaret Lefranc]], their close friend for years; they had one child, Dan.{{Sfn | Brown | 2006 | pp = 18–19}}  Hofstadter was raised as an Episcopalian but later identified more with his Jewish roots. Antisemitism may have cost him fellowships at Columbia and attractive professorships.{{Sfn | Brown | 2006 | pp = 12, 21, 38, 53}} The Buffalo Jewish Hall of Fame list him as one of the "Jewish Buffalonians who have made a lasting contribution to the world."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://jbuff.com/hall.htm Buffalo Jewish Hall of Fame  ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Hofstadter entered the doctoral program in history at [[Columbia University]] where his advisor [[Merle Curti]] was demonstrating how to synthesize intellectual, social, and political history based upon secondary sources rather than primary-source archival research.{{Sfn | Brown | 2006 | pp = 22, 29}}  In 1942, Hofstadter earned his PhD and in 1944 published his dissertation ''Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860–1915'', a commercially successful (200,000 copies) critique of late nineteenth-century American capitalism and its ruthless "dog-eat-dog" economic competition and [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinian]] self-justification. Conservative critics, such as Irwin G. Wylie and Robert C. Bannister, disagree with his interpretation.{{Sfn | Brown | 2006 | pp = 30–37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Irwin G | last = Wylie | title = Social Darwinism and the Businessmen | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 103 | year = 1959 | pages = 629–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert C | last = Bannister | title = Social Darwinism: Science and Myth in Anglo–American Social Thought | year = 1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sharpest criticism of ''Social Darwinism in American Thought, 1860–1915'' focused on Hofstadter's weakness as a research scholar: he did little or no research into manuscripts, newspapers, archival, or unpublished sources. Instead, he primarily relied upon secondary sources augmented by his lively style and wide-ranging interdisciplinary readings, thus producing very well-written arguments based upon scattered evidence he found by reading other historians.{{Sfn | Brown | 2006 | pp = 38, 113}}

==Consensus historian==
From 1942 to 1946 Hofstadter taught history at the [[University of Maryland]], where he became fast friends with radical sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] and read extensively in the fields of sociology and psychology, absorbing ideas of [[Max Weber]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the [[Frankfurt School]].  His later books frequently refer to behavioral concepts such as "status anxiety."{{Sfn | Baker | 1985 | p = 184}}{{Sfn | Brown | 2006 | pp = 90–94}}

In 1946 Hofstadter joined the [[Columbia University]] faculty and in 1959 succeeded [[Allan Nevins]] as the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History, where he played a major role in directing Ph.D. dissertations in the field.  After 1945 Hofstadter philosophically broke with [[Charles A. Beard]] and moved to the right, becoming leader of the "consensus historians," a term that Hofstadter disliked, but it was widely applied to his rejection of the Beardian idea that there was a fundamental conflict running throughout American history that pitted economic classes against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2006), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as his ''American Political Tradition'' (1948) Hofstadter rejected black-and-white polarization between pro-business and anti-business politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Jumonville, ''Henry Steele Commager : Midcentury Liberalism and the History of the Present'' (1999) pp 232-39&lt;/ref&gt;  Making explicit reference to [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]], [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryan]], [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]], and [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]], Hofstadter made a compelling statement of the consensus model of the American political tradition:
:The fierceness of the political struggles has often been misleading: for the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise.  However much at odds on specific issues, the major political traditions have shared a belief in the rights of property, the philosophy of economic individualism, the value of competition; they have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=The American Political Tradition: And the Men Who Made it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6k_G670uhZsC&amp;pg=PR35|year=1948|publisher=Knopf|pages=xxxvi–xxxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consensus historian, Hofstadter rejected Beard's interpretation of history as a succession of socio-economic group conflicts. He thought that all historical periods could be understood as an implicit consensus, shared by antagonists, explaining that the generation of Beard and [[Vernon Louis Parrington]] had:
{{Quote |...put such an excessive emphasis on conflict, that an antidote was needed...  It seems to me to be clear that a political society cannot hang together, at all, unless there is some kind of consensus running through it, and yet that no society has such a total consensus as to be devoid of significant conflict. It is all a matter of proportion and emphasis, which is terribly important in history. Of course, obviously, we have had one total failure of consensus, which led to the Civil War.  One could use that as the extreme case in which consensus breaks down.&lt;ref&gt;In Pole (2000), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1948 he published ''[[The American Political Tradition|The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It]]'', incisive interpretive studies of 12 major American political leaders from the 18th-20th centuries.  Besides critical success, the book sold nearly a million copies at university campuses, where it was used as a history textbook; critics found it "skeptical, fresh, [[historical revisionism|revisionary]], occasionally ironical, without being harsh or merely destructive."&lt;ref&gt;Pole (2000), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Each chapter title illustrated a paradox: [[Thomas Jefferson]] is "The Aristocrat as Democrat"; [[John C. Calhoun]] is the "Marx of the Master Class"; and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] is "The Patrician as Opportunist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Bruce | last = Kuklick | journal = Transactions | publisher = The Charles S. Peirce Society | volume = 42 | number = 4 | year = 2006 | pages = 574–77 | doi=10.1353/csp.2007.0005 | title=Richard Hofstadter: An Intellectual Biography (review)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hofstadter's writing style was so powerful and engrossing that professors kept assigning the book long after its main points had been revised or rejected by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pole (2000), pp. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later works==
As a historian, Hofstadter's ground-breaking work came in using social psychology concepts to explain political history.{{Efn | He was influenced by his friend sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2006), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}} He explored [[subconscious]] motives such as [[social status]] anxiety, [[anti-intellectualism]], irrational fear, and paranoia—as they propel political discourse and action in politics.

===The rural ethos===
''[[The Age of Reform]]'' (1955) analyzes the [[yeoman]] ideal in America's sentimental attachment to [[agrarianism]] and the moral superiority of the farm over the city.  Hofstadter—himself very much a big-city person—noted the agrarian ethos was "a kind of homage that Americans have paid to the fancied innocence of their origins, however, to call it a myth does not imply falsity, because it effectively embodies the rural values of the American people, profoundly influencing their perception of the correct values, hence their political behavior."  In this matter, the stress is upon the importance of Jefferson's writings, and of his followers, in the development of agrarianism in the US, as establishing the agrarian myth, and its importance, in American life and politics—despite the rural and urban industrialization that rendered the myth moot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Hofstadter | title = The Age of Reform | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =June 2013}}

{{Citation | title = [[Anti-intellectualism in American Life]] | year = 1963}} and {{Citation | title = [[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]] | year = 1965}} describe the [[provincialism]] in American society, warning it contains much [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] fear of the [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city, presented as wicked by the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]] of the 1890s. They trace the direct political and ideological lineage between the Populists and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[McCarthyism]], the political paranoia manifest in his contemporary time. His dissertation director [[Merle Curti]] noted about Hofstadter that "His position is as biased, by his urban background... as the work of older historians was biased by their rural background and traditional agrarian sympathies.”&lt;ref&gt;In Brown (2006), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrational fear===
{{Citation | title = The Idea of a Party System | year = 1969}} describes the origins of the [[First Party System]] as reflecting fears that the [other] political party threatened to destroy the republic.  {{Citation | title = The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington | year = 1968}} systematically analyzes and criticizes the intellectual foundations and historical validity of Charles Beard's [[historiography]]; the book "signalled a growing support for neoconservatism" by Hofstadter. While not publishing his harshest thoughts, Hofstadter said privately that Turner no longer was a useful guide to history, because he was too obsessed with the frontier and his ideas too often had "a pound of false-hood for every few ounces of truth."{{Efn | The private letter was written to [[Merle Curti]], probably in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2003), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Howe and Finn argue that rhetorically, Hofstadter's cultural interpretation drew upon concepts drawn from literary criticism, anthropology, and social psychology.  He used them over and over: first:  "irony," "paradox," "anomaly," "curiously."  Second: "myth," "tradition," "legend," "folklore."  Third: "projection," "unconsciously," "identity," "anxiety," and "paranoid."  He artfully employed their explicit scholarly meanings and their informal prejudicial connotations. His goal, they argue, was "destroying certain cherished American traditions and myths derived from his conviction that they provided no trustworthy guide for action in the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Howe | last2 = Finn | title = Richard Hofstadter: The Ironies of an American Historian | pages = 3–5, 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Hofstadter argued, "The application of depth psychology to politics, chancy though it is, has at least made us acutely aware that politics can be a projective arena for feelings and impulses that are only marginally related to the manifest issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=Richard | last1 = Hofstadter| first2= Sean | last2 = Wilentz | title = The Paranoid Style in American Politics| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fbRN-7uyqAwC&amp;pg=PR33 | year = 2008 |publisher=Random House Digital |page= xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. Vann Woodward]] stated that Hofstadter seemed "to have a solid understanding, if not a private affection" for "the
odd, the warped, the 'zanies' and the crazies of American life - left, right and middle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted
in John Wakeman, 
''World Authors 1950-1970 : A Companion Volume to Twentieth Century Authors''. New York : H.W. Wilson Company, 1975. {{ISBN|0824204190}}. (pp. 658-60).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Hofstadter, influenced by his wife, was a member of the [[Young Communist League]] in college, and in April 1938 he joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the USA]]; he quit in 1939.{{Sfn | Baker | 1985 | pp = 89–90}}  Hofstadter had been reluctant to join, knowing the orthodoxy it imposed on intellectuals, and disillusioned by the spectacle of the [[Moscow Show Trials]], but wrote: "I join without enthusiasm but with a sense of obligation...&amp;nbsp;my fundamental reason for joining is that I don't like capitalism and want to get rid of it."&lt;ref name="Foner-38"&gt;{{cite book | first = Eric | last = Foner | authorlink = Eric Foner | title = Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H3I-Z8KW5REC&amp;pg=PT38 | page = 38 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained anti-capitalist, writing, "I hate capitalism and everything that goes with it," but was similarly disillusioned with Stalinism, finding the Soviet Union "essentially undemocratic" and the Communist Party rigid and doctrinaire. In the 1940s Hofstadter abandoned political causes, feeling that intellectuals were no more likely to "find a comfortable home" under socialism than they were under capitalism.&lt;ref name="Foner-38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geary (2007) p 429&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Susan Baker writes that Hofstadter, "was profoundly influenced by the political Left of the 1930s. ...  The philosophical impact of Marxism was so intense and direct during Hofstadter's formative years that it formed a major part of his identity crisis. ...  The impact of these years created his orientation to the American past, accompanied as it was by marriage, establishment of life-style, and choice of profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Susan Stout | last = Baker | title = Out of the Engagement: Richard Hofstadter, the Genesis of a Historian | type = PhD dissertation | publisher = Case Western reserve U | year = 1982 | page = xiv | oclc = 10169852}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geary (2007) concludes that, "To Hofstadter, radicalism always offered more of a critical intellectual stance than a commitment to political activism. Although Hofstadter quickly became disillusioned with the Communist Party, he retained an independent left-wing standpoint well into the 1940s. Both his first book, ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' (1944), and ''The American Political Tradition'' (1948) were written from a radical point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Geary (2007) p 418&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, Hofstadter cited Charles A. Beard as "the exciting influence on me."&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Hofstadter specifically responded to Beard's social-conflict model of U.S. history, which emphasized the struggle among competing economic groups (primarily farmers, Southern slavers, Northern industrialists, and workers) and discounted abstract political rhetoric which rarely translated into action. Beard encouraged historians to search for the hidden self-interest and financial goals of the economic belligerents.

By the 1950s and 1960s Hofstadter had a strong reputation in liberal circles. [[Lawrence Cremin]] noted that "Hofstadter's central purpose in writing history ... was to reformulate American liberalism so that it might stand more honestly and effectively against attacks from both left and right in a world which had accepted the essential insights of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Marx]], and [[Freud]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Lawrence Arthur Cremin]]|title=Richard Hofstadter (1916-1970): a biographical memoir|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Hofstadter's+central+purpose+in+writing+history%22&amp;num=10#q=%22honestly+and+effectively+against+attacks%22+darwin&amp;tbm=bks|year=1972|publisher=[[National Academy of Education]]|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Alfred Kazin]] identified his use of parody:
:He was a derisive critic and parodist of every American Utopia and its wild prophets, a natural oppositionist to fashion and its satirist, a creature suspended between gloom and fun, between disdain for the expected and mad parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Kazin|title=New York Jew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU3XAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|year=2013|publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative commentator [[George Will]] in 2008 called Hofstadter "the iconic public intellectual of liberal condescension," who "dismissed conservatives as victims of character flaws and psychological disorders—a 'paranoid style' of politics rooted in 'status anxiety.' etc. Conservatism rose on a tide of votes cast by people irritated by the liberalism of condescension."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/04/obamas_condescension.html Candidate on a High Horse], [[George Will]], ''The Washington Post'', April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Angered by the radical politics of the 1960s, and especially by the [[Columbia University protests of 1968|student occupation and temporary closure of Columbia University in 1968]], Hofstadter began to criticize student activist methods. His friend [[David Herbert Donald]] said, "as a liberal who criticized the liberal tradition from within, he was appalled by the growing radical, even revolutionary, sentiment that he sensed among his colleagues and his students. He could never share their simplistic, moralistic approach."&lt;ref&gt;In Brown (2006), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;   Brick says he regarded them as "simple-minded, moralistic, ruthless, and destructive."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Brick, "The End of Ideology Thesis." in ''The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies'' (2013) p 103&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he was "extremely critical of student tactics, believing that they were based on irrational romantic ideas, rather than sensible plans for achievable change, that they undermined the unique status of the university, as an institutional bastion of free thought, and that they were bound to provoke a political reaction from the right."&lt;ref&gt;Geary (2007), p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coates argues that his career saw a steady move from left to right, and that his 1968 Columbia Commencement Address, "represented the completion of his conversion to conservatism."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Coates, "The Conservatism of Richard Hofstadter," ''History in the Making'' (2013) 2#1 pp 45-51 quote at p 50 [http://www.historyitm.org/index.php/hitm/article/view/125/35 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite strongly disagreeing with their political methods, he invited his radical students to discuss goals and strategies with him.  He even employed one, [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]], to collaborate with him on ''American Violence: A Documentary History'' (1970); about the book, Hofstadter student [[Eric Foner]] said that it "utterly contradicted the consensus vision of a nation placidly evolving without serious disagreements."l&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Foner | first = Eric | title = Introduction | page =xxv}}, in {{Harvnb | Hofstadter | 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstadter planned to write a three-volume history of American society, but at his death he had only completed the first volume, ''America at 1750: A Social Portrait'' (1971).

==Death==
He died from [[leukemia]] on October 24, 1970, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]] at age 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Alden Whitman]] |coauthors= |title=Richard Hofstadter, Pulitzer Historian, 54, Dies.

He lived at 1125 Park Avenue. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 25, 1970 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Hofstadter showed more interest in his research than in his teaching.  In undergraduate classes, he read aloud each day the draft of his next book.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2006), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior professor at a leading graduate university, Hofstadter directed more than one hundred finished doctoral dissertations but gave his graduate students only cursory attention; Hofstadter believed that this academic latitude enabled them to find their own models of history. Among them were [[Herbert Gutman]], [[Eric Foner]], [[Lawrence W. Levine]], [[Linda Kerber]], and [[Paula S. Fass]]. Some, such as [[Eric McKitrick]] and [[Stanley Elkins]], were more conservative than he; hence, Hofstadter had few disciples and founded no school of history writing.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2006), pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazin (1999), p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hofstadter's death, Columbia dedicated a locked bookcase of his works in [[Butler Library]] to him, but his widow Beatrice—who after his death married the journalist [[Theodore White]]—asked that it be removed when the physical conditions of the library deteriorated.

[[Image:ROGER C GREEN 002.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Roger Green in 2003]]

'''Roger Curtis Green''', [[ONZM]] (15 March 1932 – 4 October 2009) was an American born, New Zealand-based [[archaeologist]], [[Professor Emeritus]] at [[The University of Auckland]], and member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and [[Royal Society of New Zealand]]. He was awarded the [[Hector Memorial Medal|Hector]] and [[Marsden Medal]]s and was an Officer of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] for his contributions to the study of Pacific culture history.

==Early life and education==

Roger Green was born in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], New Jersey, and expressed an interest in archaeology at an early age.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Davidson, Janet, 1999. Roger Curtis Green. In T. Murray, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Archaeology: The Great Archaeologists''. Santa Barbara:ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|835}} At sixteen, his family relocated to [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], where his interest in [[North america#Prehistory|North American prehistory]] flourished.

Following a field season on [[Pueblo]] sites in the region under the tutelage of [[Frank Hibben]], Green attended the [[University of New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|836}} While there, he undertook coursework in geology and [[linguistics]] in addition to [[anthropology]], while at the same time being engaged in [[ROTC|officers training]]. He was particularly influenced by the work of linguist [[Edward Sapir]] during this period,&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|836}} which likely contributed to his subsequent works in Polynesian linguistics. During this period, Green continued to work on local field projects, resulting in his first published works.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Green, Roger C., 1956. A pit house of the Gallina phase. American Antiquity 22:10–16&lt;/ref&gt;

His talents were recognised early on by his professors at New Mexico, and before completing his [[Master's degree|Masters]] study there, Green was encouraged to enroll in a doctorate program at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|837}} While there he studied closely under [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Cora du Bois]]. It was also there that he was first introduced to Pacific prehistory by Douglas Oliver, who helped arrange a Fulbright fellowship that took him to New Zealand and on to conduct research in [[French Polynesia]] on the islands of [[Moorea]] and [[Mangareva]]. His PhD dissertation focused on the prehistoric sequence of the [[Auckland]] region.

==Academic career==

Following his doctoral work in the Pacific, Green replaced [[Jack Golson]] as a senior lecturer of Anthropology at [[The University of Auckland]] from 1961 to 1966.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;{{rp|839}} In 1966, he was promoted to [[associate professor]], and worked for the next three years at the [[University of Hawaii at Mānoa]]. From 1970 to 1973, he worked on an extensive research project with [[Douglas Yen]] in the [[Solomon Islands]] funded by a [[Captain James Cook Fellowship]], after which he returned to [[Auckland]] for the remainder of his teaching career. He retired from teaching in 1992, at which time he was made [[Professor Emeritus]].

In addition to teaching at Auckland and Hawaii, Green periodically held active teaching and research positions at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, the [[Bernice P. Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu]], and Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi in [[Whakatane]], New Zealand. He also oversaw the funding of numerous research projects through the Green Foundation for Polynesian Research.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Allen, M.S. 2006. Periodicity, duration, and function of occupation at Tauroa Point, Northland, New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 27:19–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his teaching career, Green taught a number of students who would later make significant contributions to New Zealand and Pacific archaeology, including [[Janet Davidson]], [[Les Groube]], [[Andrew Pawley]], [[Lisa Matisoo-Smith]].

==Contributions==

Green's earliest work was focused primarily on the [[Gallina|Largo-Gallina]] phase of the Pueblo Native Americans. He conducted several excavations at various sites in New Mexico as part of academic and salvage projects.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1956. Excavations near Mayhill, New Mexico. "Highway Salvage Archaeology" 2:10–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1956. A pit house of the Gallina phase. ''American Antiquity'' 22:10–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vargas-Cassanova (ed.), "Easter Island and East Polynesian Prehistory". Santiago: Instituto de Estudios Isla de Pascua&lt;/ref&gt; He worked extensively on the general prehistory of the [[History of the Pacific Islands|Pacific]], contributing to a myriad of topics including:

* '''Polynesian origins''' &lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1967. The immediate origins of the Polynesians. In ''Polynesian Culture History: Essays in Honor of Kenneth P. Emory'', edited by G. H. Highland et al. Bernice P. Bishop Museum Special Publication 56. Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Green helped to develop a [[phylogeny|phylogenetic model]] of the Pacific using a combination of linguistic, ethnological, biological, and archaeological analysis;&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Patrick V. and R. C. Green, 1987. History, phylogeny, and evolution in Polynesia. Current Anthropology 28: 431–443, 452–456.&lt;/ref&gt; this work was complemented by ethnohistorical research of the ancestral Polynesian homeland, Hawaiki.&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Patrick V. and R. C. Green, 2001. Hawaiiki, Ancestral Polynesia, An Essay in Historical Anthropology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Evolution of [[Polynesian languages]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1966. Linguistic subgrouping with Polynesia: the implications for prehistoric settlement. ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'' 80:355–370.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, Green worked to classify Polynesian languages and identify common terms.
* '''The [[Lapita]] cultural complex'''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Green, Roger C., 1973. Lapita pottery and the origins of Polynesian culture. ''Australian Natural History'' 17:332-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1979. Lapita. In ''The Prehistory of Polynesia'', edited by J.D. Hennings. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Green was among the first to identify Lapita pottery and material culture with the Austronesian-speaking ancestors of the Polynesians. His excavations in the [[Reef Islands|Reef]]&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1993. The Lapita site at Nenumbo, in the Solomon Islands. In G. Burenhult (ed.), ''People of the Stone Age: Hunter Gatherers and Eaerly Farmers''. &lt;nowiki&gt;[The Illustrated Historyof Humankind, Vol. 2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, pp. 150, San Francisco: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Santa Cruz Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;Green, Rocger C., 1976. In R.C. Green and M.M. Cresswell (eds), ''Southeast Solomon Islands Cultural History: A Preliminary Survey''. Wellington: Bulletin of the Royal Society of New Zealand 11:245-65)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Watom Island]] in Papua New Guinea&lt;ref&gt;Green, R.C. and D. Anson, 1987. The Lapita site of Watom: New evidence from excavations in 1985. ''Man and Culture in Oceania'', Special Issue 3:121-31&lt;/ref&gt; furnished significant data for this interpretation.
* '''Settlement patterns in Oceania''' &lt;ref&gt;e.g. Green, Roger C., 1984. Settlement pattern studies in Oceania: an introduction to a symposium. "New Zealand Journal of Archaeology" 6:59–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Green pioneered the settlement pattern approach in the Pacific, which examined the archaeological landscape holistically rather than focus on sites with rich deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, Patrick V, 2004. ''On the Roads of the Winds''. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; This was used to good effect by Green on Moorea,&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1996. Settlement patterns and complex society in the Windward Society Islands: Retrospective commentary on the research in 'Opunohu Valley, Mo'orea. In Julien, M. Orliac and C. Orliac (eds), ''Memoire de Pierre, Memoire d'Homme, Tradition et Archeologie en Oceanie, Ouvrage Collectif en Hommage a J. Garanger'', pp. 209–227. Paris: Publication de la Sorbonne.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;Green, Roger C., 1990. The Study of open settlements in New Zealand prehistory. In D.G. Sutton (ed.), ''The Archaeology of the Kainga: A Study of Precontact Maori Undefended Settlements at Pouerua, Northland, New Zealand'', pp. 23–32. Auckland: Auckland University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Samoa,&lt;ref name="Green, R.C. 2002. pp. 125"&gt;Green, R.C., 2002. A retrospective view of settlement pattern studies in Samoa. In T. N. Ladefoged and M. W. Graves (eds), "Pacific Landscapes: Archaeological Approaches". Los Osos, CA: Easter Island Foundation, pp. 125–52.&lt;/ref&gt; and by others elsewhere.
* '''Radiocarbon and stratigraphic sequences''' &lt;ref&gt;e.g. Jones, Martin, F. Petchey, R. C. Green, P. Sheppard, and M. Phelan, 2007. The marine delta-R for Nenumbo: a case study for calculating reservoir offsets from paired sample data. "Radiocarbon" 49(1):95–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Green worked closely with a number of archaeologists to develop the sequences for a number of island groups, and emphasised the importance of using archaeological context in addition to chronometric data.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R.C. and S. H. Bickler, 2009. 'Anakena reinterpreted using a geo-archaeological, chronological, and landscape approach. Presented to the University of Auckland Department of Anthropology, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Long-distance voyaging and exchange''' Green's work with obsidian provenance and Lapita sites helped to develop ideas about prehistoric voyaging and exchange between island groups.

Among his methodological contributions, Green was well known for his work on obsidian dating and provenance, an invaluable tool in Pacific archaeology. Additionally, he made significant contributions to settlement pattern archaeology, particularly with his work in Moorea and Samoa.&lt;ref name="Green, R.C. 2002. pp. 125"/&gt;

The Green Foundation, established in 1984 by Green and his wife, Valerie, was an initiative which was started with diverted earnings from fee paying work Green was involved in. The Foundation supports multidisciplinary research in New Zealand and the Pacific.

==History==
[[Image:Kuching, Sarawak; the museum building. Photograph. Wellcome V0037397.jpg|thumb|left|The museum in 1896, prior to its extension in 1911.]]
[[Image:The Sarawak museum building in 1911.jpg|thumb|right|The museum after its extension in 1911.]]
Since the visit of Alfred Wallace, the Rajah of Sarawak was interested in the natural history of Sarawak and has been asking his officers to collect specimens throughout the state since 1878 so that he can build a museum on a future date. As the collections began to increase, the specimens were put inside a clock tower of a government office. Then, the specimens were moved to a room above an old vegetable market when H.B Low's collections arrived from the [[Rajang River]].  The room above the old vegetable market acted as a temporary museum and was open to the public. Finally, the proper Sarawak museum was built in 1889 and opened on 4 August 1891. The museum extended a new wing in 1911. However, the brick work steps outside the old wing was demolished in 1912. The building was built to permanently house and display local indigenous arts and crafts, and collections of local animals.&lt;ref name="Kuching pics 1841-1946"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ah Chon|first1=Ho|title=Kuching in pictures (1841-1946)|date=|publisher=Sarawak state library (Pustaka Negeri Sarawak)|location=Kuching|pages=42–43|year=1948|url=http://library.perdana.org.my/Digital_Content/PNS/Kuching%20in%20Pictures%201841-1946%20%5BHo%20Ah%20Chon%5D.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202044309/http://library.perdana.org.my/Digital_Content/PNS/Kuching%20in%20Pictures%201841-1946%20%5BHo%20Ah%20Chon%5D.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2018|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Japanese Occupation]], the museum was directed by a [[Japan]]ese officer, who was sympathetic to its goals. He protected it and the museum suffered very little damage or looting.&lt;ref name="Kuching pics 1841-1946"/&gt;

The historic building has been renovated. It is used to exhibit and interpret collections on the natural history of Sarawak. [[Shell Oil]] sponsored an exhibit on the [[petroleum]] industry, which has been important to Borneo. In addition, it displays [[archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and reconstructions of examples of the traditional life of the indigenous peoples, and of their arts and crafts. It has the most comprehensive archaeological, natural history, and ethnographic collections on Borneo.

==Architecture==
The building has undergone several renovations and alterations since its construction. It is rectangular, 44’ × 160’ with walls and pillars of bricks, and roof of [[belian]] and [[concrete]]. The museum building has european-style architecture with its edifice in Queen Anne style. The galleries were lighted up by dormer windows.&lt;ref name="Kuching pics 1841-1946"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patrica|first1=Hului|title=Tracing the designs behind the Sarawak Museum|url=http://seeds.theborneopost.com/2015/08/07/tracing-the-designs-behind-the-sarawak-museum/|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=7 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809055917/http://seeds.theborneopost.com/2015/08/07/tracing-the-designs-behind-the-sarawak-museum/|archivedate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The galleries are lighted by dormer windows on the roof, making wall space available for exhibit displays and collections.

==Layout==
[[Image:Longhouse gallery of Sarawak museum.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The longhouse gallery inside the museum.]]
The ground floor of the museum holds the natural history collection and specimens of Sarawak fauna — reptiles, mammals, birds, etc., all expertly prepared and mounted for display. The west wing of the museum houses the Shell exhibition on the [[petroleum]] industries of Sarawak.

The first floor has exhibits of ethnographic artifacts of the indigenous peoples, such as models of the various types of longhouses, musical instruments, various kinds of fish and animal traps, handicrafts, models of boats and others.

==Activities==
The museum has been proclaimed guardian of the national patrimony, with the responsibility to search for, acquire and protect antiquities and historical monuments. The museum director is also responsible for protecting marine turtles and assisting the chief game warden in the conservation of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/25/travel/preserving-borneo-s-traditions.html|title=Preserving Borneo's Traditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum journal{{anchor|Journal}}==
The ''Sarawak Museum Journal'' is published by the museum staff. It was first published in 1911, with [[John Coney Moulton|John Moulton]] the inaugural editor, making it one of the oldest [[scientific journal]]s of the [[South-East Asia]]n region.  Topics covered include the [[history]], [[natural history]] and [[ethnology]] of the island of [[Borneo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6146">'''Sidney Bradshaw Fay''' (13 April 1876 in [[Washington, D.C.]] – 29 August 1967 in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]) was an American [[historian]], whose examination of the causes of [[World War I]], ''The Origins of the World War '' (1928; revised edition 1930) remains a classic study. In this book, which won him the 1928 [[George Louis Beer Prize]] of the [[American Historical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historians.org/awards-and-grants/past-recipients/george-louis-beer-prize-recipients |title=George Louis Beer Prize Recipients |publisher=[[American Historical Association]] |author= |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fay claimed that Germany was too readily blamed for the war and that a great deal of the responsibility instead rested with the Allies, especially Russia and Serbia. His stance is supported by several modern scholars, such as [[Christopher Clark]], but it remains controversial.

Fay left [[Harvard University]] (Ph.D. 1900)&lt;ref&gt;His thesis research appeared as ''The Hohenzollern household and administration in the sixteenth century''&lt;/ref&gt; to study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and the [[University of Berlin]]. He taught at [[Dartmouth College]] (1902–14) and [[Smith College]] (1914–29) and, after the publication of his major book, at both Harvard and [[Yale University]].

Fay's conclusion was that all the European powers shared in the blame, but he blamed mostly the system of secret alliances that divided Europe after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] into two mutually suspicious camps of group solidarity: [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] against [[Triple Entente]] (Fay's student [[Allan B. Calhamer]], would later develop and publish the game [[Diplomacy (game)|''Diplomacy'']], based on this thesis). He considered [[Austro-Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Russia]] to be primarily responsible for the immediate cause of war's outbreak. Other forces besides [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]] were at work, as the economics of [[imperialism]] and the [[news media|newspaper press]] played roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johndclare.net/causes_WWI2_Fay.htm Excerpt from the Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Fay also wrote ''The Rise of Brandenburg-Prussia to 1786'' (1937).

He married (17 August 1904) Sarah Eliza Proctor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.geocities.com/jimmannan/d0003/g0000016.html Genealogical notice]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Stone Age Archaeology ==

=== [[Lomekwi]]3 Stone Tools ===
In 2011, [[Sonia Harmand|Harmand]] discovered the [[Lomekwi]] 3 stone tools in the [[Turkana Basin]] of [[Kenya]] near the town of Lomewki. This discovery was made while Harmand was leading the [[West Turkana Archaeological Project]] team along with Jason Lewis. They were both working with [[Stony Brook University]]'s [[Turkana Basin Institute]] at the time &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.turkanabasin.org/2015/05/oldest-stone-artifacts-found-in-kenya/|title=Oldest Stone Artifacts Found in Kenya's Turkana Basin|work=Turkana Basin Institute|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

At the [[Lomekwi]] 3 site, between 2011 and 2012, there were 149 stone artifacts recovered in total &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Jason E.|last2=Harmand|first2=Sonia|date=2016-07-05|title=An earlier origin for stone tool making: implications for cognitive evolution and the transition to Homo|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920290/|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=371|issue=1698|doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0233|issn=0962-8436|pmc=4920290|pmid=27298464}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These artifacts were found at the Lomekwi 3 site which sits above the Toroto Tuff, dated at about 3.32 Ma &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/35068500/figures/4|title=Figure 4: Stratigraphic sections and placement of hominin specimens at sites in upper part of the Lomekwi drainage, west of Lake Turkana, northern Kenya.|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The 149 artifacts range from small broken [[Lithic flake|flakes]] weighing less than 1kg to anvils and passive elements weighing about 12 kg &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harmand|first=Sonia|last2=Lewis|first2=Jason E.|last3=Feibel|first3=Craig S.|last4=Lepre|first4=Christopher J.|last5=Prat|first5=Sandrine|last6=Lenoble|first6=Arnaud|last7=Boës|first7=Xavier|last8=Quinn|first8=Rhonda L.|last9=Brenet|first9=Michel|date=2015-05-20|title=3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14464#t1|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=521|issue=7552|pages=310–315|doi=10.1038/nature14464|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. All of these tools are evidence of [[Knapping|knapped stone tools]]. Stone tool [[knapping]] was previously associated with the genus ''[[Homo]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The discovery of stone tools from the [[Olduvai Gorge|Oldevai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] dating to about 2.6 Ma brought forth a theory of non-''[[homo]]'' [[Hominini|hominins]] usage of stone tools since there is only fossil evidence of ''[[homo]]'' from 2.4-2.3 Ma &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The tools found at [[Lomekwi]]3 are dated to ≈3.3 Ma which pushes back the evidence of stone tool use by nearly 700,000 years, and further expands the overall [[Archaeology|archaeological]] record &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Furthermore, these discoveries support the theory of usage of stone tools by non-''homo'' hominids. [[Sonia Harmand|Harmand]] and other [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] suspect ''[[Australopithecine|Australophithecines]]'' including: ''[[Australopithecus africanus|A. Africanus]]'', ''[[Australopithecus sediba|A. Sediba]]'', ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. Garhi]]'', ''[[Paranthropus aethiopicus|A. Aethiopicus]]'', and ''[[Paranthropus robustus|A. Robustus]]'' to be possible non-''homo'' stone tool [[Knapping|knappers]]. The Lomekwi 3 site is still currently under excavation and the [[West Turkana Archaeological Project]] team continues fieldwork in the [[Turkana Basin]] every summer.


=== [[Acheulean]]Tools ===
[[Sonia Harmand|Harmand]] additionally worked along the northwest shore of [[Lake Turkana]] in [[Kenya]] in 2011, recovering and studying [[acheulean]] tools. The stone tools found at the Kokiselei 4 site are dated to about 1.76 Ma which pushes the evidence for [[acheulean]] tool use back an extra ≈300,000 years &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepre|first=Christopher J.|last2=Roche|first2=Hélène|last3=Kent|first3=Dennis V.|last4=Harmand|first4=Sonia|last5=Quinn|first5=Rhonda L.|last6=Brugal|first6=Jean-Philippe|last7=Texier|first7=Pierre-Jean|last8=Lenoble|first8=Arnaud|last9=Feibel|first9=Craig S.|date=September 2011|title=An earlier origin for the Acheulian|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10372|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=477|issue=7362|pages=82–85|doi=10.1038/nature10372|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Acheulean]] tools are thought to be connected to ''[[Homo erectus|Homo Erectus]]'' because there were [[Homo erectus|H. erectus]] fossils found in the same area which are dated at a similar age &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

== Work at Stony Brook University ==
Sonia Harmand is currently an Associate Professor at New York's [[Stony Brook University]] teaching in the Anthropology Department. Along with professorial work, Harmand is an associate research scientist at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS), and the head of the West Turkana Archeological Project (WTAP) as of 2012. Harmand's research utilizes the [[chaîne opératoire]] method to aid in her analysis of stone tools, which places emphasis on the interactions between tool-makers and their environment. The central focus of her research at Stony Brook is on the origins of hominin technology and the role of [[biomechanics]] in stone tool production. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/anthropology/faculty-and-staff/soniaharmand.php|title=Stony Brook University: Department of Anthropology|last=|first=|date=|website=Stony Brook University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors and Publications ==
Harmand has received many awards for her work with [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Stone Age]] archaeology. In 2015, Harmand won both the Stone Age Institute Award for Outstanding Research into Human Origins&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/2015harmand.html#.XAQcvi2ZPq1|title=2015 SAI Public Lectures: Sonia Harmand|website=www.stoneageinstitute.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Field Discovery Award from the Shanghai Archaeology Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacea.u-bordeaux1.fr/Jacques-Jaubert-et-ses.html?lang=fr|title=PACEA — De la Préhistoire à l’Actuel : Culture, Environnement et Anthropologie. - Jacques Jaubert et ses collaborateurs récompensés par l’Académie des Sciences sociales de Chine pour leurs travaux sur la grotte de Bruniquel|website=www.pacea.u-bordeaux1.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her work with the [[Lomekwi]] 3 tools. The following year, in 2016, she earned the Prix La Recherche archaeology award in Paris, France. In 2017, the Tübingen research prize for Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology was awarded to Harmand from the [[Eberhard Karls University|Eberhard-Karls-University]] of Tübingen, Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">{{Wiktionary|tenement}}
A '''tenement''' (from the Latin [[wiktionary:tenere#Latin|tenere]] ''to hold''), in law, is anything that is held, rather than owned.  This usage is a holdover from [[feudalism]], which still forms the basis of all real-estate law in the English-speaking world, in which the [[monarch]] alone owned the [[allodial title]] to all the land within his [[Realm|kingdom]].

Under feudalism, land itself was never privately "owned" but rather was "held" by a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (from Latin ''teneo'' "to hold") as a [[Fee (feudal tenure)|fee]], being merely a legal right over land known in modern law as an [[estate in land]]. This was held from a superior [[lord|overlord]], ( a [[mesne lord]]), or from [[The Crown|the crown]] itself in which case the holder was termed a [[tenant-in-chief]], upon some manner of service under one of a variety of [[feudal land tenure]]s.  The thing held is called a tenement, the holder is called a [[leasehold estate|tenant]], the manner of his holding is called a [[tenure]], and the superior is called the [[landlord]], or lord of the fee. These forms are still preserved in law, even though feudalism itself is extinct, because all real estate law has developed from them over centuries.

[[Feudal land tenure]] existed in many varieties. The sole surviving form in the United States is that species of [[freehold (law)|freehold]] known as ''free [[socage]]''. Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the "lord of the fee" is the State itself, and the service due to this "lord" is payment of the taxes upon the real estate.  The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the [[wiktionary:forfeit|forfeiture]] of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of [[eminent domain]], whereby the "lord of the fee" might take back the estate, provided he make [[just compensation]]. Also existing in a vestigial form is the concept of [[escheat]], under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state.

An interesting side effect of this is that government entities do not pay real estate taxes to other government entities since government entities own the land rather than hold the land.  Localities that depend on real estate taxes to provide services are often put at a disadvantage when the state or federal government acquires a piece of land.  Sometimes, to mollify local public opinion, the state or federal government may volunteer to make payments in lieu of taxes ([[PILOT (finance)|PILOT]] or PILT programs) to local governments.

They are usually made from large trees, mostly [[Western Red Cedar|western red cedar]], by [[First Nations]] and [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast]] including northern Northwest Coast [[Haida people | Haida]], [[Tlingit]], and [[Tsimshian]] communities in Southeast [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] and [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] communities in southern [[British Columbia]], and the [[Coast Salish]] communities in [[Washington (state) | Washington]] and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://content.lib.washington.edu/aipnw/wright.html |title= Totem Poles: Heraldic Columns of the Northwest Coast |last= Wright |first= Robin K. |date=n.d. |website= University of Washington, University Libraries, American Indians of the Pacific Northwest Collection|access-date= 21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''totem'' derives from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] (most likely Anishinaabemowin ([[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]])) word ''o[[doodem]]'' [{{IPA|oˈtuːtɛm|}}], "(his) kinship group". The carvings may symbolize or commemorate ancestors, cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole. Given the complexity and symbolic meanings of totem pole carvings, their placement and importance lies in the observer's knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures and the culture in which they are embedded.

==History== 
[[Image:'Ksan Historical Village 2010.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Totem poles and houses at [['Ksan]], near [[Hazelton, British Columbia]].]]
Totem poles serve as important illustrations of family lineage and the cultural heritage of the Native peoples in the islands and coastal areas of North America's Pacific Northwest, especially British Columbia, Canada, and coastal areas of Washington and southeastern Alaska in the United States. Families of traditional carvers come from the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw|Kwakwaka’wakw]] (Kwakiutl), [[Nuxalk]] (Bella Coola), and [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] (Nootka), among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Richard D.

Because of the region's climate and the nature of the materials used to make the poles, few examples carved before 1900 remain. Noteworthy examples, some dating as far back as 1880, include those at the [[Royal British Columbia Museum]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and the Museum of Anthropology at [[University of British Columbia|UBC]] in Vancouver.

Totem poles are the largest, but not the only, objects that coastal Pacific Northwest natives use to depict spiritual reverence, family legends, sacred beings and culturally important animals, people, or historical events. The freestanding poles seen by the region's first European explorers were likely preceded by a long history of decorative carving. Stylistic features of these poles were borrowed from earlier, smaller prototypes, or from the interior support posts of house beams.&lt;ref name=GF1-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Marius Barbeau| title =Totem Poles: According to Crests and Topics | journal = National Museum of Canada Bulletin | volume =119 | issue =1 | page =9 | publisher = Dept. of Resources and Development, National Museum of Canada | location = Ottawa | date =1950  | url = http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/barbeau/mbp0502e.shtml| accessdate =24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although 18th-century accounts of European explorers traveling along the coast indicate that decorated interior and exterior house posts existed prior to 1800, the posts were smaller and fewer in number than in subsequent decades. Prior to the 19th century, the lack of efficient carving tools, along with sufficient wealth and leisure time to devote to the craft, delayed the development of elaborately carved, freestanding poles.&lt;ref name=Barbeau5&gt;Barbeau, "Totem Poles: According to Crests and Topics", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Before iron and steel arrived in the area, Natives used tools made of stone, shells, or beaver teeth for carving. The process was slow and laborious; axes were unknown. By the late eighteenth century, the use of metal cutting tools enabled more complex carvings and increased production of totem poles.&lt;ref name=GF1-2&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; The tall monumental poles appearing in front of native homes in coastal villages probably did not appear until after the beginning of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Barbeau5/&gt;

Eddie Malin has proposed that totem poles progressed from house posts, funerary containers, and memorial markers into symbols of [[clan]] and family wealth and prestige. He argues that the [[Haida people|Haida]] people of the islands of [[Haida Gwaii]] originated carving of the poles, and that the practice spread outward to the [[Tsimshian]] and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], and then down the coast to the indigenous people of British Columbia and northern [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=Malin&gt;{{Cite book  | author = Edward Malin  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Totem Poles of the Pacific Northwest Coast  | publisher = Timber Press  | year = 1986  | location = Portland, Oregon  | pages =   | url=  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-88192-295-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malin's theory is supported by the photographic documentation of the Pacific Northwest coast's cultural history and the more sophisticated designs of the Haida poles.  

Accounts from the 1700s describe and illustrate carved poles and timber homes along the coast of the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph H. Wherry|title=The Totem Pole Indians |page=23&amp;ndash;24 |year=1964|location= New York|publisher=W. Funk|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''Alaska's Totem Poles'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early nineteenth century, widespread importation of iron and steel tools from Great Britain, the United States, and elsewhere led to easier and more rapid production of carved wooden goods, including poles.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''Alaska's Totem Poles'',  p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, American and European trade and settlement initially led to the growth of totem pole carving, but United States and Canadian policies and practices of acculturation and assimilation caused a decline in the development of [[Alaska Native]] and [[First Nations]] cultures and their crafts, and sharply reduced totem pole production by the end of the century. Between 1830 and 1880, the [[Maritime Fur Trade|maritime fur trade]], mining, and fisheries gave rise to an accumulation of wealth among the coastal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 2 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''Alaska's Totem Poles'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of it was spent and distributed in lavish [[potlatch]] celebrations, frequently associated with the construction and erection of totem poles.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The monumental poles commissioned by wealthy family leaders to represent their social status and the importance of their families and clans.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s and 1890s, tourists, collectors, scientists and naturalist interested in native culture collected and photographed totem poles and other artifacts, many of which were put on display at expositions such as the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name=Kramer25&gt;Kramer, ''Alaska's Totem Poles'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, before the passage of the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] in 1978, the practice of Native religion was outlawed, and traditional indigenous cultural practices were also strongly discouraged by Christian [[missionaries]]. This included the carving of totem poles. Missionaries urged converts to cease production and destroy existing poles. Nearly all totem pole making had ceased by 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pat Kramer| title=Totem Poles| page=22| publisher=Heritage House| year=2008| location=Vancouver, British Columbia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UmjSngEACAAJ&amp;dq=Totem+Poles+Kramer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uDV_VMyTGtW2yATpjYHwBA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg| isbn=978-1-89497-444-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carving of monumental and mortuary poles continued in some, more remote Native villages as late as 1905; however, as native sites were abandoned, the poles and timber homes were left to decay and vandalism.&lt;ref name=G-F8&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1930s, a combination of cultural, [[Linguistics|linguistic]], and artistic revivals, along with scholarly interest  and the continuing fascination and support of an educated and empathetic public, led to a renewal and extension of this artistic tradition.&lt;ref name=Kramer25/&gt; In 1938 the United States Forest Service began a program to reconstruct and preserve the old poles, salvaging about 200, roughly one-third of those known to be standing at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=G-F8/&gt; With renewed interest in Native arts and traditions in the 1960s and 1970s, freshly carved totem poles were erected up and down the coast, while related artistic production was introduced in many new and traditional media, ranging from tourist trinkets to masterful works in wood, stone, [[Glassblowing|blown]] and etched glass, and other traditional and non-traditional media.&lt;ref name=Kramer25/&gt;

== Meaning and purpose ==
[[Image:Wrangell totem poles.JPG|thumb|left|200px|From left to right, the ''One-Legged Fisherman'' pole, the ''Raven'' pole, and the ''Killer Whale'' pole in [[Wrangell, Alaska]]]]
Totem poles can symbolize the characters and events in mythology, or convey the experiences of recent ancestors and living people.&lt;ref name=G-F1/&gt; Some of these characters may appear as stylistic representations of objects in nature, while others are more realistically carved. Pole carvings may include animals, fish, plants, insects, and humans, or they may represent supernatural beings such as the [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]]. Some symbolize beings that can transform themselves into another form, appearing as combinations of animals or part-animal/part-human forms. Consistent use of a specific character over time, with some slight variations in carving style, helped develop similarities among these shared symbols that allowed people to recognize one from another. For example, the raven is symbolized by a long, straight beak, while the eagle's beak is curved, and a beaver is depicted with two large front teeth, a piece of wood held in his front paws, and a paddle-shaped tail.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:82296943-SLD-001-050.jpg|thumb|right|Totem pole in Vancouver, British Columbia]]
[[Image:Moa-2.jpg|thumb|right|Totem poles at the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] at the [[University of British Columbia]]]]

The meanings of the designs on totem poles are as varied as the cultures that make them. Some poles celebrate cultural beliefs that may recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events, while others are mostly artistic. Animals and other characters carved on the pole are typically used as symbols to represent characters or events in a story; however, some may reference the moiety of the pole’s owner,&lt;ref&gt;The Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian people separate themselves into two or more major divisions called moieties, which are further divided into small family groups called clans. Traditionally, several families within the same a clan lived together in a large communal house. See Feldman, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply fill up empty space on the pole.&lt;ref name=Feldman1-5&gt;Feldman, pp. 1 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The carved figures interlock, one above the other, to create the overall design, which may rise to a height of sixty feet or more. Smaller carvings may be positioned in vacant spaces, or they may be tucked inside the ears or hang out of the mouths of the pole’s larger figures.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the figures on the poles constitute symbolic reminders of quarrels, murders, debts, and other unpleasant occurrences about which the Native Americans prefer to remain silent... The most widely known tales, like those of the exploits of Raven and of Kats who married the bear woman, are familiar to almost every native of the area. Carvings which symbolize these tales are sufficiently conventionalized to be readily recognizable even by persons whose lineage did not recount them as their own legendary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ishmael Reed]], (ed.)|year=2003|title= From Totems to Hip-Hop: A Multicultural Anthology of Poetry across the Americas, 1900-2002|location=|publisher= |page=|isbn=1-56025-458-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{anchor|Low on the totem pole}}
Those from cultures that do not carve totem poles often assume that the linear representation of the figures places the most importance on the highest figure, an idea that became pervasive in the dominant culture after it entered into mainstream parlance by the 1930s with the phrase "low man on the totem pole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/491446/ |work=The Morning Herald |location=Hagerstown, Maryland |date=April 18, 1939 |title=Around the Clock |quote=Bob started a few months ago as low man on the totem pole. . . . Today he's the boss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and as the title of a bestselling 1941 humor book by [[H. Allen Smith]]). However, Native sources either reject the linear component altogether, or reverse the hierarchy, with the most important representations on the bottom, bearing the weight of all the other figures, or at eye level with the viewer to heighten their significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Oscar Newman | title =Secret Stories in the Art of the Northwest Indian | publisher =Catskill Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2004 | location =New York | page =19 | url =  | isbn =097201196X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poles have no vertical arrangement at all, consisting of a lone figure atop an undecorated column.

== Types ==
There are six basic types of totem poles: house frontal poles, interior house posts, mortuary poles, memorial poles, welcome poles, and the ridicule or shame pole.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 12&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===House frontal poles===
This type of pole, usually 20 to 40 feet tall&lt;ref name=Newman16&gt;Newman, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; is the most decorative. Its carvings tell the story of the family, clan or village who own them. These poles are also known as heraldic, crest, or family poles. Poles of this type are placed outside the clan house of the most important village leaders. Often, watchman figures are carved at the top of the pole to protect the pole owner’s family and the village. Another type of house frontal pole is the entrance or doorway pole, which is attached to the center front of the home and includes an oval-shaped opening through the base that serves as the entrance to the clan house.&lt;ref name=Feldman12&gt;Feldman, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;-_-


''

===House posts===
These interior poles, typically 7 to 10 feet in height, are usually shorter than exterior poles.&lt;ref name=Newman16/&gt; The interior posts support the roof beam of a clan house and include a large notch at the top, where the beam can rest.&lt;ref name=Feldman12/&gt; A clan house may have two to four or more house posts, depending on the native group who built it. Carvings on these poles, like those of the house frontal poles, are often used as a storytelling device for children and help tell the story of the owners' family history.&lt;ref name=Newman19&gt;Newman, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman13&gt;Feldman, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortuary pole===
The rarest type of totem pole is a mortuary structure that incorporates grave boxes with carved supporting poles or includes a recessed back to hold the grave box. It is among the tallest and most prominent poles, reaching 50 to 70 feet in height.&lt;ref name=Newman19/&gt; The Haida and Tlingit people erect mortuary poles at the death of important individuals in the community. These poles may have a single figure carved at the top, which may depict the clan's crest, but carvings usually cover its entire length. Ashes or the body of the deceased person are placed in the upper portion of the pole.&lt;ref name=Feldman13/&gt;

===Memorial pole===
This type of pole, which usually stands in front of a clan house, is erected about a year after a person has died. The clan chief’s memorial pole may be raised at the center of the village.&lt;ref name=Newman19/&gt; The pole's purpose is to honor the deceased person and identify the relative who is taking over as his successor within the clan and the community. Traditionally, the memorial pole has one carved figure at the top, but an additional figure may also be added at the bottom of the pole.&lt;ref name=Feldman13/&gt;

Memorial poles may also commemorate an event. For example, several memorial totem poles were erected by the Tlingits in honor of Abraham Lincoln, one of which was relocated to [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]], Alaska, in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincoln pole at Saxman commemorates the end of hostilities between two rival Tlingit clans and symbolizes the hope for peace and prosperity following the American occupation of the Alaskan territory.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The story begins in 1868, when  the United States government built a customs house and fort on Tongass Island and left the U.S, revenue cutter ''Lincoln'' to patrol the area. After American soldiers at the fort and aboard the ''Lincoln'' provided protection to the Tongass group against its rival, the Kagwantans, the Tongass group commissioned the Lincoln pole to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;Barbeau, "Totem Poles: According to Crests and Topics", p. 402&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welcome pole===
Carved by the Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) and Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people, most of the poles include a large carvings of human figures, some as tall as 40 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Welcome poles are placed at the edge of a stream or saltwater beach to welcome guests to the community, or possibly to intimidate strangers.&lt;ref name=Feldman13&gt;Feldman, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wherry, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shame/ridicule pole===
Poles used for public ridicule are usually called shame poles, and were created to embarrass individuals or groups for their unpaid debts or when they did something wrong.&lt;ref name=Feldman13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keithahn&gt;{{Cite book  | author=Edward Keithahn  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Monuments in Cedar  | publisher = Superior Publishing Co.  | year = 1963  | location =Seattle, Washington  | pages = 56 | url = http://www.alaskool.org/projects/traditionalife/monumentsincedar/MIC_three.htm | doi =  | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poles are often placed in prominent locations and removed after the debt is paid or the wrong is corrected. Shame pole carvings represent the person being shamed.&lt;ref name=Feldman13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Jackson Museum, Sitka, AK. Accessed 23 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Top of Seward Pole.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Seward Pole]]
One famous shame pole is the Seward Pole at the [[Saxman Totem Park]] in [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]], Alaska. It was created to shame former U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] for not reciprocating the courtesy or generosity of his Tlingit hosts following a [[potlatch]] given in his honor. The intent of this pole is indicated by the figure's red-painted nose and ears to symbolized Seward's stinginess.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. 55&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''Alaska’s Totem Poles'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the shame pole is the Three Frogs pole on [[Chief Shakes]] Island, at [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], Alaska. This pole was erected by Chief Shakes to shame the Kiks.ádi [[clan]] into repaying a debt incurred for the support of three Kiks.ádi women who were allegedly cohabiting with three slaves in Shakes's household. When the Kiks.ádi leaders refused to pay support for the women, Shakes commissioned a pole with carvings of three frogs, which represented the crest of the Kiks.ádi clan. It is not known if the debt was ever repaid.&lt;ref&gt;Barbeau, "Totem Poles: According to Crests and Topics", p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The pole stands next to the Chief Shakes Tribal House in Wrangell. The pole's unique crossbar shape has become popularly associated with the town of Wrangell, and continues to be used as part of the ''Wrangell Sentinel'' newspaper's masthead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Wrangell Sentinel|publisher =''Wrangell Sentinel'' | date =21 November 2014 |url=http://www.wrangellsentinel.com/|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, the U.S. Forest Service commissioned a pole to commemorate [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexander Baranof]], the Russian governor and Russian American Company manager, as a civilian works project. The pole's original intent was to commemorate a peace treaty between the Russians and Tlingits that the governor helped broker in 1805. George Benson,  a Sitka carver and craftsman, created the original design. The completed version originally stood in Totem Square in downtown [[Sitka, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=Haugland&gt;{{Citation  | author =Shannon Haugland  | author-link =   | last2 =   | first2 =   | author2-link =

On March 24, 2007, a shame pole was erected in [[Cordova, Alaska]], that includes the inverted and distorted face of former [[Exxon]] CEO [[Lee Raymond]].

[[Image:Totem Pole - Pioneer Square - 1907.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Tlingit totem pole brought from Alaska to Pioneer Square in Seattle.]]

The other two poles were sold; one pole from the Alaska pavilion went the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] and the pole from the Esquimau Village was sold and then given to industrialist [[David M. Parry]], who installed it on his estate in what became known as the [[Golden Hill Historic District (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Golden Hill]] neighborhood of [[Indianapolis]], Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 25&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the remains of the original pole at Golden Hill no longer exist, a replica was raised on April 13, 1996, on the front lawn of The [[Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art]] in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 43 and 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately two years later, the replica was moved inside the museum, and in 2005, it was installed in a new atrium after completion of a museum expansion project.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian New Deal===
The [[Indian New Deal]] of the 1930s strongly promoted native arts and crafts, and in the totem pole they discovered an art that was widely appreciated by white society.  In Alaska the Indian Division of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] restored old totem poles, copied those beyond repair, and carved new ones.  The Indian Arts and Crafts Board, A federal government agency, facilitated their sale to the general public. The project was lucrative, but anthropologists complaining that it stripped the natives of their traditional culture and stripped away the meaning of the totem poles.&lt;ref&gt;Aldona Jonaitis, "Totem Poles And The Indian New Deal," ''European Contributions to American Studies'' (1990) Vol. 18, pp 267-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fay Schrader, ''The Indian Arts &amp; Crafts Board: An Aspect of New Deal Indian Policy'' (University of New Mexico Press, 1983.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example occurred in 1938, when the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] began a totem pole restoration program in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield and Forrest, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Poles were removed from their original places as funerary and crest poles to be copied or repaired and then placed in parks based on English and French garden designs to demystify their meaning for tourists.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite speech |title=Decoding Totems in the New Deal |author=Emily Moore |authorlink= |event=Wooshteen Kana&lt;u&gt;x&lt;/u&gt;tulaneegí Haa At Wuskóowu / Sharing Our Knowledge, A conference of Tlingit Tribes and Clans: Haa eetí ḵáa yís / For Those Who Come After Us |location=Sitka, Alaska |date=31 March 2012|url=http://ankn.uaf.edu/ClanConference2/course/view.php?id=4 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England at the side of [[Virginia Water Lake]], in the south of [[Windsor Great Park]], there is a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} tall Canadian totem pole that was given to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to commemorate the centenary of [[British Columbia]]. In Seattle, Washington, a Tlingit funerary totem pole was raised in Pioneer Square in 1899, after being taken from an Alaskan village.&lt;ref name=Graves&gt;{{cite news  | author=Jen Graves  | coauthors =  | title = A Totem Pole Made of Christmas Lights: Bringing Superwrongness to Life  | newspaper = The Stranger  | location = Seattle, Washington  | pages =   | publisher =  | date = 10 January 2012  | url = http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/a-totem-pole-made-of-christmas-lights/Content?oid=11587201  | accessdate = 12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the totem pole collections in Vancouver's [[Stanley Park]], Victoria's [[Thunderbird Park (Victoria, British Columbia)|Thunderbird Park]], and the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] were removed from their original locations around British Columbia.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Construction and maintenance==
[[Image:Incomplete haida pole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Incomplete [[Haida people|Haida]] pole in [[Skidegate]], British Columbia]]
After the tree to be used for the totem pole is selected, it is cut down and moved to the carving site, where the bark and outer layer of wood (sapwood) is removed. Next, the side of the tree to be carved is chosen and the back half of the tree is removed. The center of the log is hollowed out to make it lighter and to keep it from cracking.&lt;ref name=Feldman21-22&gt;Feldman, p. 21&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt; Early tools used to carve totem poles were made of stone, shell, or bone, but beginning in the late 1700s, the use of iron tools made the carving work faster and easier. In the early days, the basic design for figures may have been painted on the wood to guide the carvers, but today's carvers use paper patterns as outlines for their designs. Carvers use chain saws to make the rough shapes and cuts, while adzes and chisels are used to chop the wood. Carvers use knives and other woodworking tools to add the finer details. When the carving is complete, paint is added to enhance specific details of the figures.&lt;ref name=Feldman21-22/&gt;

Raising a totem pole is rarely done using modern methods, even for poles installed in modern settings. Most artists use a traditional method followed by a pole-raising ceremony. The traditional method calls for a deep trench to be dug. One end of the pole is placed at the bottom of the trench; the other end is supported at an upward angle by a wooden scaffold. Hundreds of strong men haul the pole upright into its footing, while others steady the pole from side ropes and brace it with cross beams. Once the pole is upright, the trench is filled with rocks and dirt. After the raising is completed, the carver, the carver's assistants, and others invited to attend the event perform a celebratory dance next to the pole. A community [[potlatch]] celebration typically follows the pole raising to commemorate the event.&lt;ref name=Feldman22-23&gt;Feldman, p. 22&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Klawock-dancing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing at a pole-raising celebration in [[Klawock, Alaska]]]]

Totem poles are typically not well maintained after their installation and the potlatch celebration. The poles usually last from 60 to 80 years; only a few have stood longer than 75 years, and even fewer have reached 100 years of age.&lt;ref name="G-F8"/&gt; Once the wood rots so badly that the pole begins to lean and pose a threat to passersby, it is either destroyed or pushed over and removed. Older poles typically fall over during the winter storms that batter the coast. The owners of a collapsed pole may commission a new one to replace it,&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural property==
Each culture typically has complex rules and customs regarding the traditional designs represented on poles. The designs are generally considered the property of a particular clan or family group of traditional carvers, and this ownership of the designs may not be transferred to the person who has commissioned the carvings. There have been protests when those who have not been trained in the traditional carving methods, cultural meanings and protocol, have made "fake totem
poles" for what could be considered crass public display and commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=ICTMN&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon Country Fair Cancels Fake Native Totem Pole Raising - Ritz Sauna story pole ‘worst appropriation I’ve ever seen’ says descendant of carving family|last=Hopper|first=Frank|publisher =[[Indian Country Media Network]] | date=25 May 2017 |url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/native-news/oregon-country-fair-cancels-fake-native-totem-pole-raising|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cultural appropriation|misappropriation]] of coastal Pacific Northwest culture by the art and tourist trinket market has resulted in production of cheap imitations of totem poles executed with little or no knowledge of their complex stylistic conventions or cultural significance. These include imitations made for commercial and even comedic use in venues that serve alcohol, and in other settings that are insensitive or outright offensive to the sacred nature of some of the carvings.&lt;ref name=ICTMN/&gt;

==Examples==
[[Image:Tallest totem pole.jpg|thumb|175px|The world's tallest totem pole, near [[Alert Bay]]]]
The title of "The World's Tallest Totem Pole" is or has at one time been claimed by several coastal towns of North America's Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name=Kramer83&gt;Kramer, ''Alaska's Totem Poles'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes over which is genuinely the tallest depends on factors such the number of logs used in construction or the affiliation of the carver. Competitions to make the tallest pole remain prevalent, although it is becoming more difficult to procure trees of sufficient height.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The tallest poles include those in:
* [[Alert Bay]], British Columbia&amp;mdash;{{convert|173|ft|m}}, Kwakwaka'wakw. This pole is composed of two or three pieces.&lt;ref name=Kramer83/&gt;
* [[McKinleyville, California]]&amp;mdash;{{convert|160|ft|m}}, carved from a single redwood tree by Ernest Pierson and John Nelson.
* [[Kalama, Washington]]&amp;mdash;{{convert|149|ft|m}}, carved from a single pole by Lelooska.&lt;ref name=Kramer83/&gt;
* [[Kake, Alaska]]&amp;mdash;{{convert|132|ft|m}}, single log carving,&lt;ref name=Kramer83/&gt; Tlingit
* [[Victoria, British Columbia]] (Beacon Hill Park)&amp;mdash;{{convert|127.7|ft|m}}, raised in 1956,&lt;ref name=Kramer83/&gt; Kwakwaka'wakw, carved by Mungo Martin with Henry Hunt and David Martin.
* [[Tacoma, Washington]] (Fireman's Park)&amp;mdash;{{convert|105|ft|m}}, carved by Alaska Natives in 1903.&lt;ref name=Kramer83/&gt;
* [[Vancouver]], British Columbia (Maritime Museum) &amp;mdash;{{convert|100|ft|m}}, Kwakwaka'wakw, carved by Mungo Martin with Henry Hunt and David Martin.

The thickest totem pole ever carved to date is in [[Duncan, British Columbia]]. Carved by Richard Hunt in 1988 in the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] style, and measuring over {{convert|6|ft|m}} in diameter, it represents Cedar Man transforming into his human form.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The city is located mainly on the western bank of the [[Po (river)|Po River]], in front of [[Susa Valley]], and is surrounded by the western [[Alps|Alpine arch]] and [[Superga]] Hill. The population of the city proper is 878,074 (31 July 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.demo.istat.it/bilmens2017gen/index.html|title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT|website=www.demo.istat.it|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the population of the urban area is estimated by [[Larger Urban Zones|Eurostat]] to be 1.7&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants.  The [[Turin metropolitan area]] is estimated by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] to have a population of 2.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="competitive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF |title=Competitive Cities in the Global Economy |author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] |accessdate=30 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001192936/http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF |archivedate= 1 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a rich culture and history, being known for its numerous [[art museum|art galleries]], restaurants, churches, palaces, [[opera house]]s, [[piazza]]s, parks, gardens, theatres, libraries, museums and other venues. Turin is well known for its [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]], and [[Art Nouveau]] architecture. Many of Turin's [[Town square|public squares]], castles, gardens and elegant ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' such as the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama]], were built between the 16th and 18th centuries. A part of the historical center of Turin was inscribed in the World Heritage List under the name [[Residences of the Royal House of Savoy]].

The city used to be a major European political center. From 1563, it was the capital of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], then of the Kingdom of Sardinia ruled by the Royal [[House of Savoy]], and the first capital of the unified Italy (the [[Kingdom of Italy]]) from 1861 to 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/history.htm |title=The city's history |accessdate=31 August 2007 |work=Turismo e promozione |publisher=Città di Torino |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818061240/http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/history.htm |archivedate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/turin--culture-amp-history-20081128-6m77.html |title=Turin – Culture &amp; History |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=|accessdate=26 December 2009}} {{dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turin is sometimes called "the cradle of Italian liberty" for having been the birthplace and home of notable individuals who contributed to the ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'', such as [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Cavour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/Chastain/ac/cavour.htm |title=Cavour, Count Camillo Benso di (1810–1861) |publisher=Ohio.edu |date=22 April 1998 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city currently hosts some of Italy's best universities, colleges, academies, lycea and gymnasia, such as the [[University of Turin]], founded in the 15th century, and the [[Turin Polytechnic]]. In addition, the city is home to museums such as the [[Museo Egizio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiantourism.com/egizio.html |title=ITALIA – Egyptian Museum of Turin |publisher=Italiantourism.com |date=|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mole Antonelliana]]. Turin's attractions make it one of the world's top 250 tourist destinations and the tenth most visited city in Italy in 2008.&lt;ref name="euromonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/_Euromonitor_Internationals_Top_City_Destinations_Ranking |title=Euromonitor Internationals Top City Destinations Ranking Euromonitor archive |publisher=Euromonitor.com |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111043452/http://www.euromonitor.com/_Euromonitor_Internationals_Top_City_Destinations_Ranking |archivedate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though much of its political significance and importance had been lost by [[World War II]], Turin became a major European crossroad for industry, commerce and trade, and is part of the famous "industrial triangle" along with [[Milan]] and [[Genoa]]. Turin is ranked third in Italy, after Milan and Rome, for economic strength.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040318203933/http://www.regione.basilicata.it/dipattivitaproduttive/default.cfm?fuseaction=linkdoc&amp;doc=519&amp;link=527 CENSIS]&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of $58&amp;nbsp;billion, Turin is the world's 78th richest city by purchasing power.&lt;ref name="citymayors.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2005.html |title=City Mayors reviews the richest cities in the world in 2005 |publisher=Citymayors.com |date=11 March 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the city  has been ranked by [[GaWC]] as a [[world city|Gamma World city]].&lt;ref name="lboro.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |archivedate=10 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turin is also home to much of the Italian automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DJvGpo_CH-UC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=turin+automobile+industry#v=onepage&amp;q=turin%20automobile%20industry&amp;f=false |title=The Economic History of Italy 1860... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=28 October 1993|accessdate=26 December 2009 |first=Vera |last=Zamagni |isbn=978-0-19-829289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/609705/Turin |title=Turin (Italy) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient origins ===
The [[Taurini]] were an ancient [[Celto-Ligurian]]&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXI, 38: ''Taurini semigalli''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alpine race|Alpine]] people, who occupied the upper valley of the [[Po River]], in the center of modern [[Piedmont]].
[[File:BattleofTurin prince Anhalt.JPG|thumb|left|[[Siege of Turin]].]]
In 218 BC, they were attacked by [[Hannibal]] as he was allied with their long-standing enemies, the [[Insubres]]. The Taurini chief town (''Taurasia'') was captured by Hannibal's forces after a three-day siege.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]] iii. 60, 8&lt;/ref&gt; As a people they are rarely mentioned in history. It is believed that a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony was established in 27 BC under the name of ''Castra Taurinorum'' and afterwards ''Julia Augusta Taurinorum'' (modern Turin). Both [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;v. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;iv. p.&amp;nbsp;209&lt;/ref&gt; mention the Taurini's country as including one of the passes of the [[Alps]], which points to a wider use of the name in earlier times.

=== Roman times ===
In the 1st century BC (probably 28 BC), the Romans created a military camp (''Castra Taurinorum''), later dedicated to [[Augustus]] (''Augusta Taurinorum''). The typical Roman street grid can still be seen in the modern city, especially in the neighborhood known as the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral). Via Garibaldi traces the exact path of the Roman city's [[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]] which began at the ''Porta Decumani'', later incorporated into the ''Castello'' or ''Palazzo Madama''. The ''Porta Palatina'', on the north side of the current city centre, is still preserved in a park near the Cathedral. Remains of the Roman-period [[Roman theatre (structure)|theater]] are preserved in the area of the ''Manica Nuova''. Turin reached about 5,000 inhabitants at the time, all living inside the high city walls.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Arduino d'ivrea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arduin of Italy|Arduin d'Ivrea]]]]
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the town was conquered by the [[Heruli]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], recaptured by the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]], but then conquered again by the [[Lombards]] and then the [[Franks]] of [[Charlemagne]] (773). The ''[[March of Turin|Contea di Torino]]'' (countship) was founded in the 940s and was held by the [[Arduin of Italy|Arduinic]] dynasty until 1050. After the marriage of [[Adelaide of Susa]] with [[Humbert I, Count of Savoy|Humbert Biancamano]]'s son [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Otto]], the family of the [[House of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]] gained control. While the title of count was held by the Bishop as count of [[County of Turin|Turin]] (1092–1130 and 1136–1191) it was ruled as a [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishopric]] by the Bishops. In 1230–1235 it was a lordship under the [[List of rulers of Montferrat|Marquess of Montferrat]], styled Lord of Turin. At the end of the 13th century, when it was annexed to the Duchy of Savoy, the city already had 20,000 inhabitants. Many of the gardens and palaces were built in the 15th century when the city was redesigned. The [[University of Turin]] was also founded during this period.

=== Early modern ===
[[File:Torino 1500-1600 vista dall'alto.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Turin in the 17th century.]]
[[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known under the nickname of ''Iron Head'' (Testa 'd Fer), made Turin the capital of the Duchy of Savoy in 1563. Piazza Reale (named [[Piazza San Carlo]] today) and Via Nuova (current Via Roma) were added along with the first enlargement of the walls, in the first half of the 17th century; in the same period the ''Palazzo Reale'' ([[Royal Palace of Turin]]) was also built. In the second half of that century, a second enlargement of the walls was planned and executed, with the building of the arcaded Via Po, connecting Piazza Castello with the bridge on the Po through the regular street grid.

In 1706, during the [[Battle of Turin]], the French besieged the city for 117 days without conquering it. By the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] the Duke of Savoy acquired [[Sicily]], soon traded for [[Sardinia]], and part of the former [[Duchy of Milan]], and was elevated to king; thus Turin became the capital of a European kingdom. The architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] began a major redesign of the city; Turin had about 90,000 inhabitants at the time.

=== Late modern and contemporary ===
[[File:Maggi, Giovanni Battista - Torino - Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Turin in the late 19th century. In the background, the [[Mole Antonelliana]] under construction.]]

Turin, like the rest of [[Piedmont]], was annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1802. The city thus became the seat of the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of [[Pô (department)|Pô]] [[Departments of France|department]] until the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814, when the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored with Turin as its capital. In the following decades, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia led the struggle towards the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]]. In 1861, Turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed united [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiansrus.com/articles/torinohistory_part4.htm |title=Turin's History |publisher=Italianrus.com. Anthony Parenti |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1865, when the capital was moved to [[Florence]], and then to [[Rome]] after the 1870 conquest of the [[Papal States]]. The 1871 opening of the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel|Fréjus Tunnel]] made Turin an important communication node between Italy and France. The city in that period had 250,000 inhabitants. Some of the most iconic landmarks of the city, like the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio church]] and ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' were built in this period. The late 19th century was also a period of rapid industrialization, especially in the automotive sector: in 1899 [[Fiat]] was established in the city, followed by [[Lancia]] in 1906. The [[Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna|Universal Exposition]] held in Turin in 1902 is often regarded as the pinnacle of [[Art Nouveau]] design, and the city hosted the same event in [[Turin International|1911]]. By this time, Turin had grown to 430,000 inhabitants.
[[File:19TorinoGranMadreDio.JPG|thumb|[[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre di Dio]].]]

After [[World War I]], harsh conditions brought a wave of strikes and workers' protests. In 1920 the [[Lingotto]] Fiat factory was occupied. The Fascist regime put an end to the social unrest, banning trade unions and jailing socialist leaders, notably [[Antonio Gramsci]]. On the other hand, [[Benito Mussolini]] largely subsidized the automotive industry, to provide vehicles to the army. Turin was then a target of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[strategic bombing]] during [[World War II]], being heavily damaged in its industrial areas by the air raids. The Allied's [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|campaign in Italy]] started off from the [[Southern Italy|South]] and slowly moved northwards in the following two years, leaving the northern regions occupied by Germans and collaborationist forces for several years.

Turin was not captured by the Allies until the end of [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Spring Offensive of 1945]]. By the time the vanguard of the armoured reconnaissance units of [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] reached the city, it was already freed by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian Partisans]], that had begun revolting against the Germans on 25 April 1945. Days later, troops from the US Army's [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored]] and [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Divisions]] came to substitute the Brazilians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willis D. Crittenberger]], "The final campaign across Italy"; year of edition 1952 {{ISBN|85-7011-219-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mascarenhas de Moraes]], ''The Brazilian Expeditionary Force, By Its Commander'' US Government Printing Office, 1966. ASIN B000PIBXCG&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postwar years, Turin was rapidly rebuilt. The city's automotive industry played a pivotal role in the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s, attracting hundred of thousands of immigrants to the city, particularly from the rural southern regions of Italy. The number of immigrants was so big that Turin was said to be "the third southern Italian city after [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]". The population soon reached 1 million in 1960 and peaked at almost 1.2 million in 1971. The exceptional growth gains of the city gained it the nickname of ''the Automobile Capital of Italy'' and ''the [[Detroit]] of Italy'' (Turin has been "twinned" with Detroit since 1998). In the 1970s and 1980s, the oil and automotive industry crisis severely hit the city, and its population began to sharply decline, losing more than one-fourth of its total in 30 years. The long population decline of the city has begun to reverse itself only in recent years, as the population grew from 865,000 to slightly over 900,000 by the end of the century. In 2006, Turin hosted the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Torino panorama Superga.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Turin today]]
Turin is located in [[northwest Italy]]. It is surrounded on the western and northern front by the Alps and on the eastern front by a high hill that is the natural continuation of the hills of [[Montferrat|Monferrato]]. Four major rivers pass through the city: the Po and three of its tributaries, the [[Dora Riparia]] (once known as ''Duria Minor'' by the Romans, from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] noun ''duria'' meaning "water"), the [[Stura di Lanzo]] and the [[Sangone (torrent)|Sangone]].

=== Climate ===
Turin features a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'')  in contrast to the [[Mediterranean climate]] characteristic of the coast of [[Italy]].

Winters are moderately cold but dry, summers are mild in the hills and quite hot in the plains. Rain falls mostly during spring and autumn; during the hottest months, otherwise, rains are less frequent but heavier (thunderstorms are frequent). During the winter and autumn months banks of fog, which are sometimes very thick, form in the plains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |title=Torino Turistica – Servizio Telematico Pubblico – Città di Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |date= |accessdate=6 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429121444/http://www.comune.torino.it/canaleturismo/en/clima.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rarely on the city because of its location at the end of the [[Susa Valley]].

Its position on the east side of the [[Alps]] makes the weather drier than on the west side because of the [[föhn wind]] effect.

The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|37.1|C|F}}, while the lowest was {{convert|-21.8|C|F}}.

[[File:Torino, via Roma (01).jpg|thumb|right|''Via Roma'']]

Turin's historical architecture is predominantly [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and was developed under the [[Kingdom of Savoy]]. Nonetheless the main street of the city centre, ''Via Roma'', was built during the Fascist era (from 1931 to 1937) as an example of [[Italian Rationalism]], replacing former buildings already present in this area.

Via Roma runs between [[Piazza Carlo Felice]] and [[Piazza Castello, Turin|Piazza Castello]]. Buildings on the portion between Piazza Carlo Felice and [[Piazza San Carlo]] were designed by rationalist architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]. These blocks were built into a reticular system, composed by austere buildings in clear rationalist style, such as the impressive ''Hotel Principi di Piemonte'' and the former ''Hotel Nazionale'' in ''Piazza CLN''. Porches are built in a continuous [[entablature]] and marked with double columns, to be consistent with those of Piazza San Carlo. The section of the street between Piazza San Carlo and Piazza Castello was built in eclectic style, with arcades characterised by [[Serliana]]-type arches. To this day Via Roma is the street featuring the most fashionable boutiques of the city.

[[File:Torino - Caval ëd Brons latoB.jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza San Carlo'' and the ''Caval 'd Brons'' (Bronze Horse in Piedmontese language) equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]].]]

Via Roma crosses one of the main squares of the city: the pedestrianized Piazza San Carlo, built by [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] in the 17th century. In the middle of the square stands the equestrian monument to [[Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]], also known as ''Caval ëd Brons'' in local dialect ("Bronze Horse"); the monument depicts the Duke sheathing his sword after the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]]. Piazza San Carlo arcades host the most ancient cafés of the city, such as ''Caffé Torino'' and ''Caffé San Carlo''.

[[File:529TorinoPalazzoReale.JPG|thumb|left|''Piazza Castello'' with [[Royal Palace of Turin|Palazzo Reale]] (Royal Palace) in the background.]]

On the northern edge of Via Roma stands ''Piazza Castello'', regarded as the heart of the city. The half-pedestrianized square hosts some significant buildings such as ''Palazzo Reale'' (Former Savoy Royal House), the ''Palazzo Madama'' (which previously hosted the Savoy senate and, for few years, the Italian senate after Italian unification), the former Baroque [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] (rebuilt in modern style in the 1960s, after being destroyed by fire) and the [[Royal Library of Turin]] which hosts the [[Portrait of a man in red chalk (Leonardo)|Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait]]. Moreover, Piazza Castello hosts a Fascist era building, the [[Torre Littoria]], a sort of skyscraper which was supposed to become the headquarters of the Fascist party, although it never served as such. The building's style is quite different from the Baroque style of Piazza Castello. The square regularly hosts the main open space events of the city, live concerts included.

[[File:Porta Nuova Piazza Carlo Felice Torino.JPG|thumb|left|''Porta Nuova'' main railway station, in front of ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' square (before restyling).]]

As for the southern part of the street, Via Roma ends in ''Piazza Carlo Felice'' and in its ''Giardino Sambuy'', a wide fenced garden right in the middle of the square. Across from Piazza Carlo Felice stands the monumental façade of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova railway station]], the central station of the city built between 1861 and 1868 by the architect Alessandro Mazzucchetti. The passengers building was  renovated to host a shopping mall and more efficient passenger service offices. However, it is still an example of monumental architecture, with its stately foyer and some Baroque sights, such as the ''Sala Reale'' (the former Royal waiting room).

[[File:Torino, piazza Vittorio Veneto (04).jpg|thumb|right|''Piazza Vittorio Veneto'' square.]]

In ''Piazza Castello'' converge some of the main streets of the city centre. Among them one of the most significant is the arcaded ''Via Po'', built by [[Amedeo di Castellamonte]] in 1868 and featuring some interesting buildings, such as the first and original building of the [[University of Turin]] and the historical [[Caffè Fiorio]], which was the favourite café of the 19th-century politicians. Via Po ends in [[Piazza Vittorio Veneto, Turin|Piazza Vittorio Veneto]] (simply called Piazza Vittorio locally), the largest Baroque square in Europe and today heart of Turin nightlife. Piazza Vittorio features the most fashionable bars and not far from here, along the [[Po (river)|Po]] riverfront, the ''Murazzi'' quays used to host several bars and nightclubs open till the morning until a few years ago.

[[File:Museo del Risorgimento italiano.JPG|thumb|right|Baroque façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]], the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]].]]

Parallel to Via Roma, other two popular pedestrian streets, namely ''Via Lagrange'' and ''Via Carlo Alberto'', cross the old town from Via Po to ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II''. Their recent pedestrianisation has improved their original commercial vocation. In particular, Via Lagrange has recently increased the presence of luxury boutiques. This street also hosts the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum of Turin]], home to what is regarded as one of the largest collections of Egyptian antiquities outside of Egypt.

Via Lagrange and Via Carlo Alberto cross two significant squares of the city, respectively. The former crosses ''Piazza Carignano'', well known mainly for the undulating “concave – convex – concave” Baroque façade of [[Palazzo Carignano]]. This building used to host the ''Parlamento Subalpino'' (the “Subalpine Parliament”, [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia]] which also became the Italian Parliament for a few years, after the Italian unification) and today houses the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Turin)|Museum of the Risorgimento]]. The square also features the [[Teatro Carignano]], a well-conserved Baroque theatre.
Via Carlo Alberto crosses ''Piazza Carlo Alberto'', a big square hosting the rear façade of Palazzo Carignano, in eclectic style. On the other side stands the monumental ''Biblioteca Nazionale'' (National Library).

[[File:Torino-mole10.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mole Antonelliana]] some years ago.]]

Not far from Via Po stands the symbol of Turin, namely the [[Mole Antonelliana]], so named after the architect who built it, [[Alessandro Antonelli]]. Construction began in 1863 as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. Nowadays it houses the [[National Museum of Cinema]] and it is believed to be the tallest museum in the world at {{convert|167|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The building is depicted on the Italian 2-cent coin.

[[File:Cupola sindone.jpg|thumb|left|Dome of [[Turin Cathedral]].]]

Just behind ''Piazza Castello'' stands the [[Turin Cathedral]], dedicated to Saint [[John the Baptist]], which is the major church of the city. It was built during 1491–1498 and is adjacent to an earlier [[bell tower]] (1470). Annexed to the cathedral is the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]], the current resting place of the [[Shroud of Turin]]. The Chapel was added to the structure in 1668–1694, designed by [[Guarino Guarini|Guarini]]. The [[Basilica of Corpus Domini]] was built to celebrate an alleged miracle which took place during the sack of the city in 1453, when a soldier was carrying off a [[monstrance]] containing the [[Blessed Sacrament]]; the monstrance fell to the ground, while the [[Sacramental bread|host]] remained suspended in air. The present church, erected in 1610 to replace the original chapel which stood on the spot, is the work of [[Ascanio Vitozzi]].

[[File:Torino - Porta Palatina.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Palatine Towers]].]]

Next to the Turin Cathedral stand the [[Palatine Towers]], an ancient [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]]-medieval structure that served as one of four Roman [[city gate]]s along the [[city walls]] of Turin. This gate allowed access from north to the ''[[cardo]] maximus'', the typical second main street of a Roman town. The Palatine Towers are among the best preserved Roman remains in northern Italy. Close to this site, the {{convert|51,300|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} ''Piazza della Repubblica'' plays host to the biggest open market in Europe, locally known as ''mercato di Porta Palazzo'' (''Porta Palazzo'' or ''Porta Pila'' are the historical and local names of this area).

West of the Porte Palatine stands the ''Quadrilatero Romano'' (Roman Quadrilateral), the old medieval district recently renewed. The current neighbourhood is characterised by its tiny streets and its several medieval buildings and today it is popular for its ''[[Apéritif and digestif|aperitivo]]'' bars and its small shops run by local artisans. The hub of the Quadrilatero is ''Piazza Emanuele Filiberto''.

South of the Quadrilatero Romano stands ''Via Garibaldi'', another popular street of the city. It is a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} pedestrian street between Piazza Castello and ''Piazza Statuto'' which features some of the old shops of the city. Large ''Piazza Statuto'' is another example of Baroque square with arcades.

[[File:Nouvelle gare TGV de Turin Porta Susa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Torino Porta Susa railway station|''Porta Susa'' railway station]].]]

Another main street of downtown is ''Via Pietro Micca'', which starts in Piazza Castello and ends in the large ''Piazza Solferino''. The street continues in ''Via Cernaia'' up to ''Piazza XXV Dicembre'', which features the former [[Porta Susa]] passengers building, relocated in 2012  a little more southward. The  new and larger passengers building is situated between ''Corso Bolzano'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' and  is an example of contemporary architecture, being a {{convert|300|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and {{convert|19|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} glass and steel structure. Porta Susa is currently the international central station of the city (high speed trains to Paris) and it is becoming the central hub of railway transportation of the city, being the station in which local trains (so-called ''Ferrovie Metropolitane''), national trains and high-speed national and international trains converge.

Close to Via Cernaia stands the ''Cittadella'' (Citadel), located in the ''Andrea Guglielminetti garden''. What remains of the old medieval and modern fortress of the city, it is a starting point for a tour into the old underground tunnels below the city.

=== San Salvario ===
[[File:Borgo medievale TO.jpg|thumb|''Borgo Medievale''.]]
[[File:Valentino castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castello del Valentino]] in [[Parco del Valentino]].]]

Southeast of the city centre stands ''San Salvario'' district, which extends from ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' to ''Corso Bramante'' and is delimited by the [[Turin-Genoa railway]] on the west side and by the Po river on the east side. Home to an increasing immigrants' community, the district is an example of integration among different cultures; it also features an incremented  nightlife after the opening of several low-cost bars and restaurants.

San Salvario is crossed by two main roads, ''Via Nizza'' and ''Via Madama Cristina'', and just as the city centre it is characterized by the [[grid plan]] typical of Turin's old neighbourhoods. The hub of the district is ''Piazza Madama Cristina'' which hosts a big open market, while several commercial activities flourish around it.

The celebrated [[Parco del Valentino]] is situated in the east side of San Salvario and, albeit not in downtown, it represents kind of central park of Turin. Thanks to the vicinity to the city centre, the park is very popular among the local people, during the day but also at night, because of the several bars and nightclubs placed here. From the terraces of Parco del Valentino, many sights of the hills on the other side of the river can be appreciated.

In the centre of the park stands the [[Castello del Valentino]], built in the 17th century. This castle has a horseshoe shape, with four rectangular towers, one at each angle, and a wide inner court with a marble pavement. The ceilings of the false upper floors are in ''transalpino'' (i.e. French) style. The façade sports the huge coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]].

Another  cluster of buildings in the park is the ''Borgo Medievale'' (Medieval village), a replica of medieval mountain castles of Piedmont and Aosta Valley, built for the 1884 [[World's fair|International Exhibition]].

Other  buildings in ''Corso Massimo d'Azeglio'' include the [[Torino Esposizioni]] complex (Turin's exhibition hall built in the 1930s) featuring a monumental entrance with a large full height porch, the circular building which hosts a night club, and the ''Teatro Nuovo'', a theatre mostly focused on ballets exhibitions. Another  building is the largest synagogue of the city, located in ''Piazzetta Primo Levi'' square. Its architecture stands in the main sight of the city, as characterised by four large towers – {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=off}} high – topped by four onion-shaped domes.

=== Crocetta ===
[[File:MonumentoVittorioEmanueleII.JPG|thumb|right|''Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II'']]
[[File:Politecnico Torino.JPG|thumb|right|[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Turinese Institute of Technology ''Politecnico'']]]]
[[File:Boulevard Spina Centrale Torino.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Spina Centrale'' is a new under-construction boulevard built over the undergrounded railway. It is already completed in ''Crocetta'']]

South of ''Centro'' stands the ''Crocetta'' district, considered one of the most exclusive districts of the city, because of highly rated residential buildings. At the heart of the district is the partially pedestrianized area crossed by ''Corso Trieste'', ''Corso Trento'' and ''Corso Duca D'Aosta'', plenty of some notable residential buildings in eclectic, neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau style. The area was built between 1903 and 1937 replacing the old [[parade ground]], which was moved in the Southern part of the city.

North of this area stands the ''GAM (Galleria d'Arte Moderna)'', one of the two Museum of Modern Arts of the Turin Metro area (the second and largest one is hosted in ''Castello di Rivoli'', a former Savoy Royal castle in the suburbs). The Museum stands in front a huge monument situated in the centre of the roundabout between ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'' and ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'': the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II (Turin)|Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]], a King of Savoy statue situated on a 39-meters high column. Next to the Museum, another significant residential building previously hosted the head office of [[Juventus]], one of the two main Turin football clubs.

West of this area, the main building of [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] stands along ''Corso Duca Degli Abruzzi''. The 1958 building, a {{convert|122,000|m2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} complex, hosts approximately 30,000 students and is considered one of the major Institutes of Technology of the country – mainly due to the vocation of the city for the industrialization, pushed by the automotive sector. This institute recently expanded in the western district of ''Cenisia'' with additional modern buildings.

Crocetta is crossed by large and modern avenues, such as ''Corso Duca degli Abruzzi'', ''Corso Galileo Ferraris'', and ''Corso Einaudi''. These avenues feature long rows of trees, symbolic of Turin's typical urbanity. However, the most popular avenue is ''Corso De Gasperi'', which, albeit smaller than other avenues of the district, hosts one of the most fashionable open markets of the city, the so-called ''Mercato della Crocetta'', in which it is possible to find some discounted branded clothing among the more popular ones.

The Western border of Crocetta is instead an example of contemporary architecture. The huge avenue, made up of ''Corso Mediterraneo'' and ''Corso Castelfidardo'', is part of ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard and was recently built over the old railway (now undergrounded): as a result, the avenue is very large (up to {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}) and modern, having been rebuilt with valuable materials, including a characteristic lighting system supported by white high poles. This avenue hosts some examples of contemporary art, such as [[Mario Merz]]'s ''Igloo'' fountain or the [[Per Kirkeby]]'s ''Opera per Torino'' monument in ''Largo Orbassano''.

The East side of the district is also known as ''Borgo San Secondo'' and was so named after the church of the same name standing in ''Via San Secondo'', a major street in the neighbourhood. This area is located near ''Porta Nuova'' railway station and is actually older than the rest of the district, featuring several apartment buildings from the late 19th century, to include the birthplace and home of author [[Primo Levi]] on Corso Re Umberto.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1989/01/19/my-house/&lt;/ref&gt; A local open market is held in ''Piazza San Secondo'' and along ''Via Legnano''. The market square also hosts the former washhouse and public baths of the neighbourhood, among the oldest examples of their kind in Turin (1905).

One of the main thoroughfares crossing Borgo San Secondo is ''Via Sacchi'', which serves as an ideal gate to the city centre: its Serlian arcades on the west side of the street (the east side is enclosed by ''Porta Nuova'' railway station service buildings) host some significant boutiques and hotels, such as the historic ''Pfatisch'' pastry shop and the ''Turin Palace Hotel'' (totally refurbished and reopened in 2015). South of ''Via Sacchi'', ''Ospedale Mauriziano'' is one of the ancient and major hospitals of the city. Going further southwards, it is possible to appreciate an interesting residential cluster of old public housing gravitating around ''Via Arquata''.

=== Cenisia ===

[[File:Turin, Italy…City scenes…'just lying around watching the people' (10831159354).jpg|thumb|left|The Piazza CNL, built during the fascist period (1935).]]
[[File:Aperitif for four.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Italian ''[[Aperitivo]]'']]

Bordered by ''Corso Castelfidardo'', ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Trapani'' and ''Corso Peschiera'', this small district is mainly significant for hosting the recent expansion of Turinese [[Institute of Technology]] ''[[Polytechnic University of Turin|Politecnico]]''. The expansion was possible after under-grounding the railway under ''Corso Castelfidardo'' and the subsequent disposal of the old buildings dedicated to the train maintenance present in this area (so called ''Officine Grandi Riparazioni'' or ''OGR''). ''Politecnico'' expanded its facilities through two huge overpass buildings over the avenue, linked to new buildings on the west side. This cluster of buildings forms an evocative square with a unique architectural style. The main building on the west side hosts a [[General Motors]] research centre, the ''General Motors Global Propulsion Systems'' (formerly known as ''General Motors Powertrain Europe''). ''Politecnico'' area extends till ''Via Boggio'' with further facilities hosted in the former ''OGR'' facilities. The Institute plans to further build new facilities in the current parking area.

North of ''Politecnico'' facilities, the main building of the ''OGR'' former cluster, which consists in three 180-meters long joint parallel buildings, became recently a big open space which hosts temporary exhibitions and during the hot seasons, its external spaces became a fashionable site to have a typical Italian ''[[aperitivo]]''.

North of ''OGR'', a former prison complex called ''Le Nuove'' is a significant example of old European prison building. The complex was built between 1857 and 1869 during the reign of Victor Emmanuel II. After being disposed of during the 1990s, the complex was changed into a museum and it is possible to visit its facilities.

An example of contemporary art is the  heating plant in ''Corso Ferrucci'', which has been covered with aluminium panels. Another building (19th century), now abandoned, is the former [[Westinghouse Brakes#Rail vehicles|Westinghouse]] factory of train brakes situated in ''Via Borsellino''.

The remaining part of the district is mainly formed by residential buildings with not significant architectural value. The district had its development mainly after the World War II, following the industrial development of the town – in particular, the expansion of [[Lancia]] automotive factories in the ''Borgo San Paolo'' neighbourhood, culminated in the construction of [[Palazzo Lancia]] in 1954, the company's former headquarters. Industrialization led to consequent population growth in the nearby areas, including ''Cenisia''. Main avenues which are crossing the district are ''Corso Ferrucci'' and ''Corso Racconigi''. This last one is hosting a huge daily open market, the ''Mercato di Corso Racconigi''.

=== Cit Turin ===
[[File:Palazzo della Vittoria - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Casa della Vittoria'' (1918-1920) is an example of Turin's neo-gothic architecture.]]

The smallest district of the city is ''Cit Turin'' ("Little Turin" in [[Piedmontese language]]). This small triangle surrounded by ''Corso Vittorio Emanuele II'', ''Corso Francia'' and ''Corso Inghilterra'' hosts some high rated residential buildings and is regarded as a prestigious residential neighbourhood by local people.

[[File:Grattacielo Intesa San Paolo - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Intesa Sanpaolo]] banking group headquarters]]

The district features many buildings in [[Art Nouveau]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Neo-Gothic]] style. Among them, one of the most impressive and well-known is the ''Casa Della Vittoria'' (architect ''Gottardo Gussoni''). Another notable example is [[Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur]]. Both buildings face Corso Francia.

The district is well known for its commercial vocation mainly in its two main streets, ''Via Duchessa Jolanda'' and ''Via Principi d'Acaja'', ideally crossing each other among the gardens ''Giardino Luigi Martini'', locally called ''Piazza Benefica'', which hosts a popular open market.

The district is also characterised by two massive recent buildings: the ''Palazzo di Giustizia'', Turin's new courthouse built in the 1990s (in a 350-metre long facility), and the first real skyscraper of Turin, the [[Torre Intesa Sanpaolo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world.intesasanpaolo.com/en/call_to_action/intesa-s-turin-tower-is-named-one-of-the-10-most-environmentally-friendly-new-buildings-in-the-world|title=Intesa’s Turin tower is named one of the 10 most environmentally friendly new buildings in the world – Intesa Sanpaolo World|author=|date=|work=intesasanpaolo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which house the headquarters of one of the major Italian private banks.

=== San Donato ===
[[File:Torino-CampanileChiesaDiNostraSignoradelSuffragio.png|thumb|upright=0.7|''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'']]
[[File:Torre littoria Torino.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Torre Littoria]]]]

''San Donato'' district is located between ''Corso Francia'', ''Corso Lecce'', ''Corso Potenza'', ''Via Nole'', the ''Parco Dora'' and ''Corso Principe Oddone''. It was populated since the medieval era, but becomes bigger during the 19th century, prospering around the canal ''Canale di San Donato'', which does not exist any more, currently replaced by the central street of the district, ''Via San Donato''. Buildings in the district are relatively recent (around 1820), except for the oldest group of small houses located in the area of ''Brusachœr'' (''Palazzo Forneris'' building) located along ''Via Pacinotti'' near the small ''Piazza Paravia''. The conservation of the street and of this old building influences the straightness of ''Via San Donato'', which makes a slight curve to result in parallel with ''Via Pacinotti'' before ending in central ''Piazza Statuto ''square.

Main church of the district is the ''Chiesa di Nostra Signora del Suffragio e Santa Zita'', which with its {{convert|83|m|ft|abbr=off}} height of its bell tower, is well known to be the fifth tallest structure in the city of Turin, after the [[Mole Antonelliana]], the [[Intesa Sanpaolo|Intesa-Sanpaolo skyscraper]], the [[Torre Littoria]] and the two pennons of the [[Juventus Stadium]]. The church is hosting the ''Istituto Suore Minime di Nostra Signora del Suffragio'' and it was promoted and designed by [[Francesco Faà di Bruno]]. The legend says, that he wanted to build the tallest bell tower of the town and put a clock on the top, to all the poor people to know the time for free. The small building near the church, is what remains of ''Casa Tartaglino'', a small residential building which was also extended and modified by Faa di Bruno.

''Villino Cibrario'' in ''Via Saccarelli'' is another significant building designed by Barnaba Panizza in 1842. The building was equipped with a large garden which was eliminated to host the street. The neighbourhood has a high concentration of historic buildings in Art Nouveau style designed by architect Pietro Fenoglio (among the others, the prestigious ''Villino Raby'' in Corso Francia 8). Other significant buildings are the  ''Villa Boringhieri'' in Via San Donato, and other Art Nouveau and Neo-Gothic buildings are situated in ''Via Piffetti ''and ''Via Durandi.''

Among the modern buildings of the district, the most significant one is of course the ''Torre BBPR'' Tower (which took the name from the architecture office who designed it). The building is representing the ''post-rationalism Italian architecture'' (same style of the better known [[Torre Velasca]] tower in the city of Milan). Tower is facing the central ''Piazza Statuto'' square.
District is crossed by some significant avenues: on ''Corso Svizzera'', which crosses the district from North To South, faces the Business Centre ''Piero Della Francesca'', where the offices of ''Tuttosport,'' one of the three national sports daily newspapers has its head offices. Also on ''Corso Svizzer''a, stands one of the oldest hospitals of the city, the ''Ospedale Amedeo di Savoia'', specialised in infectious diseases. Other major avenues are ''Corso Umbria'' and ''Corso Tassoni''.

Another big avenue, which border the district on its East, is ''Corso Principe Oddone'', which in the past was along the railway to Milan. Currently the railway has been under-grounded: the avenue will be enlarged and have same architecture style of southern ''Corso Inghilterra'' in downtown, becoming one of the major avenue of Turin.
Northern part of the district was part of the former industrial district of Turin, recently reconverted to a park called ''Parco Dora''. Mainly, in ''San Donato'' the portion reconverted was the one occupied by the plant of [[Michelin]] (west of ''Via Livorno'') and [[Fiat|FIAT]] ironwork plants (on the East). Differently for other portions of ''Parco Dora'', this part has been totally reconverted to park without letting any evidence of the industrial area except for the cooling tower which stands along ''Corso Umbria'' and became a symbol of the park. Works are completed in the western area, where ''Corso Mortara'' has been closed to traffic and moved just a bit northern and covered by an artificial tunnel. It is possible to access the southern shore of the ''Dora'' river. South of the Park, an interesting architecture of different levels is hosting a new shopping mall called ''Centro Commerciale Parco Dora''. East of ''Via Livorno'', works are still partially in progress, with the Dora river still to be uncovered by a big slab, on which the [[Fiat|FIAT]] plants used to stand). West of ''Via Livorno'', the ''Environment Park'' is a research centre for renewable energy.

=== Aurora ===
[[File:BorgoDora.JPG|thumb|right|Tiny streets of ''Borgo Dora'']]

''Aurora'' is one of the most ancient districts which developed out of the medieval [[Defensive wall|city walls]], north of the historical city centre. It stretches from downtown northern boundaries in ''Corso Regina Margherita'' (an extended and important thoroughfare of Turin) up to ''Corso Vigevano'' and ''Corso Novara'' in the North Side (namely the old [[excise]] boundary till the early 20th century); the western boundary is ''Corso Principe Oddone'' (now part of the ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard) and the eastern border is the Dora river.

The district was named Aurora after the so-called ''cascina Aurora'', an old farmstead lying north of the Dora river, right at the intersection between ''Corso Giulio Cesare'' and ''Corso Emilia''. The farmstead has long been demolished and the area has been converted to office buildings, hosting the Turinese textile company ''Gruppo Finanziario Tessile'' (''GFT'') headquarters until the early 21st century.

The historical hub of the district is ''Borgo Dora'' (The "Dora Borough"), a small neighbourhood next to ''Porta Palazzo'' and enclosed by ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Via Cigna'', the Dora river and ''Corso Giulio Cesare''. Once known as ''Borgo del Pallone'' (literally "Ball Borough") or ''Balon'' in [[Piedmontese dialect]] ({{IPA-it|baˈlun|local}}), this neighbourhood is famous for its ''mercatino del Balon'' or simply ''Balon'', the Turinese [[flea market]] that opens every Saturday in its tiny and twisted streets. Borgo Dora hosts several remarkable places, such as: ''Piccola Casa della Divina Provvidenza'' ("Little House of the Divine Providence"), also known as ''Cottolengo'', a well-known charitable organization which has been operating for almost 200 years in the city; ''Arsenale della Pace'' ("Arsenal of Peace"), a former weapons factory that currently hosts the headquarters of ''SERMIG'' (''Servizio Missionario Giovani''), a nonprofit association which assists poor and homeless people; ''Caserma Cavalli'' ("Cavalli Barracks"), one of the most representative buildings of the district, a former barracks topped by a clock tower which now hosts ''Scuola Holden'', a storytelling and performing arts school; the evocative ''Cortile del Maglio'' ("Mallet Courtyard"), a covered pedestrian area featuring bars and clubs. Across from Cortile del Maglio and Arsenale della Pace stands a wide pedestrian area which features a [[hot air balloon]], a clear allusion to the neighbourhood's old name ''Balon'': recently installed, the balloon is open to public which can now take an interesting view of the city from this new high observation point.

Right at the borders of Borgo Dora stands part of ''Porta Palazzo'' open market which hosts the [[New Exhibition Hall (Turin)|New Exhibition Hall]], designed by the Italian architect [[Massimiliano Fuksas]]. The building has replaced the ''Clothes Market'', one of the four covered pavilions of Porta Palazzo market, but unfortunately this glass green-shaded building has been highly criticized because of its lack of usability for commercial activities, albeit an example of contemporary architecture.

Another interesting building at the borders of the neighbourhood is [[Torino Porta Milano railway station|Porta Milano]] (a.k.a. ''stazione della Ciriè-Lanzo''), a former 19th century railway station that marked the terminus of Ciriè-Lanzo railway line until the 1980s. To this day, the station is no longer in use as well as the rails up to ''Piazza Baldissera''. The station building was recently renovated and now hosts some old locomotives, even though it is not open to the public. Unfortunately, the old rails crossing the district are totally disused and neglected, adding decay to the whole area.

Borgo Dora, as many other pockets of Aurora, is characterized by the marked multi-ethnicity of its population, being home to a large community of immigrants from emerging countries.

West of Borgo Dora stands ''Rione Valdocco'' ("Valdocco neighbourhood"), enclosed by ''Via Cigna'', ''Corso Regina Margherita'', ''Corso Principe Oddone'' and the Dora river. This neighbourhood hosts the significant architecture of ''Santuario di Maria Ausiliatrice'' ("Maria Ausiliatrice Sanctuary") in the homonymous square and behind the church stands ''San Pietro in Vincoli'' old cemetery.

Overall, the main thoroughfares of the West side of Aurora are ''Via Cigna'', which crosses the district from North to South, ''Corso Vercelli'', a historical avenue starting north of the Dora river, and ''Corso Principe Oddone'', part of the long ''Spina Centrale'' boulevard that will be built over the undergrounded [[Turin-Milan railway]]. However, the Spina Centrale project is proceeding slowly because of the lack of funds and the boulevard is still occupied by a large worksite along its span. Once completed, Aurora district will be connected to Eastern ''San Donato'', thanks to a better connection among the roads of the two adjacent districts (i.e. ''Corso Ciriè'' will continue in ''Corso Gamba'' and ''Strada del Fortino'' in ''Corso Rosai'').

As for the rest of Aurora, the district is crossed by an important thoroughfare named ''Corso Giulio Cesare'', a long boulevard that extends from Porta Palazzo up to [[Autostrada A4 (Italy)|Turin-Trieste motorway]] entrance in the Northern urban fringe of Turin. Other significant roads are ''Corso Palermo'', ''Via Bologna'' and ''Corso Regio Parco'', mostly in the East side of Aurora which is known as ''Borgo Rossini'' ("Rossini Borough"). Albeit not a road, the Dora river is also a significant element for the whole district, since it completely crosses it from West to East.

[[File:Caffè corretto (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lavazza]], famous Turin coffee brand]]

The area north of the river features a mix of old residential buildings and remains of former factories and facilities from the 20th century. An example are the remains of [[FIAT]] ''Officine Grandi Motori'' (''OGM'') in Corso Vigevano, an old factory that produced big industrial and automotive Diesel engines, a sort of symbol of the industrial history of Turin. Another disused facility is ''Astanteria Martini'' ("Martini Emergency Department") in Via Cigna, a former emergency department from the 1920s which has been lying vacant since long.

As for the old residential buildings of the area, this part of Aurora hosts the oldest [[public housing]] block of the city, built by ''Istituto Autonomo Case Popolari'' (''IACP'') in 1908 in lieu of an old dilapidated small farm once known as ''Chiabotto delle Merle''.

Despite its run down look, the famous [[Lavazza]] coffee company, along with ''IAAD'' School of Design, chose this part of the city as the location for their new headquarters, which will be built in a contemporary building dubbed ''Nuvola'' ("Cloud") right at the borders of ''Borgo Rossini''. Designed by the architect Gino Zucchi, this project is still a work in progress but excavations in the area revealed the remains of a medieval cemetery and an early Christian basilica; these findings will be preserved and will be shown to the public.

''Borgo Rossini'' hosts a number of businesses, for instance the ''[[Kappa (company)|Robe di Kappa]]'' flagship store (Kappa is a noted Italian sportswear brand founded in Turin) and the ''Cineporto'' ("Cineport") a.k.a. ''La Casa dei Produttori'' ("The Filmmakers' House", which hosts the ''Turin Piedmont Film Commission Foundation'').

=== Vanchiglia ===
[[File:Torino, grattacielo della Regione Piemonte (03).jpg|right|thumb|[[Piedmont Region Headquarters]] (209 m), one of the tallest skyscrapers in Italy.]]
[[File:La Fetta di Polenta - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Fetta Di Polenta, northern side]]
''Vanchiglia'' is bordered by ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regio Parco'' and the Po river, crossed also by the [[Dora Riparia]] river and by two big avenues, ''Corso Regina Margherita'' and ''Corso Tortona''.

''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the historical district: a little triangle next to downtown, situated between ''Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regina Margherita'' and the [[Po (river)|Po]] river. The district is quite popular nowadays because being quite closer to the heart of Turin nightlife ''Piazza Vittorio Veneto,'' many bars and restaurants opened recently in this area. However, Vanchiglia also includes the area called ''Vanchiglietta'', north of ''Borgo Vanchiglia''.

Notable church in ''Borgo Vanchiglia'' is the French neo-Gothic ''Chiesa di Santa Giulia'' situated into ''Piazza Santa Giulia''.

A notable and unusual building in the area is the so-called ''"Fetta di Polenta"'' (literally: "[[polenta]] slice"), formerly known as ''Casa Scaccabarozzi.'' This building is located at the intersection of ''Corso San Maurizio'' and ''Via Giulia di Barolo'', and it is one of the most peculiar examples of Turin architecture: a thin trapezoid 27 meters wide on ''Via Giulia Di Barolo'', 5 meters on ''Corso San Maurizio'' and just 0.70 meters wide on the topposite end. It was designed in 1840 by [[Alessandro Antonelli]] for his wife, Francesca Scaccabarozzi, probably because of a bet. The curious name comes from the shape of the palace, which resembles a "slice of polenta", and also because it is painted with an ocher color.

In the surroundings, in ''Via Vanchiglia 8'', (although in downtown and not really in ''Vanchiglia'' anymore) there is another trapezoid house, albeit with less extreme design: similarly, this building is nicknamed ''"Fetta di Formaggio"'' (cheese slice), built in 1832 for the rich ''Marchese Birago di Vische'' by the architect ''Antonio Talentino''.

Other notable buildings are the town public baths, eclectic building built in 1905 (''Corso Regina Margherita'' crossing ''Via Vanchiglia''), and the''Teatro della Caduta'' theatre, opened in 2003 in ''Via Michele Buniva 23'', which with its 45 seats is the smallest theater in Turin and among the smallest theatres in Europe.

In Corso Regina Margherita, another notable building is the former ''Opera pia Reynero'', a charitable organization. The building was built in 1892. Being abandoned for a long time after it closed in 1996, it was then occupied by the Askatasuna Social Center, a non-profit anarchic organization, hosting since then various activities such as concerts, dinners, seminars and homeless solidarity initiatives.
[[File:Campus Luigi Einaudi Torino - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|upright=2.8|Campus Luigi Einaudi]]
North of ''Corso Regina Margherita'', district is losing the flavour and architecture typical of Turin downtown, cause a significant portion of the district was formerly occupied by factories, nowadays partially abandoned or replaced by modern buildings. A significant example was the area occupied by gas companies between Corso Regina Margherita and the Dora river, which were partially demolished to make place to the new modern Faculty of Law building (Campus "Luigi Einaudi"), designed by the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]]. This building was classified by the American television company CNN among the 10 most spectacular university buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/spectacular-university-buildings/index.html|title=10 of the world's most spectacular university buildings to impress travelers|date=19 February 2014|work=CNN Travel|access-date=10 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the campus courtyard, a large wood statue representig a bull (symbol of Turin) has been erected by [[Mario Ceroli]]. The area hosts also a student campus.

Next to the campus, a new cycling and pedestrian bridge on the Dora river was opened on 16 April 2010, linking the campus area to ''Corso Verona.'' Bridge is entitled to the architect ''Franco Mellano''.

''Parco Colletta'' is a big park area touched by the two rivers of the district, which also hosts some sport facilities, mainly football fields and a swimming pool.

District is completed by the ''Cimitero Monumentale'' cemetery. This huge complex (formerly known as ''Cimitero Generale'') is the largest cemetery in Turin, and among the first in Italy for the number of buried people (over 400,000). It is located close to the ''Colletta'' park. The ancient part of the cemetery rises from the main entrance of Corso Novara with his octagonal shape. It contains numerous historical tombs and 12&amp;nbsp;km of arcades, enriched by artistic sculptures (that's why is called "monumental cemetery"). Over the years there have been subsequent extensions of the central historical body in the direction of the Colletta park. In the cemetery there is a crematory temple built in 1882, the second largest in Italy after that of Milan one.

=== Main churches ===
[[File:Duomo Torino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turin Cathedral]] featuring the [[Sindone Chapel|Chapel of the Holy Shroud]].]]
[[File:Basilica di superga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basilica of Superga]].]]
{{See also|List of places of worship in Turin}}
The [[Santuario della Consolata]], a sanctuary much frequented by pilgrims, stands on the site of the 10th-century Monastery of St. Andrew, and is a work by Guarini. It was sumptuously restored in 1903. Outside the city are: the [[Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin|Basilica of Our Lady, Help of Christians]] built by St. [[John Bosco]], the [[Gran Madre di Dio, Turin|Gran Madre]] built in 1818 on occasion of the return of King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia]] and [[Monte dei Cappuccini, Turin|Santa Maria del Monte]] (1583) on Monte dei Cappuccini.

In the hills overlooking the city, the [[Basilica of Superga]] provides a view of Turin against a backdrop of the snow-capped Alps. The basilica holds the tombs of many of the dukes of Savoy, as well as many of the kings of Sardinia. Superga can be reached by means of the [[Superga Rack Railway]] from Sassi suburb. The Basilica of Superga was built by [[Amadeus II of Savoy]] as an ex voto for the liberation of Turin (1706), and served  as a royal mausoleum since 1772.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Turin |title=Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Turin – Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villas, parks and gardens ===

[[File:Borgomedievale sul PO.jpg|thumb|The medieval village in [[Parco del Valentino|Valentino Park]].]]
[[File:Area dei Laghi.jpg|thumb|[[La Mandria Regional Park]].]]

The most popular park in the city is [[Parco del Valentino]]. In 1961, during the celebrations of ''Italia61'' ([[Italian unification]] centenary), an important international exhibition (''FLOR61: Flowers of the world in Turin'') took place in the park with 800 exhibitors from 19 countries. For the occasion the plan for the new lighting of the park, along with its fountains and paths, was assigned to Guido Chiarelli, the head engineer at the city hall.

Other large parks are ''Parco della Pellerina'', ''Parco Colletta'', ''Parco Rignon'', ''Parco Colonnetti'' and the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino|University botanical gardens]]. Around the city, there are several other parks, such as [[La Mandria Regional Park]] and the [[Parco naturale di Stupinigi|Parco della Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi]], once hunting grounds of the Savoy, and those situated on the hill of Turin. Many parks are smaller, located in the various districts: there is also a total of 240 playgrounds in these parks. In the early 1960s, mayor [[Amedeo Peyron]] had the first garden in Italy with games for children inaugurated. According to a [[Legambiente]] report from 2007, Turin is the first Italian city as far as structures and policies on childcare are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legambientepiemonte.it/doc/05-01-07% 20com% 20St% 20ecosistema% 20bambino% 202007.pdf Ecosystem child. Report Legambiente |]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous parks featuring a children's playground is ''Parco della Tesoriera'', which is also home to ''Andrea della Corte Municipal Music Library''; this facility is housed in a villa built in 1715 and was once the Royal Treasurer's residence. The park is located in Parella suburb (Turin's West Side) and it plays host to various concerts in summer.

[[Rosa Vercellana]], commonly known as ''Rosina'' and, in [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] as ''La Bela Rosin'' ("the beautiful Rosin"), was the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and later wife of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]. She was made Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, but never Queen of Italy. As the Savoy family refused to allow her to be buried next to her husband in the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], her children had a mausoleum built for her in a similar form and on a smaller scale in Turin, next to the road to the Castello di Mirafiori. The circular copper-domed [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] monument, surmounted by a [[Latin cross]] and surrounded by a large park, was designed by [[Angelo Dimezzi]] and completed in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piemontefeel.org/en/interesse/elemento-206.html ‘Mausoleo della Bela Rosin’], ''Piemontefeel'' (Regione Piemonte, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parks"&gt;[http://www.parks.it/parco.po.to/pun.torinese.html ‘Parco fluviale del Po tratto torinese: Punti di Interesse’], Parks.it (Rome: Federazione Italiana Parchi e Riserve Natural).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museo Egizio di Torino-631 o.jpg|thumb|right|The inside of the [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum]], the second largest in the world after the one in Cairo.]]

The [[Museo Egizio|Egyptian Museum of Turin]] specialises in archaeology and anthropology, in particular the [[Art of ancient Egypt|Art of Ancient Egypt]].

Other museums include the [[National Museum of Cinema]], the [[Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile]], the [[Museum of Human Anatomy Luigi Rolando]], the Museo delle Marionette (puppet museum) and the Museo Nazionale della Montagna (National Museum of the Mountains).

The city is home to the well-known [[Shroud of Turin]]: a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in the city centre. The origins of the shroud and its image are still the subject of intense debate among scientists, theologians, historians and researchers. It is popularly believed to be a depiction of [[Jesus Christ]], however this matter is still controversial, as there seems to be a sufficient amount of historical and scientific evidence supporting the idea that it is, or is not, the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]. Nonetheless, it is a symbol of [[Catholic devotion|religious devotion]] and is one of the city's main symbols and tourist attractions.

After it had been little more than a town for a long time, in 1559 the Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]] of Savoy made Turin the capital of his domains. The Duke had ambition to transform the city into a major artistic and cultural capital, and in the following centuries numerous  artists were to work at the Savoy court, especially architects and planners like [[Carlo di Castellamonte]] and his son [[Amedeo Castellamonte|Amedeo]], [[Guarino Guarini]] and, in the 18th century, [[Filippo Juvarra]] and [[Benedetto Alfieri]].

[[File:Palazzo Madama, Torino (9).JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama e Casaforte degli Acaja]]]]
As for the painting and the visual arts, Turin became a point of reference, especially in the 20th century. In the 1920s, the painter [[Felice Casorati (painter)|Felice Casorati]] inspired a number of students called [[The group of six of Turin]] and these included [[Carlo Levi]], [[Henry Paolucci]], [[Gigi Chessa]], [[Francis Menzio]], [[Nicola Galante]] and [[Jessie Boswell]]. Artists  born in Turin include the sculptor [[Umberto Mastroianni]] and the architect [[Carlo Mollino]]. Between the 1960s and the 1970s, the international centre of Turin ([[Arte Povera]]), the presence in the city of artists like [[Alighiero Boetti]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Giuseppe Penone]], [[Piero Gilardi]] and [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]].

=== The Opera Houses ===
One of these was [[Teatro Regio di Torino]] where Puccini premiered his ''[[La Bohème]]'' in 1896. It burned down in 1936 and was rebuilt after WW II.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Biblioteca Nazionale di Torino.jpg|thumb|right|National Library]]
A literary centre for many centuries, Turin began to attract writers only after the establishment of the court of the [[House of Savoy|Dukes of Savoy]]. One of the most famous writers of the 17th century was [[Giambattista Marino]], which in 1608 moved to the court of [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy|Charles Emmanuel I]]. Marino suffered an assassination attempt by a rival, [[Gaspare Murtola]], and was later imprisoned for a year because of gossip that he had said and written against the duke. Perhaps, because of this, in 1615 Marino left Turin and moved to France.

The main literary figures during the Baroque age in Turin were [[Emanuele Tesauro]] and [[Alessandro Tassoni]]. In the next century Torino hosted the poet [[Vittorio Alfieri]] from Asti for a while. The situation was very different in the 19th century, especially since the city became a point of reference for Italian unification and, subsequently, the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Indeed, in those years Tommaseo, Settembrini and [[John Meadows (author)|John Meadows]] resided in the city. A major literary and cultural woman of that time was [[Olimpia Savio]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Turin was home to writers such as [[Guido Gozzano]], [[Edmondo De Amicis]], [[Emilio Salgari]] and Dino Segre, the latter known by the pseudonym of [[Pitigrilli]].
[[File:IB teatro regio.jpg|thumb|right|Teatro Regio]]
Turin had a very important role in Italian literature after World War II. For the publishing house founded by [[Giulio Einaudi]]  worked figures such as [[Cesare Pavese]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Vitaliano Brancati]], [[Primo Levi]], [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Fernanda Pivano]], [[Beppe Fenoglio]], [[Carlo Fruttero]] and [[Franco Lucentini]]. In more recent years, writers active in the city are [[Giovanni Arpino]], [[Nico Orengo]], [[Giuseppe Culicchia]], [[Margherita Oggero]], [[Laura Mancinelli]], [[Alessandra Montrucchio]], [[Alessandro Perissinotto]], [[Guido Quartz]], [[Piero Soria]] and [[Alessandro Baricco]]. Baricco was also among the founders of the [[Scuola Holden]], dedicated to writing techniques teaching.

In the local [[Piedmontese language]] has a literary tradition, with names such as [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Ignas Isler]], author of epic poems, and [[Eduard Calv]].

The [[Juventus Stadium]] hosted the [[2014 UEFA Europa League Final]]. This was the first time the city hosted a seasonal UEFA club competition's single-match final.

Torino F.C. was founded by the union of one of the oldest football teams in Turin, [[Football Club Torinese]] (founded in 1894), with breakaways from Juventus and was the most successful team, called "Grande Torino", in the [[Serie A]] during the 1940s. In 1949, in the [[Superga air disaster]], a plane carrying almost the whole team crashed into the [[Basilica of Superga]] in the Turin hills.
Torino currently plays its home games at the [[Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio Olimpico "Grande Torino"]], named after the team of the 1940s, which was the host stadiums for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]] and the venue of the [[2006 Winter Olympics|XX Winter Olympics]]; moreover the team recently rebuilt the historic [[Stadio Filadelfia]], used for games of the youth teams and trainings of the first squad, and seat of the team museum.

The city hosted the final stages of the [[EuroBasket 1979]]. The most important [[basketball]] club team is the [[Auxilium Pallacanestro Torino|Auxilium Torino]], refounded in 2009, playing in the Italian [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]].

=== Cinema ===
 [[File:Mole Antonelliana from Piazza Statuto.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The ''[[Mole Antonelliana]]'']]
Turin is the Italian city where film [[History of chromatography|chromatography]] was first established. As such, it forms the birthplace of [[Italian cinema]]. Because of its historic, geographical and cultural proximity to France, Italian filmmakers were naturally influenced by [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] and the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]]. The first Italian cinema screening occurred in Turin in March 1896. In November 1896, Italian filmmakers performed the first cinema screening of a film before a fee-paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaniaci.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=38 |title="Le proiezioni cinematografiche a Torino" – di Pierluigi Capra |publisher=Cinemaniaci.it |date=|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 20th century (especially after 1907), a number of the first Italian films were aired in Turin. Examples include [[Giovanni Pastrone]] ''[[Cabiria]]'', in 1914, one of the first [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] in history.

The Turin-based company [[Ambrosio Film]], established in 1906 by [[Arturo Ambrosio]], was one of the leading forces in Italian cinema and boosted the importance of the city as a filmmaking destination. The company, noted in particular for its historical epics, produced a large number of films until it was dissolved in 1924.

During the 1920s and 30s, Turin hosted a number of film productions and major film studios (''film houses''), such as the [[Itala film]], [[Aquila (studio)|Aquila]] and [[Fert Studios]]. Today their heritage is located in the modern [[Lumiq Studios]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lumiq.com|title=Lumiq.com|author=|date=|work=lumiq.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222940/http://www.lumiq.com/|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virtual Reality Multi Media Spa]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrmmp.it|title=Vrmmp – Notizie e guide online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/torinoplus/italiano/portrait/novecento.html |title=Torino nel Novecento, Torino |publisher=Comune.torino.it |date=|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turin's prominence in Italian film continued until 1937, the year [[Cinecittà]] was inaugurated in Rome.

After World War II, the cinematic scene in Turin continued to thrive. 1956 saw the opening of the [[National Museum of Cinema]], first housed in the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] and then, from 2000, in the imposing headquarters of the [[Mole Antonelliana]]. In 1982 the film critic [[Gianni Rondolino]] created Festival Internazionale Cinema Giovani,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofilmfest.org/?action=history&amp;id=1 |title=TFF |publisher=Torinofilmfest.org |date=25 September 1982 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later became the [[Torino Film Festival]].

Today Turin is one of the main cinematographic and television centres in Italy, thanks to the role of the [[Turin Film Commission]] that reports the production of many feature films, soap operas and commercials.

Turin streets were  the locations where [[Audrey Hepburn]] played ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'', [[Michael Caine]] drove a Mini Cooper in ''[[The Italian Job]]'', [[Claudio Bisio]] becomes the president of the Italian Republic, [[Carlo Verdone]] set his version of ''[[Cinderella (2013 film)|Cinderella]]'', [[Marco Tullio Giordana]] shot ''[[Piazza Fontana: The Italian Conspiracy]]'', [[Woody Allen]] shot ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', [[Cate Blanchett]] played ''[[Heaven (2002 film)|Heaven]]'', [[Giovanna Mezzogiorno]] ''[[Vincere]]'', [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] ''[[The Sunday Woman (film)|The Sunday Woman]]'', and [[Harvey Keitel]] ''[[The Stone Merchant]]''. Turin also became the capital of the tsar for ''[[The Demons of St. Petersberg]]''.

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Gianduiotti.jpg|thumb|The iconic ''[[Gianduiotto]]'']]
[[File:Bicerin.jpg|thumb|''[[Bicerin]]'' served in its trademark rounded glass]]

Turin chocolate firms, aside from many kinds of chocolate, produce a typical chocolate called ''[[Gianduiotto]]'', named after [[Gianduja (commedia dell'arte)|Gianduja]], a local [[Commedia dell'arte]] mask. Moreover, the city is also known for the so-called ''[[bicerin]]'', a traditional hot drink made of [[espresso]], [[drinking chocolate]] and [[whole milk]] served layered in a small rounded glass. Every year Turin organizes ''CioccolaTÒ'', a two-week chocolate festival run with the main Piedmontese chocolate producers, such as [[Pierre Paul Caffarel|Caffarel]], Streglio, [[Venchi]] and others, as well as some big international companies, such as [[Lindt &amp; Sprüngli]].

As for [[snack food]], the now popular [[Tramezzino|tramezzini]] were first served in a historic café of downtown Turin, namely ''Caffè Mulassano'', where they were devised in 1925 as an alternative to [[Cuisine of England|English]] [[tea sandwich]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/Torino/cmsSezioni/costume/200808rticoli/7805girata.asp |title=Il tramezzino è nato da Mulassano |newspaper=La Stampa |date=8 May 2008 |language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://lastampa.it/2013/11/04/societa/cucina/reportage/a-tavola/recensione/il-pranzo/qui-nato-il-tramezzino-e-si-sente-12q3K83mI7IQoam7Bsc44O/pagina.html |language=Italian |newspaper=La Stampa |title=Qui è nato il tramezzino e si sente |first=Rocco |last=Moliterni |date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, another trademark drink of the city is ''MoleCola'', an Italian [[Coca-Cola]] that entered production in 2012 and quickly spread both in Italy and outside its native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bevimolecola.it/la-storia/ |title=La Storia – Molecola |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |language=Italian |website=Bevimolecola.it |trans-title=History – Molecola |access-date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local cuisine also features a particular type of pizza, so-called ''[[Pizza#Italy|pizza al padellino]]'' or ''[[Pizza#Italy|pizza al tegamino]]'', which is basically a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in several Turin pizza places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrodolce.it/2014/04/03/torino-la-riscoperta-della-pizza-al-padellino/ |title=Torino: la riscoperta della pizza al padellino |publisher=Agrodolce |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gelapajo.it/pizza-al-padellino-che-cose/ |title=Pizza al padellino (o tegamino): che cos'è? |publisher=Gelapajo.it |accessdate=8 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210202900/http://www.gelapajo.it/pizza-al-padellino-che-cose/ |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/01/19/news/beniamino_il_profeta_della_pizza_gourmet-50867170/?refresh_ce |title=Beniamino, il profeta della pizza gourmet |publisher=Torino – Repubblica.it |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-1980s, Piedmont has also benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that have highlighted the rich agricultural and vinicultural value of the [[Po valley]] and [[northern Italy]].

:''Main page: [[:category:Education in Turin|Education in Turin]]''
[[File:Loggiato Università di Torino.jpg|right|235px|thumb|Hall of the Rectorate Palace of the University of Turin]]
Turin is home to one of Italy's oldest universities, the [[University of Turin]], including its affiliated [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]], which ranks among the best universities in the country. Another established university in the city is the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], ranking among Top 50 universities in the world and #1 in Italy in the fields of engineering, technology and computer science ("Academic Ranking of World Universities" published by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]). Turin also hosts the [[United Nations System Staff College]], the [[European Training Foundation]], and a campus of the [[ESCP Europe]] business school, ranked among the 10 best business schools in Europe. Moreover, the city hosts three small English language post-secondary institutions: [[St. John International University]], [[International University College of Turin]], and the  [[Turin School of Development]], as well as [http://www.buddies.it/ Buddies Elementary School].

== Transport ==
{{See also|Gruppo Torinese Trasporti|ToBike}}
[[File:Torino PortaSusa galleria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Porta Susa]] railway station]]
The city currently has a large number of rail and road work sites. Although this activity has increased as a result of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], parts of it had long been planned. Some of the work sites deal with general roadworks to improve traffic flow, such as underpasses and flyovers, but two projects are of major importance and will radically change the shape of the city.

One is the ''Spina Centrale'' ("Central Spine") project which includes the doubling of a major railway crossing the city, the [[Turin-Milan railway]] locally known as ''Passante Ferroviario di Torino'' ("Turin Railway Bypass"). The railroad previously ran in a trench, which will now be covered by a major boulevard running from North to South of Turin, in a central position along the city. [[Torino Porta Susa railway station|Porta Susa]], on this section, will become Turin's main station to substitute the terminus of [[Torino Porta Nuova railway station|Porta Nuova]] with a through station. Other important stations are [[Torino Stura railway station|Stura]], [[Torino Rebaudengo Fossata railway station|Rebaudengo]], [[Torino Lingotto railway station|Lingotto]] and [[Madonna di Campagna]] railway stations, though not all of them belong to the layout of the Spina Centrale.

[[File:MetroTorinoMassaua.jpg|thumb|right|Turin [[Massaua (Turin Metro)|Massaua]] metro station]]

The other major project is the construction of a subway line based on the [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] system, known as [[Turin Metro|Metrotorino]]. This project is expected to continue for years and to cover a larger part of the city, but its first phase was finished in time for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympic Games]], inaugurated on 4 February 2006 and opened to the public the day after. The first leg of the subway system linked the nearby town of [[Collegno]] with Porta Susa in Turin's city centre. On 4 October 2007 the line was extended to Porta Nuova and then, in March 2011, to Lingotto. A new extension of the so-called ''Linea 1'' ("Line 1") is expected in the near future, reaching both [[Rivoli, Piedmont|Rivoli]] (up to Cascine Vica hamlet) in the Western belt of Turin and ''Piazza Bengasi'' in the Southeast side of the city. Furthermore, a ''Linea 2'' is in the pipeline that will connect the south-western district of Mirafiori with Barriera di Milano in the north end. In June 2018, the project entered the public consultation phase with the proposed list of 23 stations published on the city’s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M2TO Progetto Premliminare della Linea 2|url=http://www.comune.torino.it/trasporti/bm%7Edoc/180626_ppt_invio.pdf|publisher=Citta di Torino|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Air Dolomiti E195 (8542367226) (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Turin Caselle Airport|Turin Caselle International Airport]]]]

The main street in the city centre, ''Via Roma'', runs atop a tunnel built during the fascist era (when ''Via Roma'' itself was totally refurbished and took on its present-day aspect). The tunnel was supposed to host the underground line but it is now used as an underground car park. A project to build an underground system was ready in the 1970s, with government funding for it and for similar projects in [[Milan]] and Rome. Whilst the other two cities went ahead with the projects, Turin's local government led by mayor Diego Novelli shelved the proposal as it believed it to be too costly and unnecessary.

The city has an international airport known as [[Turin Caselle Airport|Caselle International Airport]] [[Sandro Pertini]] (TRN), located in [[Caselle Torinese]], about {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} from the centre of Turin and connected to the city by a railway service (from Dora Station) and a bus service (from Porta Nuova and Porta Susa railway stations).

{{As of|2010}} a [[bicycle sharing system]], the [[ToBike]], is operational.

The metropolitan area is served by [[Turin metropolitan railway service]].

The [[Visigoths]] entered [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) in 415, and they rose to be the dominant people there until the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of 711 brought their kingdom to an end.

This period in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] art is dominated by their style. '''Visigothic art''' is generally considered in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world to be a strain of [[Migration art]], while the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking worlds generally classify it as [[Pre-Romanesque]].

Branches of Visigothic art include their [[architecture]], their crafts (especially jewellery), and even their [[Visigothic script|script]].

==Visigothic architecture==

The only remaining examples of their architecture from the 6th century are the church of [[San Cugat del Vallés]] in [[Barcelona]], the hermitage and church of [[Santa Maria de Lara]] in Burgos, [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in ([[Braga]]), the [[Igreja de São Gião|church of São Gião]] in ([[Nazaré (Portugal)|Nazaré]]) and the few remnants of the church at [[Cabeza de Griego]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]. However, their style developed over the next centuries, though the prime remaining examples of it are mostly rural and often run-down. Some of the characteristics of their architecture are:
* Generally [[basilica]]n in layout, sometimes a [[Greek cross]] plan or, more rarely, a combination of the two. The spaces are highly compartmentalised.
* Horseshoe [[arch]]es without [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]].
* A rectangular, exterior [[apse]].
* Use of [[column]]s and pillars with Corinthian [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of unique design.
* [[Barrel vault]]s with [[cupola]]s at the crosses.
* Walls of [[ashlar]] blocks, occasionally alternating with Roman brickwork.
* Decoration commonly of animal or plant motifs.

Exemplars include:
* [[Church of San Juan Bautista, Baños de Cerrato|Church of San Juan Bautista]] in [[Baños de Cerrato]] ([[province of Palencia]])
* [[Crypt of San Antolín (Palencia)|Crypt of San Antolín]] in the [[cathedral of Palencia]] ([[province of Palencia]])
