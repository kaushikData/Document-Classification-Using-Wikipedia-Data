The '''64DD''' is a magnetic disk drive peripheral for the [[Nintendo 64]] game console developed by [[Nintendo]]. It was originally announced in 1995, prior to the Nintendo 64's 1996 launch, and after numerous delays was finally released only in [[Japan]] on December 1, 1999. The "64" references both the Nintendo 64 console and the 64 MB storage capacity of the disks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Ultra 64 Tech Specs|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=14|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "DD" is short for "disk drive" or "dynamic drive".&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | first=Peer | last=Schneider | title=Everything About the 64DD | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/10/everything-about-the-64dd | publisher=IGN | date=February 9, 2001 | accessdate=June 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plugging into the extension port on the underside of the console, it allows the Nintendo 64 to use proprietary 64&amp;nbsp;MB [[magnetic disk]]s for expanded and rewritable data storage, a [[real-time clock]] for [[persistent world|persistent game world]] design, and a standard font and audio library for further storage efficiency. Furthermore, the 64DD's software titles and hardware accessories let the user create movies, characters, and animations to be used within various games and shared online. The system could connect to the Internet through a now-defunct dedicated online service called [[#Randnet|Randnet]] for [[e-commerce]],&lt;ref name="64DD at NOM 3"/&gt; [[Online console gaming|online gaming]], and media sharing.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises" /&gt; Calling it "the first writable bulk data storage device for a modern video game console",&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Reveals New Details on 64DD at N64 Developer's Conference | date=1997 | publisher=Nintendo of America | url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/64dd.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970606100126/https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/64dd.html | archivedate=June 6, 1997 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo designed the 64DD as an [[enabling technology]] platform for the development of new genres of games and applications,&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997" /&gt; dozens of which were in development for several years.

Only ten software titles were released until the unit was discontinued in February 2001. It was a [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]],&lt;ref name="Unrivaled Champion of the Fourth Generation"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627063043/http://gameconsoles.co.uk/game-consoles/snes/ | archivedate=June 27, 2008 | url=http://gameconsoles.co.uk/game-consoles/snes/ | website=GameConsoles.co.uk | title=Super Nintendo Entertainment System Unrivaled Champion of the Fourth Generation | date=2007 | accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least 15,000 total units sold&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The 64 Dream | magazine=The 64 Dream | date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another 85,000 units unsold.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Upon the decline of 64DD's commercial viability, most such software titles were either ultimately delivered on Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles like the [[GameCube]], or canceled altogether.

IGN summarized the 64DD as "an appealing creativity package"&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises" /&gt; "targeted at a certain type of user"&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN" /&gt; "that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience"—and a "limited online experiment at the same time", which partially fulfilled Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s "longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation".&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Development ===
With the 1993 announcement of its new Project Reality console, Nintendo explored options for data storage. A Nintendo spokesperson said in 1993 that "it could be a cartridge system, a CD system, or both, or something not ever used before."&lt;ref name="Billboard September 4, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nintendo, Silicon Graphics Team for Reality Check | first=Chris | last=McGowan |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=September 4, 1993 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;d#v=onepage&amp;q=silicon%20graphics&amp;f=false | page=89 | accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America said, "Right now, cartridges offer faster access time and more speed of movement and characters than CDs. So, we'll introduce our new hardware with cartridges. But eventually, these problems with CDs will be overcome. When that happens, you'll see Nintendo using CD as the software storage medium for our 64-bit system."&lt;ref name="Billboard: June 25, 1994"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UggEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=Howard%20Lincoln&amp;f=false | title=Billboard (June 25, 1994) | last=Gillen | first=Marilyn A. | publisher=Billboard | newspaper=Billboard | date=June 25, 1994 | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}}

In consideration of the 64DD's actual launch price equivalent of about {{US$|90}}, Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick warned, "We're very sensitive to the cost of the console. We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard to pull that off."&lt;ref name="Kasten Off"&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Kasten | first=Alex S. | title=Off-Computer | work=Emedia Professional | volume= 10 | issue= 3 | date=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD-ROM, Nintendo game designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] explained, "CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [cartridge] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres."&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt;

{{details|topic=the Nintendo 64's alternate storage strategies and the optimizations involved with cartridges|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}

The company also explored the forging of an early online strategy with Netscape, whose founding management had recently come directly from SGI, the company which had designed the core Nintendo 64 hardware.&lt;ref name="Remembering Netscape"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/07/25/8266639/index.htm | title=Remembering Netscape: The Birth Of The Web | magazine=Fortune | first=Adam | last=Lashinsky | date=July 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo's Internet Connection | date=December 13, 1996 | author=IGN Staff | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/12/14/nintendos-internet-connection | work=IGN | accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within its budding online strategy, Nintendo reportedly considered multiplayer online gaming to be of the highest priority, even above that of web browsing.&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"/&gt; Several third party game developers were developing prominent online gaming features based on 64DD, including Ocean's ''Mission: Impossible'' deathmatches&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"/&gt; and Seta's four-player war simulation.&lt;ref name="64DD Goes to War"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt; Nintendo would ultimately retain the core impetus of these ideas, but would drastically alter both plans over the following years, in favor of a floppy-based storage technology and the Randnet online software and service partner—although with no online multiplayer gaming support whatsoever.

===Announcement===
{{quote box | width=25% | align=right | quote=It would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N64 first came out. It’s getting harder to explain after the fact. (laughs) | source=— Nintendo designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt;}}
The 64DD was first announced at [[Nintendo]]'s 1995 [[Nintendo Space World|Shoshinkai]] trade show, at which time Nintendo said it would launch by the end of 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Nintendo's Lincoln Speaks Out on the Ultra 64! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=January 1996|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; although giving virtually no technical specifications yet.&lt;ref name="The Game is 64 Bits"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=Popular Mechanics | date=April 1996 | first=James K. | last=Willcox | title=The Game is 64 Bits | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;d | page=134 | accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, its first public appearance wasn't until Nintendo's 8th Shoshinkai show of November 22—24, 1996, where IGN reported that the device nicknamed "Bulky Drive"&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt; was one of the biggest items of the show.&lt;ref name="Report from Shoshinkai 96"&gt;{{cite web | title=Report from Shoshinkai | date=November 22, 1996 | author=IGN Staff | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/23/report-from-shoshinkai | accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln stated that the device had received its finalized hardware specifications and sported its own show booth. Nintendo's Director of Corporate Communications, Perrin Kaplan, made the company's first official launch window announcement for the peripheral, scheduled for late 1997 in Japan.&lt;ref name="Shoshinkai 96 at Nintendo.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo 64 Shoshinkai '96 | publisher=Nintendo of America | url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/show_frame.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961222150158/https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/show_frame.html | archivedate=December 22, 1996 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The 64DD: Nintendo's Disk Drive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD delay at GameSpot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoshinkai 1996 interview"&gt;{{ cite av media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZXA2pzrLlo | title=Nintendo SpaceWorld '96: Miyamoto Interview + Super Mario 64 on 64DD + Rumble Pak Unveiled | via=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly several developers attended the show to learn how to develop for 64DD, some having traveled from the US for the 64DD presentation and some having received 64DD development kits.&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"/&gt; The demonstration included an improvised disk conversion of the familiar ''Super Mario 64'' game to demonstrate the drive's operation and performance, and a graphics application mapping the audience's photographical portraits onto live 3D animated avatars—a feature which was ultimately incorporated and released in 2000 as ''[[Mario Artist: Talent Studio]]'' and the Capture Cassette.&lt;ref name="Shoshinkai 96 at Nintendo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HL at Shoshinkai N64.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=N64.com Interviews Howard Lincoln | date=December 6, 1996 | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/12/07/n64com-interviews-howard-lincoln | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included along with Enix in the early roster of committed 64DD developers, [[Rare (company)|Rare]] officially discounted any rumors of the peripheral's impending pre-release cancellation.&lt;ref name="Closing in on Shoshinkai"&gt;{{cite web | title=Closing in on Shoshinkai | date=November 15, 1996 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/16/closing-in-on-shoshinkai | publisher=IGN | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event featured ''Creator'', a music and animation game by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]],&lt;ref name="Creator and Mario Artist"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Zee 3 | title=Career timeline | url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/career_timeline.php#nintendo | accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same UK company that had made ''Sound Tool'' for the Nintendo Ultra 64 development kit. They touted the game's ability to be integrated into other games, allowing a player to replace any such game's textures and possibly create new levels and characters. There was no playable version of ''Creator'' available at this show, but the project was later absorbed into ''[[Mario Artist: Paint Studio]]''.&lt;ref name="Creator and Mario Artist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt; Nintendo also announced their plans to bundle the 64DD with a RAM expansion cartridge at the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Nintendo Unveils N64 Disk Drive |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the gaming press said the Shoshinkai show did not make as significant a 64DD reveal as Nintendo had promised, leaving the public still in the dark as far as the system's software lineup, practical capabilities, and release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Shoshinkai '97: Nintendo Gets in the Games|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997 |pages=18-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=Insert Coin|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1997|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The 64DD Gets Real|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=102|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1997|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zelda 64'' (eventually released as the cartridge game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'') was seen as the 64DD's potential [[killer app]] in the months following the system's unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Future Memory |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997|page=46 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NEXT_Generation_29#page/n46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3–4, 1997, Nintendo of America hosted a Developer's Conference in Seattle, Washington where a surprise overview was delivered by Nintendo Developer Support staff [[Mark DeLoura]] about the 64DD.&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt;

=== Delays ===

The 64DD is notable in part for its multi-year period of many repeated launch delays, which created an interdependent cascade of delays and complications of many other business processes and product launches for Nintendo and its partners.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imagineer profile at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Imagineer | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/companies/imagineer | accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DD Date?"/&gt;

On May 30, 1997, Nintendo issued a press conference announcing the first in what would become a series of the product's launch delays, saying it had been rescheduled to March 1998, with no comment on an American release schedule. At that time, the delays were reportedly attributed to the protracted development of both the disks and the drive technologies.&lt;ref name="64DD delay at GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Says 64DD Delayed | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-says-64dd-delayed/1100-2466742/ | publisher=GameSpot | first=Chris | last=Johnston | date=May 30, 1997 | accessdate=September 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=64DD-Layed |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=97 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1997|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1997, Nintendo and [[Alps Electric]] announced their manufacturing partnership for the still tentatively titled&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt; 64DD.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Alps 64DD"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Teams Up with Alps on 64DD | publisher=IGN | date=June 9, 1997 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/06/10/nintendo-teams-up-with-alps-on-64dd | accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | quote=We're hesitant to say [the status of the 64DD software lineup, but] if software doesn't come out consistently after we sell the 64DD, we'll be stuck.&lt;br&gt;Don't worry.

At the pre-[[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] press conference on June 18, 1997, the company lacked even a prototype unit to display while Howard Lincoln stated that the company wouldn't release the device until sufficient numbers of software titles support it.  Reportedly featuring at least twenty game titles in development including ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', the device still retained its projected Japanese launch window of March 1998, and received its first American launch window of early 1998.&lt;ref name="Donkey Kong 64 Jumps to DD"/&gt;  Also at the show, Nintendo's main game designer, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], speculated that the first games to be released for the new system would be ''[[SimCity 64]]'', ''[[Mario Artist]]'', ''[[Pokémon|Pocket Monsters]]'', and ''[[EarthBound 64|Mother 3]]''.&lt;ref name="npinterview"&gt;{{Cite interview | first1=Takao | last1=Imamura | first2=Shigeru | last2=Miyamoto | magazine=Nintendo Power |date=August 1997 | title=Pak Watch E3 Report "The Game Masters" | pages=104–105 | publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | quote=[Nintendo can't guarantee that the 64DD will launch in the US in 1998], but what we can say is that it will launch when it is ready and when we have a compelling piece of software for it.

In a December 1997 interview with Shigeru Miyamoto and [[Shigesato Itoi]], Miyamoto confessed the inherent difficulty in repeatedly attempting to describe and justify the long-promised potential of the mysterious peripheral to a curious public.  He said that it "would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N64 first came out. It’s getting harder to explain after the fact. (laughs)" To illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, Itoi said, "I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn’t have been allowed to come up with if we didn’t have the 64DD."  Miyamoto concluded, "Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we’ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we’ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game."&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"&gt;{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the "Big 2" (translated text) | url=http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ | magazine=The 64 Dream| subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91 | accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, IGN optimistically expected all major Nintendo 64 cartridge titles to have software support for an impending expansion disk.

On April 8, 1999, IGN announced Nintendo's latest delayed 64DD launch date as being June 1999.

By May 1999, the 64DD's launch was still withheld by the lack of completed launch software.&lt;ref name="64DD Makes an Appearance"/&gt;

As of August 1999's Space World event, Nintendo had set Randnet's launch date at December 1, 1999, but reportedly had not yet set a launch date for the 64DD.&lt;ref name="Inside Randnet"/&gt;

=== Launch ===

The 64DD was launched on December 1, 1999, in [[Japan]], as a package called the Randnet Starter Kit which includes six games bimonthly through the mail, and a year of Internet service.

Anticipating that its long-planned peripheral would become a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]], Nintendo initially sold the Randnet Starter Kit via mail order.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt; Later, very limited quantities of the standalone 64DD and games were made available through stores.

=== Discontinuation ===

The discontinuation of the 64DD and Randnet was announced in October 2000, at a time when there were reportedly 15,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"/&gt; The hardware and online platforms were both discontinued in February 2001. Only nine official disks, including three third-party games and one Internet application suite, were released for it. Most planned 64DD games were either released as cartridge-based Nintendo 64 games as cartridge storage sizes had increased, ported to other consoles such as Nintendo's next-generation [[GameCube]] console, or canceled entirely.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Nintendo designed the 64DD as an [[enabling technology]] for the development of new genres of games,&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt; which was principally accomplished by its three main design features: its dual storage strategy of cartridges and disks; its new [[real-time clock]] (RTC); and its Internet connectivity.&lt;ref name="Why Netscape Almost Never Happened"&gt;{{ cite web|title=Why Netscape Almost Never Happened |first=Emily |last=Rogers |date=July 13, 2012 |url=http://www.notenoughshaders.com/2012/07/13/why-netscape-almost-didnt-exist/ |publisher=Not Enough Shaders |accessdate=June 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314191929/http://www.notenoughshaders.com/2012/07/13/why-netscape-almost-didnt-exist/ |archivedate=March 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual storage strategy of the Nintendo 64 plus the 64DD combines the traditional high speed cartridges, which are low-capacity, non-writable, and expensive but very fast along with the introduction of proprietary mass storage disks, which are large-capacity, rewritable, and cheap but only moderately fast.

Though incompatible in every way with any other consumer electronics product, the 64DD's magnetic storage technology resembles the generic [[floppy disk]], and the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary [[Zip disk]] for personal computers.&lt;ref name="The 64DD: Nintendo's Disk Drive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What is the 64DD?"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is the 64DD? | publisher=IGN | date=September 17, 1997 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/18/what-is-the-64dd | accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being [[magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical]] technology, Nintendo's own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic.&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N64 Introductory Manual"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nintendo 64 Introductory Manual | date=March 1999 | publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. | url=http://n64.icequake.net/doc/n64intro/kantan/step1/index.html | accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks OoT 3D"/&gt;{{rp|5}}  Complementing their proprietary and [[Nintendo 64 Game Pak#Copy protection|copy-protected]] cartridge strategy, the proprietary 64&amp;nbsp;MB disk format was Nintendo's faster, more flexible, and [[copyright infringement|copy-protected]] answer to the commodity [[Compact disc|Compact Disc]] format, which is cheaper to produce but is much slower, read-only, and easier to [[PlayStation (console)#Copy protection|copy]] on personal computers. The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Sony]] [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game consoles can hold at least 650&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s (MB) of information with a peak 300&amp;nbsp;kB/s&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt; throughput and more than 200&amp;nbsp;[[Milisecond|ms]] seek speed. This compares to the Nintendo 64's [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]]'s 4 to 64&amp;nbsp;MB size and 5 to 50&amp;nbsp;MB/s&lt;ref name="N64 Programming Manual"/&gt; of low latency and instantaneous load times, and the 64DD's 64&amp;nbsp;MB disk size and 1&amp;nbsp;MB/s peak&lt;ref name="N64 Introductory Manual"/&gt; throughput with 75 ms average seek latency.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt; The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a 2x CD-ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many titles, in addition to a much higher production cost, testing cycle, and potential development time for all the potential extra content.&lt;ref name="F5 Interview Pt1"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Factor 5 Interview (Part I) | date=February 23, 1998 |first=Julian | last=Eggebrecht | subject-link=Julian Eggebrecht | interviewer=Peer Schneider | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/02/24/factor-5-interview-part-i | accessdate=January 13, 2015 | quote=We immediately liked the N64 because we didn't have to deal with CDs. You shouldn't underestimate what a battle it can be to make a CD game on the PlayStation. You have to fill it; you have to burn it — which takes an hour every time you want to see a new version of your game, you have to work around loading errors, and so on. CDs can be a real pain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of variable storage strategies, Nintendo determined that the development of ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' would be retargeted from 64DD disk format alone, to the much faster cartridge format, for performance reasons.&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks OoT 3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/ |title=Iwata Asks: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Similar in proportion of the historical comparison of [[Famicom Disk System]] floppy disks to early [[Famicom]] cartridges,&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"&gt;{{ cite web | title=Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/08/28/virtually-overlooked-mario-artist/ | date=August 28, 2008 | first=JC | last=Fletcher | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this disk format's initial design specifications had been set during a time frame when the initial Nintendo 64 cartridge size was 4&amp;nbsp;MB as with ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', and a 32&amp;nbsp;MB size eventually became popular over the years.  Nonetheless, the 64DD disk format would serve as significant storage size expansion upon its 1999 launch when 32&amp;nbsp;MB cartridges were the norm&lt;ref name="The 64DD: Nintendo's Disk Drive"/&gt; and on into future years when only three 64&amp;nbsp;MB cartridges would ever be released for Nintendo 64.  The medium's writability, up to 38&amp;nbsp;MB per disk,&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Nintendo 64: The Start of a Long Journey |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=30 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|page=53 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n54}}&lt;/ref&gt; would yield enduring benefits to game genre and social gaming like that of the Famicom Disk System.&lt;ref name="64DD at NWP"/&gt;

Many released Nintendo 64 cartridge games have been programmed to detect the presence of a 64DD drive and the game's corresponding optional expansion disk, most of which were never fully developed or ever released.  Without an expansion disk present, such a standalone game carries on.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt; Depending on the game's specific capabilities, these expansions can provide extra levels, minigames, and can store personal and [[user-generated content]].&lt;ref name="GPro92"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Nintendo 'Bulks' Up N64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=92 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1996|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any Nintendo 64 game which doesn't actively utilize the 64DD drive has potential access to only the few kilobytes of writable storage on the standard issue [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Controller Pak|Nintendo 64 Controller Pak]] and on some cartridges' internal battery backed storage, for storing only the player's basic progress and preferences.

In addition to writable storage, the real-time clock enables the existence of [[persistent world|persistent game worlds]] according to a real-world clock and calendar, backed by a battery even when the system's main power is shut off. Nintendo's lead game designer, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], said this of the four-year development of the ultimately unreleased pet breeding game ''[[Cabbage (canceled video game)|Cabbage]]'': "We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, can still raise the creature."&lt;ref name="64DD: The Games"&gt;{{cite web | title=64DD: The Games | date=January 29, 1998 | author=IGN Staff | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/01/30/64dd-the-games | accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabbage at IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/05/nintendo-still-cooking-cabbage |title=Nintendo Still Cooking Cabbage |publisher=IGN |date=April 4, 2000 |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modem cartridge is packaged with the system, allowing Internet connectivity through Randnet, in addition to the service's members-only portal sites.

The 64DD has a chip containing an enhanced font and audio [[Library (computing)|library]] for all software to share, further saving the potential available space of mass storage on cartridges and disks. The 64DD has a [[32-bit]] [[coprocessor]] to help it read disks and to transfer data to the main console. The main Nintendo 64 deck uses its [[RCP (chip)|RCP]] and [[NEC]] [[VR4300]] to process data from the top cartridge slot and the [[Input/output|I/O]] devices.  Like nearly all disc-based consoles, the 64DD can [[booting|boot]] up without a cartridge on the top deck, because it has a boot menu.  The 64DD is packaged with the 4&amp;nbsp;MB RAM [[Expansion Pak]], yielding a total of 8&amp;nbsp;MB.  The 64DD has its own [[software development kit]] that works in conjunction with the Nintendo 64 development kit.

===Accessories===
[[File:Nintendo-64-Memory-Expansion-Pak.jpg|thumb|The requisite 4MB RAM Expansion Pak is bundled with the 64DD.]]
The 64DD Randnet bundle includes a [[modem]] for connecting to the [[#Randnet|Randnet]] network and the 4MB RAM [[Expansion Pak]].

The Randnet service was accessible only via a Nintendo 64 and 64DD setup, and the 64DD hardware was only purchasable by Randnet subscribers — the peripheral was not stocked in any retail stores. The Randnet subscription service came bundled with the 64DD hardware and several games, purchased by filling out a mail order request form at select retail stores in Japan.&lt;ref name="64DD at NOM 2"&gt;{{cite web  | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/9911/05/index.html | issue=15 | title=Nintendo Online Magazine | work=Nintendo Online Magazine | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. | language=Japanese | accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was available in two tiers: a purchase plan for users who want to buy only the 64DD to add to their existing Nintendo 64 system, and a rent-to-own plan for those who want both the 64DD and a special edition translucent black Nintendo 64 console.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt; Randnet was launched with monthly payment plans for the service and hardware bundle: ¥2,500 (approximately {{US$|23.50}}) per month for the purchase plan and ¥3,300 ({{USD|31}}) per month for rent-to-own for the first year and ¥1,500 per month for Randnet service thereafter.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inside Randnet"&gt;{{cite web | title=Inside Randnet | date=August 27, 1999 | publisher=IGN | url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/9946.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105102040/http://ign64.ign.com/news/9946.html | archivedate=January 5, 2002 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD Pricing"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Announces DD Pricing Plan | publisher=IGN | date=October 21, 1999 | url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/11411.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417174726/http://ign64.ign.com/news/11411.html | archivedate=April 17, 2001 | accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD at NOM 3"&gt;{{cite web  | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/9911/03/index.html | issue=15 | title=Nintendo Online Magazine | work=Nintendo Online Magazine | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. | language=Japanese | accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service later eliminated the monthly payment model in favor of an annual prepaid model, at ¥30,000 ({{USD|290}}) for one year for outright purchase and ¥39,600 ({{USD|380}}) for the first year of rent-to-own.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt; The 64DD and some later games eventually became available for purchase directly at retail.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt;

As part of the subscription, the game disks were delivered not in the initial package but by mail on a schedule: December 1999 had ''Doshin the Giant'' and ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio''; February 2000 had ''Randnet Disk'', ''SimCity 64'', and ''Mario Artist: Talent Studio''; and April 2000 had ''F-Zero X Expansion Kit'' and ''Mario Artist: Polygon Studio''.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt;  The final Starter Kit subscription title ''Polygon Studio'' was suddenly delayed&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon Studio Lives"&gt;{{cite web | title=Polygon Studio Lives | date=June 26, 2000 | publisher=IGN | url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/21398.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010619000502/http://ign64.ign.com/news/21398.html | archivedate=June 19, 2001 | accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then released on August 29, 2000.

[[File:Nintendo-64-Mouse.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo 64 mouse is bundled only with the ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio'' game for 64DD.]]
One of the most substantial series of games to include Randnet support is the ''Mario Artist'' series, which allowed online users to swap their artwork [[User-generated content|creations]] with others. Contests and other special events occurred periodically. Papercraft was implemented by way of modelling the characters in ''[[Mario Artist: Polygon Studio]]'' and utilizing ''[[Mario Artist: Communication Kit]]'' to upload the model data to Randnet's online printing service. The user can then cut, fold, and adhere the resulting colored paper into a full-bodied 3D [[papercraft]] figure.&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon Studio at 64DD.net"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Polygon Studio | url=http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&amp;type=released&amp;section=main&amp;id=7 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113081755/http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&amp;type=released&amp;section=main&amp;id=7 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 13, 2014 | accessdate=June 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the 64DD hardware package was primarily sold with a mandatory subscription to Randnet, the service was fairly popular amongst the limited 64DD user base. Overall, the service didn't garner enough subscribers to justify its continued existence, and in October 2000, the service's impending closure was announced.  ''The 64 Dream'' magazine reported a Nintendo public relations statement, which said that there had been approximately 15,000 Randnet subscribers at the time of this announcement, indicating that there had been at least that many hardware units sold to customers.&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"/&gt; Nintendo offered to buy back all the Randnet related consumer hardware and to give free service to all users from the announcement of closure, until the day it actually went offline.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The Randnet service closed on February 28, 2001&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randnet service termination"/&gt; and Nintendo's equity partnership with RandnetDD Co., Ltd. was liquidated from June 30, 2001&lt;ref name="Nintendo Consolidated 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | title=CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd | date=November 21, 2001 | location=Kyoto, Japan | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2001/011121e.pdf | accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} to  January 31, 2002.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Consolidated 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title=CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd | date=May 30, 2002 | location=Kyoto, Japan | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2002/020530e.pdf | accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Reception==
Rating the overall system at 6.0 out of 10.0, IGN's Peer Schneider finds the industrial design language of the 64DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate with that of the Nintendo 64, with no user-accessible moving parts, a single mechanical eject button, sharing the N64's power button, and child-friendly usability.  Installation is said to be "quick and painless", operation is "even simpler", and the whole system "couldn't be easier to use".  Software load times are described as "minimal", where the most complex possible point of the system's library reaches about five seconds.  The site says that the 64DD popularity was inherently limited, due in part to its limited release in Japan, a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo 64 and of dialup Internet connectivity.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Schneider found the combination of the Randnet's web browser and the mouse to provide a "passable surfing experience".  He described the portal's private content as "much too limited", where "[a]nyone who has used the Internet would snicker at the lack of up-to-date contents or tools offered on Randnet". He was disappointed in the companies' failure to have ever delivered certain promised online features, such as game beta testing and music distribution.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"&gt;{{cite web | title=64DD: Broken Promises | date=February 23, 2001 | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/24/64dd-broken-promises | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it provides new users with a "simple network [which] functions as first baby steps into the vast world of the Internet".&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import) |first=Peer |last=Schneider |work=ign64 |date=August 22, 2000 |url=http://ign64.ign.com/reviews/1908.html |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010330013031/http://ign64.ign.com/reviews/1908.html |archivedate=March 30, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider liked the overall product value provided by the Randnet Starter Kit, including hardware, games, accessories, and Internet subscription. However, the platform's abrupt discontinuation proved to limit the appeal to a per item basis rather than as a whole.  Because these items were sold only as a soon-discontinued bundle, all with such ultimately limited application, he found the disks' cheaper prices to be aggregated back up to the level of cartridges.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;

He found the ''Mario Artist'' series (especially the 64DD's "killer app", ''Talent Studio'') to be uniquely compelling in creative ways that "couldn't be done on any other gaming console on the market", utilizing the disks' writability and "[leaving] CD systems behind".&lt;ref name="Leaves CD Systems"/&gt; As a flagship title for the platform, IGN found ''Paint Studio''{{'}}s well-made art creation functionality to be both a low-cost paint program, and edutainment akin to an [[Adobe Photoshop]] for kids.&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/games/mario-artist-paint-studio/64dd-1908 | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that If the platform hadn't been abruptly canceled, Nintendo supposedly would have utilized ''Paint Studio'' as a source of user-generated art content throughout a notable library of 64DD-compatible games.&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt;

Schneider acknowledges Nintendo's vision, attributing the system's downfall generally upon the drastically changing marketplace during the several years of delays until the system's release.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt; He summarized the 64DD as "an appealing creativity package"&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt; "targeted at a certain type of user"&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt; "that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience"—and a "limited online experiment at the same time", which partially fulfilled Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s "longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation".&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Nintendo reported that there were 15,000 Randnet subscribers as of the October 2000 announcement of the service's impending closure, with at least as many requisite 64DD units having been deployed.&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"/&gt;

New genres of games were developed due to the advent of 64DD's rewritable mass storage, real-time clock (RTC), and [[Internet appliance]] functionality.&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt; However, the system's [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] required many 64DD games to be released on traditional Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles, or canceled.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Some of these standalone Nintendo 64 cartridge releases include the equivalent of the 64DD's RTC chip directly on board the cartridge, as with Japan's ''Animal Forest''.   The {{nowrap|4 MB}} RAM [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Expansion Pak|Expansion Pak]] became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo 64 game development, being packaged along with a few cartridge games.  All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality.

The concept of the popular multiplatform ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series originated with the 64DD's rewritable storage and RTC. The eventual initial release of the series was adapted to utilize only the Nintendo 64 cartridge format with an embedded RTC, in the form of Japan's ''Animal Forest''. That game was cosmetically adapted for GameCube (with the console's built-in RTC and its removable and rewritable [[Nintendo GameCube#Memory and storage|memory cards]]) with the new name of ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''.  All games in the series are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]] [[persistent world|persistent game world]], with the passage of time being recorded on writable media.  The realtime effect reflects real [[season]]s, real [[holidays]], virtual plant growth, development of virtual relationships, and other events.  Interactivity between real human players on different subsequent console generations has been enabled through the swapping of various Nintendo consoles' writable mass storage cards or through [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|online]] communications.&lt;ref name="IGN_GC_preview"&gt;{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/361/361068p1.html |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of what is now the ''Nintendogs'' series originated because of 64DD, in the form of a pet creature breeding prototype called ''Cabbage''. Never released, it had been codeveloped by [[Shigesato Itoi]] (designer of ''[[EarthBound]]''), [[Tsunekazu Ishihara]] (designer of ''[[Pokémon]]''), and [[Shigeru Miyamoto]].&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt; Its publicized four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the [[realtime clock]] and mass writability, where Miyamoto explained, "We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, [the game] can still raise the creature"&lt;ref name="Cabbage at IGN"/&gt; and with optionally purchasable enhancement data.&lt;ref name="64DD: The Games"/&gt; A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy via the [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Transfer Pak|Transfer Pak]], to be synchronized back to the 64DD disk.&lt;ref name="64DD: The Games"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabbage at IGN"/&gt; In 2006, Miyamoto concluded that "the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making ''Cabbage'' are, of course, connected to ''Nintendogs'' and other things that we're doing now."&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Opens Vault"/&gt;

The concept of a personal avatar creator app which had begun with prototypes for the Famicom was solidified in ''[[Mario Artist: Talent Studio]]'' and then has been seen on all subsequent Nintendo consoles. Those ''Talent Studio'' avatars can be imported into select 64DD titles including the ''[[SimCity 64]]'' game. Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki credits his work on ''Talent Studio'' as having been foundational to his conception and development of the entire [[Mii]] component of the [[Wii]] platform a decade later.&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD at NWP"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo's Expansion Ports: Nintendo 64 Disk Drive | first=Danny | last=Bivens | date=October 29, 2011 | publisher=Nintendo World Report | url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/27670/nintendos-expansion-ports-nintendo-64-disk-drive | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks: Wii Sports"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Wii Sports | others=Satoru Iwata | first1=Katsuya | last1=Eguchi | first2=Keizo | last2=Ota | first3=Yoshikazu | last3=Yamashita | first4=Takayuki | last4=Shimamura | publisher=Nintendo | url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/wii_sports/ | accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="64DD English user document"&gt;{{cite web | title=64DD English (Engrish) user document | publisher=64DD Institute | url=http://ksnk.jp/ddlab/supp/en.html | accessdate=June 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mii Prototype Development History"&gt;{{youtube | title=Mii Prototype Development History From NES to Wii GCD 2007  | id=SbaNZ7IwrxY }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's concepts were reportedly specifically foundational to the characters in ''[[Wii Tennis]]''.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Opens Vault"&gt;{{cite web | title=Miyamoto Opens the Vault | date=August 21, 2006 | first=Anoop | last=Gantayat | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/21/miyamoto-opens-the-vault | accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of graphical stamps that are seen in various [[Miiverse]]-supported games is found in ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio''&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt; and ''[[Mario Paint]]''.

The user-creation of graphics, animations, levels, and minigames which are seen in the ''Mario Artist'' series and ''[[F-Zero X#Disk drive expansion|F-Zero X Expansion Kit]]'' are revisited in later console generations.  The idea of [[minigame]]s was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64's [[fifth generation video game consoles|fifth generation of video game consoles]]. Some early minigames can be actually created in ''Mario Artist: Polygon Studio'' in the style that would later be used in the ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]]'' series of games.&lt;ref name="64DD at NWP"/&gt;  Certain minigames literally originated there, as explained by Goro Abe of [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1|Nintendo R&amp;D1]]'s so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team: "In ''Polygon Studio'' you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, but there was also a side game included inside. In this game, you would have to play short games that came one after another. This is where the idea for ''Wario Ware'' came from."&lt;ref name="Nintendo RD1 Interview"&gt;{{ cite interview | publisher=Video Games Daily | title=Nintendo R&amp;D1 Interview | url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/ncl_nintendo_wwiv_apr06_p1.asp | date=April 7, 2006 | first1=Yoshio | last1=Sakamoto | first2=Ryuichi | last2=Nakada | first3=Ko | last3=Takeuchi | first4=Goro | last4=Abe | first5=Taku | last5=Sugioka | first6=Naoko | last6=Mori | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8930">{{more footnotes|date=October 2011}}'''Advertising adstock''' is a term coined by Simon Broadbent&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, S. (1979) "One Way TV Advertisements Work", Journal of the Market Research Society Vol. 23 no.3.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the prolonged or lagged effect of [[advertising]] on consumer purchase behavior. It is also known as 'advertising carry-over'. Adstock is an important component of [[marketing-mix models]].

Adstock is a model of how response to advertising builds and decays in consumer markets.

Advertising tries to expand consumption in two ways; it both reminds and teaches. It reminds in-the-market consumers in order to influence their immediate brand choice and teaches to increase brand awareness and salience, which makes it easier for future advertising to influence brand choice. Adstock is the mathematical manifestation of this [[Behavioral economics|behavioral process]].

The adstock theory hinges on the assumption that exposure to television advertising builds awareness in the minds of the consumers, influencing their purchase decision. Each new exposure to advertising builds awareness and this awareness will be higher if there have been recent exposures and lower if there have not been. In the absence of further exposures adstock eventually decays to negligible levels.

Measuring and determining adstock, especially when developing a marketing-mix model is a key component of determining [[marketing effectiveness]].

There are two dimensions to advertising adstock:

# decay or lagged effect.
# saturation or diminishing returns effect.

== Advertising lag: decay effect ==

The underlying theory of adstock is that the exposure to [[Television advertisement|television advertising]] builds awareness in the [[Consumer|consumer markets]], resulting in sales. Each new exposure to [[advertising]] increases awareness to a new level. The decay effect of adstock eventually reduces awareness to its base level, unless or until this decay is reduced by new exposures. This decay effect can be mathematically modelled and is usually expressed in terms of the ‘half-life’ of the advertising. A ‘two-week half-life’ means that it takes two weeks for the awareness of an advertising to decay to half its present level. Every Ad copy is assumed to have a unique half-life. Some academic studies have suggested half-life range around 7– 12 weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Leone, R.P. (1995) “Generalizing what is known about temporal aggregation and advertising carry-over”, Marketing Science, 14, G141-G150. 
&lt;/ref&gt; while industry practitioners typically report half- lives between 2–5 weeks, with the average for [[Fast-moving consumer goods|Fast Moving Consumer Goods]] (FMCG) Brands at 2.5 weeks. Adstock half-life can be estimated through a distributed lag model response with lags of the TV [[Gross rating point|Gross Ratings Point]] (GRP) variable, using [[Least squares|Least Squares]].&lt;ref&gt;Fry, T.R.L., Broadbent, S. and Dixon, J.M. (2000), “Estimating Advertising Half-life and the Data Interval Bias”, Journal of Targeting, Measurement &amp; Analysis in Marketing, 8, 314-334.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple Decay-Effect Model:

Below is a simple formulation of the basic Adstock model:

''At = Tt +'' λ''At-1 t''=1,...., n

Where At is the Adstock at time ''t,'' T''t'' is the value of the advertising variable at

time ''t'' and λ is the ‘decay’ or lag weight parameter. Inclusion of the A''t''-1 term, this

imparts an infinite lag structure to this model, with the effect of the first Adstock term, approaching 0, as t tends to ∞.

This is a simple decay model, because it captures only the dynamic effect of advertising, not the diminishing returns effect.&lt;ref&gt;Joy, J. (2006). Understanding Advertising Adstock Transformation. Retrieved March 31, 2016, from https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7683/4/MPRA_paper_7683.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising saturation: diminishing returns effect ==
{{see also|Diminishing returns}}

Increasing the amount of advertising increases the percent of the audience reached by the advertising, hence increases demand, but a linear increase in the advertising exposure doesn’t have a similar linear effect on demand. Typically each incremental amount of advertising causes a progressively lesser effect on demand increase. This is advertising saturation. Saturation only occurs above a threshold level that can be determined by Adstock Analysis.

[[File:Adstock2.png]]

For e.g. for the ad copy in the above graph, saturation only kicks in above 110 GRPs per week.

Adstock can be transformed to an appropriate nonlinear form like the [[logistic distribution|logistic]] or [[negative exponential distribution]], depending upon the type of diminishing returns or ‘saturation’ effect the response function is believed to follow.

== Campaign carry-over ==

The advertising carryover effect is a famous and debated effect of business [[The Marketing Practice|marketing practices]]. Essentially, the carryover theory states that the positive benefits from advertising, especially increased sales, are not perfectly in step with advertising movements but rather delayed and spread out over time so that changes may not be noticeable immediately or measurable right after the advertising strategy has gone into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Lacoma, T. (n.d.) Problems With the Advertising Carryover Effect. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/problems-advertising-carryover-effect-21824.html 
&lt;/ref&gt; Carryover (measured from the end of a campaign) ranges between 3 weeks and 6 months. This establishes that consumer involvement has a noticeably positive impact on carry-over, as involved consumers have a better memory for commercials.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman, M., Willemsen, L. M., Neijens, P. C., &amp; Smit, E. G. (2012). Program-involvement effects on commercial attention and recall of successive and embedded advertising. Journal of Advertising, 41(2), 25–37. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show long and expensive campaigns, result in competitive clutter, when several brands advertise simultaneously, competitive interference depreciates campaign accessibility and makes individuals forget the message more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, B. I. (2008). Pooling and dynamic of forgetting effects in multitheme advertising: tracking the advertising sales relationship with particle filters. Marketing Science, 27(4), 659–673. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Observations show noticeable wear-out effects as carry-overs are shortened when brands air multiple campaigns and/or increase the size of their advertising budget. These results are noteworthy because it shows that advertising intensity, competitive interference and wear-out effects have impacts on advertising effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Aurier, P., Broz-Giroux, A. (2013).  Modeling Advertising Impact at Campaign Level: Empirical Generalization Relative to Long-term Advertising Profit Contribution and its Antecedents. New York, NY : Springer Media. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The negative impacts of campaign carryovers include:

*'''Analysis Difficulty''': A campaign carryover effect makes it very difficult to analyze the success of marketing campaign. Businesses have to choose a time period after the [[advertising]] to gauge the effects on sales by comparing it to a previous period. But if the effects are delayed, the business does not know when to start the period or how long to make it for the most accurate result. Market forces, price changes and other factors will change sales themselves if the company waits too long to make its analysis.
*'''Advertising Problems''': Advertising problems can be resolved if they are quickly dealt with. Some problems, however, can be subtle and if the carryover effect exists, the company may not even be aware of the problem until it is too late to fix it. If positive results are delayed, so are issues with advertising [[strategy]] that could otherwise be repaired. This leaves very little room for mistakes.
*'''Changing Markets''': Many types of advertising are based on rapidly changing markets. Trends can shift suddenly, problems can arise and create the need for marketing solutions, and other changes can make it necessary to update or replace advertising very quickly. But if the carryover effect exists, then the original gains that the advertising plan generated may not have occurred yet before it is changed, leading to an essential blindness when it comes to measuring ad effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Lacoma, T. (n.d.) Problems With the Advertising Carryover Effect. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/problems-advertising-carryover-effect-21824.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">'''Aggregate planning''' is a marketing activity that does an aggregate plan for the [[Manufacturing|production]] process, in advance of 6 to 18 months, to give an idea to [[management]] as to what quantity of materials and other [[Resource (project management)|resources]] are to be procured and when, so that the total [[cost of operation]]s of the organization is kept to the minimum over that period.

The quantity of [[outsourcing]], [[subcontracting]] of items, [[overtime]] of labour, numbers to be hired and fired in each period and the amount of [[inventory]] to be held in stock and to be backlogged for each period are decided. All of these activities are done within the framework of the company [[ethics]], policies, and long term commitment to the society, community and the country of operation.

Aggregate planning has certain pre-required inputs which are inevitable. They include:
*Information about the resources and the facilities available.
*[[Supply and demand|Demand]] forecast for the period for which the planning has to be done.
*Cost of various alternatives and resources. This includes cost of holding inventory, ordering cost, cost of production through various production alternatives like subcontracting, [[Scrum (development)#Product backlog|backordering]] and overtime.
*Organizational policies regarding the usage of above alternatives.

"Aggregate Planning is concerned with matching supply and demand of output over the medium time range, up to approximately 12 months into the future. The term aggregate implies that the planning is done for a single overall measure of output or, at the most, a few aggregated product categories. The aim of aggregate planning is to set overall output levels in the near to medium future in the face of fluctuating or uncertain demands. Aggregate planning might seek to influence demand as well as supply.

==Aggregate Plan Strategies==
===Level plans===
*Use a constant workforce &amp; produce similar quantities each time period
*Use inventories and back-orders to absorb demand peaks &amp; valleys
*Use inventories in better way to absorb the peak of demand and valleys

===Chase plans===
*Minimize finished good inventories by trying to keep pace with demand fluctuations
*Matches demand varying either work force level or output rate

===Hybrid Strategies===
*Build-up inventory ahead of rising demand and use back-orders to level extreme peaks
*[[Layoff]] or [[furlough]] workers during lulls
*Subcontract production or hire temporary workers to cover short-term peaks
*Reassign workers to preventive maintenance during lulls

==Problems related to Aggregate Planning==
Smoothing
*Smoothing refers to costs that result from changing production and workforce levels from one period to the next.

Bottleneck Problems
*It is the inability of the system to respond to sudden changes in demand as a result of capacity restrictions.

Planning Horizon
*The number of periods for which the demand is to be forecasted, and hence the number of periods for which workforce and inventory levels are to be determined, must be specified in advance.

Treatment of Demand
Aggregate planning methodology requires the assumption that demand is known with certainty. This is simultaneously a weakness and a strength of the approach.

'''Alfred Léonard Loewenstein''' (11 March 1877 - 4 July 1928),&lt;ref&gt;[http://gw.geneanet.org/quentinhayois?lang=fr&amp;p=alfred+leonard&amp;n=loewenstein Généalogie de quentinhayois]&lt;/ref&gt; [[CB (Honour)|CB]], was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] financier. At his peak in the 1920s he was worth around £12 million in the currency of the time.

The basis of his wealth was that he invested in electric power and artificial silk businesses when those industries were in their infancy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;LOWENSTEIN'S TRAGIC END SHAKES EUROPE'S MARKETS; SUICIDE THEORY IS RAISED: CAPTAIN ALFRED LOWENSTEIN. Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES.Times Wide World Photo.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 06 July 1928: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and business career==
Loewenstein was born to Bernard Loewenstein, a [[German-Jewish]] banker in [[Brussels]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Loewenstein established his own banking concern, and was a [[wealth]]y man by 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He offered his [[Belgium in World War I|government in exile]] 50 million dollars, interest free, to stabilize the currency in return for the right of printing [[Belgian franc]]s. The offer was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Teigh Bloom - The Man Who Stole Portugal, London: Secker &amp; Warburg (1966), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; At war's end, he maintained a residence in England where he ran an [[investment]] business that made him one of Europe's most powerful [[financiers]]. He partnered the investment house of [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born [[Sir James Dunn]] in several [[Joint venture|business ventures]], the duo emerging with more than [[Pound (currency)|£1,000,000]] [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] from their 1920s investment in [[British Celanese]] alone.

Loewenstein was an owner of a successful stable of [[Thoroughbred]] [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase race horses]]. His horses won the 1926 and 1928 runnings of the [[Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris]].

==Business successes==
Loewenstein also made an enormous fortune providing [[electric power]] facilities for developing countries worldwide through his Belgian-based company, "''Société Internationale d'Énergie Hydro-Électrique''" (SIDRO). By the mid-1920s, Loewenstein's reputation was such that he was consulted by [[Head of state|heads of state]] from around the globe. The British government made him a [[Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath]].

In 1926, he established "International Holdings and Investments Limited" that raised huge amounts of [[Financial capital|capital]] from wealthy [[investors]] wishing to get aboard his bandwagon of success. However, Loewenstein was rebuffed in his attempt to [[Takeover|take over]] a Canadian company called [[Barcelona Traction|Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power]], a huge operation building [[infrastructure]] in [[Brazil]].

==Alleged drug deal with Arnold Rothstein==
It is said that shortly before his death, Lowenstein made a deal with the [[gangster]] [[Arnold Rothstein]] to supply heroin to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/meet_americas_first_drug_dealer_arnold_rothsteins_wild_real_life_1920s_sopranos_story/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On the evening of 4 July 1928, Loewenstein left from [[Croydon]] to fly to [[Brussels]] on his private [[aircraft]], a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker F.VII trimotor]], along with six other people. While the aircraft was crossing the [[English Channel]] at an altitude of {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, Loewenstein went to the rear of the plane to use the [[Aircraft lavatory|lavatory]]. On Loewenstein's Fokker, a door at the rear of the main passenger cabin opened on to a short passage with two doors: the one on the right led to the lavatory, while the one on the left was the aircraft's entrance door.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Suicide hinted in strange death of europe's croesus | newspaper = The Evening Independent | location = St Petersburg, Fla. | page = 1 | language = | publisher = | date = 5 July 1928 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K99PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l1QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3107%2C2967110  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he had not reappeared after some time, Loewenstein's secretary went in search of him and discovered that the lavatory was empty, and the aircraft's entrance door was open and flapping in the slipstream. The employee (along with the others on the plane) asserted his belief that Loewenstein had fallen through the plane's rear door and plunged several thousand feet to his death in the English Channel. The aircraft landed first on the beach before transferring to the airfield at [[Saint-Inglevert Airfield|Saint-Inglevert]], [[Pas-de-Calais]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=Times060728&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Fall From an Aeroplane |day_of_week=Friday |date=6 July 1928 |page_number=16 |issue=44938 |column=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News and investigation===
News of Loewenstein's demise caused [[panic selling]] in his [[corporation|corporations']] [[publicly traded]] [[shares]] that immediately plummeted in value by more than fifty percent.

On 12 July it was reported that tests had been conducted by the Accidents Branch of the British Air Ministry using Loewenstein's aircraft. It was stated that at an altitude of {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} one of the Ministry men had thrown himself against the aircraft's entry door, which had opened about {{convert|6|in|abbr=on}}. However, he was immediately thrown back into the aircraft when the slipstream violently slammed shut the door. It was concluded that it would have been impossible for someone to accidentally open the door and fall out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = TEST DOOR OF PLANE LOEWENSTEIN USED; British Officials Doubt He Could Have Fallen Out of It Accidentally. | newspaper = New York Times | location =  | page = 5 | language = | publisher = | date = 13 July 1928 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loewenstein's body was discovered near Boulogne on 19 July, and was taken to Calais by fishing boat where his identity was confirmed by means of his wristwatch; an [[autopsy]] was performed (at the request of his family), his brother-in-law stating that they did not suspect anyone of foul play, but that they did not want anyone to suggest after the burial that Loewenstein might have been poisoned, or had died in the aircraft and then been thrown out. The autopsy revealed a partial fracture of his skull and several broken bones, and it was concluded that he had been alive when he struck the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Lowenstein post-mortem urged | newspaper = Canberra Times | location =  | page = 1 | language = | publisher = | date = 23 July 1928 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article981459 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loewenstein was laid to rest in a cemetery outside [[Evere]], in a tomb belonging to his wife's family, the Misonnes. However, his name was never carved on the slab covering his casket, so he was in effect buried in an unmarked grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Norris | first =William | authorlink = | title =The Man Who Fell From the Sky | publisher =Viking | series = | volume = | edition = | date =1987 | location = | page =2 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
Many theories have been put forward as to exactly what had happened to Loewenstein in the back of his plane; some suspected a [[criminal conspiracy]] in which his employees [[murder]]ed him. ''[[The New York Times]]'' hypothesised that a growing [[Forgetting|absent mindedness]], noted by many of Loewenstein's acquaintances, may have caused him to walk out the wrong door of the plane. Because he had left behind a tangled web of business ventures, many of which were highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]], others theorized that his business empire was on the verge of collapse. Some even asserted that corrupt business practices were about to be exposed and that Loewenstein, therefore, committed [[suicide]]. None of these theories was ever proved.

In 1987, William Norris wrote Loewenstein's story in a book titled ''The Man Who Fell From the Sky'' (New York: Viking, 1987).  Norris presents evidence in support of his case that, if his death was not a conspiracy by business rivals and associates, a certain opportunism existed regarding the death of the tycoon and his insurance.  He also shows that later events are frequently ignored, such as the fact that Loewenstein's son shot one of the family servants under murky circumstances within a decade or so after the tragedy.  The son eventually died in World War II. Norris concluded that Loewenstein had been thrown from the aircraft by Donald Drew, the pilot, at the behest of Madeleine Loewenstein, the motive being to gain control of Loewenstein's fortune. He suggested that the aircraft's rear door was completely removed while in the air and a replacement fitted on the beach at [[Saint-Pol-sur-Mer|St. Pol]].

Crime writers Robert &amp; Carol Bridgestock have speculated that Loewenstein faked his own death and disappeared because the financial irregularities in his businesses. This theory is supported by the facts that the body was buried in an unmarked grave and that his wife did not attend the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4, 12 July 2014, Steve Punt '' Punt PIThe Mysterious Death of Flying Millionaire Alfred Loewenstein ''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3103">'''Andrew Batten-Foster''' (born May 1953) is a former [[BBC]] music presenter, who became a television producer and director, a university media lecturer and the owner of [[Cactus Pictures]].

==Career==
Batten-Foster began his media career in 1977 in the newsroom at Radio Bristol. While there he learned of a possible job presenting a new arts and music television programme to be produced by David Pritchard for which he successfully auditioned. ''RPM'' featured a regular piece by [[Auberon Waugh]] that had to be checked by lawyers before it could be broadcast, and the first television appearance of the celebrity chef Keith Floyd. Batten-Foster moved on to a job at [[BBC Radio One]]. In 1983 he presented the ''Saturday Live'' show with [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]]. He was also one of the presenters of "Live Aid" in 1985. He then moved into television, first by directing "The Antiques Roadshow" before eventually becoming an executive producer on a wide range of BBC television shows including "999", presented by [[Michael Buerk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_igfFVfpELkC&amp;pg=PA389 |title=The Road Taken |author=Michael Buerk |page=389 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set up a New York office for the BBC to produce programmes for the Discovery Networks and in 2002 was part of the editorial team responsible for re-launching '[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'

Batten-Foster suffered a near fatal bout of meningitis in 2010 before making a full recovery. He went on to become the Bristol chair of the [[Royal Television Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Carol-Vorderman-host-TV-awards-Bristol/story-20602929-detail/story.html |title=Carol Vorderman to host TV awards in Bristol |newspaper=[[Bristol Post]] |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2008 to 2013. He then taught media 
studies - international formats and television commissioning -  to students at Regent`s University in London, Bath Spa University and Solent Southampton University.

==Personal life==
Batten-Foster is married to Dr. Harriet Rachel Batten-Foster, daughter of television presenter [[Joan Bakewell]]. They have two children, Louis and Max, who was born with cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nathan |first=Sara |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2088698/Dame-Joan-Bakewell-says-shes-plummy-voiced-work-politically-correct-corporation.html |title=Dame Joan Bakewell says she's too plummy-voiced to work for politically correct corporation |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8616">'''Arthur T. Gregorian''', (1909 &amp;ndash; January 14, 2003), was a [[Greater Boston]] [[oriental rug]] dealer and author of books on oriental rugs. He is considered by some to be the world's leading collector of rare, inscribed [[Armenians|Armenian]] rugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/17/SouthPinellas/Arthur_T_Gregorian__9.shtml Southpinellas: Arthur T. Gregorian, 93, rug collector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Film frame greogiran buying rugs 72dpi.jpg|thumb|Arthur T. Gregorian purchasing rugs in Kabul, Afghanistan - 16mm frame]]

==Early life==
Gregorian did not know his birthdate. However, he marked it as November 15, 1909. He was born in [[Reyhanabad, West Azerbaijan|Rahvah]], on the western shore of [[Lake Urmia]], [[West Azerbaijan Province]], [[Iran]], of [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, and died on January 14, 2003, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].

In 1919, Gregorian and his family fled the [[Armenian Genocide]] by [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] on a thousand-mile journey with hundreds of thousands of [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[refugees]] from his ancient [[Armenians|Armenian]] homeland near [[Lake Urmia]], over the [[Zagros Mountains]] in southwestern [[Iran]], down to [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]. There, they stayed at a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[refugee]] camp. Gregorian almost died of [[cholera]] and worked as a sidekick to a [[Hakim (title)|hakim]] or herbal doctor to earn food for his family. After traveling by [[steerage]] to [[India]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], he finally reached [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and settled in [[New Britain, Connecticut]]. In high school, Arthur met Phebe Ballou, his future wife. He spent his final year of high school at the [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]], where in later life he became the director of the board of alumni. After high school he worked in a rug shop to get money to go to night school at [[Boston University]], so he could become a doctor.

==Wellesley==
In 1934, Gregorian took his savings of $700.00 and moved to [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], partly to open his own [[oriental rug]] store there and partly to see Phebe who was attending [[Wellesley College]]. The store was tiny and below street level, so he visited his potential buyers in their homes or businesses. He and Phebe were married in 1936. The business flourished and in 1940, Arthur was able to move east across the [[Charles River]] to larger quarters on Washington Street in [[Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts|Newton Lower Falls]].

==Newton Lower Falls==
In his new store in [[Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts]] ({{coord|42|19|34.75|N|71|15|17.10|W|type:landmark}}), Gregorian finally had the space for his customers to come to him to see his rugs. Business continued to be good until [[World War II]] disrupted his importation of rugs as well as reduced the demand for luxury goods. After the war was over, however, the economy of Greater Boston boomed and Arthur's business boomed along with it. He had a store in Newton Lower Falls and another in [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. In 1948 he bought the old [[Crane Paper Company]] paper mill next door and expanded his showrooms into it. In 1965 and again in 1989, additions were made to the two buildings, which resulted in {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|-3}} of space divided into 10 galleries and over 6,000 rugs on display.

==Personal life==
In 1936, Arthur T. Gregorian married Phebe Ballou (April 14, 1912 &amp;ndash; November 19, 1999). They had three children, Lynda, John and Joyce (1946–1991). Phebe was regional president of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts|Girl Scouts]] and founding Director of the United Nation's Asian Women's Institute.

==St. Petersburg, Florida, interlude==
Arthur and Phebe Gregorian retired to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] in the mid-1970s, but around 1979, Arthur grew tired of retirement and opened an oriental rug store in downtown St. Pete and later exhibited rugs from his collection at local art museums. The Gregorians returned to Massachusetts in 1999. He was a founding member of The Academy of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College.

==Impact on the study of oriental rugs==
Perhaps Greogrian's most important legacy has been in his study, writing, [[filmmaking]], collecting and lectures on oriental rugs. Fluent in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], he spent months at a time in the [[bazaar]]s of [[Afghanistan]], Armenia and Iran buying rugs and filming his [[bargaining]] and travels with a [[16 mm]] [[Bell and Howell]] [[movie camera]].

In the study and erudition of oriental rugs, he will be best remembered for his books, ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell'',&lt;ref&gt;Gregorian, Arthur T., ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell, 3rd ed, revised and enlarged, Boston: Nimrod Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Armenian Rugs of the Gregorian Collection'', done in collaboration with his daughter, [[Joyce Ballou Gregorian|Joyce Ballou Gregorian Hampshire]] and his grandson, Douglas Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorian, Arthur T. and Hampshire, Joyce Gregorian, with photos by Douglas A. Christian, ''Armenian Rugs from the Gregorian Collection'', Newton Lower Falls: Congraf, paperback, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell'', he divided rugs into three major categories: [[tribal]], [[village]], and city rugs. He observed that it is often difficult for a novice to distinguish between a [[Sarouk Rug|Sarouk]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]] or a [[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]], but it is not difficult for the novice to distinguish between the innate characteristics of a village woven [[Bidjar rug|Bidjar]] and an intricate and highly stylized city woven [[Qum]]. ''Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell'' was a breakthrough in the study of rugs, because it made the study of rugs clear and accessible.

His book on Armenian oriental rugs came out of realization that many rugs labeled as Turkish or Kazakh or something else were in fact [[Armenians|Armenian]] in origin. He was extremely proud of his [[List of Armenian Americans|Armenian heritage]] and spent the last decades of his life collecting and documenting the particular aspects of Armenian oriental rug weaving. His collection of Armenian oriental rugs was shown throughout the world and the majority of it was donated to the [[Armenian Library and Museum of America]], of which he was a founding member and director. He was also president of the Armenian Rugs Society.

He also wrote a book with his wife, Phebe, entitled ''Armenag's Story'', about his own travels by ox-cart from his Armenian home to a British refugee camp in [[Basra]] in present-day [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregorian, Arthur T. &amp; Phebe, ''Armenag's Story'', Newton: Lower Falls Publishing, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notable achievements==
Gregorian was actively involved in social causes throughout most of his life. He was president of the Newton [[Rotary Club]], as well as a long time active member of the [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] Rotary Club. He was the founding chairman of the board of directors for [[Damavand College]], a women's college located north of [[Tehran]].

In 1953, as President of Morgan Memorial and President of [[Goodwill Industries]], he called his friend and fellow Armenian, [[Stephen P. Mugar]], and asked if he could place a new collection receptacle he had designed in the parking lot of the [[Star Market]] in [[Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts|Wellesley Hills]]. The container was a dumpster painted blue with a rectangular hole cut in the side for shoppers to deposit their extra clothing for the needy. This first Goodwill collection box became such an attraction for grocery shoppers that soon competitors of Star Market were requesting containers of their own.

[[File:Bayes' Theorem MMB 01.jpg|thumb|alt=text|Bayes' Theorem]]
In [[marketing]], [[Bayesian inference]] allows for decision making and [[market research]] evaluation under uncertainty and with limited data.

==Introduction==
[[Bayes’ theorem]] is fundamental to [[Bayesian inference]]. It is a subset of [[statistics]], providing a mathematical framework for forming [[inferences]] through the concept of [[probability]], in which evidence about the true state of the world is expressed in terms of degrees of belief through subjectively assessed numerical probabilities. Such a probability is known as a [[Bayesian probability]]. The fundamental ideas and concepts behind Bayes' theorem, and its use within Bayesian inference, have been developed and added to over the past centuries by [[Thomas Bayes]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]] as well as numerous other mathematicians, statisticians and scientists.&lt;ref name=x&gt;McGrayne, S. B. (2011). ''The Theory that Would Not Die'', New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayesian inference has experienced spikes in popularity as it has been seen as vague and controversial by rival [[Frequentist probability|frequentist]] statisticians.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Green, P. E. and Frank, R. E. (1966). “Bayesian Statistics and Marketing Research”, [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C]] 15 (3): 173-190. {{jstor|2985299}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few decades Bayesian inference has become widespread in many scientific and social science fields such as [[marketing]]. Bayesian inference allows for decision making and market research evaluation under uncertainty and limited data.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Olshausen B. A. (2004) “Bayesian Probability Theory” http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/npb163/bayes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bayes’ theorem==
Bayesian probability specifies that there is some [[prior probability]]. Bayesian statisticians can use both an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] approach when interpreting the prior probability, which is then updated in light of new relevant information. The concept is a manipulation of [[conditional probabilities]]:&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(AB)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, a more simple understanding of the formula may be reached by substituting the events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to become respectively the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[data]] &lt;math&gt;(D)&lt;/math&gt;.  The rule allows for a judgment of the relative truth of the hypothesis given the data.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

This is done through the calculation shown below, where &lt;math&gt;P(D|H)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[likelihood function]]. This assesses the probability of the observed data &lt;math&gt;(D)&lt;/math&gt; arising from the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;(H)&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the assigned prior probability or initial belief about the hypothesis; the denominator &lt;math&gt;P(D)&lt;/math&gt; is formed by the integrating or summing of &lt;math&gt;P(D|H)P(H)&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P(H|D)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Posterior probability|posterior]] which is the recalculated probability, or updated belief about the hypothesis. It is a result of the prior beliefs as well as sample information. The posterior is a conditional distribution as the result of collecting or in consideration of new relevant data.&lt;ref name="b"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(H|D)=\frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)}&lt;/math&gt;

To sum up this formula: the posterior probability of the hypothesis is equal to the prior probability of the hypothesis multiplied by the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the new evidence.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Paulos, J. A. (2011) “The Mathematics of Changing your Mind” Book review, New York Times. (August 5th p14 sunday book review)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in marketing==

===History===
While the concepts of Bayesian statistics are thought to date back to 1763, marketers' exposure to the concepts are relatively recent, dating from 1959.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;  Subsequently, many books&lt;ref name=d&gt;Chernoff, H. and Moses, L. E.  (1959). Elementary Decision Theory. New York: Wiley; London: Chapman &amp; Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e&gt;Schlaifer, R. (1959). Probability and Statistics for Business Decisions, New York: McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f&gt;Rossi, P. E., Allenby, G. M. and McCulloch, R. (2005). ''Bayesian Statistics and Marketing'', New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; and articles&lt;ref name=g&gt;Roberts, H. V. (1960). “The New Business Statistics”, ''Journal of Business'' 33 (1): 21-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h&gt;Pratt, J. W., Raiffa, H. and Schlaifer, R. (1964). ”The Foundations of Decision Under Uncertainty: An Elementary Exposition”, ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'' 59 (306): 353- 375&lt;/ref&gt; have been written about the application of Bayesian statistics to marketing decision-making and [[market research]]. It was predicted that the Bayesian approach would be used widely in the marketing field but up until the mid-1980s the methods were considered impractical.&lt;ref name=i&gt;Rossi, P.E., Allenby. G. M (2003) "Bayesian Statistics and Marketing" ''Marketing Science'' 22 (3): 304-328&lt;/ref&gt; The resurgence in the use of Bayesian methods is largely due to the developments over the last few decades in computational methods; and expanded availability of detailed marketplace data - primarily due to the birth of the [[world wide web]] and explosion of the [[internet]].

===Application in marketing===
Bayesian decision theory can be applied to all four areas of the [[marketing mix]].&lt;ref name=j&gt;Alderson, W., Green, P. E. (1964) ''Planning and Problem Solving in Marketing''. Richard D. Irwin Inc Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but it should be noted that in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a [[weighted mean]] of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed [[Numerical data|quantitatively]] in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.

====New product development====

{{Main|New product development}}

The use of Bayesian [[decision theory]] in new product development allows for the use of subjective prior information.  Bayes in new product development allows for the comparison of additional review project costs with the value of additional information in order to reduce the costs of uncertainty. The methodology used for this analysis is in the form of [[decision trees]] and ‘stop’/‘go’ procedures. If the predicted payoff (the posterior) is acceptable for the organisation the project should go ahead, if not, development should stop. By reviewing the posterior (which then becomes the new prior) on regular intervals throughout the development stage managers are able to make the best possible decision with the information available at hand. Although the review process may delay further development and increase costs, it can help greatly to reduce uncertainty in high risk decisions.

====Pricing decisions====

{{Main|Pricing}}

[[Bayesian decision theory]] can be used in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments it is often difficult to fully apply Bayesian decision theory to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.

====Promotional campaigns====

{{Main|Promotion (marketing)}}

When dealing with promotion a marketing manager must account for all the market complexities that are involved in a decision. As it is difficult to account for all aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a test sample in order to assess the effectiveness of a promotion prior to a full scale rollout. By combining prior subjective data about the occurrence of possible events with experimental empirical evidence gained through a test market, the resultant data can be used to make decisions under risk.

====Channel decisions and the logistics of distribution====

{{Main|Logistics}}

Bayesian decision analysis can also be applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a [[normal distribution]]. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.

==Strengths==

The Bayesian approach is superior to use in decision making when there is a high level of uncertainty or limited information in which to base decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense to people who are less familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in this sense that Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.&lt;ref name=k&gt;Roberts, H. V. (1963). “Bayesian Statistics in Marketing” Journal of Marketing 27 (1):1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The three principle strengths of Bayes' theorem that have been identified by scholars are that it is prescriptive, complete and coherent.&lt;ref name=l&gt;Little, R.(2006). “Calibrated Bayes: A Bayes/ Frequentist Roadmap”, The American Statistician 60 (3): 213-233&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive in that it is the theorem that is the simple prescription to the conclusions reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning for the consistent decision maker.
It is complete because the solution is often clear and unambiguous, for a given choice of model and prior distribution. It allows for the incorporation of prior information when available to increase the robustness of the solutions, as well as taking into consideration the costs and risks that are associated with choosing alternative decisions.&lt;ref name=m&gt;Wald, A.(1950). “Statistical Decision Functions”, in: Kotz, S. And Johnson, N. L. (Eds.) (1992). Breakthroughs in Statistics: Foundations and Basic Theory, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
Lastly Bayes theorem is coherent. It is considered the most appropriate way to update beliefs by welcoming the incorporation of new information, as is seen through the [[probability distributions]] (see Savage&lt;ref name=n&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954). The Foundations of Statistics, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; and De Finetti&lt;ref name=o&gt;De Finetti, B. (1974). The Theory of Probability, New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;). This is further complemented by the fact that Bayes inference satisfies the likelihood principle,&lt;ref name =p&gt;Birnbaum, A. (1962). “On the Foundations of Statistical Inference”, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 57 (298), 269- 306. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2281640&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which states that models or inferences for datasets leading to the same likelihood function should generate the same statistical information.
Bayes methods are more cost effective than the traditional frequentist take on marketing research and subsequent decision making. The probability can be assessed from a degree of belief before and after accounting for evidence, instead of calculating the probabilities of a certain decision by carrying out a large number of trials with each one producing an outcome from a set of possible outcomes. The planning and implementation of trials to see how a decision impacts in the ‘field’ e.g. observing consumers reaction to a relabeling of a product, is time consuming and costly, a method many firms cannot afford. In place of taking the frequentist route in aiming for a universally acceptable conclusion through [[iteration]],&lt;ref name=q&gt;Bradley, E(2005). “Bayesians, Frequentists, and Scientists”, Journal of the American Statistical Association 100 (469):1- 5. http://search.proquest.com/docview/274829688&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes more effective to take advantage of all the information available to the firm to work out the ‘best’ decision at the time, and then subsequently when new knowledge is obtained, revise the posterior distribution to be then used as the prior, thus the inferences continue to [[logic]]ally contribute to one another based on Bayes theorem.&lt;ref name=r&gt;[https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/PDF/default/statug.pdf SAS Institute Inc. (2009). SAS/STAT® 9.2 User’s Guide, Second Edition, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaknesses==
In marketing situations, it is important that the prior probability is (1) chosen correctly, and (2) is understood.  A disadvantage to using Bayesian analysis is that there is no ‘correct’ way to choose a prior, therefore the inferences require a thorough analysis to translate the subjective prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior to ensure that the results will not be misleading and consequently lead to the disproportionate analysis of preposteriors.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; The subjective definition of probability and the selection and use of the priors have led to statisticians critiquing this subjective definition of probability that underlies the Bayesian approach.&lt;ref name=l/&gt;
Bayesian probability is often found to be difficult when analysing and assessing probabilities due to its initial [[counter intuitive]] nature. Often when deciding between [[strategy|strategies]] based on a decision, they are interpreted as:  where there is evidence X that shows condition A might hold true, is misread by judging A's likelihood by how well the evidence X matches A, but crucially without considering the prior frequency of A.&lt;ref name="l"/&gt; In alignment with [[falsifiability|Falsification]], which aims to question and falsify instead of prove hypotheses, where there is very strong evidence X, it does not necessarily mean there is a very high probability that A leads to B, but in fact should be interpreted as a very low probability of A not leading to B.
In the field of marketing, behavioural experiments which have dealt with managerial decision- making,&lt;ref name=s&gt;Green, P. E., Peters, W. S. and Robinson, P. J. (1966). “A Behavioural Experiment in Decision- Making under Uncertainty”, Journal of Purchasing, 2: 18-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t&gt;Starbuck, W. H. and Bass, F. M. (1965). An Experimental Study of Risk-taking and the Value of Information in a New Product Context. Institute Paper No. 117. Herman C. Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Perdue University&lt;/ref&gt; and [[risk perception]],&lt;ref name=u&gt;Baur, R. A. (1960). “Consumer Behaviour as Risk Taking”, Proc. 43rd National Conference American Marketing Association., 389-398. Chicago: American Marketing Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=v&gt;Cox, D. F. and Rich, S. (1964). “Perceived Risk and Consumer Decision-making- The Case of Telephone Shopping”, Journal of Marketing Research, 1 (4): 32-39&lt;/ref&gt; in consumer decisions have utilised the Bayesian model, or similar models, but found that it may not be relevant quantitatively in predicting human information processing behaviour. Instead the model has been proven as useful as a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] means of describing how individuals combine new evidence with their predetermined judgements. Therefore, “the model may have some value as a first approximation to the development of descriptive choice theory” in consumer and managerial instances.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

==Example==
An [[advertising]] manager is deciding whether or not to increase the advertising for a product in a particular [[Market (economics)|market]]. The Bayes approach to this decision suggests: 1) These alternative courses of action for which the consequences are uncertain are a necessary condition in order to apply Bayes';  2) The advertising manager will pick the course of action which allows him to achieve some objective i.e. a maximum return on his advertising investment in the form of profit; 3) He must determine the possible consequences of each action into some measure of success (or loss) with which a certain objective is achieved.

This 3 component example explains how the payoffs are conditional upon which outcomes occur. The advertising manager can characterize the outcomes based on past experience and knowledge and devise some possible events that are more likely to occur than others. He can then assign to these events prior probabilities, which would be in the form of numerical weights.&lt;ref name=w&gt;Green, P. E. (1962) “Bayesian Decision Theory in Advertising”. Journal of Advertising 33-42&lt;/ref&gt;

He can test out his predictions (prior probabilities) through an [[experiment]]. For example, he can run a test campaign to decide if the total level of advertising should be in fact increased. Based on the outcome of the experiment he can re-evaluate his prior probability and make a decision on whether to go ahead with increasing the advertising in the market or not.  However gathering this additional data is costly, time consuming and may not lead to perfectly reliable results. As a decision makers he has to deal with experimental and [[systematic error]] and this is where Bayes' comes in.

It approaches the experimental problem by asking; is additional data required? If so, how much needs to be collected and by what means and finally, how does the decision maker revise his prior judgment in light of the results of the new experimental evidence? In this example the advertising manager can use the Bayesian approach to deal with his dilemma and update his prior judgments in light of new information he gains.  He needs to take into account the profit (utility) attached to the alternative acts under different events and the value versus cost of information in order to make his optimal decision on how to proceed.

==Bayes in computational models==
[[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) is a flexible procedure designed to fit a variety of Bayesian models. It is the underlying method used in [[computer simulation|computational]] software such as the [[LaplacesDemon]] [[R (programming language)|R]] Package and [[WinBUGS]].  The advancements and developments of these types of statistical software have allowed for the growth of Bayes by offering ease of calculation. This is achieved by the generation of samples from the posterior distributions, which are then used to produce a range of options or strategies which are allocated numerical weights. MCMC obtains these samples and produces summary and diagnostic statistics while also saving the posterior samples in the output. The decision maker can then assess the results from the output data set and choose the best option to proceed.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

== Membership ==
The 'Chartered Financial Analyst' designation will be conferred only on completion of MFA (Master in [[Financial analysis|Financial Analysis]]) or Groups Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta of MS Finance post graduate programs offered by the ICFAI University under Flexible Mode. The CFA Program offered by the ICFAI University, Tripura is a unique program covering the areas of [[financial market]]s, financial analysis, valuation of assets, [[Investment management|portfolio management]], mutual and other funds and professional ethics.

The CFA Program has been developed in the context of the present and future needs of the investment industry and the CFA profession.

The core body of knowledge of the CFA Program includes current and evolving concepts, techniques and applications, and also providing the flavor of the frontiers of knowledge.

=== Objectives ===

The CFA Program is a postgraduate program with the following broad objectives :

* To improve the ability to develop a framework for financial analysis and to rationally evaluate alternatives for purposes of decision-making.
* To deepen insights into practical applications of financial analysis in a dynamic investment environment.
* To encourage aspiring [[financial analyst]]s equip themselves with the latest tools and techniques.
* To develop contemporary body of knowledge and skill-set and make them available for those seeking rewarding careers in the investment industry era of globalization.

=== The Approach ===

The CFA Program follows the following distinctive but inter-related approaches :

* Basic Knowledge aimed at improving students' understanding of certain fundamental phenomena and relationships underlying the changing world of [[investment management]].
* Tools and Techniques are required to equip students improve their analytical ability and power of integration and synthesis in the context of financial markets and instruments.
* Application Areas linking the theoretical studies to the practical problems faced by financial analysts and investment managers.
* Professional Ethics aimed at inculcating in the students an ethical approach in their professional interactions and a sense of personal, corporate, and social responsibilities.

=== Focus Areas ===

The Program has five focus areas:

* '''Financial Markets'''
Financial markets include [[capital market]]s (equity, debt and derivatives) both primary and secondary segments. The players include the issuers of [[financial instruments]], the institutional and individual investors, the intermediaries (like investment bankers, brokers, bankers, etc.), the financial analysts, the media, the [[mutual fund]]s, pension funds, [[hedge fund]]s, the [[stock exchange]]s (like [[Bombay Stock Exchange]], [[National Stock Exchange of India|National Stock Exchange]], etc.), and the regulators like [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]].

* '''Analysis and Valuation'''
The various financial instruments like equity, [[Fixed income|fixed income securities]] (like bonds), and derivatives (like options, futures, and swaps) have different risks associated with them and yield different returns. These risks and returns have to be carefully analyzed and the instruments have to be properly valued applying various methods of valuation.

* '''Portfolio Management'''
Different investors have different risk profiles and return-expectations. Hence different portfolios have to be developed and managed to achieve the objectives of the investors. Depending upon the changing circumstances, the portfolios have to be rebalanced. [[Asset allocation]] and risk-return management are the key functions of a successful portfolio manager.

* '''Mutual and Other Funds'''
A wide variety of mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds have come into existence. Each mutual fund has several schemes: growth schemes, income schemes, balanced schemes, sectoral schemes, [[Price index|index-linked]] schemes, tax-planning, schemes etc. Several insurance companies have to manage their investment funds as per Insurance Regulatory Development Authority Regulations. Securities and Exchange Board of India has kept in place detailed regulations for mutual funds.

* '''Code of Conduct'''
The CFAs are required to adhere to the code of ethics and standards of professional conduct covering various aspects like integrity, ethical behavior, professional competence, objectivity, professional independence and [[public trust]].

{{Capitalism}}
[[Proto-capitalism|Proto-capitalist]] [[economy|economies]] and [[free market]]s became active during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] where an early [[market economy]] and a form of [[merchant capitalism]] took root{{where?|date=July 2015}} between the 8th–12th centuries.

A vigorous [[monetary economy]] developed, based on a widely circulated [[currency]] (the [[dinar]]) and on the integration of previously independent [[monetary]] areas.

[[File:FEMA - 37677 - Aerial of a Louisiana oil refinary repaired since Katrina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Oil refinery in [[Louisiana]] - an example of chemical industry]]
The '''chemical industry''' comprises the [[company|companies]] that produce industrial [[chemical]]s. Central to the modern [[world economy]], it converts [[raw materials]] ([[oil]], [[natural gas]], [[air]], [[water]], [[metals]], and [[minerals]]) into more than 70,000 different [[Products Finishing|products]].

The [[plastics industry]] contains some overlap, as most chemical companies produce plastic as well as other chemicals.

==History==
Although chemicals were made and used throughout history, the birth of the heavy chemical industry (production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses) coincided with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in general.

===Industrial Revolution===
One of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial processes was [[sulphuric acid]]. In 1736, the pharmacist [[Joshua Ward]] developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter, allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water. It was the first practical production of sulphuric acid on a large scale. [[John Roebuck]] and [[Samuel Garbett]] were the first to establish a large-scale factory in [[Prestonpans|Prestonpans, Scotland]], in 1749, which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Derry, Thomas Kingston |author2=Williams, Trevor I. | year = 1993 | title = A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900 | location = New York | publisher = Dover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sulfuric Acid: Pumping Up the Volume | author = Kiefer, David M. | year = 2001 | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/10/i09/html/09chemch.html | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Tennant]]'s St. Rollox Chemical Works in 1831, then the biggest chemical enterprise in the world.]]
In the early [[18th century]], cloth was bleached by treating it with stale [[urine]] or [[sour milk]] and exposing it to [[sunlight]] for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production. Sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as [[lime (material)|lime]] by the middle of the century, but it was the discovery of [[bleaching powder]] by [[Charles Tennant]] that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise. His powder was made by reacting [[chlorine]] with dry [[slaked lime]] and proved to be a cheap and successful product. He opened a factory in [[Glasgow St Rollox (UK Parliament constituency)|St Rollox]], north of [[Glasgow]], and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chemical Industries In The UK|publisher = American Chemical Society|url=http://the-environment.org.uk/bristish_isles/history_chemical_industry_UK.html|accessdate = 2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soda ash]] was used since ancient times in the production of [[glass]], [[textile]], [[soap]], and [[paper]], and the source of the [[potash]] had traditionally been [[wood]] ashes in [[Western Europe]]. By the 18th century, this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered a prize of 2400 [[French livre|livres]] for a method to produce alkali from sea salt ([[sodium chloride]]). The [[Leblanc process]] was patented in 1791 by [[Nicolas Leblanc]] who then built a Leblanc plant at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref name="Aftalion11"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 11–13 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied his prize money because of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'/&gt;

However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process really took off.&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 14–16 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Losh]] built the first soda works in Britain at the [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] works on the [[River Tyne]] in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large [[tariff]]s on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. [[James Muspratt]]'s chemical works in [[Liverpool]] and Charles Tennant's complex near [[Glasgow]] became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.

[[File:Ernest Solvay.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ernest Solvay]], patented an improved industrial method for the manufacture of [[soda ash]].]]
These huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the [[Industrial Revolution]] matured. Originally, large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda, provoking one of the [[Alkali Act 1863|first pieces of environmental legislation]] to be passed in 1863. This provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution. Methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali.

The [[Solvay process]] was developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrial chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] in 1861. In 1864, Solvay and his brother Alfred constructed a plant in the Belgian town of [[Charleroi]] and in 1874, they expanded into a larger plant in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In the same year, [[Ludwig Mond]] visited Solvay to acquire the rights to use his process, and he and [[John Tomlinson Brunner|John Brunner]] formed the firm of [[Brunner Mond|Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.]], and built a Solvay plant at [[Winnington]], England. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success; he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process.

===Expansion and maturation===
The late [[19th century]] saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured. Large chemical industries also took shape in Germany and later in the United States.

[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1866.JPG|thumb|right|The factories of the German firm [[BASF]], in 1866.]]
Production of artificial manufactured [[fertilizer]] for [[agriculture]] was pioneered by Sir [[John Lawes]] at his purpose-built [[Rothamsted Research]] facility. In the 1840s he established large works near [[London]] for the manufacture of [[Monocalcium phosphate|superphosphate of lime]]. Processes for the [[vulcanization of rubber]] were patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in the United States and [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by [[William Henry Perkin]] in [[London]]. He partly transformed [[aniline]] into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer AG|Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Herbert Henry Dow|Herbert Henry Dow's]] use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from [[brine]] was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bromineproduction.html|title=Electrolytic Production of Bromine - National Historic Chemical Landmark - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[petrochemical]] industry can be traced back to the oil works of [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in Scotland and [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]] in Canada. The first plastic was invented by [[Alexander Parkes]], an English [[metallurgy|metallurgist]]. In 1856, he patented [[Parkesine]], a [[celluloid]] based on [[nitrocellulose]] treated with a variety of solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UK Patent office|title=Patents for inventions|year=1857|publisher=UK Patent office|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nCoU-2tAx8C&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The industrial production of [[soap]] from vegetable oils was started by [[William Lever]] and his brother [[James Darcy Lever|James]] in 1885 in [[Lancashire]] based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used [[glycerin]] and [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Jeannifer Filly Sumayku, [http://www.thepresidentpost.com/?p=2621 Unilever: Providing Enjoyable and Meaningful Life to Customers], ''The President Post, 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, chemical firms consolidated into large [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s; [[IG Farben]] in Germany, [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in France and [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain. [[DuPont|Dupont]] became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in America.

Currently chemical production is a high-tech industry, where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Gabriele |last= Centi|title=Resources and energy efficiency :the winning strategy for chemical industry |journal=La Chimica  l'Industria |publisher=Società Chimica Italiana|url=https://www.soc.chim.it/sites/default/files/chimind/pdf/2012_1_64_ca.pdf|issue=  1|date = January 2012|pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
"Polymers and plastics, especially [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], [[polystyrene]] and [[polycarbonate]] comprise about 80% of the industry’s output worldwide".&lt;ref name=Chemistry&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry in Daily Life|last=Singh|first=Kirpal|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|isbn=978-81-203-4617-8|date=July 2012|page=132|chapter=17.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials are often converted to [[fluoropolymer]] tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluorotherm.com/technical-information/materials-overview/ptfe-properties/|title=PTFE Properties|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fluorotherm Polymers, Inc.|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals are used in a lot of different consumer goods, but they are also used in a lot of different other sectors; including agriculture manufacturing, construction, and service industries.&lt;ref name=Chemistry /&gt; Major industrial customers include rubber and [[plastic]] products, [[textile]]s, apparel, petroleum refining, [[paper chemicals|pulp and paper]], and primary metals. Chemicals are nearly a $3 trillion global enterprise, and the EU and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories, including basic chemicals (about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output), life sciences (30 percent), specialty chemicals (20 to 25 percent) and consumer products (about 10 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Technofunc|title=Sectors of Chemical Industry|url=http://www.technofunc.com/index.php/domain-knowledge/chemicals-industry/item/sectors-of-chemical-industry|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Chemicals &amp; Commodity Chemicals to Polymers and Specialty Chemicals===

[[File:Slovnaft - new polypropylene plant PP3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|New polypropylene plant PP3 in the [[Slovnaft]] oil refinery ([[Bratislava]], Slovakia)]]
Basic chemicals, or "commodity chemicals" are a broad chemical category including polymers, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic chemicals]], and [[fertilizer]]s. Typical growth rates for basic chemicals are about 0.5 to 0.7 times GDP.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Product prices are generally less than fifty cents per pound.{Citation needed|date=May 2010}

'''Polymers''', the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value, includes all categories of [[plastics industry|plastics]] and man-made fibers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The major markets for plastics are [[packaging]], followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and games. 
* The largest-volume polymer product, [[polyethylene]] (PE), is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles, containers, and pipe.
* [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), another large-volume product, is principally used to make piping for construction markets as well as siding and, to a much smaller extent, transportation and packaging materials.
* [[Polypropylene]] (PP), similar in volume to PVC, is used in markets ranging from packaging, appliances, and containers to clothing and carpeting.
* [[Polystyrene]] (PS), another large-volume plastic, is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation.
* The leading [[synthetic fiber|man-made fibers]] include [[polyester]], [[nylon]], polypropylene, and [[Acrylic fiber|acrylics]], with applications including apparel, home furnishings, and other industrial and consumer use.
The principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Chemicals in the bulk '''[[petrochemicals]]''' and intermediates are primarily made from [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[natural gas]], and [[crude oil]]. Their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 
Typical large-volume products include [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[xylenes]], [[methanol]], [[vinyl chloride monomer]] (VCM), [[styrene]], [[butadiene]], and [[ethylene oxide]]. These basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many [[polymer]]s and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the [[specialty chemicals]] category (see below).

'''Other derivatives''' and basic industrials include [[synthetic rubber]], [[surfactant]]s, [[dye]]s and [[pigment]]s, [[turpentine]], [[resin]]s, [[carbon black]], [[explosive]]s, and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals' external sales.

'''[[inorganic chemistry|Inorganic chemicals]]''' (about 12 percent of the revenue output) make up the oldest of the chemical categories. Products include [[salt]], [[chlorine]], [[caustic soda]], [[soda ash]], acids (such as [[nitric acid]], [[phosphoric acid]], and [[sulfuric acid]]), [[titanium dioxide]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

'''[[Fertilizers]]''' are the smallest category (about 6 percent) and include [[phosphate]]s, [[ammonia]], and [[potash]] chemicals.

===Life sciences===
Life sciences (about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business) include differentiated chemical and biological substances, [[pharmaceutical]]s, diagnostics, [[veterinary medicine|animal health products]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[pesticides]]. While much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors, their products tend to have very high prices—over ten dollars per pound—growth rates of 1.5 to 6 times GDP, and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales. Life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. Pesticides, also called "crop protection chemicals", are about 10 percent of this category and include [[herbicides]], [[insecticide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Specialty chemicals===
[[Specialty chemicals]] are a category of relatively high valued, rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets. Typical growth rates are one to three times GDP with prices over a dollar per pound. They are generally characterized by their innovative aspects. Products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain. Products include electronic chemicals, [[industrial gases]], adhesives and sealants as well as coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals, and catalysts. In 2012, excluding fine chemicals, the $546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33% Paints, Coating and Surface Treatments, 27% Advanced Polymer, 14% Adhesives and Sealants, 13% additives and 13% pigments and inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher==Marketline|title=Global Specialty Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=15 November 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speciality chemicals]] are sold as effect or performance chemicals. Sometimes they are mixtures of formulations, unlike "[[fine chemicals]]," which are almost always single-molecule products.

===Consumer products===
Consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, and [[cosmetics]]. Typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times GDP.

Consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives, such as in plastics, cleaning materials, cosmetics, paints &amp; coatings, electronic gadgets, automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=MarketLine|title=Global Speciality Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|access-date=2012-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as [[pesticides]], [[Polymers|speciality polymers]], electronic chemicals, [[surfactants]], construction chemicals, Industrial Cleaners, [[flavours]] and [[fragrances]], speciality coatings, printing inks, water-soluble polymers, [[food additives]], [[paper chemicals]], oil field chemicals, plastic adhesives, [[adhesives]] and [[sealants]], [[Cosmetic ingredients|cosmetic chemicals]], [[Water treatment|water management chemicals]], [[catalysts]], textile chemicals. Chemical companies rarely supply these products directly to the consumer.

Every year, the [[American Chemistry Council]] tabulates the U.S. production volume of the top 100 chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=Every+year,+the+American+Chemistry+Council+tabulates+the+U.S.+production+volume+of+the+top+100+chemicals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shhcD&amp;sig=-o3fTx4ZfLPxIGxuBcvCgg7sZXE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5nKWf2v3YAhWo44MKHa2mC38Q6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Every%20year,%20the%20American%20Chemistry%20Council%20tabulates%20the%20U.S.%20production%20volume%20of%20the%20top%20100%20chemicals&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2000, the aggregate production volume of the top 100 chemicals totalled 502 million tons, up from 397 million tons in 1990. 
Inorganic chemicals tend to be the largest volume, though much smaller in dollar revenue terms due to their low prices. The top 11 of the 100 chemicals in 2000 were [[sulfuric acid]] (44 million tons), [[nitrogen]] (34), [[ethylene]] (28), [[oxygen]] (27), [[Lime (material)|lime]] (22), [[ammonia]] (17), [[propylene]] (16), [[polyethylene]] (15), [[chlorine]] (13), [[phosphoric acid]] (13) and [[diammonium phosphate]]s (12).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=The+top+11+of+the+100+chemicals+in+2000+were+sulfuric+acid+(44+million+tons),+nitrogen+(34),+ethylene+(28),+oxygen+(27),+lime+(22),+ammonia+(17),+propylene+(16),+polyethylene+(15),+chlorine+(13),+phosphoric+acid+(13)+and+diammonium+phosphates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shn3D&amp;sig=D8nl9Hp1kPzKBtgFXCx7Rk5XXsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInJmS3P3YAhVp5IMKHdb7BW4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20top%2011%20of%20the%20100%20chemicals%20in%202000%20were%20sulfuric%20acid%20(44%20million%20tons),%20nitrogen%20(34),%20ethylene%20(28),%20oxygen%20(27),%20lime%20(22),%20ammonia%20(17),%20propylene%20(16),%20polyethylene%20(15),%20chlorine%20(13),%20phosphoric%20acid%20(13)%20and%20diammonium%20phosphates&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers working to produce a sustainable process for use in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat, friction, pressure, emissions, and contaminants.]]

From the perspective of chemical engineers, the chemical industry involves the use of [[chemical process]]es such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[refining]] methods to produce a wide variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.  Most of these products serve to [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] other items, although a smaller number go directly to consumers.  [[Solvent]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[lye]], [[sodium carbonate|washing soda]], and [[portland cement]] provide a few examples of product used by consumers.

The industry includes manufacturers of [[inorganic]]- and [[Organic chemistry|organic]]-industrial chemicals, ceramic products, petrochemicals, agrochemicals,  polymers and rubber (elastomers), oleochemicals (oils, fats, and waxes), explosives, fragrances and flavors.

Although the [[pharmaceutical]] industry is often considered{{Who|date=November 2010}} a '''chemical industry ''', it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category.  Other closely related industries include [[petroleum]], [[glass]], [[paint]], [[ink]], [[sealant]], [[adhesive]], and [[food processing]] manufacturers.

Chemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in [[chemical plant]]s to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels.  In many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of [[catalyst]]s. The products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including [[distillation]] especially [[fractional distillation]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[crystallization]], [[adsorption]], [[filtration]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and [[drying]].

The processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site [[quality control]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]] to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required [[specification]]s. More organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and [[manufacturing]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical and Agrochemical Enterprise Quality Management Software|url=http://www.spartasystems.com/industries/other-industries/chemical-and-agrochemical/|publisher=Sparta Systems, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The products are packaged and delivered by many methods, including pipelines, tank-cars, and tank-trucks (for both solids and liquids), cylinders, drums, bottles, and boxes.  Chemical companies often have a [[research-and-development]] laboratory for developing and testing products and processes.  These facilities may include pilot plants, and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant(s).

==World Chemical Production ==
[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distillation columns]]
The scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume ([[petrochemical]]s and [[commodity chemicals]]), to [[specialty chemicals]], and the smallest, [[fine chemicals]].

The petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.

Those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the [[United States]], on [[Teesside]] in the [[Northeast of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as [[power stations]], [[Port|port facilities]], road and rail terminals. To demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] on [[Teesside]].
 
Specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes. These manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks.

===Continents and Countries===
In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6trCF6poRSQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=In+the+U.S.+there+are+170+major+chemical+companies.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLyrPv3P3YAhUC7YMKHX3eD3IQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20U.S.%20there%20are%20170%20major%20chemical%20companies.&amp;f=false|title=CHEMISTRY IN DAILY LIFE|last=SINGH|first=KIRPAL|date=2012-07-07|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120346178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;They operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. The U.S. chemical output is $750 billion a year.  The U.S. industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the United States alone. The chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over $5 billion annually on pollution abatement.

In Europe the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. Since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the EU.

in 2012 The chemical sector accounted for 12% of the EU manufacturing industry's added value. Europe remains world’s biggest chemical trading region with 43% of the world’s exports and 37%of the world’s imports, although the latest data shows that Asia is catching up with 34% of the exports and 37% of imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except Japan and China where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance. Europe’s trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stan|last=Higgins|publisher=Chemical News|title=European Chemicals Industry:A review|url=http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf|date=April 2013|pages=18–20|access-date=2013-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723230317/http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf#|archive-date=2015-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the European Chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion Euros to 539 billion Euros a picture of constant growth. Despite this the European industry’s share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36% to 20%. This has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data suggest that 95% of this impact is from China alone. In 2012 the data from the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)shows that 5 European countries account for 71% of the EU's chemicals sales. These are Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic [[organic polymer]]s used as [[plastics]], [[fibres]] and [[elastomers]]. Historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world, Western Europe, North America and Japan (the Triad). The European Community remains the largest producer area followed by the US and Japan.

The traditional dominance of chemical production by the Triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price, labour cost, energy cost, differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures. Instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in China, India, Korea, the Middle East, South East Asia, Nigeria, and Brazil.

Just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry, we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank, with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export.  Though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope, the bulk of the world’s $3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations. The United States alone produced $689 billion, 18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747|title=Global Business of Chemistry|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019103305/http://americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747#|archive-date=2010-10-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''East 4th Street''' is a major downtown district in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], known for its food, entertainment, and lack of car traffic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.east4thstreet.com/ Retrieved on 2015-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; The street runs south from [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)|Euclid Avenue]] to Prospect Avenue. Once a very run down street, the area has been given new life by a multitude of restaurateurs, investors, small business owners and the city of Cleveland itself &lt;ref&gt;http://greaterclevelandlife.com/neighborhoods/east-4th-street/ Retrieved on 2015-08-18&lt;/ref&gt;. The area is the location of many established Cleveland restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and apartments. 

The old [[Cleveland Arcade]] is located across Euclid Avenue from East 4th Street. The historic [[May Company Ohio]] Building is down Euclid Avenue toward [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]]. The new [[The Beacon (Cleveland)|The Beacon]] apartment tower is across the street and down on East 6th Street. The [[Park Building (Cleveland, Ohio)|Park Building]], The Lofts at Rosetta Center, The Euclid, The Frederick, The Commercial, The Windsor, and The Buckeye Building are all apartment blocks in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.east4thstreet.com/live Retrieved on 2015-08-18&lt;/ref&gt;.

Additionally, the district butts up against the [[Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex]] which includes [[Quicken Loans Arena]], home of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], [[Progressive Field]], home of the [[Cleveland Indians]], and numerous bars and restaurants. It is also katty corner from the developing [[NuCLEus]] project. 

The current official logo of the district features the word east super imposed with an elongated "A" that is actually a four when looked at more carefully. The street is given a Mardi Gras atmosphere due to its being festooned with over hanging bubble lights along the entire length of the avenue. No vehicular traffic is allowed to travel up or down the street due to the heavy foot traffic.

'''East Side Access''' is a [[public works]] project under construction by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) in [[New York City]], which will extend the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) from its [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] in [[Queens]] into a new station under [[Grand Central Terminal]] on [[Manhattan]]'s [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]]. The new station and tunnels are tentatively scheduled to start service in December 2022.&lt;ref name="Siff 2018"/&gt;

An LIRR connection to the East Side of Manhattan was first proposed in 1963. The LIRR line was included in the [[Program for Action]], which was published in 1968 and called for numerous transit improvements in the New York City area. Budgetary constraints prevented the construction of any part of the connection other than the [[63rd Street Tunnel]] under the [[East River]]. Plans for the LIRR connection were revived in the late 1990s. After the project received federal funding in 2006, construction commenced in 2007. The tunnels on the Manhattan side were dug from 2007 to 2011, and the connecting tunnels on the Queens side was dug up until 2012. Afterward, work began on other structures related to the line, such as the new Grand Central Terminal, ventilation and ancillary building, communication and utility systems, and the supporting rail infrastructure in Queens.

The new terminal will contain eight tracks and four platforms in a two-level station {{Convert|100|ft|m}} below street level. It is being built in conjunction with several other expansion projects across the LIRR, including an additional track on the LIRR's [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] and a new [[Sunnyside station (LIRR)|Sunnyside station]] in Queens. East Side Access has faced controversy for its multiple delays, high cost, and bloated scope.  The estimated budget for construction has risen nearly threefold from the original estimate of $3.5 billion, and the originally planned opening date of 2009 has been delayed by fifteen years. With a cost estimate of $11.1 billion {{as of|April 2018|lc=y}}, East Side Access is one of the world's most expensive underground rail-construction projects.

===Route===
Extending between [[Sunnyside, Queens|Sunnyside]], [[Queens]], and Grand Central, the East Side Access project is creating an LIRR branch from [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|its Main Line]] through new track connections in [[Sunnyside Yard]] and through the lower level of the existing [[63rd Street Tunnel]] under the [[East River]]. A storage yard in Sunnyside is also being built, connecting to the 63rd Street Tunnel via a [[balloon loop|loop]]. In Manhattan new tunnels begin at the western end of the 63rd Street Tunnel at [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]], curving south under [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] and entering a new LIRR terminal beneath Grand Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/comout_esa_alt.html |title=Capital Programs East Side Access |last= |first= |date= |website=web.mta.info |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Queens side, four tunnels merge into two tracks and enter the lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel. Three of them (Tunnels A, B/C, and D) will connect to the busy [[Harold Interlocking]] within Sunnyside Yard, splitting off the Main Line. A fourth tunnel on a lower level will connect to the Midday Storage Yard.&lt;ref name=mta20120124/&gt; The Midday Storage Yard, located to the northwest of the existing Sunnyside Yard, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha}} and will contain 24 storage tracks once completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb2/downloads/pdf/east_side_access_winter_2018_newsletter.pdf|title=East Side Access Newsletter|website=[[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|date=Winter 2018|page=2|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tutor Perini]] is constructing the $291 million yard just south of the existing Harold Interlocking.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The new LIRR terminal at Grand Central, located 14 stories below ground, would feature a total of four platforms and eight tracks, plus a new {{convert|350,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail and dining concourse with 25 retail spaces. There would be two caverns containing one platform and two tracks on each of two levels; the concourse would be located between the two platform levels.&lt;ref name="NBC-ESA-2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/MTA-East-Side-Access-Project-Grand-Central-Terminal-Long-Island-Rail-Road-Tour-340356972.html |title=Massive East Side Access Project Rolling On Under Grand Central |last=Dobnik |first=Verena |website=nbcnewyork.com |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald Community Newspapers 2018"/&gt; The LIRR terminal would initially be accessed via stairwells, 22 elevators, and 47 escalators connecting to the existing food court at the lower level of Grand Central.

South of the station, the four tracks on each level will merge into two {{Convert|1700|ft|m|-long|adj=mid}} storage tracks, with one in each cavern on each level. These storage tracks, which extend under Park Avenue south to 38th Street, will be able to store one {{Convert|1020|ft|m|-long|adj=mid}}, 12-car train. The storage tracks were not part of the original proposal, as they were added in a 2008 modification to the plans for East Side Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capital/esa_docs/Technical%20Memo%203%20Environmental%20Review%20of%20Potential%20Design%20Changes.pdf|title=MTA LIRR East Side Access Technical Memorandum Assessing Design Refinement: Tail Tracks Ventilation Plenum and Grate|last=|first=|date=February 2008|website=|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also includes the construction of several ventilation plants.

''The New York Times'' reported in 2017 that the project was slated to become the most expensive of its kind in the world. With an estimated cost of $12 billion, or approximately {{convert|3,500,000,000|$/mi|$/km}} of new tunnel, the East Side Access tunnels were seven times as expensive as comparable railroad tunnels in other countries.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Cost11Billion-2018"/&gt; Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. Contractors for the MTA were paid more than those working in other cities, even though that provided no construction benefits. Planning for East Side Access cost upward of $2 billion, and planning for MTA projects in general also made up a more significant part of the cost than in other cities' projects. In addition, politicians and trade unions had forced the MTA to hire more workers than were needed. In 2010, an accountant had found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Castillo 2018"/&gt; Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the [[Second Avenue Subway]] and [[7 Subway Extension]], had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities' transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other delays were attributed to the fact that dozens of contracts, some of which conflicted with each other, were bid out separately. Cost increases also occurred due to changing the design while construction was underway; ordering components that were the wrong size; failing to cooperate with other transit agencies in Sunnyside Yard; and making infeasible construction-timeline estimates.&lt;ref name="Castillo 2018"/&gt;

In September 2018, in an effort to alleviate the high costs and shorten delays, the LIRR hired Arthur R. Troup, who previously worked in high-level positions at [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|Atlanta's]] and [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Washington, D.C.'s]] rapid transit systems, as the new leader for the East Side Access project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Castillo | first=Alfonso A. | title=New boss tagged for LIRR East Side Access project | website=Newsday | date=September 25, 2018 | url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/mta-lirr-east-side-access-1.21248373 | access-date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=MTA taps Troup for ESA | website=Railway Age | date=September 25, 2018 | url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/mta-taps-troup-for-esa/ | access-date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
In February 1963, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA) proposed a two-track tunnel for the [[New York City Subway]], which would cross the [[East River]] at 76th Street.

In February 1968, the NYCTA's parent company, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], released the [[Program for Action]], which proposed numerous improvements to subway, railway, and airport service in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. The plan included a new LIRR terminal at a proposed Metropolitan Transportation Center at [[Third Avenue]] and 48th Street in [[East Midtown, Manhattan|East Midtown]]. It also included connections to [[Grand Central Terminal]], with a new northern entrance leading to the center, and the [[Second Avenue Subway]], among other transit services.&lt;ref name="int-arch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Full text of "Metropolitan transportation, a program for action.

It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been more inclined to use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time.&lt;ref name="nyt19730708" /&gt; On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the new terminal under Third Avenue.&lt;ref name="Tolchin"/&gt;

===Plans stalled===
Due to the [[1975 New York City fiscal crisis]], the LIRR project was canceled long before the tunnel was completed. ''The New York Times'' noted that the lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel was still under construction by 1976, even though "officials knew that the tunnel would never be used."&lt;ref name="nyt-1980-10-11" /&gt; [[Richard Ravitch]], the MTA chairman, said that to stop the work was impossible or so costly as to make it impractical subsequent to the construction of the subway portion."&lt;ref name="nyt-1980-10-11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tunnel Project, Five Years Old, Won't Be Used |first=David A. |last=Andelman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/10/11/archives/tunnel-project-five-years-old-wont-be-used-ravitch-orders-inquiry.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 1980 |page=25 |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel was completed along with the upper subway level.&lt;ref name=mta-esa1/&gt;{{rp|17 (PDF p. 20)}}&lt;ref name="nyt-1980-10-11"/&gt; The western end of the tunnel lay dormant under Second Avenue at 63rd Street for three decades.

The 8,600-foot "tunnel to nowhere" was completed "largely for structural reasons — to support the subway tunnel above."&lt;ref name="nyt-1980-10-11" /&gt;

The 63rd Street subway line and LIRR tunnel were completed as far as 29th Street in [[Long Island City]], Queens, with the subway level of the tunnel opening in 1989.

===Plans revived===
By the turn of the century, plans had resurfaced to bring LIRR service to East Midtown. In 1995, officials began the planning process for such a link.&lt;ref name="MTA-ESA-EIS-Mod-AppendixB-2006"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/esa_docs/eafiles06/Appendix%20B%20Upper%20Level%20Loop%20Alternative%20Analysis.pdf |title=East Side Access Modification to Environmental Impact Statement |chapter=Appendix B: Upper Level Loop Analysis |work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[MTA Capital Construction]] |date=April 2006|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} At the time, the MTA was quoted as saying that the LIRR East Side connection would not be completed within the next generation. Two years later, in 1997, U.S. Senator [[Al D'Amato]] started petitioning for an allocation of federal money to connect the LIRR to Grand Central. New York Governor [[George Pataki]] had previously proposed completing the project, but D'Amato's support, as well as the promise of financial backing, increased the likelihood that construction would actually commence. At the time, if everything went favorably, the LIRR link could open by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perez-Pena |first=Richard |title=Proposed L.I.R.R.

The scope of the project within Queens also included the construction of two bypass tunnels for Amtrak trains within Harold Interlocking. While eastbound Amtrak trains to New England would be able to go through the interlocking without crossing the paths of East Side Access trains, westbound Amtrak trains to Penn Station would use tracks that intersected East Side Access tracks.

As part of the Jamaica project, the MTA is constructing a new platform for the [[Atlantic Branch]], as well as re-configuring track layouts and installing high-speed switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apta.com/mc/rail/previous/2014/papers/Papers/Beth%20Kulick%20Reconfiguration.pdf|title=Jamaica Interlocking Reconfiguration Operations Simulation|last=Kulick|first=Beth|date=2014|website=apta.com|publisher=TranSystems Corporation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the project is complete, the Atlantic Branch would function as a high-frequency shuttle service to [[Atlantic Terminal]], and all trains from Long Island would proceed to either [[Long Island City station]], Penn Station, or Grand Central via the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/news-lirr-long-island-rail-road-jamaica-hicksville-governor/2016/09/21/121-million-initiative|title=$121 Million Initiative to Rebuild Hicksville Station Begins Construction;  $64.9 Million Contract Award to Improve Jamaica Station|last=|first=|date=September 21, 2016|website=www.mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the project, which includes the new platform, is planned to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2019 at a cost of $301.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/180521_1400_CPOC.pdf |title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Committee Meeting |date=May 21, 2018 |accessdate=October 2, 2018 |work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTA is also installing storage tracks at two LIRR stations as part of the East Side Access readiness project. One storage track, a {{convert|1,700|ft|m|adj=on}} siding under construction near [[Massapequa station]] on the [[Babylon Branch]], would be used to store trains that originate or terminate at Massapequa, allowing for increased peak-hour service between Massapequa and Penn Station/Grand Central. {{as of|2017}}, it is planned for completion in April 2019.&lt;ref name="Nov 2017"/&gt; The MTA is also extending Track 2 on the [[Port Washington Branch]], which ends as a pocket track east of [[Great Neck station|Great Neck]] station, an additional {{convert|1,200|ft|m}} east, making it long enough to store two trainsets. It is also installing a new bridge at Colonial Road, near the station.&lt;ref name="Great Neck Record"&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Announces Second Pocket Track Proposed for LIRR in Great Neck|url=https://antonnews.com/greatneckrecord/news/11688-mta-announces-second-pocket-track-proposed-for-lirr-in-great-neck.html|publisher=Great Neck Record|author=Wendy Karpel Kreitzman|date=November 19, 2010|access-date=May 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209021339/https://antonnews.com/greatneckrecord/news/11688-mta-announces-second-pocket-track-proposed-for-lirr-in-great-neck.html|archive-date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA LIRR Proposed Colonial Road Improvement Project|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=658cb1gQ9lU|publisher=MTA Long Island Rail Road|accessdate=November 18, 2011|date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/colonialroad/infocenter.htm|title=MTA LIRR - Colonial Road Improvement Project|website=web.mta.info|access-date=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIRR Opens Info Center at Great Neck Station for Proposed Colonial Road Improvement Project|url=http://www.mta.info/mta/news/releases/?agency=lirr&amp;en=110328-LIRR27|publisher=MTA Long Island Rail Road|accessdate=November 18, 2011|author=Sam Zambuto|author2=Salvatore Arena|date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the pocket track is scheduled for completion in December 2018 at a total cost of $45.2 million.&lt;ref name="Nov 2017"/&gt;

Finally, the MTA is planning to expand two yards as part of the project. The Port Washington Yard, adjacent to [[Port Washington station]] on the [[Port Washington Branch]], would be expanded to allow for storage of two additional ten-car trains. {{As of|2017}}, construction is scheduled to begin in late 2020 or early 2021 and would cost $500,000.&lt;ref name="Nov 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/capitaldashboard/allframenew_head.html?PROJNUM=l60601yl&amp;PLTYPE=1|title=L60601YL Port Washington Yard Reconfiguration|last=|first=|date=|website=web.mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MTA would also expand the existing rail yard along the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]]/[[Ronkonkoma Branch]] adjacent to [[Ronkonkoma station]].

===New railcars===
The LIRR is also purchasing additional railcars to provide passenger capacity for East Side Access. Up to 160 [[M9 (railcar)|M9A]] cars might be built specifically to allow for train capacity increases, and are paid for using federal grant money attached to the East Side Access project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=LIRR seeks M9A EMUs | website=Railway Age | date=December 6, 2017 | url=https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/rapid-transit/lirr-seeks-m9a-emus/ | access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald Community Newspapers 2018"/&gt;

===Penn Station Access===
{{main|Penn Station Access}}
Redirecting LIRR trains from Penn Station to Grand Central Terminal would free up track and platform space at Penn. This new capacity, as well as track connections resulting from the East Side Access project, would allow [[Metro-North Railroad]] trains on the [[New Haven Line]] to run to Penn Station via Amtrak's [[Hell Gate Bridge]]. Four new local Metro-North stations in [[the Bronx]] are planned as part of this project, at [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]], [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]], [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester]], and [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]]. The MTA also proposes a second connection from the Metro-North's [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] to Penn Station using Amtrak's [[West Side Line]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/planning/psas/pdf/PennAccess_MTAweb.pdf|title=Metro-North Penn Station Access|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Penn Station Access project would provide direct rides from [[Connecticut]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], the [[Hudson Valley|Lower Hudson Valley]], and the Bronx to West Midtown; ease reverse-commuting from Manhattan and the Bronx to Westchester County, the Lower Hudson Valley, and Connecticut; and provide transportation service to areas of the Bronx without direct subway service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/docs/Penn%20Station%20Access%20Project%20Overview.pdf |title=MTACC Quarterly Progress Report to CPOC Penn Station Access Project Overview December 12, 2016 |date=December 12, 2016 |work=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]] |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used in conjunction with an [[electronic signature]], it can provide evidence whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. In a time where fraud and [[identity theft]] has become rampant, electronic authentication can be a more secure method of verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balbas|first1=Luis|title=Digital Authentication - Factors, Mechanisms and Schemes|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-factors-mechanisms-schemes|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various e-authentication methods that can be used to authenticate a user's identify ranging from a password to higher levels of security that utilize [[multifactor authentication]] (MFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMahon|first1=Mary|title=What is E-Authentication?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-e-authentication.htm|website=wiseGEEK|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of security used, the user might need to prove his or her identity through the use of [[security token]]s, challenge questions or being in possession of a certificate from a third-party certificate authority that attests to their identity.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Digital Authentication - the Basics|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-the-basics|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Digital enrollment and authentication reference process.jpg|thumb|Digital enrollment and authentication reference process by the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] The American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has developed a generic electronic authentication model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Newton|first3=Elaine|title=Electronic Authentication Guideline|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63-1/SP-800-63-1.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a basic framework on how the authentication process is accomplished regardless of jurisdiction or geographic region. According to this model, the enrollment process begins with an individual applying to a [[Credential Service Provider]] (CSP). The CSP will need to prove the applicant's identity before proceeding with the transaction. Once the applicant's identity has been confirmed by the CSP, he or she receives the status of "subscriber", is given an authenticator, such as a token and a credential, which may be in the form of a username.

The CSP is responsible for managing the credential along with the subscriber's enrollment data for the life of the credential. The subscriber will be tasked with maintaining the authenticators. An example of this is when a user normally uses a specific computer to do their online banking. If he or she attempts to access their bank account from another computer, the authenticator will not be present. In order to gain access, the subscriber would need to verify their identity to the CSP, which might be in the form of answering a challenge question successfully before being given access.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics" /&gt;

==History==
The need for authentication has been prevalent throughout history. In ancient times, people would identify each other through eye contact and physical appearance. The [[Sumer]]ians in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] attested to the authenticity of their writings by using seals embellished with identifying symbols. As time moved on, the most common way to provide authentication would be the handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication factors==
There are three generally accepted factors that are used to establish a digital identity for electronic authentication, including:
* Knowledge factor, which is something that the user knows, such as a password, answers to challenge questions, ID numbers or a PIN.
* Possession factor, which is something that the user has, such as mobile phone, PC or token
* [[Biometric]] factor, which is something that the user is, such as his or her fingerprints, eye scan or voice pattern
Out of the three factors, the biometric factor is the most convenient and convincing to prove an individual's identity. However, having to rely on this sole factor can be expensive to sustain. Although having their own unique weaknesses, by combining two or more factors allows for reliable authentication. It is always recommended to use multifactor authentication for that reason.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Methods==
Authentication systems are often categorized by the number of factors that they incorporate. The three factors often considered as the cornerstone of authentication are:
Something you know (for example, a password)
Something you have (for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key)
Something you are (for example, a voice print, thumb print or other biometric)

Multifactor authentication is generally more secure than single-factor authentication. But, some multi-factor authentication approaches are still vulnerable to cases like man-in-the-middle attacks and Trojan attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=The Failure of Two-Factor Authentication|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_failure_of.html|website=Schneier on Security|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods used in authentication systems are summarized below.

=== Token ===
[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumb|A sample of token]]
Tokens generically are something the claimant possesses and controls that may be used to authenticate the claimant's identity. In e-authentication, the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network. Therefore, a token used for e-authentication is a secret and the token must be protected. The token may, for example, be a cryptographic key, that is protected by encrypting it under a password. An impostor must steal the encrypted key and learn the password to use the token.

=== Passwords and PIN-based authentication===
Passwords and PINs are categorized as "something you know" method. A combination of numbers, symbols, and mixed cases are considered to be stronger than all-letter password. Also, the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) features during the information transmission process will as well create an encrypted channel for data exchange and to further protect information delivered. Currently, most security attacks target on password-based authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Passwords and PINs based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=2 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015717/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public-key authentication===
This type of authentication has two parts. One is a public key, the other is a private key. A public key is issued by a Certification Authority and is available to any user or server.  A private key is known by the user only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Public-Key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015722/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetric-key authentication===
The user shares a unique key with an authentication server. When the user sends a randomly generated message (the challenge) encrypted by the secret key to the authentication server, if the message can be matched by the server using its shared secret key, the user is authenticated.
When implemented together with the password authentication, this method also provides a possible solution for two-factor authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Symmetric-key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709050327/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMS-based authentication===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|Biometric authentication]]
The user receives password by reading the message in the cell phone, and types back the password to complete the authentication. [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) is very effective when cell phones are commonly adopted. SMS is also suitable against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, since the use of SMS does not involve the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=SMS based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827103712/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biometric authentication ===
Biometric authentication is the use of unique physical attributes and body measurements as the intermediate for better identification and access control. Physical characteristics that are often used for authentication include fingerprints, voice recognition, face, recognition, and iris scans because all of these are unique to every individual separately. Traditionally, Biometric Authentication based on token-based identification systems, such as passport, and nowadays becomes one of the most secure identification systems to user protections. A new technological innovation which provides a wide variety of either behavioral or physical characteristics which are defining the proper concept of Biometric Authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Biometric Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108205213/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital identity authentication ===
Digital identity authentication refers to the combined use of device, behavior, location and other data, including email address, account and credit card information, to authenticate online users in real time.

==Electronic credentials==
Paper credentials are documents that attest to the identity or other attributes of an individual or entity called the subject of the credentials. Some common paper credentials include passports, [[birth certificate]]s, driver's licenses, and employee identity cards. The credentials themselves are authenticated in a variety of ways: traditionally perhaps by a signature or a seal, special papers and inks, high quality engraving, and today by more complex mechanisms, such as holograms, that make the credentials recognizable and difficult to copy or forge. In some cases, simple possession of the credentials is sufficient to establish that the physical holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. More commonly, the credentials contain biometric information such as the subject's description, a picture of the subject or the handwritten signature of the subject that can be used to authenticate that the holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. When these paper credentials are presented in-person, authentication [[biometrics]] contained in those credentials can be checked to confirm that the physical holder of the credential is the subject.

Electronic identity credentials bind a name and perhaps other attributes to a token. There are a variety of [[Electronic identification|electronic credential]] types in use today, and new types of credentials are constantly being created (eID, [[Voter ID laws|electronic voter ID card]], biometric passports, bank cards, etc.) At a minimum, credentials include identifying information that permits recovery of the records of the registration associated with the credentials and a name that is associated with the subscriber.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Verifiers==
In any authenticated on-line transaction, the verifier is the party that verifies that the claimant has possession and control of the token that verifies his or her identity. A claimant authenticates his or her identity to a verifier by the use of a token and an authentication protocol. This is called Proof of Possession (PoP). Many PoP protocols are designed so that a verifier, with no knowledge of the token before the authentication protocol run, learns nothing about the token from the run. The verifier and CSP may be the same entity, the verifier and [[relying party]] may be the same entity or they may all three be separate entities. It is undesirable for verifiers to learn shared secrets unless they are a part of the same entity as the CSP that registered the tokens. Where the verifier and the relying party are separate entities, the verifier must convey the result of the authentication protocol to the relying party. The object created by the verifier to convey this result is called an assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Polk|first3=W|title=INFORMATION SECURITY|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authentication schemes==
There are four types of authentication schemes: local authentication, centralized authentication, global centralized authentication, global authentication and web application (portal).

When using a local authentication scheme, the application retains the data that pertains to the user's credentials. This information is not usually shared with other applications. The onus is on the user to maintain and remember the types and number of credentials that are associated with the service in which they need to access. This is a high risk scheme because of the possibility that the storage area for passwords might become compromised.

Using the central authentication scheme allows for each user to use the same credentials to access various services. Each application is different and must be designed with interfaces and the ability to interact with a central system to successfully provide authentication for the user. This allows the user to access important information and be able to access private keys that will allow he or she to electronically sign documents.

Using a third party through a global centralized authentication scheme allows the user direct access to authentication services. This then allows the user to access the particular services they need.

The most secure scheme is the global centralized authentication and web application (portal). It is ideal for E-Government use because it allows a wide range of services. It uses a single authentication mechanism involving a minimum of two factors to allow access to required services and the ability to sign documents.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication and digital signing working together==
Often, authentication and digital signing are applied in conjunction. In [[advanced electronic signature]]s, the signatory has authenticated and uniquely linked to a signature. In the case of a [[qualified electronic signature]] as defined in the [[eIDAS]]-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified [[trust service provider]]. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature – commonly referred to as [[non-repudiation]] of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called non-repudiation of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature loses validity.&lt;ref name="Turner-NonRep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Understanding Non-Repudiation of Origin and Non-Repudiation of Emission|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-non-repudiation-of-origin-and-non-repudiation-of-emission|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics biometric authentication==

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Biometric authentication can be defined by many different procedures and sensors which are being used to produce security. Biometric can be separated into physical or behavioral security. Physical protection is based on identification through fingerprint, face, hand, iris, etc. On the other hand, behavioral safety is succeeded by keystroke, signature, and voice.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3e6/b094d8052137c6e91f9c89cba860d356483a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main point is that all of these different procedures and mechanism that exist, produce the same homogeneous result, namely the security of the system and users. When thinking of the decoupling of hardware, the hardware is not coded in the same form by digitization which directly makes decoupling more difficult. Because of unlinkability and irreversibility of biometric templates, this technology can secure user authentication.

=== Digital traces ===
Biometric authentication has a substantial impact on digital traces. For example when the user decides to use his fingerprint to protect his data on his smartphone, then the system memorizes the input so it will be able to be re-used again. During this procedure and many other similar applications proves that the digital trace is vital and exist on biometric authentication.

=== Connectivity ===
Another characteristic of biometric authentication is that it combines different components such as security tokens with computer systems to protect the user. Another example is the connection between devices, such as camera and computer systems to scan the user’s retina and produce new ways of security. So biometric authentication could be defined by connectivity as long it connects different applications or components and through these users are getting connected and can work under the same roof and especially on a safe environment on the cyber world.

=== Reprogrammable &amp; smart ===
As new kinds of cybercrime are appearing, the ways of authentication must be able to adapt. This adaptation means that it is always ready for evolution and updating, and so it will be able to protect the users at any time. At first biometric authentication started in the sampler form of user’s access and defining user profiles and policies. Over time the need of biometric authentication became more complex, so cybersecurity organizations started reprogramming their products/technology from simple personal user’s access to allow interoperability of identities across multiple solutions. Through this evolution, business value also rises.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.fidis-project.eu/fileadmin/journal/issues/1-2007/Biometric_Implementations_and_the_Implications_for_Security_and_Privacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk assessment ==
When developing electronic systems, there are some industry standards requiring United States agencies to ensure the transactions provide an appropriate level of assurance. Generally, servers adopt the US' [[Office of Management and Budget]]'s (OMB's) E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies (M-04-04) as a guideline, which is published to help federal agencies provide secure electronic services that protect individual privacy. It asks agencies to check whether their transactions require e-authentication, and determine a proper level of assurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Authentication Risk Assessment for Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ecomm/e_rx/risk_assessment_dea_218.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It established four levels of assurance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assurance Level 1: Little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity.&lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 2: Some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 3: High confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 4: Very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.

=== Determining assurance levels ===
The OMB proposes a five-step process to determine the appropriate assurance level for their applications:
* Conduct a risk assessment, which measures possible negative impacts. 
* Compare with the five assurance levels and decide which one suits this case.
* Select technology according to the technical guidance issued by NIST.
* Confirm the selected authentication process satisfies requirements.
* Reassess the system regularly and adjust it with changes.&lt;ref name="OMB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolten|first1=Joshua|title=Memorandum: E-Authentication Guideline for Federal Agencies|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf|publisher=Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The required level of authentication assurance are assessed through the factors below:
* Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation;
* Financial loss or agency liability;
* Harm to agency programs or public interests;
* Unauthorized release of sensitive information;
* Personal safety; and/or civil or criminal violations.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt;

=== Determining technical requirements ===
[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) guidance defines technical requirements for each of the four levels of assurance in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tokens are used for proving identity. Passwords and symmetric cryptographic keys are private information that the verifier needs to protect. Asymmetric cryptographic keys have a private key (which only the subscriber knows) and a related public key.
* Identity proofing, registration, and the delivery of credentials that bind an identity to a token. This process can involve a far distance operation.
* Credentials, tokens, and authentication protocols can also be combined together to identify that a claimant is in fact the claimed subscriber. 
* An assertion mechanism that involves either a digital signature of the claimant or is acquired directly by a trusted third party through a secure authentication protocol.

==Guidelines and regulations==
Triggered by the growth of new cloud solutions and online transactions, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine identities play a significant role in identifying individuals and accessing information. According to the Office of Management and Budget in the U.S, more than $70 million was spent on identity management solutions in both 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Shawn|title=E-authentication: What IT managers will be focusing on over the next 18 months|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2013/07/31/eauthentication.aspx|website=GCN|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments use e-authentication systems to offer services and reduce time people traveling to a government office. Services ranging from applying for visas to renewing driver's licenses can all be achieved in a more efficient and flexible way. Infrastructure to support e-authentication is regarded as an important component in successful e-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agimo.gov.au/infrastructure/authentication|title=Whole of Government Information and Communications Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor coordination and poor technical design might be major barriers to electronic authentication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=27391 Breaking Barriers to eGovernment (Draft Deliverable 1b)], eGovernment unit, European Commission, August 2006. See table 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In several countries there has been established nationwide common e-authentication schemes to ease the reuse of digital identities in different electronic services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanpkiforum.jp/shiryou/e-auth_policy/overview_e-auth_v07.pdf An overview of International Initiatives in the field of Electronic Authentication], Japan PKI Forum, June 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other policy initiatives have included the creation of frameworks for electronic authentication, in order to establish common levels of trust and possibly interoperability between different authentication schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/security-and-authentication/ Australia], [http://e-com.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ecic-ceac.nsf/en/h_gv00090e.html Canada], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf US] (M04-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

===US===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the [[United States government]]'s effort to expand electronic government, or [[e-government]], as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier to access. The e-authentication service enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) from other web sites that both the user and the government  trust.

E-authentication is a government-wide partnership that is supported by the agencies that comprise the Federal CIO Council. The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is the lead agency partner. E-authentication works through an association with a trusted credential issuer, making it necessary for the user to log into the issuer's site to obtain the authentication credentials.  Those credentials or e-authentication ID are then transferred the supporting government web site causing authentication.The system was created in response a December 16, 2003  memorandum was issued through the  Office of Management and Budget.  Memorandum M04-04 Whitehouse.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt; That memorandum updates the guidance issued in the  ''Paperwork Elimination Act'' of 1998, 44 U.S.C. § 3504 and implements section 203 of the E-Government Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 36.

NIST provides guidelines for digital authentication standards and does away with most knowledge-based authentication methods. A stricter standard has been drafted on more complicated passwords that at least 8 characters long or passphrases that are at least 64 characters long.&lt;ref name="NIST800-63-3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft NIST Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Authentication Guideline|url=https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], [[eIDAS]] provides guidelines to be used for electronic authentication in regards to electronic signatures and certificate services for website authentication. Once confirmed by the issuing Member State, other participating States are required to accept the user's electronic signature as valid for cross border transactions.

Under eIDAS, electronic identification refers to a material/immaterial unit that contains personal identification data to be used for authentication for an online service. Authentication is referred to as an electronic process that allows for the electronic identification of a natural or legal person. A trust service is an electronic service that is used to create, verify and validate electronic signatures, in addition to creating, verifying and validating certificates for website authentication.

Article 8 of eIDAS allows for the authentication mechanism that is used by a natural or legal person to use electronic identification methods in confirming their identity to a relying party. Annex IV provides requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the Russia government's effort to expand e-government, as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier for the Russian people to access. The e-authentication service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garant.ru/products/ipo/prime/doc/12092469/|title=Постановление Правительства РФ от 28 ноября 2011 г. N 977 "О федеральной государственной информационной системе "Единая система идентификации и аутентификации в инфраструктуре, обеспечивающей информационно-технологическое взаимодействие информационных систем, используемых для предоставления государственных и муниципальных услуг в электронной форме"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) they already have from web sites that they and the government trust.

== Other applications ==
Apart from government services, e-authentication is also widely used in other technology and industries. These new applications combine the features of authorizing identities in traditional database and new technology to provide a more secure and diverse use of e-authentication. Some examples are described below.

=== Mobile authentication ===
Mobile authentication is the verification of a user's identity through the use a mobile device. It can be treated as an independent field or it can also be applied with other multifactor authentication schemes in the e-authentication field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margaret|first1=Rouse|title=mobile authentication definition|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/mobile-authentication|website=SearchSecurity.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mobile authentication, there are five levels of application sensitivity from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 is for public use over a mobile device and requires no identity authentications, while level 4 has the most multi-procedures to identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of India Department of Electronics and Information Technology Ministry of Communications and Information Technology|title=e-Pramaan: Framework for e-Authentication|url=https://epramaan.gov.in/documents/ePramaan_Framework.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For either level, mobile authentication is relatively easy to process. Firstly, users send a one-time password (OTP) through offline channels. Then, a server identifies the information and makes adjustment in the database. Since only the user has the access to a PIN code and can send information through their mobile devices, there is a low risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tolentino|first1=Jamie|title=How to Increase App Security Through Mobile Phone Authentication|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/03/16/increasing-application-security-with-mobile-phone-authentication/|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=TNW news|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-commerce authentication ===
In the early 1980s, [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) systems was implemented, which was considered as an early representative of E-commerce. But ensuring its security is not a significant issue since the systems are all constructed around closed networks. However, more recently, business-to-consumer transactions have transformed. Remote transacting parties have forced the implementation of E-commerce authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Matthew|title=Identity Authentication and 'E-Commerce'|journal=Warwick, Journal of Information Law &amp;Technology|date=23 Feb 2005|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/1998_3/ford/#a2|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the approaches adopted in E-commerce authentication are basically the same as e-authentication. The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field that focuses on the transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a merchant server via the Internet. The merchant server usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawma|first1=Victor|title=A New Methodology for Deriving Effective Countermeasures Design Models|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.1216&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
To keep up with the evolution of services in the digital world, there is continued need for security mechanisms. While passwords will continued to be used, it is important to rely on authentication mechanisms, most importantly multifactor authentication. As the usage of e-signatures continues to significantly expand throughout the United States, the EU and throughout the world, there is expectation that regulations such as [[eIDAS]] will eventually be amended to reflect changing conditions along with regulations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Walker-Perspectives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Heather|title=How eIDAS affects the USA|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/how-eidas-affects-the-us|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrique Jacobo Pedro Luis Plácido Zóbel de Ayala'''&lt;ref name="baptism"/&gt;  (October 9, 1877 &amp;ndash; February 17, 1943), was a [[Filipinos of Spanish descent|Spanish Filipino]] industrialist and philanthropist who became the first patriarch of the [[Zobel de Ayala family|Zóbel de Ayala family]].  He was also one of the leaders in the [[Philippine Falange]] during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Hermógenes E. Bacareza. A history of Philippine-German relations. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) - APO Production Unit EDSA, 1980. Pp. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Zóbel was born in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], on October 9, 1877 to Jacobo Zóbel y Zangroniz and Trinidad de Ayala y Róxas.&lt;ref name="baptism"/&gt; He had a twin named, Alfonso, who died the age of five. His other siblings were Fernando Antonio, Margarita and Gloria (who died a few months after her birth).

He studied at the [[Letran|Colegio de San Juan de Letran]]. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Real Colegio Alfonso XII in El Escorial, Spain. He pursued postgraduate studies at Liceo de San Luis and the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]], Paris. He was very much interested in engineering and mining, so he also took courses at the [[Mines ParisTech|École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris]], Paris from 1897 to 1901. He also pursued the study of painting in the French capital.

He married his cousin Consuelo Róxas de Ayala in Manila on October 16, 1901. The couple had three children - Jacobo (father of [[Enrique Zobel|Enrique J. Zóbel]]), Alfonso (father of [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala|Jaime Zóbel de Ayala]]) and Mercedes. The union was short-lived after Consuelo succumbed to [[cholera]] on September 25, 1907 at the age of 30.

He was a widower for three years when he met Fermina Montojo de Torrontegui. She was the daughter of the Spanish admiral [[Patricio Montojo]], who led the Spanish fleet against [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] in the [[Battle of Manila Bay]]. They were married on November 12, 1911 and had  four children - Matilde, Consuelo, Gloria, and [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando]] (and namesake of his brother, Fernando Antonio).

==Business career==

He was a managing partner of Ayala y Compañia from 1901 to 1913 and from 1920 until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, his children from Consuelo - Jacobo, Alfonso and Mercedes - would inherit [[Makati City|Hacienda San Pedro de Macati]] from his aunt (and mother of Consuelo), Carmen Róxas de Ayala.  The property was first purchased in 1851 by his great uncle, Jose Bonifacio Róxas, for 52,800 pesos. It was inherited by Róxas' son, Pedro Pablo Róxas (and upon his death in 1912, by his widow, Carmen). In 1929, ownership of the property would be transferred to Ayala y Compañia.&lt;ref&gt;http://ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/dispensations.html&lt;/ref&gt; The property - which had lain in the family’s hands, undeveloped and undisturbed for several decades - would serve as the basis of his family's future wealth.  During the 1930s, [[Zobel Roxas Street|portions of the property]] would be developed, as the company's initial foray into real estate development. In 1937, he offered 42 hectares of the property to be leased for the development of [[Nielson Field]].

On June 21, 1924, the Ayala distillery (Destileria y Licoreria de Ayala y Compañia, maker of Ginebra San Miguel) was sold by Ayala y Compañia to [[Ginebra San Miguel|La Tondeña Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his involvement with the Ayala company, he also established La Porcelanica in 1903 - the first ceramics factory in the Philippines. The following year, he established a glass factory with Eduardo Soriano (father of [[Andres Soriano|Andrés Soriano Sr.]]). He co-founded Filipinas Compañia de Seguros in 1913 and ventured into insurance and finance as vice president of [[Insular Life|Insular Life Assurance Company]], a director of Philippine Guaranty Co. and a director of [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|Banco Español-Filipino]].

==Cultural and philanthropic activities==

Zóbel inherited the liberal ideas and interests of his father Don Jacobo Zóbel y Zangroniz. Like his father, he was educated in Europe, not only in business and sciences, but also in the arts. He loved the cultivation of the arts and culture. His mansion on Plaza del Carmen and Leon Guerrero Street in [[Ermita]], [[Manila]] became the focal point of many tertulias and salon de artistas.
He donated his vast collection of books on European literature to the [[University of the Philippines]] library.

He was the first modern [[Hispanist]] and founded Premio Zóbel in 1929 in order to preserve and promote the use of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish language]], which he believed was the true language of Filipino nationalists. His great obsession was the conservation of the spiritual ties between Spain and the Philippines through the promotion of its language and culture. Premio Zóbel was the fulfillment of his desire that "No quiero que el español muera en Filipinas". Today, Premio Zóbel is administered by his grandchildren, Georgina Padilla MacCrohon and Alejandro Padilla (both children of his daughter, Gloria).

Together with brother Fernando Antonio, he co-founded Casino Español de Manila, a socio-civic club for Hispano-Filipinos. He established the Patronato Escolar Español and the Asociación Pro-Idioma Hispano, both efforts directed at strengthening the role of Spanish in the educational system.  He was a founding member of [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language|Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española]] in 1924, which became the correspondent of the prestigious Real Academia de la Lengua Española.

He dabbled as a Spanish-language publisher when he resuscitated the moribund El Mercantil. He supported the arts and gave scholarships, among them, a young [[Fernando Amorsolo]], who in gratitude would teach his son, [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando]], the rudiments of art.

In 1930, he helped fund the construction of the [[Manila Metropolitan Theater]], a landmark [[art deco]] building designed by [[Juan Arellano]]. He became the treasurer of the Metropolitan Theater Company.

In 1936, he reported the discovery of a horde of Oriental pottery found on his [[Calatagan]], [[Batangas]] property to the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] director Eduardo Quisumbing and subsequently funded the ensuing excavations.

In April 1939, he was appointed by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]] as the acting consul for Spain in the Philippines. The government of Spain, in admiration of his many philanthropic and cultural causes, awarded him La Gran Cruz Isabela la Católica and the Medalla del Mérito Civil.

==Death==

Zóbel died on February 17, 1943 in Manila, at the height of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese Occupation]] during [[World War II]].

:'' "Monkey model" redirects here. For animal testing in medical research, see [[Animal model]].''

'''Export variants of Soviet military equipment''' were versions of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military equipment (armored vehicles, airplanes, missiles) of significantly inferior capability to the original designs and intended only for export.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htproc/20080220.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  '''''Monkey model''''' was the unofficial designation given by the [[Soviet Military]] to such variants.  The monkey model was exported with the same or a similar designation as the original Soviet design but in fact it lacked many of the advanced or expensive features of the original.

Monkey-model weaponry was used mainly by non-[[communism|communist]] Soviet allies, such as [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].  [[Eastern Bloc]] states generally used fully capable versions of Soviet weaponry, although poorer states often used earlier generations of weapons.

The term ''monkey model'' was popularized in the West by [[Viktor Suvorov]], in ''[[Inside the Soviet Army]]''.  Suvorov states that the simplified monkey model was designed for massive production in wartime, to replace front-line stocks if a war should last for several weeks. In peacetime, Soviet industry gained experience building both standard and export-model variants, the latter being for sale "to the 'brothers' and 'friends' of the USSR as the very latest equipment available."  He also cites the benefit of [[disinformation]] when an exported monkey model fell into the hands of Western intelligence, who "naturally gained a completely false impression of the true combat capabilities of the BMP-1  and of Soviet  tanks" .{{sfn|Suvorov|1982|pp=215}}

==Armored vehicles==

Monkey-model tanks were equipped with downgraded fire control systems, downgraded armor, no NBC system, and provided with substandard ammunition. (Their ballistic computers, range finders, and night vision were inferior to those found on production models)

For instance, the 3BM17 APFSDS [[125 mm smoothbore ammunition]] were designed specifically for export, and had a penetration of sloped armor at 2000 m that was inferior to the original Soviet model, the 3BM15. By the time of the [[Gulf War]], both rounds were obsolescent and relegated solely to training purposes (not actual combat). For 3rd world client states, however, they were the most advanced 125mm KE rounds available.

==Aircraft==

Monkey-model aircraft were downgraded in a manner similar to that of tanks. The [[MiG-23]] MS 'Flogger-E', for example, was an export variant the original MiG 23 developed because the MiG 23 was considered too advanced to be exported to Third World countries. The 'Flogger-E' lacked the most advanced features of the original. [[Infra-red search and track]] and [[beyond visual range missile]] capabilities were removed and its [[avionics]] suite was very basic. This variant was widely sold during the 1970s to Soviet allies in the [[Middle East]].

==Effectiveness of monkey models==
The fact that most Soviet-designed tanks and aircraft engaged by western forces during the last decades were actually monkey models must be kept in mind when trying to assess the capabilities of real Soviet-era equipment versus those of contemporary western designs. A good example of this is the dismal performance of Iraqi T-72 models during the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

In each conflict, Iraqi T-72s failed to destroy a single M1 abrams tank, even after scoring direct hits. On the other hand, a publication from the early 80s claims that the 125&amp;nbsp;mm 2A46 gun "will penetrate the armor of any current or future NATO tank at ranges greater than 2,000 meters." &lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Armed Forces Journal International|date=1980|volume=118|publisher=Army and Navy Journal, Incorporated|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Dj9VAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, Robert H. Scales insisted that the 125mm gun "could penetrate the Abrams (frontal armor) at 1,000 meters," provided it was using modern ammunition. {{sfn|Scales|1994|pp=116}} The performance discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Iraqi's used substandard ammunition for their guns, while operating a mix of monkey models and their own locally produced variant, the [[Lion of Babylon (tank)|Lion of Babylon]].

The '''''Gaming Industry Report Magazine''''' (or ''GIR Magazine'' for short) was a subscription-based bimonthly [[video game]] [[trade journal]] that was published by [[GNB News Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2006.

The ''Gaming Industry Report Magazine'' was shut down in 2006. However, it was relaunched as a free online magazine by GNB News Group in January 2006.&lt;ref name="prw"&gt;{{cite news|title=GNB News Group Launches Gaming Industry Report|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/01/prweb330845.htm|accessdate=February 16, 2017|work=prweb|date=January 11, 2006|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2007 JEMS Media Group had plans to relaunch the publication in 2007 as a video game newspaper instead of a magazine.

The ''Gaming Industry Report'' is currently being run by Jeremy Meyer who holds the position of publisher and editor in chief.

The magazine covers all aspects of the business of the video game industry in the US, regulation, technology, finance, and journalism. ''GIR'' is dedicated to providing the most comprehensive weekly analysis on the business of video games, and offers a forum for industry debate and criticism of the medium.

In March 2008, the U.S. Army Geospatial–Enterprise Governance Board (GGB) created the GIO position, with the Director, U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tec.army.mil |title=Army Geospatial Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=Tec.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (TEC) as the U.S. Army's "central manager responsible for coordination, assessment, and synchronization of all Army policies and standardization requirements for the geospatial information enterprise."

Robert Burkhardt, the Army's first GIO stated, “The technology is available to enable battle command systems to collect information once and allow discovery and exploitation by all, however, without these standards, it is difficult to present unified, understandable solutions within and outside of the Army.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Dr. Joseph Fontanella, Director of the U.S. Army Geospatial Center, is the current GIO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agc.army.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Article-View/Article/480940/dr-joseph-f-fontanella/ |title=Army Geospatial Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |publisher=agc.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannibal Muammar Gaddafi'''  ({{lang-ar|هانيبال معمر القذافي}} born {{Birth date|1975|09|20|df=yes}}) is the fifth son of former Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and his second wife, [[Safia Farkash]].

==Biography==
Gaddafi was born in [[Tripoli]], the [[Libyan Arab Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERPOL issues global alert following threat identified in UN sanctions resolution targeting Libya's Colonel Al-Qadhafi and others |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/PressReleases/PR2011/PR015ON.pdf |publisher=[[Interpol]]|accessdate=1 September 2011|date=4 March 2011|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his maritime career by joining the Marine Academy of Maritime Studies/Libya in 1993 as a Deck [[Cadet]]. He graduated in 1999, as a watch keeping officer with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in [[Navigation|marine navigation]].

Soon after he started his maritime career on board various types of GNMTC vessels on various ranks, he obtained successfully the combined [[Chief mate|chief officer]] and [[Master Mariner]] qualification from the [[Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport|Arab Maritime Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Alexandria]] in 2003.

Gaddafi was the first consultant to the Management Committee of the [[General National Maritime Transport Company]] (GNMTC) of Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnmtc.com/default.php?pname=ManagementBoard&amp;la=1 |title=General National Maritime Transport Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzshWA0d?url=http://www.gnmtc.com/default.php?pname%3DManagementBoard%26la%3D1 |archivedate=2012-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to this position in 2007, upon earning his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree in Shipping Economics and Logistics from [[Copenhagen Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.cbs.dk/continuing_education/master_programmes/mba_uddannelser/executive_mba_in_shipping_logistics_the_blue_mba/menu/value/menu/alumni |title=Copenhagen Business School 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721104824/http://uk.cbs.dk/continuing_education/master_programmes/mba_uddannelser/executive_mba_in_shipping_logistics_the_blue_mba/menu/value/menu/alumni |archivedate=2012-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi is married to Aline Skaf, a [[Lebanese Christian]] former lingerie model, with whom he has three children. Another child, Carthage Hannibal (b. 2 August 2008), was killed in the bombing raid of the family compound on 30 April 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=LUCY BUCKLAND|title=Gaddafi son's lingerie model wife in racy photographs... as more decadent snaps emerge of Libya's first family|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2048098/Aline-Skaff-Gaddafis-son-Hannibals-lingerie-model-wife-pornographic-photos.html|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=Daily Mail|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Like Father Like Sons?

===Legal issues===
In 2008, Swiss authorities arrested Gaddafi and his wife, Aline Skaf, on charges of "bodily harm, threatening behaviour and coercion,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gaddafi son arrested for assault |date=17 July 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7512925.stm |work=BBC World News |accessdate = 8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after an incident involving two of their staff at the Gaddafis' hotel in [[Geneva]]. The charges were later dropped, but [[Libya–Switzerland relations|relations between Libya and Switzerland]] soured. In 2009, two Swiss citizens, Max Goeldi and Rachid Hamdani, were detained in Libya; the [[Government of Switzerland|Swiss government]] asserted that the detention was done as retaliation against them for Gaddafi's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emma|last=Thomasson |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/06/us-libya-swiss-idUSTRE7250VF20110306 |title=Swiss want probe into Libya detention of citizens |work=Reuters |accessdate=6 March 2011 |date=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, Gaddafi lost a lawsuit he brought in [[Denmark]] against the Danish newspaper, ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]''. The newspaper reported that in 2005, Gaddafi, then a student in [[Copenhagen]], had directed the abduction and beating of a Libyan national at the home of the Libyan consul in [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]]. Gaddafi failed to appear in court to present his side of the case, and the court ruled that the existing evidence supported ''Ekstra Bladet's'' version of events.&lt;ref name=danish&gt;{{cite news|title=Gadaffi-søn tabte sag til Ekstra Bladet|first=Kate |last=Bluhme|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/112/article1025433.ece|accessdate=3 April 2011|work=Ekstra Bladet|date=25 June 2008|language= Danish|trans-title=Gadaffi son lost the case for Ekstra Bladet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bt.dk/krimi/gadaffi-junior-tabte-til-ekstra-bladet | title=Gadaffi Junior tabte til Ekstra Bladet | work=Business Times | date=25 June 2008 | accessdate=3 April 2011 | language=Danish | quote=Hannibal Gadaffi, mødte aldrig op i landsretten for at tale sin sag, og derfor har dommerne støttet sig til forklaringer fra Ekstra Bladet og fra politiets rapporter i den opsigtvækkende affære. I januar 2005 fik Københavns Politi en anmeldelse om, at en libysk borger var blevet bortført fra en lejlighed på Nordre Fasanvej og ført til den libyske konsuls hjem i Gentofte. Manden havde ringet på sin mobil og fortalt, at han var bundet i kælderen og havde fået "smadret" arme og ben. Da politiet efterforskede sagen nærmere, gik det op for dem, at det tilsyneladende var Hannibal Gadaffi, der nu studerede på handelshøjskolen i København, som stod bag afstraffelsen." In English: "Hannibal Gaddafi never appeared in court to present his case and therefore the court has relied on explanations from Ekstra Bladet and police reports in the current case. In January 2005 Copenhagen Police received a report that a Libyan citizen was abducted from his apartment at Nordre Fasanvej and taken to the Libyan consul's home in Gentofte. The man had called by his mobile phone and told that he was tied in the cellar and had got his arms and legs "damaged". When the police investigated the case more closely the realized that appearently it was Hannibal Gadaffi, who then studied at the Copenhagen School of Business, that directed the punishment. |trans-title=Gadaffi Junior lost to Ekstra Bladet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, police were called to [[Claridge's]] Hotel in [[London]] in response to reports of a woman screaming. When they arrived, the suite was locked and three bodyguards were arrested for obstructing entry. Gaddafi's wife, Aline Skaf, was found in the room bleeding heavily and was taken by ambulance to hospital where she was treated for facial injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/6911392/Col-Gadaffis-son-in-hotel-room-row-which-sees-wife-injured-and-bodyguards-arrested.html | title=Col Gadaffi's son in hotel room row which sees wife injured and bodyguards arrested | work=The Telegraph | date=31 December 2009 | accessdate=1 September 2011 | last1=Laing | first1=Aislinn |last2=Irvine|first2=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Libyan civil war===
On 29 August after [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|the rebels entered Tripoli]], Gaddafi and his wife fled from Libya to [[Algeria]] together with other members of the Gaddafi family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/human-rights/Aid-Sought-for-Alleged-Gadhafi-Torture-Victim--129138853.html | title=Aid Sought for Alleged Gadhafi Torture Victim | work=Voice of America | date=2 September 2011 | accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 they left a hideaway in Algeria to go to [[Oman]], where they were granted [[political asylum]].&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/oman/9952970/Muammar-Gaddafis-family-take-refuge-in-Oman.html | title=Muammar Gaddafi's family take refuge in Oman | work=The Telegraph | date=25 March 2013 | accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shweyga Mullah, an [[Ethiopia]]n nanny who cared for the couple's young daughter and son was found abandoned by the rebels in a room at one of the family's luxury seaside villas in western Tripoli. She claimed that Aline Skaf took her to a bathroom, tied her up, taped her mouth and started pouring the boiling water on her head - after she lost her temper when Mullah refused to beat her daughter who was crying. Then Mullah was denied sleep, food and water for three days. Another member of staff, who did not want to give his name, verified Ms Mullah's story and said that he also had been regularly beaten and slashed with knives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2031390/Aline-Skaf-Gaddafis-daughter-law-threw-boiling-water-nanny-Shweyga-Mullah.html#ixzz1inqf4Edg| title='Gaddafi's daughter-in-law threw boiling water over my head after I refused to beat her child': Horrific burns of nanny abandoned in dictator's mansion| work=Daily mail| date=30 August 2011 | accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Civil War===
On 11 December 2015, Hannibal was kidnapped and briefly held in Lebanon by an armed group demanding information about disappearance of Shiite Imam [[Musa al-Sadr]] but later was released in the city of [[Baalbek]].&lt;ref name="BBC News 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gaddafi's son Hannibal freed after kidnap in Lebanon | website=BBC News | date=11 December 2015 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35074083 | accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An arrest warrant was issued against him by the Lebanese government over the disappearance of al-Sadr and he was arrested. A request by the Syrian government to return Gaddafi on the grounds that he was a "political refugee" was denied by the Lebanese government as he is a wanted man in Lebanon for withholding information regarding the disappearance of al-Sadr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hannibal-gaddafi-lebanon-officials-issue-arrest-warrant-son-former-libyan-dictator-1533335|title=Hannibal Gaddafi: Lebanon officials issue arrest warrant for son of former Libyan dictator|publisher=IBTimes|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lebanon-denies-syria-request-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son/|title=Lebanon rejects Syria request to hand over Gaddafi son|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, al-Sadr's family filed a lawsuit against Gaddafi over his role in the disappearance of the Imam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.abna24.com/service/middle-east-west-asia/archive/2016/08/30/775621/story.html|title=Imam Musa Sadr’s Family Files Lawsuit against Gaddafi Son|publisher=Ahlul Bayt News Agency|date=30 August 2016|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Esau Avery''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CMG|CBE|DSO|size=85%}} (3 October 1885 – 22 March 1961) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] player, military officer and businessman. He played three rugby test matches for New Zealand in 1910, served as quartermaster general in New Zealand's military forces during World War II, and founded Avery Motors, the Wellington franchisee for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] cars, in the 1920s.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Wellington]] on 3 October 1884,&lt;ref name="AB profile"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=27 |title = Henry Avery | last = Knight | first = Lindsay | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Union | accessdate = 4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avery was the son of Helen Jane Avery (née Boyle) and her husband Joseph Avery. He was educated at [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]].&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt; On 2 July 1913 Avery married Alice Maude Draper at the Church of the Nativity in [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=MEX19130703.2.21 | title=Wedding | date=3 July 1913 | work=Marlborough Express | accessdate=3 October 2015 | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple went on to have seven children between 1914 and 1929.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;

==Rugby union==
A [[Thomas Ellison#Wing-forward|wing-forward]], Avery represented [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] at a provincial level from 1905 to 1910, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the [[All Blacks]], on their [[1910 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|tour of Australia]] in 1910. He played six matches for the All Blacks on that tour including three internationals. He twice served as club captain of the Wellington College Old Boys Rugby Football Club, in 1920 and then from 1923 to 1924.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;

==Military career==
Avery joined the New Zealand Field Artillery Volunteers as a gunner in 1904, and rose through the ranks to be commissioned as a lieutenant in 1910. In January 1911 he became a regular soldier in the [[New Zealand Military Forces]] as a lieutenant in the [[New Zealand Staff Corps]]. He was promoted to temporary captain in July 1911 and captain in April 1914.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], Avery served overseas with the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] in Egypt, Gallipoli and France, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name="Military record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE19276034 |title=Avery: Henry Esau - WWI 5/420A, WWII 800237, 30280 - Army |date= |website= |publisher=Archives New Zealand |accessdate= 3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1916 he was appointed a [[Distinguished Service Order|Companion of the Distinguished Service Order]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=12947 |city=e |date=5 June 1916 |page=996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between 1916 and 1919 he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] four times.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt; In the 1919 King's Birthday Honours, Avery was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in recognition of services rendered in relation to military operations in France and Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31370 |date=3 June 1919 |page=6793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war, Avery served as New Zealand's military representative in the War Office in London from 1920 to 1921, and trained at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] from 1921 to 1922.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cenotaph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/war-memorial/online-cenotaph/record/C36203 |title=Henry Esau Avery |date= |website=Online Cenotaph |publisher=Auckland War Memorial Museum |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred to the Reserve of Officers in 1925.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt; He received the [[New Zealand Long and Efficient Service Medal]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt;

Avery served as president of the Wellington branch of the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association|Returned Soldiers Association]] from 1930 to 1932.&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militarian.com/attachments/avery-jpg.6284/ |title=Avery, Brigadier Henry Esau |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], Avery was recalled to serve at army headquarters in Wellington in August 1940. Two months later he was promoted to colonel and appointed quartermaster general and third military member of the Army Board, and remained in those posts until he was seconded to the War Assets Realisation Board as general manager in September 1944. He retired from that role and the army in March 1949, having been promoted to the rank of brigadier in late 1941.&lt;ref name="Military record"/&gt; In the [[1943 New Year Honours]], Avery was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35841 |date=1 January 1943 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] (Commander degree) by the American government.&lt;ref name="Cenotaph"/&gt;

==Business career==
Avery obtained the franchise for Ford motor vehicles and established Avery Motors in Wellington in 1924. He was general manager of the company from 1924 to 1936. He then became the secretary and assistant manager of the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]] from 1937 to 1940.&lt;ref name="AB profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"/&gt;

The '''Istanbul Chamber of Commerce''' (ICOC) is an institution that organizes and records the commercial transactions of individuals and commercial institutions located in Istanbul; in addition the ICOC also keeps records for these companies. The activities of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce are for the most part carried out in the central building, located in Eminönü.

In elections held in March, 2005, Dr. [[Murat Yalçıntaş]] was elected to the post of president of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunyagazetesi.com.tr/news_display.asp?upsale_id=211843 Dünya Gazetesi - İTO'nun yeni başkanı Murat Yalçıntaş oldu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Establishment===

As part of their concern for the commercial and industrial problems of the 19th century, the Ottoman State desired to bring together the representatives of the industrial sector into one institution. To this end, the Trade and Agricultural Council, which had been established in 1876, was very productive. Subsequently, [[Mehmed Said Pasha]] (1838–1914), who had been appointed as grand vizier (prime minister) in 1879, put a start to the processes that were necessary for the establishment of trade, industry and agricultural guilds.
Acting upon Said Pasha’s directive, a draft charter consisting of 11 articles was prepared for the establishment of a chamber of commerce that would be similar to those in [[Europe]], particularly the French examples. This draft was accepted by the Council of Ministers (Meclis-i Mahsus) on 18 January 1880. The Council of Ministers ruled that the chamber was to be referred to as the Ticaret Odası and quoted the decision in the text of the charter as follows: 
“The establishment of a Ticaret Odası in Istanbul by the Meclis-i Mahsus has been ratified by [[Abdul Hamid II]] II on 19 January 1880. Thus, for the first time in the Ottoman territory the process concerned with the establishment of a local chamber of commerce has been completed. The stage to proceed to next will be the completion of the organizational processes and the start of the activities of the Dersaadet (Istanbul) Ticaret Odası.”&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye'de Ticaretin Öncü Kuruluşu Dersaadet Ticaret Odası 1882 - 1923, Prof. Dr. Ufuk Gülsoy, Yrd. Doç. Dr. Bayram Nazır (Page:39-43)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Establishment Charter of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce===

The administrative structure of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası was very different from that of a modern chamber of commerce. While modern chambers have separate committees to carry out executive and supervisory functions, all the functions of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası were carried out by one institution. According to the first regulations of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, 24 members formed the chamber council. In order to be a member of the council, one had to be at least 30 years of age, have dealt with trade for at least 5 years, not have been implicated in any felony or murder, nor have committed any shameful crime that damaged one’s reputation or honor or to have been bankrupted; if the candidate had gone bankrupt, then they should have been able to regain their honor and name before becoming a member. The members of the council were selected by a majority secret ballot; if the votes were tied, the elder candidate would be selected. It was forbidden for two members to be selected from the same company. 
The members were selected by a twenty-person election committee, headed up by the minister of trade and agriculture; half of the commission was appointed by the minister, the other half by merchants. A majority vote among the members of the chamber would select a president and a vice-president, who would be ratified by the Ministry of Trade. The members of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası were elected for three years; that is, every year one-third of the members were newly appointed. If a member did not participate in the meetings for a period of six months without stating a good reason, they were considered to have resigned. 
The Dersaadet Ticaret Odası would act on its own initiative or would be instructed in how to act by the Ministry of Trade when applied to, thus providing opportunities for the advancement of trade; this included functions like taking the necessary measures to develop trade and industry, carrying out changes required in trade functions, customs duties, the construction of ports, the functioning of steam boats in the rivers, post offices and telegraphs, railway construction, repairs of roads and bridges, the establishment of stock markets, and the publication of trade newspapers.

The internal regulations were prepared immediately after the establishment of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası and were presented to the Ministry of Trade for its approval. In this charter, the status of the Ticaret Odası was organized according to the total sovereignty of the state; this remained the status, without any serious change, until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye'de Ticaretin Öncü Kuruluşu Dersaadet Ticaret Odası 1882 - 1923, Prof. Dr. Ufuk Gülsoy, Yrd. Doç. Dr. Bayram Nazır (Page:45)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First Internal Charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası===

A “preparatory committee” headed up by Azaryan Efendi, which was known as the Cemıyet-i Ticariye (Trade Council), was established to prepare internal regulations. An “interim-institute” started to function with an official ceremony in April 1880; this body continued to operate until 14 January 1882. The organization of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası had been prepared by this same date. At the moment that the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası started to operate officially the Cemiyet-i Ticariye ceased to function; that is, the Cemiyet became the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası on 14 January 1882. The Cemiyet-i Ticaret met ten times until it was transformed into the Ticaret Odası, meeting to discuss the regulations of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, which had been prepared by the commission. The members were informed that the charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası had been approved by the ministry and the charter went into execution on 27 December 1881.

The internal charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, dated 16 August 1881 was organized in a detailed way, setting out the function of the duties and authorities of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası. The internal charter, which consisted of six main sections, included many articles concerned with the aim and duties of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, the method of convening, the duties of the president, the functioning of the Ticaret Odası and its procedures, the duties of the merchants, the position of the head secretary and officials, as well as with the income of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası.&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye'de Ticaretin Öncü Kuruluşu Dersaadet Ticaret Odası 1882 - 1923, Prof. Dr. Ufuk Gülsoy, Yrd. Doç. Dr. Bayram Nazır (Page:48)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Seal of the Chamber===

According to the internal charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, the Ticaret Odası had its own seal. On the top part of this seal was a “Crescent Moon and Star” symbol, while in the middle was inscribed: Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, surrounded by the French phrase Chambre de Commerce de Constantinople. All the documents that were dealt with in the Chamber of Commerce were to be stamped with this seal.&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye'de Ticaretin Öncü Kuruluşu Dersaadet Ticaret Odası 1882 - 1923, Prof. Dr. Ufuk Gülsoy, Yrd. Doç. Dr. Bayram Nazır (Page:53)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening Ceremony of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası===

The members of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, who were summoned after the ratification of the internal charter, took the decision to carry out an official opening of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası; it was decided that the first meeting was to be held on 14 January 1882. Before the opening of the Chambers of the Commerce, 200 lira was loaned to the Cemiyet’s accountant Benzona Efendi by Azaryan Efendi, who was the chief of the Cemiyet at that date, to spend on fittings and office supplies. 
Some time later the members of the Ticaret Odası were convened again and it was decided that the opening ceremony of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, which was to go into operation on 14 January 1882, would be held in its own building and that this should be in a neighborhood that would be easy for tradesmen to reach. Upon this, the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası went into operation in flat No. 12, a property belonging to Mehmed Ali Pasha which was located on the shores of the Golden Horn. It was seen to be suitable that the opening ceremony be held in the same location.
The Dersaadet Ticaret Odası was opened with a simple ceremony in the Mehmed Ali Pasha Han (Business Quarters). At the opening, the minister of trade and agriculture, Raif Efendi, was present and made a speech.&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye'de Ticaretin Öncü Kuruluşu Dersaadet Ticaret Odası 1882 - 1923, Prof. Dr. Ufuk Gülsoy, Yrd. Doç. Dr. Bayram Nazır (Page:54)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce consists of two main structures, one established by election and one by appointment. The organs that are formed by election are the Meslek Komiteler (Professional Committees), Oda Meclisi (Chamber Assembly), Yönetim Kurulu (Board of Directors) and the Disiplin Kurulu (Disciplinary Board). The organs that are established by appointment are the Genel Sekreterlik (General Secretarat) and the Şube Müdürlük (Branch Directorate). There are 257 council members and 347 committee members who are appointed as results of elections held every four years; this makes up the structure of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.

==Professional Committees==

The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is one of the largest chambers of commerce in the world, with a registered membership of 350,000. The Professional Committees of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce consists of approximately 90 elected Professional Committees. These committees are categorized according to [[Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community|NACE]] codes and are determined by the number of companies active in the related sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ito.org.tr/wps/portal/komiteler Istanbul Chamber of Commerce Professional Committees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

===Education Projects===

===Istanbul Commerce University===

ITO-SSM Teknopark will be established on land that is part of the Advanced Technology Industry Park (İTEP), which is the property of the National Defense Ministry; this land makes up part of [[Sabiha Gökçen Airport]]. The most important characteristic of the Teknopark Istanbul Complex is that it will be established upon a structure that is formed from the public and private sectors and a university. The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce will set aside a budget of 50 million TL, and the park will be brought to life in an area measuring 5,000 square meters. In addition, a research center will be constructed. Teknopark Istanbul will, as part of its mission, work on advanced technology, including defense, space and aeronautics, biotechnology, nanotechnology and naval technologies.

==The ÖZİMEK Project==

In 2007 the Mesleki ve Teknik Eğitim Kursları (Vocational and Technical Training Courses) Project, ÖZİMEK, which has been brought into life as a joint venture by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ICOC), the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration and the Istanbul Regional Board of Education, is seen as being the largest career-training program in the Turkish Republic. The aim of the project is to protect, increase and develop employment, to help reduce unemployment by benefiting from trade and vocational training schools and institutions, and to provide vocational development, change and training to prepare officials or those still working in the sector so that they will be able to be employed in keeping with new technology and developments.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ioi.gov.tr/mesleki_ve_teknik_egitimi.php The ÖZİMEK Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The İş-Kur project was included in later stages of the project. The first aim was to develop a project that would provide 500 students with certificates at 15 trade high schools, in 44 different branches; at the present time, three large institutions in Istanbul, which has a great need in this area, have provided 10,000 courses in 70 vocational schools, in 82 separate branches, producing 6,500 graduates. By 2011 the project will have trained 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ito.org.tr/wps/portal/egitim?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=ozimek The size of the project]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, the website: “Human Resources Market” has been established for the graduates of these courses. Those who have graduated can register their resumes on this site and thus when seeking employees, employers will be able to give priority to those who have graduated from certified courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikb-ito.org.tr Human Resources Market]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberler.com/ozimek-mezunlari-icin-web-den-is-imkani-haberi Jobs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==e-ICOC==

In 2006, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce began an e-ICOC project which enabled members to complete ICOC procedures online, including patents, archiving, documents and forms. The system has been integrated with the systems of other institutions with whom the Chamber of Commerce works, including notaries, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]] (TÜİK), the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB), Bağ-Kur, the governor's office and the city councils. With the implementation of this project, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has aimed to minimize internal bureaucracy and make tracking documents easier, thus creating an efficient and [[paperless office]].

==Formula One (Istanbul Park)==

The expansion of the [[Formula 1]] Grand Prix into Turkey was initiated by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. The Formula 1 facilities in Istanbul were successfully completed in 2005 when the first races were held. ICOC's partner TOBB, as well as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and the Special Provincial Administration aided in the completion of the facilities. After the first two races, the operation of the Istanbul Formula 1 Grand Prix was privatized and transferred to a third party.

==Gulf Development==

The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has paid visits to the [[Gulf Region]] in order to benefit from the capital accumulation resulting from the increase in oil output. A large delegation, including many representatives from the construction sector, participated in the visits which were organized to [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. As a result of the meetings with both the private sector and government officials, Turkish contractors have undertaken many important construction projects in this region. Furthermore, these meetings have yielded an increase in Gulf investments in Turkey. These visits and meetings have brought about extremely productive results both for Turkish investments in the Gulf countries, as well as for the Gulf countries' investments in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ito.org.tr/wps/portal/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3iDgCBzUzcPIwMDf39TA6MwTxfPEA8DQ3dPI_2CbEdFAKzYb-w!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ito_portal_tr/ito-portal/gazete/gzt-2009/gzt-2009-7/gzt-2009-7-24/dd0d88804ef35b3cba7dbe7df61d7f8f Gulf Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Start-Exporting Program==

In 2010, 140 Istanbul Chamber of Commerce members benefited from the Start-Exporting program. This project, this first of its type in Turkey, is held throughout the country and has to date trained organizations in many provincial chambers of commerce. Between January 12 and May 12, 2010, the Start-Exporting program, which was developed in collaboration with the Madrid Chamber of Commerce and Industry, reached the sixth step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ito.org.tr/wps/portal/ito-genel?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=ito_portal_tr/ito-portal/anasayfa/ihracata_ilk_adim_programi The Start-Exporting Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The First Step in the U.S. Market Project==

In 2007, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] (USCHAMBERS) launched the first step in the U.S. Market project. The project aims to improve trade relations between Turkey and the [[United States]] and to ensure the access of Turkish firms to the world's largest market. After Doing Business seminars were organized in Istanbul and the United States, a comprehensive educational website on the two markets went into operation.

The Istanbul Investment and Trade Office has been opened in [[New York City]]. The Istanbul office, one of the many offices that have been opened in various financial centers, was opened in the Istanbul World Trade Center, hosted by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce on October 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-istanbul.com/ The First Step in the U.S. Market Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had previously been a proportional representation federal deputy from the state to the [[LXII Legislature of the Mexican Congress|LXII Legislature]].&lt;ref name="sil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfil del legislador|url=http://sil.gobernacion.gob.mx/Librerias/pp_PerfilLegislador.php?SID=&amp;Referencia=9217023|publisher=Legislative Information System|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life==

Bonilla was born in Tijuana and obtained his degree in business administration from the [[UNAM]] in 1983. He worked in a variety of companies, including Electrol de México, CONESA, and COVIMEX de México.{{r|sil}} Between 1982 and 1985, he directed the [[Potros de Tijuana]] baseball club, which played in the [[Liga Mexicana del Pacífico]].&lt;ref name="ef"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/jaime-bonilla-sedujo-a-amlo-pero-dividio-a-morena-en-bc|date=29 December 2016|title=Jaime Bonilla sedujo a AMLO, pero dividió a Morena en BC|first=Rivelino|last=Rueda|work=El Financiero|language=Spanish|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he became the director general and a columnist of the ''Diario de Baja California'' newspaper, which began a career in media ownership for Bonilla. Through his company PSN (originally an acronym for Pacific Spanish Network, now Primer Sistema de Noticias), he directly operates [[XESS-AM]] 620 and [[XESDD-AM]] 1030 in Tijuana. He also owned [[XHENB-TV]] channel 29 in [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], now a cable-only outlet, and his company Media Sports de México holds the concessions for two radio stations operated under brokerage agreements by American programmers, [[XEPE-AM]] 1700 and [[XHPRS-FM]] 105.7. Bonilla also acquired cable systems in Ensenada and [[Tecate]]. Bonilla also owned radio station [[KURS]] 1040 in San Diego through his company Quetzal Bilingual Communications; the station was sold in 2016 for $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insideradio.com/features/deal_digest/deal-digest---november/article_ba52b346-b146-11e6-b43e-cf236de8b4fe.html|work=Inside Radio|title=Deal Digest - November 23, 2016|date=23 November 2016|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Bonilla, then a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, joined the board of the Otay Water District in Otay Mesa, California. While in the US, he was a donor to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] causes and even was on the California finance committee for [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.razon.com.mx/republicano-que-financio-a-mccain-ya-es-diputado-del-pt/|work=La Razón|first=Jorge|last=González|title=Republicano que financió a McCain ya es diputado del PT|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=10 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, he announced his resignation from the water board in order to run for federal deputy and simultaneously join the 2012 presidential campaign of [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-otays-bonilla-resigns-high-profile-posts-mexico-2012mar27-story.html|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|title=Otay's Bonilla resigns for high-profile posts in Mexico|first=Sandra|last=Dibble|accessdate=10 August 2018|date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he renounced his dual citizenship,{{r|ef}} a move necessary to meet the constitutional requirements to run for office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/opinion/Doble-nacionalidad-20180603-0069.html|title=Doble nacionalidad|first=Marco Antonio|last=Baños|work=El Economista|date=3 June 2018|language=Spanish|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a proportional representation deputy on the [[Labor Party (Mexico)|PT]] list, during which time he served as the president of the Northern Border Matters Commission and was the state campaign coordinator for the PT in the 2013 Baja California state elections.{{r|sil}} Bonilla left the post in 2014 in order to become the state party director for the then-new Morena party.{{r|ef}} His relationship with López Obrador remained close; in 2016, Bonilla invited him to his [[Petco Park]] suite for the [[2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].{{r|ef}} Party members and leaders say that in Bonilla's media holdings, López Obrador saw a "gold mine" to gain media exposure in Baja California.{{r|ef}}

On 31 January 2018, López Obrador announced that Bonilla would be the primary Senate candidate in Baja California for the [[Juntos Haremos Historia]] coalition, forming a ticket with [[Alejandra León Gastélum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blancoynegro.mx/~wynegr0/politica-y-policiaca/16985-va-jaime-bonilla-por-la-candidatura-al-senado.html|work=Blanco y Negro|date=31 January 2018|first=Conrado|last=Osuna Murillo|title=Va Jaime Bonilla por la candidatura al Senado|language=Spanish|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Juntos Haremos Historia ticket took first place in the election, securing both candidates seats in the Senate. However, Bonilla has stated that he will only remain in office three months and will then become the state development coordinator in Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Noticias/13072018/1356617-Jaime-Bonilla-solo-sera-Senador-por-BC-durante-tres-meses.html|work=La Crónica|first=Glenn|last=Sánchez|date=13 July 2018|title=Jaime Bonilla solo será Senador por BC durante tres meses|accessdate=10 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johan Claesz van Loo''' (c.1585 &amp;ndash; 1660), was a Dutch brewer of [[Haarlem]], best known today for his portrait painted by [[Frans Hals]].
==Biography==
He was painted twice by Hals in his capacity as member of the Haarlem [[schutterij]], the first time as captain in the St. Adrian group in 1633, and the second time in 1639 as colonel of the St. Joris group.
According to [[Pieter Biesboer]] he married Margrietge Arisdr Akersloot (the sister of [[Outgert Ariss Akersloot]]), and they had several children who later also became brewers. Their daughter Risje (1604-1652) married [[Florens Pietersz van der Hoeff]] in 1624.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; His son-in-law Hoeff served with him in the civic guard and was also painted by Hals in a stance in which he is looking at his father-in-law.&lt;ref name=Biesboer&gt;Collections of Paintings in Haarlem: 1572-1745, by Peter Biesboer (editor Carol Togneri), Getty Trust Publications, Los Angeles, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Cornelis van Loo (1609-1673) married Dorothea Olycan in 1635. Their son [[Nicolaes van Loo|Nicolaas]] married [[Aletta Hannemans]], the widow of Dorothea's brother [[Jacob Pietersz Olycan]], in 1641.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; Loo was a member of the Haarlem regency from 1618 until his death, and he was a representative to the Staten-Generaal during the years 1649-1652.

'''Marcelo Hugo Tinelli''' (born 1 April 1960, [[San Carlos de Bolívar]]) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Television|TV]] host, media producer and businessman, best known as the host of the TV show ''ShowMatch'' broadcast on Argentina's [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]]. He is one of the most iconic figures in Argentina's television. Tinelli is one of the most famous supporters of the [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] football club of all time. He is the current Vice-President of the Boedo's side.

Tinelli was working on [[LS5|Radio Rivadavia]] as [[football (soccer)|football]] [[sportscaster]] before Juan Alberto Badía brought him to TV to ''Badía y Compañía''. In 1990, after several years as sports commentator, he created the light-content ''Videomatch'', based on sport results, easy jokes, [[hidden camera]]s and [[blooper]]s.

Afterwards, he hosted the variety-musical show ''[[Ritmo de la Noche]]'' which featured live performances of international acts including [[Bon Jovi]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Duran Duran]] and former [[Queen (band)|Queen]] member [[Brian May]]. Around 1996 the program left the lightest contents and included musical shows and guests. In 1999 he received the Golden [[Martín Fierro Awards|Martín Fierro Award]] for ''[[Videomatch]]''. The show still airs, as ''[[Showmatch]]''. 

He created the TV production company ''Ideas del Sur'' (Ideas from the South), which has produced many TV shows including ''Okupas'', ''Buenos Vecinos'', ''Tumberos'', ''Fugitivos'' and ''[[Los Roldán]]''. He also bought Radio Uno FM station, and the Spanish [[Segunda División]] football club [[CD Badajoz]]. 

In 2002, he helped found the [[volleyball]] team [[Club Ciudad de Bolívar]], based in his native San Carlos de Bolívar. The team came to be the most successful of the [[Liga Argentina de Voleibol – Serie A1|Argentine league]].

==''Videomatch/ShowMatch''==
He became popular as the presenter of Argentina's high-rated show ''[[Videomatch]]'' on the Argentine network Telefe. The variety show had sketches, musical guests, contests, and introduced bloopers to the Argentine audience.

Tinelli caused controversy in 2005, when he announced plans to switch to [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]], the third highest rated network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obserdiscriminacion.gov.ar/informes.html Informe Sobre Discriminación en el Programa "Showmatch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422203235/http://www.obserdiscriminacion.gov.ar/informes.html|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His show increased the average audience of Canal 9 by giving the network the highest-rated show in the country. 

In 2006 Tinelli announced a switch to [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]], Telefe's largest competitor. Tinelli works at El Trece since then, and also produces TV dramas with his own production company, [[Ideas del Sur]]. The show title changed from ''Videomatch'' to ''[[Showmatch]]'' since the Videomatch name was owned by Telefe. ''Showmatch'' is also the name of a short-lived version of ''Videomatch'' that aired in [[Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} 

ShowMatch included many segments of contests with stage acts, such as dancing or singing. In 2009 it included a segment called [[Gran Cuñado]] (Big Brother-in-Law) with parodies of Argentine politicians, that generated great stir in real political world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html El efecto de Gran Cuñado sobre la intención de voto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627112321/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-46584-Gran-Cunado-y-la-intencion-de-voto.html|date=27 June 2009}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2017}}
Tinelli married his first [[wife]], Soledad Aquino, in 1986. The couple had two children: Micaela in (born in 1988), and Candelaria (born in 1990). The couple [[Divorce|divorced]] in 1993. Following his divorce, in 1997 he married for the second time with Paula Robles. They met at one of the shows he hosted (Ritmo de la noche). The couple lasted 12 years, during that period of time they had two children. The couple divorced in 2009. In April 2014, Tinelli had his fifth child with Guillermina Valdes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0863906/bio|title=Marcelo Tinelli|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/307323-marcelo-tinelli-sorprendio-un-increible-tatuaje-toda-su-espalda |title=Marcelo Tinelli sorprendió con un increíble tatuaje en toda su espalda &amp;#124; Marcelo Tinelli |website=Minutouno.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Money laundering''' is the act of concealing the transformation of profits from illegal activities and [[corruption]] into ostensibly "legitimate" assets.&lt;ref name="Duhaimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime|first= Christine |title=What is Laundering? Duhaime's Financial Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Law |url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/what-is-money-laundering |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies. Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion. Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering. After money has been suitably laundered or "cleaned", it can be used in the mainstream economy for accumulation of wealth, such as by acquisitions of properties or legitimate businesses, or simply spent. Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities, and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors.
In a number of legal and regulatory systems, the term "money laundering" has become [[Conflation|conflated]] with other forms of [[financial crime|financial]] and [[White-collar crime|business crime]], and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, [[digital currency|digital currencies]], credit cards, and traditional currency), including [[terrorism financing]] and evasion of [[international sanctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2765010|title=Financial Weapons of War, ''Minnesota Law Review'' (2016)|website=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with ''source'' of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with ''destination'' of funds) when regulating the financial system.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the Anti-Money Laundering &amp; Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Australia), the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (New Zealand), and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap 615) (Hong Kong. See also (for example) guidance on [http://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/amlcft/eng/ IMF] and [http://www.fatf-gafi.org/topics/financialinclusion/documents/fatfguidanceonanti-moneylaunderingandterroristfinancingmeasuresandfinancialinclusion.html FATF] websites similarly conflating the concepts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering, whether it is  intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations. Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that ''would have been'' a crime in that country, even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gettingthedealthrough.com/area/50/anti-money-laundering/|title=Anti-Money Laundering – Getting The Deal Through – GTDT|website=Getting The Deal Through|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Laws against money laundering were created to use against organized crime during the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] during the 1930s. [[Organized crime]] received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of [[Al Capone]] on [[tax evasion]] brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.

In the 1980s, the [[war on drugs]] led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize proceeds of [[Drug-related crime|drug crimes]] in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and it is up to the individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower [[burden of proof (law)|burdens of proof]].

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, which led to the [[Patriot Act]] in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide, led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countermoneylaundering.com/public/content/brief-history-money-laundering |title=A brief history of money laundering |author=Nigel Morris-Cotterill |date=1999 |access-date=17 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224181114/http://www.countermoneylaundering.com/public/content/brief-history-money-laundering |archive-date=24 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Group of Seven (G7)]] nations used the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries. Starting in 2002, governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions. Anti money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for [[financial institution]]s and enforcement has stepped up significantly. During 2011–2015 a number of major banks faced ever-increasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations. This included [[HSBC]], which was fined $1.9 billion in December 2012, and [[BNP Paribas]], which was fined $8.9 billion in July 2014 by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="nytimes bnp admits guilt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/bnp-paribas-pleads-guilty-in-sanctions-case/ | title=BNP Paribas Admits Guilt and Agrees to Pay $8.9 Billion Fine to U.S. | work=The New York Times | date=30 June 2014 | accessdate=1 July 2014 |author1=Protess, Ben  |author2=Jessica Silver-Greenberg |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically. For example, in 2006, Australia set up the [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|AUSTRAC]] system and required the reporting of all financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance|title=AUSTRAC at a glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=AUSTRAC|accessdate=18 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828034700/http://austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance|archive-date=28 August 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Money-laundering.svg|thumb|Placing "dirty" money in a service company, where it is layered with legitimate income and then integrated into the flow of money, is a common form of money laundering.]] The conversion or transfer of property, the concealment or disguising of the nature of the proceeds, the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing that these are derived from criminal activity and participate or assist the movement of funds to make the proceeds appear legitimate is money laundering.

Money obtained from certain crimes, such as [[extortion]], [[insider trading]], [[drug trafficking]], and [[illegal gambling]] is "dirty" and needs to be "cleaned" to appear to have been derived from legal activities, so that banks and other financial institutions will deal with it without suspicion. Money can be laundered by many methods which vary in complexity and sophistication.

Money laundering involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means ("placement"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash ("layering"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds ("integration"). Some of these steps may be omitted, depending upon the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial system would not need to be placed.&lt;ref name="chasing dirty money"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reuter |first=Peter |title=Chasing Dirty Money |year=2004 |publisher=Peterson |isbn=978-0-88132-370-2 |url=http://bookstore.piie.com/book-store//381.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Treasury Department]]:
{{quote|sign=|source=|Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e., "dirty money") appear legal (i.e., "clean"). Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system. Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the "dirty money" appears "clean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws|title= History of Anti-Money Laundering Laws|date=30 June 2015|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
Money laundering can take several forms, although most methods can be categorized into one of a few types. These include "bank methods, smurfing [also known as structuring], currency exchanges, and double-invoicing".&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Lawrence M. Salinger, ''Encyclopedia of white-collar &amp; corporate crime: A – I, Volume 1'', page 78, {{ISBN|0-7619-3004-3}}, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Structuring]]: Often known as ''[[Smurfing (financial crime)|smurfing]]'', this is a method of placement whereby cash is broken into smaller deposits of money, used to defeat suspicion of money laundering and to avoid anti-money laundering reporting requirements. A sub-component of this is to use smaller amounts of cash to purchase bearer instruments, such as money orders, and then ultimately deposit those, again in small amounts.&lt;ref name=NDIC&gt;{{cite web |last=National Drug Intelligence Center |title=National Drug Threat Assessment |url=http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs44/44849/44849p.pdf |accessdate=20 September 2011 |page=40 |date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bulk cash smuggling: This involves physically smuggling cash to another jurisdiction and depositing it in a financial institution, such as an [[offshore bank]], with greater [[bank secrecy]] or less rigorous money laundering enforcement.&lt;ref name="National Money Laundering Threat Assessment"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/011106.pdf |title=National Money Laundering Threat Assessment |accessdate=3 March 2011 |date=December 2005 |page=33 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017094839/http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/pressrel/011106.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cash-intensive businesses: In this method, a business typically expected to receive a large proportion of its revenue as cash uses its accounts to deposit criminally derived cash. Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so generate cash revenue from incidental legitimate business in addition to the illicit cash – in such cases the business will usually claim all cash received as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such enterprises have little or no  [[variable cost]]s and/or a large ratio between revenue and variable costs, which makes it difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs. Examples are parking structures,  [[strip club]]s, [[tanning salon]]s,  [[car wash]]es, [[amusement arcade|arcade]]s, [[bar]]s, restaurants, and casinos.
* Trade-based laundering: This involves under- or over-valuing [[invoice]]s to disguise the movement of money.&lt;ref name="Achilles Heel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Capitalism's Achilles Heel |author=Baker, Raymond |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the art market has been accused of being an ideal vehicle for money laundering due to several unique aspects of art such as the subjective value of artworks as well as the secrecy of auction houses about the identity of the buyer and seller.&lt;ref name="Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime?"&gt;{{cite web |last=Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime? |title=Has the Art Market Become an Unwitting Partner in Crime? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/arts/design/has-the-art-market-become-an-unwitting-partner-in-crime.html |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shell companies and trusts: Trusts and shell companies disguise the true owners of money. Trusts and corporate vehicles, depending on the jurisdiction, need not disclose their true owner.  Sometimes referred to by the slang term ''rathole'', though that term usually refers to a person acting as the fictitious owner rather than the business entity.&lt;ref name="FATF threat assessment"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Global Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Threat Assessment |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/48/10/45724350.pdf |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="private-eye.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/registry|title=Private Eye - Official Site - the UK's number one best-selling news and current affairs magazine, edited by Ian Hislop|website=www.private-eye.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Round-tripping (finance)|Round-tripping]]: Here, money is deposited in a [[controlled foreign corporation]] offshore, preferably in a [[tax haven]] where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a [[foreign direct investment]], exempt from taxation. A variant on this is to transfer money to a law firm or similar organization as funds on account of fees, then to cancel the retainer and, when the money is remitted, represent the sums received from the lawyers as a legacy under a will or proceeds of litigation.&lt;ref name="private-eye.co.uk"/&gt;
* Bank capture: In this case, money launderers or criminals buy a controlling interest in a bank, preferably in a jurisdiction with weak money laundering controls, and then move money through the bank without scrutiny.
* Casinos: In this method, an individual walks into a casino and buys chips with illicit cash. The individual will then play for a relatively short time. When the person cashes in the chips, they will expect to take payment in a check, or at least get a receipt so they can claim the proceeds as gambling winnings.&lt;ref name="National Money Laundering Threat Assessment" /&gt;
* Other gambling: Money is spent on gambling, preferably on high odds games. One way to minimize risk with this method is to bet on every possible outcome of some event that has many possible outcomes, so no outcome(s) have short odds, and the bettor will lose only the [[vigorish]] and will have one or more winning bets that can be shown as the source of money. The losing bets will remain hidden.
* Black salaries: A company may have unregistered employees without written contracts and pay them cash salaries. Dirty money might be used to pay them.&lt;ref name="Underground Economy Issues. Ontario Construction Secretariat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iciconstruction.com/resources/industry_publications/underground_economy_issues.cfm |title=Underground Economy Issues.

* [[Tax amnesty|Tax amnesties]]: For example, those that legalize unreported assets and cash in tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tax amnesties turn HMRC into 'biggest money-laundering operation in history' |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100011790/tax-amnesties-turn-hmrc-into-biggest-money-laundering-operation-in-history |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By region ==

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America, money laundering is mainly linked to drug trafficking activities and to having connections with criminal activity, such as crimes that have to do with arms trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, blackmail, smuggling, and acts of corruption of people linked to governments, such as bribery, which are more common in Latin American countries. There is a relationship between corruption and money laundering in developing countries. The economic power of Latin America increases rapidly and without support, these fortunes being of illicit origin have the appearance of legally acquired profits. With regard to money laundering, the ultimate goal of the process is to integrate illicit capital into the general economy and transform it into licit goods and services. 

The money laundering practice uses various channels to legalize everything achieved through illegal practices. As such, it has different techniques depending on the country where this illegal operation is going to be carried out:

* In Colombia, the laundering of billions of dollars, which come from drug trafficking, is carried out through imports of contraband from the parallel exchange market.
* In Central America in countries such as Guatemala and Honduras, money laundering continues to increase in the absence of adequate legislation and regulations in these countries. Money laundering activities in Costa Rica have experienced substantial growth, especially using large-scale currency smuggling and investments of drug cartels in real estate, within the tourism sector. Furthermore, the Colon Free Zone, in Panama, continues to be the area of operations for money laundering where cash is exchanged for products of different nature that are then put up for sale at prices below those of production for a return fast of the capital.
* In Mexico, the preferred techniques continue to be the smuggling of currency abroad, in addition to electronic transfers, bank drafts with Mexican banks and operations in the parallel exchange market.
* Money Laundering in the Caribbean countries continues to be a serious problem that seems to be very dangerous. Specifically, in Antigua, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Citizens of the Dominican Republic who have been involved in money laundering in the United States, use companies that are dedicated to transferring funds sent to the Dominican Republic in amounts of less than $ 10,000 under the use of false names. Moreover, in Jamaica, multi-million dollar asset laundering cases were discovered through telephone betting operations abroad. Thousands of suspicious transactions have been detected in French overseas territories. Free trade zones such as Aruba, meanwhile, remain the preferred areas for money laundering. The offshore banking centers, the secret bank accounts and the tourist complexes are the channels through which the launderers whiten the proceeds of the illicit money.

Casinos continue to attract organizations that deal with money laundering. Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela are considered high priority countries in the region, due to the strategies used by the washers.

==== Economic impact in the region ====
The practice of money laundering, among other economic and financial crimes have been better in infiltrating into the economic and political structures of most developing countries therefore resulting to political instability and economic digression.

Money laundering is still a great concern for the financial services industry.  About 50% of the money laundering incidents in Latin America were reported by organizations in the financial sector. According to PwC’s 2014 global economic crime survey in Latin America only 2.8% of respondents in Latin America claimed suffering Anti-Trust/Competition Law incidents, compared to 5.2% of respondents globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/pdf/pwc-latin-america-economic-crime-survey.pdf|title=Economic Crime: A Threat to Business Globally|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144150/https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/pdf/pwc-latin-america-economic-crime-survey.pdf|archive-date=2018-06-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been shown that money laundering has an impact on the financial behavior and macroeconomic performance of the industrialized countries. In these countries the macroeconomic consequences of money laundering are transmitted through several channels. Thus, money laundering complicates the formulation of economic policies. It is assumed that the proceeds of criminal activities are laundered by means of the notes and coins in circulation of the monetary substitutes.

The laundering causes disproportionate changes in the relative prices of assets which implies that resources are allocated inefficiently; and, therefore may have negative implications for economic growth, apparently money laundering is associated with a lower economic growth.

The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] of the United States estimates that only in that country, sales of narcotic drugs represent about 57,000 millions of dollars annually and most of these transactions are made in cash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ondcp|title=Office of National Drug Control Policy|website=The White House|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Jurisprudence ====
Money laundering has been increasing. A key factor behind the growing money laundering is ineffective enforcement of money laundering laws locally. Perhaps because of the lack of importance that has been given to the subject, since the 21st century started, there was not jurisprudence regarding the laundering of money or assets, or the conversion or transfer of goods. Which is even worse, the laws of the Latin American countries have really not dealt with their study in a profound way, as it is an issue that concerns the whole world and is the subject of seminars, conferences and academic analysis in different regions of the planet. Now a new figure that is being called the Economic Criminal Law is being implemented, which should be implemented in modern societies, which has been inflicted enormous damage to the point of affecting the general economy of the states. Even though, developing countries have responded and continue to respond, through legislative measures, to the problem of money laundering, at national level, however, money launderers, have taken advantage of the lax regulatory environment, vulnerable financial systems along with the continued  civil and political unrest of most the developing countries.

==Magnitude==
Many regulatory and governmental authorities issue estimates each year for the amount of money laundered, either worldwide or within their national economy. In 1996, a spokesperson for the IMF estimated that 2–5% of the worldwide global economy involved laundered money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp021098|title=Money Laundering: the Importance of International Countermeasures--Address by Michel Camdessus|work=IMF|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering, stated, "Due to the illegal nature of the transactions, precise statistics are not available and it is therefore impossible to produce a definitive estimate of the amount of money that is globally laundered every year. The FATF therefore does not publish any figures in this regard."&lt;ref name="FATF FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Money Laundering - Financial Action Task Force |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/faq/moneylaundering/ |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic commentators have likewise been unable to estimate the volume of money with any degree of assurance.&lt;ref name="chasing dirty money" /&gt; Various estimates of the scale of global money laundering are sometimes repeated often enough to make some people regard them as factual—but no researcher has overcome the inherent difficulty of measuring an actively concealed practice.

Regardless of the difficulty in measurement, the amount of money laundered each year is in the [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments.&lt;ref name="chasing dirty money" /&gt; As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been [[Organized crime|large scale criminal enterprises]]. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, under UK law the first offences created for money laundering both related to the proceeds from the sale of illegal narcotics under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and then later under the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of [[terrorist financing]] in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come ''from'', and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going ''to'').

==Electronic money==
In theory, [[electronic money]] should provide as easy a method of transferring value without revealing identity as untracked banknotes, especially wire transfers involving anonymity-protecting numbered bank accounts.  In practice, however, the record-keeping capabilities of Internet service providers and other network resource maintainers tend to frustrate that intention.  While some [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] under recent development have aimed to provide for more possibilities of transaction anonymity for various reasons, the degree to which they succeed—and, in consequence, the degree to which they offer benefits for money laundering efforts—is controversial. Solutions such as [[Zcash|ZCash]] and Monero are examples of cryptocurrencies that provide unlinkable anonymity via proofs and/or obfuscation of information ([[Ring signature|ring signatures]]). Such currencies could find use in online illicit services.

In 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at [[ESSEC]] ISIS, surveyed new techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]].&lt;ref name="Jean-Loup Richet"&gt;{{cite arXiv |arxiv=1310.2368|title=Laundering Money Online: a review of cybercriminals methods |date=June 2013 |author=Richet, Jean-Loup}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common approach was to use a [[digital currency exchanger]] service which converted dollars into a digital currency called [[Liberty Reserve]], and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, the US authorities shut down Liberty Reserve charging its founder and various others with money laundering.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/05/liberty-reserve-indicted/ |title=Liberty Reserve founder indicted on $6 billion money-laundering charges |publisher=Wired |date=May 2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |author=Zetter, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another increasingly common way of laundering money is to use online gaming. In a growing number of online games, such as ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''[[World of Warcraft]],'' it is possible to [[gold farming|convert money into virtual goods, services, or virtual cash]] that can later be converted back into money.&lt;ref name="Wired.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/21/money-laundering-online |title=Cybercriminals launder money using in-game currencies |publisher=Wired|date=October 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |author=Solon, Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse money laundering==
Reverse money laundering is a process that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes.&lt;ref name="REVERSE LAUNDERING"&gt;{{cite web |last=International Federation of Accountants |title=Anti-Money Laundering |url=http://www.ifac.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/anti-money-laundering-2n.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassella | first1 = S.D. | year = 2003 | title = Reverse money laundering | url = | journal = Journal of Money Laundering Control | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 92–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay "under-the-table" salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zabyelina | first1 = Yuliya | year = 2015 | title = Reverse money laundering in Russia: Clean cash for dirty ends | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JMLC-10-2014-0039 | journal = Journal of Money Laundering Control | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 202–221 | doi=10.1108/JMLC-10-2014-0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in an affidavit filed on 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascau alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator [[Leland Yee]], engaged in reverse money laundering activities.

The problem of such fraudulent encashment practices  (''obnalichka'' in Russian) has become acute in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) reported that the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan have encountered a substantial shrinkage of tax base and shifting money supply balance in favor of cash. These processes have complicated planning and management of the economy and contributed to the growth of the [[shadow economy]].&lt;ref&gt;EAG.

== {{anchor|Anti-money laundering}} Combating==
Anti-money laundering (AML) is a term mainly used in the financial and legal industries to describe the legal controls that require [[financial institution]]s and other regulated entities to prevent, detect, and report money laundering activities. Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally as a result of the formation of the [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF) and the promulgation of an international framework of anti-money laundering standards.&lt;ref name="about the FATF"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=About the FATF |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/0,3417,en_32250379_32236836_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards began to have more relevance in 2000 and 2001, after FATF began a process to publicly identify countries that were deficient in their anti-money laundering laws and international cooperation, a process colloquially known as "[[name and shame]]".&lt;ref name="FATF NCCT initiative"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=About the Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT) Initiative |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/document/51/0,3746,en_32250379_32236992_33916403_1_1_1_1,00.html |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compasscayman.com/journal/2010/01/06/The-global-anti-money-laundering-regime--a-short-overview |title=The Global Anti-Money Laundering Regime: A Short Overview, by Richard Horowitz, Cayman Islands Journal, 6 January 2010 |publisher=Compasscayman.com |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effective AML program requires a jurisdiction to criminalise money laundering, giving the relevant regulators and police the powers and tools to investigate; be able to share information with other countries as appropriate; and require financial institutions to identify their customers, establish risk-based controls, keep records, and report suspicious activities.&lt;ref name="Money Laundering FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Money Laundering FAQ |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/document/29/0,3746,en_32250379_32235720_33659613_1_1_1_1,00.html |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict background checks are necessary to combat as many money launderers escape by investing through complex ownership and company structures. Banks can do that but a proper surveillance is required but on the Government side to reduce this. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/deutsche-bank-anti-money-laundering-report-2018-8|title=Deutsche Bank report reveals shortcomings in its screening process, raises anti-money laundering concerns|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalization===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The elements of the crime of money laundering are set forth in the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] and [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]]. It is defined as knowingly engaging in a financial transaction with the proceeds of a crime for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property from governments.

===The role of financial institutions===
While banks operating in the same country generally have to follow the same anti-money laundering laws and regulations, financial institutions all structure their anti-money laundering efforts slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amlsource.com/aml-job-descriptions.php|title=Financial Crime Job Descriptions - FinCrimeJobs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most financial institutions globally, and many non-financial institutions, are required to identify and [[Suspicious activity report|report transactions of a suspicious nature]] to the financial intelligence unit in the respective country. For example, a bank must verify a customer's identity and, if necessary, monitor transactions for suspicious activity. This is often termed as "[[know your customer]]". This means knowing the identity of the customer and understanding the kinds of transactions in which the customer is likely to engage. By knowing one's customers, financial institutions can often identify unusual or suspicious behaviour, termed anomalies, which may be an indication of money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Roth |first=John|title=Monograph on Terrorist Financing |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Ch4.pdf |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=20 September 2011 |pages=54–56 |date=20 August 2004|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank employees, such as tellers and customer account representatives, are trained in anti-money laundering and are instructed to report activities that they deem suspicious. Additionally, [[anti-money laundering software]] filters customer data, classifies it according to level of suspicion, and inspects it for anomalies. Such anomalies include any sudden and substantial increase in funds, a large withdrawal, or moving money to a bank secrecy jurisdiction. Smaller transactions that meet certain criteria may also be flagged as suspicious. For example, structuring can lead to flagged transactions. The software also flags names on government "blacklists" and transactions that involve countries hostile to the host nation. Once the software has mined data and flagged suspect transactions, it alerts bank management, who must then determine whether to file a report with the government.

===Value of enforcement costs and associated privacy concerns===
The financial services industry has become more vocal about the rising costs of anti-money laundering regulation and the limited benefits that they claim it brings.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704355304576214852895407540 |title=U.S. Banks Oppose Tighter Money Rules |work=Wall Street Journal |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2011 |author=Ball, Deborah, et al.,}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator wrote that "[w]ithout facts, [anti-money laundering] legislation has been driven on rhetoric, driving by ill-guided activism responding to the need to be "seen to be doing something" rather than by an objective understanding of its effects on predicate crime.

Besides economic costs to implement anti-money-laundering laws, improper attention to [[Information privacy|data protection]] practices may entail disproportionate costs to individual privacy rights. In June 2011, the data-protection advisory committee to the European Union issued a report on data protection issues related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, which identified numerous transgressions against the established legal framework on privacy and data protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion 14/2011 on data protection issues related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2011/wp186_en.pdf|publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=18 February 2014|author=Article 29 Data Protection Working Party|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report made recommendations on how to address money laundering and terrorist financing in ways that safeguard personal privacy rights and data protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion 14/2011 Annex: Recommendations|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2011/wp186_en_annex.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=18 February 2014|author=Article 29 Data Protection Working Group|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, groups such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have expressed concern that money laundering rules require banks to report on their own customers, essentially conscripting private businesses "into agents of the surveillance state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=American Civil Liberties Union |title=The Surveillance Industrial Complex |url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/surveillance_report.pdf |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries are obligated by various international instruments and standards, such as the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], the 2000 [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]], the 2003 [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], and the recommendations of the 1989 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) to enact and enforce money laundering laws in an effort to stop narcotics trafficking, international organised crime, and corruption.

===Global organizations===
Formed in 1989 by the [[G7]] countries, the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote an international response to combat money laundering. The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the [[OECD]] in Paris. In October 2001, FATF expanded its mission to include combating the financing of terrorism. FATF is a policy-making body that brings together legal, financial, and law enforcement experts to achieve national legislation and regulatory AML and CFT reforms. {{As of|2014}} its membership consists of 36 countries and territories and two regional organizations.  FATF works in collaboration with a number of international bodies and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/membersandobservers/|title=FATF Members and Observers|last=GAFI|first=FATF|date=21 July 2017|website=www.fatf-gafi.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These entities have observer status with FATF, which does not entitle them to vote, but permits them full participation in plenary sessions and working groups.&lt;ref name="FATF member FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last=Financial Action Task Force |title=Member Country and Observers FAQ |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/document/5/0,3746,en_32250379_32236869_34310917_1_1_1_1,00.html |website=www.fatf-gafi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FATF has developed 40 recommendations on money laundering and 9 special recommendations regarding terrorist financing. FATF assesses each member country against these recommendations in published reports. Countries seen as not being sufficiently compliant with such recommendations are subjected to financial sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.bitcoinfaststart.com/bitcoin-money-laundering/|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-riskandnon-cooperativejurisdictions/?hf=10&amp;b=0&amp;s=desc(fatf_releasedate) |title=High-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions |last=Financial Action Task Force |date=23 June 2017 |website=www.fatf-gafi.org |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FATF's three primary functions with regard to money laundering are:
# Monitoring members’ progress in implementing anti-money laundering measures,
# Reviewing and reporting on laundering trends, techniques, and countermeasures, and
# Promoting the adoption and implementation of FATF anti-money laundering standards globally.

The FATF currently comprises 34 member jurisdictions and 2 regional organisations, representing most major financial centres in all parts of the globe.

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] maintains the ''International Money Laundering Information Network'', a website that provides information and software for anti-money laundering data collection and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imolin.org/imolin/index.html International Money Laundering Information Network].

==Anti-money-laundering measures by region==
Many jurisdictions adopt a list of specific predicate crimes for money laundering prosecutions, while others criminalize the proceeds of any serious crimes.

===Afghanistan===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Afghanistan (FinTRACA) was established as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Anti Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law passed by decree late in 2004. The main purpose of this law is to protect the integrity of the Afghan financial system and to gain compliance with international treaties and conventions. The Financial Intelligence Unit is a semi-independent body that is administratively housed within the Central Bank of Afghanistan (Da Afghanistan Bank). The main objective of FinTRACA is to deny the use of the Afghan financial system to those who obtained funds as the result of illegal activity, and to those who would use it to support terrorist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fintraca.gov.af |title=fintraca.gov.af |publisher=fintraca.gov.af |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet its objectives, the FinTRACA collects and analyzes information from a variety of sources. These sources include entities with legal obligations to submit reports to the FinTRACA when a suspicious activity is detected, as well as reports of cash transactions above a threshold amount specified by regulation. Also, FinTRACA has access to all related Afghan government information and databases. When the analysis of this information supports the supposition of illegal use of the financial system, the FinTRACA works closely with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the illegal activity. FinTRACA also cooperates internationally in support of its own analyses and investigations and to support the analyses and investigations of foreign counterparts, to the extent allowed by law. Other functions include training of those entities with legal obligations to report information, development of laws and regulations to support national-level AML objectives, and international and regional cooperation in the development of AML typologies and countermeasures.

===Australia===
Australia has adopted a number of strategies to combat money laundering, which mirror those of a majority of western countries. The [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] ([[AUSTRAC]]) is Australia's financial intelligence unit to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires financial institutions and other 'cash dealers' in Australia to report to it suspicious cash or other transactions and other specific information. The [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] maintains a list of [[Outlawed terror organisations in Australia|outlawed terror organisations]]. It is an offense to materially support or be supported by such organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Security: [http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/WhatAustraliaisdoing/Pages/default.aspx What Australia is doing]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an offence to open a bank account in Australia in a false name,&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988'' (Cth), s 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and rigorous procedures must be followed when new bank accounts are opened. 

The ''Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006'' (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) is the principal legislative instrument, although there are also offence provisions contained in Division 400 of the ''Criminal Code Act 1995'' (Cth). Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a second tranche of reforms extending to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms have yet to be progressed.

The ''[[Proceeds of Crime Act 1987]]'' (Cth) imposes criminal penalties on a person who engages in money laundering, and allows for confiscation of property. The principal objects of the Act are set out in s.3(1):

* to deprive persons of the proceeds of, and benefits derived from the commission of offences,
* to provide for the forfeiture of property used in or in connection with the commission of such offences, and
* to enable [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission|law enforcement authorities]] to effectively trace such proceeds, benefits and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Cash|last=Tyree|first=Alan|publisher=Butterworths|year=1997|isbn=0 409 31316 5|location=Adelaide, Australia|pages=82, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
The first anti-money laundering legislation in Bangladesh was the ''Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2002''. It was replaced by the ''Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance 2008''. Subsequently, the ordinance was repealed by the ''Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2009''. In 2012, government again replace it with the ''Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money Laundering Act 2012 amended|url=https://resource.ogrlegal.com/money-laundering-act-2012-amended/|website=Resource Portal of OGR Legal|publisher=OGR Legal|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of section 2, "Money Laundering means – (i)  knowingly moving, converting, or transferring proceeds of crime or property involved in an offence for the following purposes:- (1) concealing or disguising the illicit nature, source,  location, ownership or control of the proceeds of crime; or (2) assisting any person involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of such offence;  (ii)   smuggling money or property earned through legal or illegal means to a foreign country; (iii)  knowingly transferring or remitting the proceeds of crime to a foreign country or remitting or bringing them into Bangladesh from a foreign country with the intention of hiding or disguising its illegal source; or (iv) concluding or attempting to conclude financial transactions in such a manner so as to reporting requirement under this Act may be avoided;(v) converting or moving or transferring property with the intention to instigate or assist for committing a predicate offence; (vi) acquiring, possessing or using any property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of a predicate offence; (vii) performing such activities so as to the illegal source of the proceeds of crime may be concealed or disguised; (viii) participating in, associating with, conspiring, attempting, abetting, instigate or counsel to commit any offences mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws and Acts|url=https://www.bb.org.bd/aboutus/regulationguideline/lawsnacts.php|website=Bangladesh Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/bangla_pdf_part.php?act_name=&amp;vol=%E0%A7%AA%E0%A7%A8&amp;id=1088|title=মানিলন্ডারিং প্রতিরোধ আইন, ২০১২|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent these Illegal uses of money, the Bangladesh government has introduced the Money Laundering Prevention Act. The Act was last amended in the year 2009 and all the financial institutes are following this act. Till today there are 26 circulars issued by Bangladesh Bank under this act. To prevent money laundering, a banker must do the following:
* While opening a new account, the account opening form should be duly filled up by all the information of the customer.
* The [[Know your customer|KYC]] must be properly filled.
* The Transaction Profile (TP) is mandatory for a client to understand his/her transactions. If needed, the TP must be updated at the client's consent.
* All other necessary papers should be properly collected along with the National ID card.
* If any suspicious transaction is noticed, the Branch Anti Money Laundering Compliance Officer (BAMLCO) must be notified and accordingly the Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) must be filled out.
* The cash department should be aware of the transactions. It must be noted if suddenly a big amount of money is deposited in any account. Proper documents are required if any client does this type of transaction.
* Structuring, over/ under invoicing is another way to do money laundering. The foreign exchange department should look into this matter cautiously.
* If any account has a transaction over 1 million taka in a single day, it must be reported in a cash transaction report (CTR).
* All bank officials must go through all the 26 circulars and use them.

===Canada===
In 1991, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was brought into force in Canada to give legal effect to the former [[FATF]] Forty Recommendations by establishing record keeping and client identification requirements in the financial sector to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of money laundering offences under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]].&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada"&gt;{{cite web |author=Duhaime, Christine |title=AML Legislation in Canada, Duhaime's Financial Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Law |url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law/aml-legislation-in-canada |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was amended to expand the scope of its application and to establish a financial intelligence unit with national control over money laundering, namely [[FINTRAC]].&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

In December 2001, the scope of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was again expanded by amendments enacted under the Anti-Terrorism Act with the objective of deterring terrorist activity by cutting off sources and channels of funding used by terrorists in response to [[9/11]].  The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was renamed the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

In December 2006, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act was further amended, in part, in response to pressure from the FATF for Canada to tighten its money laundering and financing of terrorism legislation.  The amendments expanded the client identification, record-keeping and reporting requirements for certain organizations and included new obligations to report attempted suspicious transactions and outgoing and incoming international electronic fund transfers, undertake risk assessments and implement written compliance procedures in respect of those risks.&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

The amendments also enabled greater money laundering and terrorist financing intelligence-sharing among enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="AML Legislation in Canada" /&gt;

In Canada, casinos, money service businesses, notaries, accountants, banks, securities brokers, life insurance agencies, real estate salespeople and dealers in precious metals and stones are subject to the reporting and record keeping obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.

===European Union===
The fourth and latest iteration of the EU’s anti-money laundering directive (AMLD IV) was published on 5 June 2015, after clearing its last legislative stop at the European Parliament. The new directive brings the EU’s anti-money laundering laws more in line with the US’s, which is welcome news for financial institutions that are operating in both jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/aml-global-alignment.pdf |title= AML global alignment: Two steps forward, one step back |website= pwc.com|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://complyadvantage.com/blog/5mld-fifth-anti-money-laundering-directive/ The Fifth Money Laundering Directive (5MLD)] will come into force on the 10th January 2020. It will address a number of weaknesses in the European Union’s AML/CFT regime that have come to light since the enactment of the Fourth Money Laundering Directive AMLD IV).

Lack of harmonization in AML requirements between the US and EU has complicated the compliance efforts of global institutions that are looking to standardize the Know Your Customer (KYC) component of their AML programs across key jurisdictions. AMLD IV promises to better align the AML regimes by adopting a more risk-based approach compared to its predecessor, AMLD III.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"/&gt;

Certain components of the directive, however, go beyond current requirements in both the EU and US, imposing new implementation challenges on banks. For instance, more public officials are brought within the scope of the directive, and EU member states are required to establish new registries of “beneficial owners” (i.e., those who ultimately own or control each company) which will impact banks. AMLD IV became effective 25 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045|title = EUR-Lex – 52013PC0045 – EN – EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Parliament of India]] passed an [[Act of Parliament|act]] called the [[Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002]]. The main objectives of this act are to prevent money-laundering as well as to provide for confiscation of property either derived from or involved in, money-laundering.&lt;ref name="Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/2003/The%20Prevention%20of%20Money-laudering%20Act,%202002.pdf|publisher=Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), Ministry of Finance, India|accessdate=10 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712181014/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/P-ACT/2003/The%20Prevention%20of%20Money-laudering%20Act,%202002.pdf|archive-date=12 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 12 (1) describes the obligations that banks, other financial institutions, and intermediaries have to 
:(a) Maintain records that detail the nature and value of transactions, whether such transactions comprise a single transaction or a series of connected transactions, and where these transactions take place within a month.
:(b) Furnish information on transactions referred to in clause (a) to the Director within the time prescribed, including records of the identity of all its clients.

Section 12 (2) prescribes that the records referred to in sub-section (1) as mentioned above, must be maintained for ten years after the transactions finished. It is handled by the Indian Income Tax Department.

The provisions of the Act are frequently reviewed and various amendments have been passed from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/MoneyLaundering.pdf |title=The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2005 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219064454/http://lawmin.nic.in/legislative/MoneyLaundering.pdf |archive-date=19 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/vikas_doc/docs/1253169904~~The%20Prevention%20of%20Money%20Laundering%20Act,%202009.pdf |title=The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank accountants must record all transactions over Rs. 1&amp;nbsp;million and maintain such records for 10 years. Banks must also make cash transaction reports (CTRs) and suspicious transaction reports over Rs. 1&amp;nbsp;million within 7 days of initial suspicion.

The term ‘money laundering’ is not used as such within the CDSA. Part VI of the CDSA criminalises the laundering of proceeds generated by criminal conduct and drug tracking via the following offences:
* The assistance of another person in retaining, controlling or using the benefits of [[drug dealing]] or criminal conduct under an arrangement (whether by concealment, removal from jurisdiction, transfer to nominees or otherwise) [section 43(1)/44(1)].
* The concealment, conversion, transfer or removal from the jurisdiction, or the acquisition, possession or use of benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct [section 46(1)/47(1)].
* The concealment, conversion, transfer or removal from the jurisdiction of another person’s benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct [section 46(2)/47(2)].
* The acquirement, possession or use of another person’s benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct [section 46(3)/47(3)].

Money laundering and terrorist funding legislation in the UK is governed by four Acts of primary legislation:-
* [[Terrorism Act 2000]]&lt;ref name="TERRA1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_1 |title=OPSI: Terrorism Act |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shearman.com/perspectives/2018/06/sanctions-and-anti-money-laundering-act|title=The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018: New Challenges in Sanctions Compliance?|website=Shearman &amp; Sterling|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money Laundering Regulations are designed to protect the UK financial system, as well as preventing and detecting crime. If a business is covered by these regulations then controls are put in place to prevent it being used for money laundering.

The [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] contains the primary UK anti-money laundering legislation,&lt;ref&gt;Sections 327 – 340, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; including provisions requiring businesses within the "regulated sector" (banking, investment, money transmission, certain professions, etc.) to report to the authorities suspicions of money laundering by customers or others.&lt;ref&gt;Section 330, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Money laundering is broadly defined in the UK.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Section 340, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In effect any handling or involvement with any proceeds of any crime (or monies or assets representing the proceeds of crime) can be a money laundering offence. An offender's possession of the proceeds of his own crime falls within the UK definition of money laundering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Section 329, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The definition also covers activities within the traditional definition of money laundering, as a process that conceals or disguises the proceeds of crime to make them appear legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Section 327, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike certain other jurisdictions (notably the US and much of Europe), UK money laundering offences are not limited to the proceeds of serious crimes, nor are there any monetary limits. Financial transactions need no money laundering design or purpose for UK laws to consider them a money laundering offence. A money laundering offence under UK legislation need not even involve money, since the money laundering legislation covers assets of any description. In consequence, any person who commits an acquisitive crime (i.e., one that produces some benefit in the form of money or an asset of any description) in the UK inevitably also commits a money laundering offence under UK legislation.

This applies also to a person who, by criminal conduct, evades a liability (such as a taxation liability)—which lawyers call "obtaining a pecuniary advantage"—as he is deemed thereby to obtain a sum of money equal in value to the liability evaded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The principal money laundering offences carry a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Section 334, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary regulation is provided by the Money Laundering Regulations 2003,&lt;ref name="MLR1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20033075.htm |title=OPSI: Money Laundering Regulations 2003 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was replaced by the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.&lt;ref name="MLR2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20072157_en_1 |title=OPSI: Money Laundering Regulations 2007 |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are directly based on the EU directives 91/308/EEC, 2001/97/EC and 2005/60/EC.

One consequence of the Act is that solicitors, accountants, tax advisers, and insolvency practitioners who suspect (as a consequence of information received in the course of their work) that their clients (or others) have engaged in tax evasion or other criminal conduct that produced a benefit, now must report their suspicions to the authorities (since these entail suspicions of money laundering). In most circumstances it would be an offence, "tipping-off", for the reporter to inform the subject of his report that a report has been made.&lt;ref&gt;Section 333A, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions do not however require disclosure to the authorities of information received by certain professionals in privileged circumstances or where the information is subject to [[legal professional privilege]]. Others that are subject to these regulations include financial institutions, credit institutions, estate agents (which includes chartered surveyors), trust and company service providers, high value dealers (who accept cash equivalent to €15,000 or more for goods sold), and casinos.

Professional guidance (which is submitted to and approved by the UK Treasury) is provided by industry groups including the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group,&lt;ref name="JMLSG1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmlsg.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.jsp;jsessionid=aH1DPtXgUly-?d=749 |title=Joint Money Laundering Steering Group |accessdate=14 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006131749/http://www.jmlsg.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.jsp;jsessionid=aH1DPtXgUly-?d=749 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Law Society.&lt;ref name="LS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/support-services/risk-compliance/anti-money-laundering |title=Law Society AML advice |accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB).
However, there is no obligation on banking institutions to routinely report monetary deposits or transfers above a specified value. Instead reports must be made of all suspicious deposits or transfers, irrespective of their value.

The reporting obligations include reporting suspicious gains from conduct in other countries that would be criminal if it took place in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Section 340(2), Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions were later added for certain activities legal where they took place, such as [[bullfighting]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;David Winch, [http://www.accountingevidence.com/documents/articles/Money%20laundering%20law%20changes.pdf "Money Laundering Law Changes"] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 200,000 reports of suspected money laundering are submitted annually to authorities in the UK (there were 240,582 reports in the year ended 30 September 2010. This was an increase from the 228,834 reports submitted in the previous year).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;The Suspicious Activity Reports Regime Annual Report 2010 published by SOCA&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these reports are submitted by banks and similar financial institutions (there were 186,897 reports from the banking sector in the year ended 30 September 2010).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Although 5,108 different organisations submitted [[Suspicious activity report (banking)|suspicious activity reports]] to the authorities in the year ended 30 September 2010, just four organisations submitted approximately half of all reports, and the top 20 reporting organisations accounted for three-quarters of all reports.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The offence of failing to report a suspicion of money laundering by another person carries a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

On May 1, 2018, the UK House of Commons, without opposition,&lt;ref name=aolmay1 /&gt; passed the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which will set out the UK government’s intended approach to exceptions and licenses when the nation becomes responsible for implementing its own sanctions and will also require notorious overseas British territory tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to establish public registers of the beneficial ownership of firms in their jurisdictions by the end of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sanctions-and-anti-money-laundering-bill-exceptions-and-licences-policy-note|title=Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill: exceptions and licences policy note|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aolmay1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aol.co.uk/news/2018/05/01/mps-back-public-registers-of-ownership-in-bid-to-improve-tax-hav/|title=MPs back public registers of ownership in bid to improve tax haven transparency - AOL|website=www.aol.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was passed by the House of Lords on May 21 and received Royal Asset on May 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/sanctionsandantimoneylaundering/stages.html|title=Bill stages — Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 — UK Parliament|website=services.parliament.uk|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Act's public register provision is facing legal challenges from local governments in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, who argue that it violates their Constitutional sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/overseas-territories-to-fight-public-register-demands/5066370.article|title=Overseas territories to fight public register demands|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bureaux de change''====
All UK ''[[Bureaux de change]]'' are registered with [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]], which issues a trading licence for each location. Bureaux de change and [[money transmitter]]s, such as [[Western Union]] outlets, in the UK fall within the "regulated sector" and are required to comply with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.&lt;ref name="MLR2"/&gt; Checks can be carried out by HMRC on all [[Money Service Business]]es.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (2001) and subsequent amendments have added responsibilities to the FSB to combat money laundering.

===United States===
The approach in the United States to stopping money laundering is usually broken into two areas: preventive (regulatory) measures and criminal measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp|title=Anti Money Laundering - AML|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2005-07-21|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws|title=History of Anti-Money Laundering Laws {{!}} FinCEN.gov|website=www.fincen.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preventive====
In an attempt to prevent dirty money from entering the U.S. financial system in the first place, the United States Congress passed a series of laws, starting in 1970, collectively known as the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] (BSA). These laws, contained in sections 5311 through 5332 of Title 31 of the United States Code, require [[financial institution]]s, which under the current definition include a broad array of entities, including banks, credit card companies, life insurers, [[money service businesses]] and broker-dealers in securities, to report certain transactions to the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. Cash transactions in excess of a certain amount must be reported on a [[currency transaction report]] (CTR), identifying the individual making the transaction as well as the source of the cash. The law originally required all transactions of [[USD|US$]]5,000 or more to be reported, but due to excessively high levels of reporting the threshold was raised to US$10,000.  The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world to require reporting of all cash transactions over a certain limit, although certain businesses can be exempt from the requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/olm_019.htm |title=FFIEC website regarding CTR Exemptions |accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, financial institutions must report transaction on a [[Suspicious Activity Report]] (SAR) that they deem "suspicious", defined as a knowing or suspecting that the funds come from illegal activity or disguise funds from illegal activity, that it is structured to evade BSA requirements or appears to serve no known business or apparent lawful purpose; or that the institution is being used to facilitate criminal activity. Attempts by customers to circumvent the BSA, generally by structuring cash deposits to amounts lower than US$10,000 by breaking them up and depositing them on different days or at different locations also violates the law.&lt;ref name=fincen&gt;{{cite web |last=FinCEN |title=Bank Secrecy Act |url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/ |accessdate=2 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307015603/http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/ |archivedate=7 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial database created by these reports is administered by the U.S.'s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), called the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN), located in Vienna, Virginia. The reports are made available to U.S. criminal investigators, as well as other FIU's around the globe, and FinCEN conducts computer assisted analyses of these reports to determine trends and refer investigations.&lt;ref name="FinCEN Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/mission.html |title=FinCEN mission |accessdate=2 March 2011 |last=FinCEN Mission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430233210/http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/mission.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSA requires financial institutions to engage in customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as [[know your customer]]. This includes obtaining satisfactory identification to give assurance that the account is in the customer's true name, and having an understanding of the expected nature and source of the money that flows through the customer's accounts. Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters. If a manual inspection reveals that the transaction is suspicious, the institution should file a [[Suspicious Activity Report]].&lt;ref name="roth monograph"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=John |author2=Douglas Greenburg and Serena Willie |title=Monograph on Terrorist Financing |year=2004 |pages=54–56 |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulators of the industries involved are responsible to ensure that the financial institutions comply with the BSA. For example, the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] regularly inspect banks, and may impose civil fines or refer matters for criminal prosecution for non-compliance. A number of banks have been fined and prosecuted for failure to comply with the BSA. Most famously, [[Riggs Bank]], in Washington D.C., was prosecuted and functionally driven out of business as a result of its failure to apply proper money laundering controls, particularly as it related to foreign political figures.&lt;ref name="Joseph USAB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joseph |first=Lester |author2=John Roth |title=Criminal Prosecution of Banks Under the Bank Secrecy Act |journal=United States Attorneys' Bulletin |date=September 2007 |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5505.pdf |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the BSA, the U.S. imposes controls on the movement of currency across its borders, requiring individuals to report the transportation of cash in excess of US$10,000 on a form called Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (known as a CMIR).&lt;ref name="CMIR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/amlsourcetool.htm#8 |title=SEC resources |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, businesses, such as automobile dealerships, that receive cash in excess of US$10,000 must file a Form 8300 with the Internal Revenue Service, identifying the source of the cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=148857,00.html |title=IRS web site regarding Form 8300 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222191824/http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=148857,00.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2010, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] issued an advisory on "[[informal value transfer system]]s" referencing ''[[United States v. Banki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2010-A011.html "Informal Value Transfer Systems", Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 1 September 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905002704/http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2010-A011.html |date=5 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, there are perceived consequences of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. These [[unintended consequences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natcnc.com/msb/the-unintended-consequences-of-aml-regulations/|title=AML Regulation MSBs - National Check &amp; Currency|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; include FinCEN's publishing of a list of "risky businesses," which many believe unfairly targeted money service businesses. The publishing of this list and the subsequent fall-out, banks indiscriminately [[de-risking]] MSBs, is referred to as [[Operation Choke Point]]. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a Geographic Targeting Order to combat against illegal money laundering in the United States. This means that title insurance companies in the U.S. are required to identify the natural persons behind companies that pay all cash in residential real estate purchases over a particular amount in certain U.S. cities.

====Criminal sanctions====
Money laundering has been criminalized in the United States since the [[Money Laundering Control Act]] of 1986. The law, contained at section 1956 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits individuals from engaging in a financial transaction with proceeds that were generated from certain specific crimes, known as "specified unlawful activities" (SUAs). The law requires that an individual specifically intend in making the transaction to conceal the source, ownership or control of the funds. There is no minimum threshold of money, and no requirement that the transaction succeeded in actually disguising the money. A "financial transaction" has been broadly defined, and need not involve a financial institution, or even a business. Merely passing money from one person to another, with the intent to disguise the source, ownership, location or control of the money, has been deemed a financial transaction under the law. The possession of money without either a financial transaction or an intent to conceal is not a crime in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cassella USAB"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5505.pdf |title=Money Laundering Laws |accessdate=2 March 2011 |last=Cassella |first=Stefan |journal=United States Attorneys' Bulletin |date=September 2007 |pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides money laundering, the law contained in section 1957 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits spending more than US$10,000 derived from an SUA, regardless of whether the individual wishes to disguise it. It carries a lesser penalty than money laundering, and unlike the money laundering statute, requires that the money pass through a financial institution.&lt;ref name="Cassella USAB" /&gt;

According to the records compiled by the United States Sentencing Commission, in 2009, the United States Department of Justice typically convicted a little over 81,000 people; of this, approximately 800 are convicted of money laundering as the primary or most serious charge.&lt;ref name="USSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ussc.gov/Data_and_Statistics/Federal_Sentencing_Statistics/State_District_Circuit/2009/1c09.pdf |title=US Sentencing Commission Date, 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] of 1988 expanded the definition of financial institution to include businesses such as car dealers and real estate closing personnel and required them to file reports on large currency transaction. It required verification of identity of those who purchase monetary instruments over $3,000. The [[Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act]] of 1992 strengthened sanctions for BSA violations, required so called "Suspicious Activity Reports" and eliminated previously used "Criminal Referral Forms", required verification and recordkeeping for wire transfers and established the [[Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group]] (BSAAG). The [[Money Laundering Suppression Act]] from 1994 required banking agencies to review and enhance training, develop anti-money laundering examination procedures, review and enhance procedures for referring cases to law enforcement agencies, streamlined the [[Currency transaction report]] exemption process, required each [[Money services business]] (MSB) to be registered by an owner or controlling person, required every MSB to maintain a list of businesses authorized to act as agents in connection with the financial services offered by the MSB, made operating an unregistered MSB a federal crime, and recommended that states adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs. The [[Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act]] of 1998 required banking agencies to develop anti-money laundering training for examiners, required the Department of the Treasury and other agencies to develop a "National Money Laundering Strategy", created the "High Intensity Money Laundering and Related Financial Crime Area" (HIFCA) Task Forces to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the federal, state and local levels in zones where money laundering is prevalent. HIFCA zones may be defined geographically or can be created to address money laundering in an industry sector, a financial institution, or group of financial institutions.&lt;ref name="hicfa"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a HICFA?|url=http://www.fincen.gov/law_enforcement/hifca/index.html#map_hifca|work=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|accessdate=6 March 2014|author=US Dept Treasury|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306130201/http://www.fincen.gov/law_enforcement/hifca/index.html#map_hifca|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intelligence Reform &amp; Terrorism Prevention Act]] of 2004 amended the Bank Secrecy Act to require the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to prescribe regulations requiring certain financial institutions to report cross-border electronic transmittals of funds, if the Secretary determines that reporting is "reasonably necessary" in "anti-money laundering /combatting financing of terrorists (Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism AML/CFT).

== Digital money and Money laundering == 
To prevent the usage of decentralized digital money such as [[Bitcoin]] for the profit of crime and corruption, Australia is planning to strengthen the nation's anti-money laundering laws.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web |title=Bitcoin one step closer to being regulated in Australia under new anti-money laundering laws|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-23/bitcoin-one-step-closer-to-being-regulated-in-australia/9058582 |accessdate=18 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Knowing the characteristics of Bitcoin,&lt;ref name= Bitcoin&gt;{{cite web |title=Bitcoin FAQ |url= https://bitcoin.com.au/page/faq/  |accessdate=18 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is completely deterministic, protocol based and cannot be censored, may circumvent national laws using services like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] to obfuscate transaction origins, and relies completely off of cryptography, not a central entity running under a [[Know your customer|KYC]] framework. There are several cases of criminals have cashed out a significant amount of Bitcoin after ransomware attacks, drug dealings, cyber fraud and gunrunning. &lt;ref name= cnbc.com&gt;{{cite web |title=Hackers have cashed out on $143,000 of bitcoin from the massive WannaCry ransomware attack  |url= https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/03/hackers-have-cashed-out-on-143000-of-bitcoin-from-the-massive-wannacry-ransomware-attack.html  |accessdate=18 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;ref name= express.co.uk&gt;{{cite web |title=Bitcoin used by CRIMINALS to launder illicit funds    |url= https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/887627/bitcoin-worth-exchange-rate-scotland-yard-criminal-activity-drug-dealing |accessdate=18 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other damages such as [[The DAO (organization)|The DAO]] being drained of [[Ethereum|Ether]] cannot be classified as money laundering under any legal definition, as decentralized virtual environments are legally stateless and cannot be intervened with by a governing body. Such an incident has been debated as to the clear definition of money laundering in a stateless environment, leading to [[Ethereum Classic]] to form.

In the first part of the 21st century, he has opened his cheque book in an attempt to bring his hometown rugby team to prominence. His signings of international stars such as past Toulon players [[George Gregan]], [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]], [[Sonny Bill Williams]] and [[Tana Umaga]], plus current stars [[Steffon Armitage]], [[Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe]], [[Matt Giteau]], [[Drew Mitchell]], [[Mathieu Bastareaud]], [[Bakkies Botha]] and [[Jonny Wilkinson]],  have led British rugby commentator [[Martin Gillingham]] to call Toulon a "band of galacticos" (an obvious reference to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] [[galácticos|galáctico]] policy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/top-14-toulon-are-the-galacticos-of-the-rugby-world/ |title=Top 14: Toulon are the Galacticos of the rugby world |first=Martin |last=Gillingham |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331061211/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/top-14-toulon-are-the-galacticos-of-the-rugby-world/ |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His time at the helm of Toulon has not been without controversy. Most notably, he drew a 130-day dressing room and pitchside ban from Top 14 organizer [[National Rugby League (France)|LNR]] for the following outburst after a narrow Toulon loss to [[ASM Clermont Auvergne|Clermont]] in January 2012:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2011-12/rugby/story/165300.html |title=The perfect finale |first=Martin |last=Gillingham |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I had my first refereeing sodomy in the [[2009–10 Top 14 season|[2010]]] semi-final against Clermont. I've just had my second tonight. It appeared to hurt the first time but it was just as bad this time. We will review the images not on [[YouTube]] but on [[YouPorn]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, his tenure has seen tremendous commercial success for the club. ESPN rugby journalist Ian Moriarty remarked during the [[2012–13 Top 14 season|2012–13 season]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Boudjellal claimed earlier this season that the financial performance of the club meant he no longer needed to put his own cash in. Whatever you think about his penchant for throwing verbal grenades in the media from time to time, his management from a commercial point of view has been impressive. Toulon have increased their turnover by 500% during his tenure, allowing the club to spend right up to the limit of the salary cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2012-13/rugby/story/183943.html |title=Wilko and Toulon target rare double |first=Ian |last=Moriarty |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2013-05-30 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Mutual Gains Bargaining''' (MGB) is an approach to [[collective bargaining]] intended to reach ''[[win-win]]'' outcomes for the negotiating parties.

Instead of the traditional adversarial (i.e., "win/lose") approach (also known as "positional bargaining"), the mutual gains approach is quite similar to [[principled negotiation]] (first described by [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] in his book ''[[Getting to YES]]''), where the goal is to reach a sustainable (i.e., lasting) agreement that both parties (or all parties in a multi-party negotiation) can live with and support.

Mutual gains bargaining has been used successfully in such areas as labor–management relations and environmental negotiations.

==Some principles of MGB==
* Both sides have legitimate interests to be recognized and advanced
* Approach the issues as problems to be solved
* Listening builds trust
* Enlarge the pie
* Seek sustainable alternatives

* [[Integrative negotiation]]

The '''Ordre des Experts-Comptables''' (''Institute of Chartered Accountants''), or '''OEC''', is a professional organization of [[Chartered Accountant]]s in France. 
The institute was created by Ordinance in 1945 and placed under the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget.
It represents Chartered Accountants, supports them in their professional development and guarantees their ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://waccounting.net/associations/conseil-sup%C3%A9rieur-de-lordre-des-experts-comptables
 |publisher=Waccounting
 |title=Conseil Supérieur de l'Ordre des Experts-Comptables
 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute is represented by the Supreme Council (''Conseil Superieur de L'Ordre des Experts Comptables'') based in [[Paris]].
The Supreme Council consists of 44 elected members and the presidents of 22 regional councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=LE CONSEIL SUPÉRIEUR DE L'ORDRE
 |publisher=OEC
 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OEC is a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) and of the [[International Federation of Francophone Accountants]] (FIDEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=France
 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[CGA-Canada]] has a Mutual Recognition Agreement with the OEC. There is a straightforward process for a member of the one institution to become a member of the other, subject to passing an examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Pablo Tecson y Ocampo''' (July 4, 1858 – April 30, 1940) was an officer in the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolutionary Army]] serving under [[Gregorio del Pilar|Gen. Gregorio del Pilar]] (responsible for the eventual surrender of the Spanish forces) and a representative to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]].  He was elected the [[Governor General]] of [[Bulacan]] immediately following the [[Philippine–American War]]. Tecson later served as [[Secretary of Agriculture (Philippines)|Insular Secretary of the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture]].

==Early life and education==
Pablo Tecson was born July 4, 1859 in [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel de Mayumo]], Bulacan Province, [[Philippines]]; the son of Tiburcio Tecson and Paula Ocampo.  He studied in San Miguel and later, at the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] in [[Intramuros, Manila]] (where he finished his Bachelor of Arts program).

==Early career==
Tecson worked as a writer for a Spanish-era magazine, the "Catholic Periodical Guide" (''Pahayagan Patnubay ng Catolico''), in [[Malolos]], the county seat of Bulacan; its initial publication being in April 1890.

==Military action against Spain==
When the revolution against Spain broke out, Tecson was an officer in the Spanish Civil Guards (''Guardia Civil'') in San Miguel.

===Background===
In 1896, Tecson co-founded the Arao (''Balangay Arao'') branch of a secret society-turned-revolutionary government, the [[Katipunan]] (''Kataastaasang Kagalanggalangang Katipunan'', or ''KKK'')([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''nang mga anak nang bayan''), which operated out of San Miguel.

On December 14, 1897 the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]], was signed in Tecson's residence.  It called for a truce between Spanish Colonial Governor-General [[Fernando Primo de Rivera]], and insurgent leader, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], to end the [[Philippine Revolution]].  Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were given amnesty and money and agreed to go into voluntary exile in [[Hong Kong]].  (Aguinaldo later used the money to purchase firearms.)  Following Aguinaldo's return from exile in [[Hong Kong]], Tecson defected from the Civil Guards and joined Aguinaldo's Republican Army as a captain.

Following the ''[[Cry of Nueva Ecija]]'', he fought alongside [[Manuel Tinio|General Manuel Tinio]] (especially in [[Nueva Ecija]]) and General [[Francisco Macabulos]].  He himself was eventually ranked brigadier general under del Pilar.

===Battle of San Miguel===
On May 24, 1898, Tecson launched attacks on the Spanish Civil Guard garrisons in San Miguel and [[San Rafael, Bulacan]] (collectively known as the [[Battle of San Miguel]]); which ended with the Spanish force's surrender on June 1, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baleria.com/index.php?body=article_baleria&amp;id_article=69 |title=Los ultimos de Filipinas. El regreso a Baler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime politics==
In 1898, Tecson represented the province of [[Cagayan]] at the Malolos Congress (which drafted the [[Malolos Constitution|Charter]] of the [[First Philippine Republic]]) a few months before the outbreak of the [[Philippine–American War|war with America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1899constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1899 Constitution - Chan Robles and Associates Law Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cast the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|deciding vote]] which addressed the constitutional provision of the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="bulacan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bulacan.gov.ph/generalinfo/governor.php?id=36 |title=Bulacan, Philippines: General Info: Provincial Governors: Pablo Tecson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military action against the United States==

===Battle of Quingua===
The [[Battle of Quingua]] was fought on April 23, 1899, in Quingua, Bulacan (now [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]]), which resulted in a rout of the Filipinos by their former allies, the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="arl"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Arlington National Cemetery Website: John M. Stotsenburg | url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jmstots.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and politics following the war==
Tecson was elected governor general of Bulacan—the first accepted under American rule, serving from 1902–1906.  In 1904, he was named as a delegate of the Philippine's Worlds Fair Commission. Tecson resigned from government service in 1906 and went into farming.  He was one of the first to promote the silk culture industry in the Philippines.  He returned to government service in 1907, becoming the Secretary of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]].

==Philanthropy, legacy and death==
Tecson donated the land for the use of the [[Philippine Constabulary|Constabulary Station]] (''Barangay Sibul Spring'') in San Miguel.  This was later named [[1st Scout Ranger Regiment|Camp Tecson]].  Tecson died in 1933&lt;ref name="bulacan" /&gt; and is buried in San Miguel.  At his death, he donated land for a public burial ground for Filipino patriots.

'''Rapid casting''' is an integration of conventional [[casting]] with [[rapid prototyping]]/[[3D printing]]. In this technique disposable pattern used for forming mold  are  created with 3d printing techniques like fused deposition, [[stereo lithography]] or any other 3d printing technique.

==Procedure==
* A disposable pattern is made with RP (that can be of wax or any other plastic used in 3d printing)
* The pattern if made of wax, undergoes wax infiltrations  and other procedures to increase its strength and  dewaxing properties .
* A mold is made with the printed pattern.
* Evacuation of the pattern from the mold followed by regular casting procedure.

==Advantages==
* Easier to make pattern.
* Reduced time of manufacturing.
* Possibility to make the pattern lighter by removing unwanted material and stiffer by adding rib features.

'''Solomon (Sol) Kerzner''', [[K.C.M.G.]] (born 23 August 1935) is a [[South Africa]]n [[accountant]] and [[business magnate]].  His family started a hotel chain; after Kerzner graduated with a B.Com (Accounting), B.Com (Hons) (Accounting) from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], [[Johannesburg]] and qualified as a [[Accountant|Chartered Accountant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://janiallan.com/facetoface/ SOL KERZNER: The Miniature Minotaur] [[Jani Allan|janiallan.com]] Retrieved on 20 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; he took over the running of the group and went on to create the most successful hotel group in South Africa, [[Sun International South Africa|Sun International]].  He is now the Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Kerzner International and his career spans more than 45 years in the resort industry.  He founded both of South Africa's largest hotel groups, [[Southern Sun Hotel Group]].

==Background and career==

Kerzner was born in Troyeville, [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, the son of [[Russian Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref name=SundayTribSunSets&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/sunday-tribune/news/sun-sets-on-sol-s-empire-1.1214660#.Vh5fnNh01Fo Sunday Tribune: "Sun sets on Sol’s empire" By Vivian Attwood] 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His parents owned and operated a chain of kosher hotels.&lt;ref name=SundayTribSunSets /&gt; Kerzner graduated with a degree in accounting and then took control of the family company.&lt;ref name=SundayTribSunSets /&gt; In 1962, he purchased the Astra Hotel in Durban. Following the success of that property, Kerzner built South Africa's first five-star graded hotel in Umhlanga, a village north of Durban –  he opened this resort in December 1964 which he named the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Following the Beverly Hills, Kerzner built the 450-room Elangeni Hotel (now renamed Southern Sun Elangeni &amp; Maharani), overlooking Durban's beachfront and, in 1969, in partnership with South African Breweries, he established the chain of Southern Sun Hotels, which by 1983 operated 30 luxury hotels with more than 7,000 rooms.  In 1975, Kerzner opened his first hotel outside South Africa on the Indian Ocean Island of Mauritius which he named Le Saint Géran.

In 1979 Kerzner developed [[Sun City, South Africa|Sun City]], the most ambitious resort project in Africa.  Over a period of ten years he built four hotels, a man-made lake, two Gary Player designed championship golf courses and entertainment center with an indoor 6,000-seat multi-purpose arena in which he presented many superstars including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Shirley Bassey]] and which was also the venue of many World Title fights promoted by Bob Arum's Top Rank organisation.  During 1985, Kerzner's Sun City, South Africa resort was the topic of anti-Apartheid rock album titled ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]'' by a group of rock musicians calling themselves [[Artists United Against Apartheid]].

In 1994, following the first multiracial elections in South Africa, Kerzner was asked by incoming President Nelson Mandela to arrange the VIP function at the Presidential Inauguration, which was attended by approximately a thousand people, including many of the world's leaders and heads of state.

In 1996, Kerzner opened the hugely successful [[Mohegan Sun]] casino in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] in the United States and in 2000 opened the second phase of the project including a 1,200-room hotel through a joint venture with the [[Mohegan|Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut]] called Trading Cove Associates. TCA relinquished its management of the resort in 2002 but Kerzner through his company will still receive a 5% dividend on the gross revenue generated by Mohegan Sun until 2014.  The property is one of the largest gambling and entertainment complexes in the United States.

As a result of the success of the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort with its Gary Player Country Club golf course (ranked number 1 in South Africa) he got involved in international hotel, leisure and gambling resorts; most notable is his role as the innovative developer behind the well-known [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Atlantis]] Resort in the [[Bahamas]].  In late 1994, Kerzner made his first major acquisition outside Africa through the purchase of the Paradise Island Resort in The Bahamas.  This 1,150-room resort was in bankruptcy at the time.  After acquiring the resort, Kerzner launched a major re-development and expansion program which transformed Paradise Island into a 2,300-room resort that included one of the world's largest man-made marine habitats and the Caribbean's biggest casino.

In 2002, Kerzner launched One&amp;Only Resorts which currently operates seven properties in The Bahamas, Mexico, Mauritius, The Maldives, South Africa, Dubai and Hayman Island.

In early 2007, Kerzner expanded Atlantis, Paradise Island with new hotels The Cove and The Reef which added 1,100 new rooms to the property.  This expansion was overseen by [[Alan Leibman]], which included 21 retail outlets and new restaurants by celebrity chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Nobu Matsuhisa and [[Bobby Flay]].
Kerzner extended the Atlantis brand globally with the development of [[Atlantis, The Palm]], Dubai, with 1,500-room, water-themed resort opened in late-September 2008 on The [[Palm Jumeirah]] – a multibillion-dollar leisure and residential development in Dubai. On September 2009, the "Mazagan Beach Resort" a luxury hotel in El Jadida (Morocco), has been inaugurated by Sol Kerzner him-self accompanied with many celebrities of show biz.

In October 2013, Kerzner announced that it is building a new Atlantis hotel at [[Sanya]], [[Hainan Island]] in China with China's [[Fosun International]]. The 62-hectare resort will have 1,300 rooms and a water park like the other Atlantis hotels. The project will cost $1.63 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/10/china-atlantis-idUSL4N0HZ2I320131010|title=UPDATE 1-China's Fosun, Sun City casino king bet on luxury Hainan resort|date=10 October 2013|publisher=''Reuters''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first wife was Maureen Adler; they had three children:&lt;ref name=IndCashIn&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-great-casino-cash-in-the-sun-king-and-his-shady-past-434560.html The Independent: "The great casino cash-in: the Sun King (and his shady past)" by Paul Vallely] 1 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Butch Kerzner]], Andrea Kerzner, and Beverly Kerzner Mace.&lt;ref name=EvenLucky&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/lucky-heather-kerzner-6750074.html Evening Standard: "Lucky Heather Kerzner" by Lydia Slater] 27 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/style/evening-hours-wildlife-watching.html new York Times: "Evening Hours; Wildlife Watching"] May 8, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife was Shirley Bestbier; they had two children: Brandon Kerzner and Chantal Kerzner Sweeney.&lt;ref name=EvenLucky /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-sunday-telegraph/20070415/282462819482183 The Sunday Telegraph: "Man With A Mission"] 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She later committed suicide&lt;ref name=SundayTribSunSets /&gt; soon after the birth of her second child.&lt;ref name=EvenLucky /&gt; His third wife, [[Miss World]] 1974 [[Anneline Kriel]], ended in divorce after five years.&lt;ref name=SundayTribSunSets /&gt; During a lengthy period in the 1990s, he dated the model [[Christina Estrada]], got engaged, but never married her.&lt;ref name=EvenBusBef&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/sol-kerzner-put-business-before-our-marriage-says-wife-6449543.html Evening Standard: "Sol Kerzner put business before our marriage, says wife" by Simon Freeman] 3 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He married his fourth wife, model Heather Murphy in 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/|title=News|date=2016-03-15|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; they divorced in 2011.&lt;ref name=EvenBusBef /&gt;

'''Tongsun Park''' (born 1935 in [[Sunchon, North Korea|Sunch'ŏn]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]), also known as '''Pak Dong-seon''', was a [[South Korea]]n [[lobbyist]]. He was involved in two political money-related scandals: [[Koreagate]] in the 1970s, and the [[Oil-for-Food Program]] scandal of the 2000s. Park had a reputation as the "Asian [[Jay Gatsby|Great Gatsby]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan |first=Dan |date=1979 |title=Merchants of Grain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLszAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Viking Press |page=289 |isbn=978-0670471508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Koreagate==
In 1976, Park was charged with bribing members of the [[U.S. Congress]], using money from the South Korean government, in a successful effort to convince the United States government to keep United States troops in South Korea. In 1977, he was indicted by a U.S. District Court on thirty-six counts, including [[bribery]], illegal campaign contributions, [[mail fraud]], [[racketeering]], and failure to register as an agent of the [[Korean Central Intelligence Agency]]. He avoided a federal trial by testifying to the court in exchange for [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]]. His testimony did not have a major impact, though it led to three members of Congress getting reprimanded, and may have convinced [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Carl Albert]] not to seek re-election.  One of the implicated former representatives, [[Otto Passman]] of [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district]] based about [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], was charged with conspiracy, bribery, acceptance of an illegal gratuity, and [[income tax evasion]]. When his trial was moved from [[Washington, D.C.]], to Monroe, Passman was quickly acquitted.&lt;ref name=oepassman&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Otto Passman, Jerry Huckaby, and Frank Spooner: The Louisiana Fifth Congressional District Campaign of 1976", ''Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association,'' Vol. LIV, No. 3 (Summer 2013), pp. 341-342&lt;/ref&gt;
Explained [[William G. Hundley]], a former organized crime investigator for the U.S. Senate who attended the Passman trial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I went there for the trial, and I'd go into restaurants with Park, and people would get up and leave. ... I thought the prosecution presented a pretty good case. But when the defense attorney, [[Camille Gravel]], got up to cross-examine Tongsun Park, he carried a big map of Korea. He didn't even tough the merits of the case. He identified South Korea and noted that it's right under North Korea and next to China. Then he pointed out that North Korea and China are [[totalitarian]] communist states. The jury was out less than ninety minutes, and they acquitted Passman on every charge.&lt;ref name=oepassman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Oil-for-food scandal==
In 1992, Park was approached by [[Samir Vincent]], an [[Iraqi American|Iraqi-born American]] who was lobbying unofficially on behalf of the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime, to try to create a program that would bypass the [[United Nations]]-approved [[Iraq sanctions|economic sanctions of Iraq]] that had started in 1991. Park agreed, requesting a payment of US$10 million for his effort, to which Vincent agreed. Park served as a liaison between Vincent and then-[[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], with whom Park was friendly. In late 1996, partly as a result of Park's lobbying efforts, the U.N. [[Oil-for-Food Program]] began. After 1997, when [[Kofi Annan]] became the new secretary-general, the government of Iraq dropped its ties with Park; by then Park had received about US$2 million in payments.

In 2005 Park was accused of acting as an intermediary with corrupt [[United Nations]] officials in the [[oil-for-food]] conspiracy orchestrated by [[Saddam Hussein]]. His name surfaced as part of investigations into the oil-for-food scandal. In July 2006 he was convicted in a U.S. federal court on [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date= July 13, 2006| last=Associated Press|title= Korean businessman guilty in oil-for-food case | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13849968/|publisher= MSNBC |accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first person convicted through the oil-for-food investigation.  On February 22, 2007, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also was fined $15,000 and required to forfeit $1,200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Lynch| first= Colum| author-link= | date= February 23, 2007| title= Park Sentenced to 5 Years in U.N.
